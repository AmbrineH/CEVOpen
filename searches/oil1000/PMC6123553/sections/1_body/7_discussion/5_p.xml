<p class="p">It can also be concluded from the results of the present study that the MMEO (100 mg/kg) in repeated doses could be toxic, especially in some organs of female rats. In the female rats, an increase in the serum ALT activity level was associated with histological changes in the liver, revealing the mild hepatotoxicity potential of the MMEO. Our subchronic oral dosage regimen of the essential oil in the rats appeared to adversely affect the kidney and led to an increase in the level of BUN (in the males) and mild histological changes. The difference in the biochemistry profile observed between the males and females may have been due to hormonal variations. These results suggest that females are more susceptible than males. The histological analysis of the different organs showed slight microscopic tissue damage to the liver, kidney, stomach, and small intestine tissues of the MMEO group at the repeated dose of 100 mg/kg. Part of the observed organ toxicity effects could have been related to the presence of pulegone in the MMEO, which accounted for 0.3% of the total chromatographic materials. </p>
