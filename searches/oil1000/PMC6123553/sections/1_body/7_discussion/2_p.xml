 <italic class="italic">M. mozaffarianii</italic> Jamzad, an Iranian endemic plant, is commonly used in Iranian traditional medicine for its potent therapeutic effects. As the safety profile of this plant in acute and repeated tests had yet to be determined, we undertook the present study and succeeded in demonstrating the safety profile of this plant in both models of toxicity assessment. Given that we observed no deaths and no serious signs of toxicity in the first 24 hours following the MMEO administration at the dose of 2000 mg/kg, we can classify this essential oil as Category 5 material according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals criteria.

 </sup> The criteria for Category 5 are intended to enable the identification of substances that are of relatively low acute toxicity hazard, and the MMEO was anticipated to have an LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> higher than 2000 mg/kg, which is not hazardous in acute doses in mice and rats. Nevertheless, taking a single dose of the MMEO (2000 mg/kg) induced hypoactivity and drowsiness 4 hours after its administration in the rats. These consequences suggest that rats are more sensitive than mice to the central effects of the essential oil. These results could be explained by the presence in the essential oil of sedative compounds, which could act on the central nervous system. Indeed, preliminary qualitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 22 components, accounting for about 99.4% of the total chromatographically materials. The 3 major identified compounds were piperitone (51%), 1,8-cineol (11.7%), and linalool (11.1%); some of these compounds are known to have depressive activity on the central nervous system.
