 <italic class="italic">Mentha mozaffarianii </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">M. mozaffarianii</italic>) is an Iranian endemic plant known locally as “Pooneh-Koohi” (Mozaffarian, 2006). This plant is among the medicinal plants that serve as antiseptics and analgesics to treat painful menstruation, dyspepsia, arthralgia, fever, headache, common cold, and wounds in Iranian traditional medicine.
