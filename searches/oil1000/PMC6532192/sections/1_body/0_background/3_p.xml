<p id="Par4" class="p">Most of the positive health effects of herbs and spices towards preventing or ameliorating chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and neurodegeneration appear to be mediated through the direct action of their constituent phytochemicals (particularly polyphenols or polyphenol breakdown products) targeting specific receptors or enzymes involved in various anti-inflammatory pathways or immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Herbs and spices (especially in their dried form) contain high levels of polyphenols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] and other physiologically active phytochemicals. The predominant class of polyphenols found in herbs and spices are the phenolic acids and flavonoids (mainly flavones and flavonols) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Relative to other polyphenol-rich foods such as broccoli, dark chocolate, red, blue and purple berries, grapes or onions—herbs and spices generally contain somewhat higher levels of these compounds. For instance, oregano has 935.3 mg of total phenolic content per 100 g of fresh weight (FW) in the fresh form (F) while in the dried form (D) has 6367 mg/100 g. Similarly, high polyphenolic levels are seen in rosemary [1082.4 mg/100 g (F) vs. 2518 mg/100 g (D)], thyme [1173.28 mg/100 g (F) vs. 1815 mg/100 g (D)], and parsley [89.27 mg/100 g (F) vs. 1584 mg/100 g (D)]. Likewise, cloves have 16,047.25 mg/100 g, cinnamon 9700 mg/100 g, and turmeric 2117 mg/100 g (all FW). In contrast, other non-herbs and foods such as dark chocolate contain 1859.8 mg/100 g FW, while raw blackcurrants contain 820.6 mg/100 g FW and broccoli just 198.6 mg/100 g FW.
