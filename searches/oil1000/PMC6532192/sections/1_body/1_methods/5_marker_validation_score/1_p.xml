<p id="Par13" class="p">In order to further assess the validity of the biomarker candidates, a set of consensus evaluation criteria, from the FoodBAll consortium was employed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Specifically, the suitability of each biomarker was assessed by answering a set of questions reported elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>], which reflect the analytical and biological criteria that the proposed biomarkers should fulfill in order to be considered valid. Such questions have been answered for the most promising biomarkers and the results are reported in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Possible answers were Y (yes), N (no), or U (unknown or uncertain). The potential markers were scored for plausibility and uniqueness (question 1); kinetics and dose-response relationship (question 2), kinetics of postprandial response (question 3a) and longer-term kinetics (question 3b). All markers were further evaluated for their robustness in complex diets or a real exposure situation (question 4) and reliability (question 5), which refers to the concordance with other measures of intake for the food or food group in question (such as other existing validated biomarkers or dietary instruments). The analytical aspects of each BFI were investigated through an evaluation of their chemical stability (question 6), their analytical performance (question 7), and reproducibility in different labs (question 8).
