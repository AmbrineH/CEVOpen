<p id="Par41" class="p">Only one study was found for the evaluation of nutmeg ingestion. Beyer and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>] evaluated nutmeg administration in animals and then performed an observational toxicological study to identify the metabolites in the urine of a human subject after the individual ingested the powder derived from 5 nutmeg seeds. In the human urine sample, the following metabolites were identified by GC-MS: O-demethyl elemicin, O-demethyl dihydroxy elemicin, demethylenyl myristicin, dihydroxy myristicin, and demethylenyl safrole. Neither amphetamine derivatives nor the main nutmeg ingredients could be detected in the rat urine nor in human urine samples [
