<p id="Par43" class="p">Because nutmeg is the primary known dietary source of these compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>], many of the metabolites of myristicin, elemicin, and safrole either alone or in combination (as a multi-marker panel) could be considered as good candidate BFIs of nutmeg intake. However, since the only study that exists on nutmeg intake is an observational study, additional controlled kinetic studies should be conducted, and further analytical performance validation should be done before these BFIs can be fully validated.
