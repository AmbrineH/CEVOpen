<p id="Par40" class="p">Nutmeg is a fragrant flavoring spice coming from the seed of 
 <italic class="italic">Myristica fragrans (</italic>belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Myristicaceae</italic> family
 <italic class="italic">),</italic> an evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (or Spice Islands) of Indonesia. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the small island group of the Banda Islands, was the only location of the production of nutmeg and mace in the world. This made nutmeg a particularly prized and costly spice in European medieval cuisine. The nutmeg essential oil is obtained by steam distillation of ground nutmeg, and it is used widely in the perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. This volatile fraction typically contains sabinene (21.38%), 4-terpineol (13.92%), and myristicin (13.57%), as well as portions of safrole, elimicin, terpineol, Î±-pinene d-camphene, limonene, linalool, and isoeugeunol [
