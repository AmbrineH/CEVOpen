<p id="Par42" class="p">Myristicin is a natural organic compound not only present in nutmeg oil, but also, to a lesser extent, in members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> family such as carrots, parsley, celery, dill, parsnip, and black pepper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. The measured amount of myristicin in nutmeg and mace is very high—13,000 mg/kg (nutmeg) and 27,000 mg/kg (mace). On the other hand, it is much less in dill and parsley (1200 mg/kg and 727 mg/kg, respectively), and very low in celery (0.33 mg/kg), carrots (0.16 mg/kg), and parsnip (0.002 mg/kg) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. Zheng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>] found that in an in vivo animal study conducted on mice, myristicin had the ability to increase the activity of the detoxifying system (potential cancer chemoprevention). This finding was replicated in another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. Elemicin has been identified as an essential oil composition of carrots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>], parsley, elemi oil, banana, anise, and oregano [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]; however, the major route of elemicin intake appears to be nutmeg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>]. Lastly, safrole is a major chemical constituent (85%) of the aromatic oil of sassafras root bark (
 <italic class="italic">Sassaras albidum</italic>). It is also a minor component or trace constituent in mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper, cocoa, anise, and a number of other spices [
