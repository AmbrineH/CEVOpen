 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>], the authors used 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C glucose administered with peppermint oil to detect 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-menthol glucuronide. In a later study, the same authors used deuterated water administered with peppermint to detect menthol glucuronide by 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>]. Finally, the most recent study analyzed urine and plasma by GC-MS after intragastric administration of peppermint oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">121</xref>]. Approximately, 70% of the administered menthol and its metabolites were excreted in the urine, and this amount fluctuated independent of the dose. The main metabolite identified in plasma and urine was menthol glucuronide along with lesser amounts of mono-hydroxylated menthol glucuronic acid and di-hydroxylated menthol glucuronic acid.
