<p id="Par57" class="p">Peppermint and spearmint are herbs that belong to the 
 <italic class="italic">Laminacea</italic> family. Spearmint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic>) is believed to be the oldest of the mints. It is a species of mint native to much of Europe and Asia (the Middle East, the Himalayas, China) that is now found in many parts of Northern and Western Africa, North America, and South America. On the other hand, peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha × piperita</italic>) is a hybrid mint herb. In particular, it is a cross between watermint and spearmint, and is indigenous to Europe and the Middle East. Both spearmint and peppermint have a fresh, minty, weedy, aroma. The taste is spicy, minty cool, sweet, and slightly pungent [

The most abundant compound in spearmint oil is carvone, which gives spearmint its distinctive smell. Spearmint oil also contains significant amounts of limonene, dihydrocarvone, and 1,8-cineol [

Conversely, peppermint has a high menthol content (40.7%), along with menthone (23.4%), and other essential oils such as menthyl acetate (4.2%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), limonene (2.6%), menthofuran (3.7%), and β-caryophyllene (1.7%) [

Peppermint leaves are often used alone or with other herbs in herbal teas (tisanes, infusions), ice cream, confectionery, chewing gum, toothpastes, and shampoos. Menthol activates cold-sensitive receptors in the skin and mucosal tissues, and is the primary source of the cooling sensation that follows the topical application of peppermint oil [
