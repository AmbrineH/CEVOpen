<p id="Par58" class="p">Interestingly, six research papers were found that studied the administration of peppermint (oil), but no studies were found that assessed spearmint administration. All six peppermint studies evaluated menthol and its glucuronide conjugate after administration of peppermint oil using a targeted approach. The main goal of these studies was to find a way to delay the absorption and increase the efficacy in treating spastic colon and irritable bowel syndrome. Menthol is fat-soluble and therefore is rapidly absorbed from the proximal small intestine when taken orally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">116</xref>]. This makes it particularly useful for targeting disorders of the intestine. One of the first studies to look at peppermint oil ingestion was performed in 1984 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>] in which a comparison was done between the oral administration of gelatine capsules containing peppermint oil versus a 
 <italic class="italic">Colpermin</italic> preparation (Tillotts Laboratories), a commercial peppermint preparation. The comparison was done in six healthy volunteers and repeated in six ileostomy subjects. The authors measured the levels of menthol in urine and found that 
 <italic class="italic">Colpermin</italic> led to a more delayed-release of menthol compared to a gelatine capsule [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. A second study conducted 3 years later, compared the 
 <italic class="italic">Colpermin</italic> preparation with another new capsule administration (
 <italic class="italic">Mintec</italic> SK&amp;F Ltd.). The authors affirmed that the 
 <italic class="italic">Colpermin</italic> preparation delivered menthol more effectively to the distal small intestine and ascending colon than the 
 <italic class="italic">Mintec</italic> formulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">116</xref>]. In 1990, Kaffenberger [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">118</xref>] studied the administration of 180 mg of peppermint oil in an enteric-coated capsule, identifying menthol glucuronide in urine by GC-FID [
