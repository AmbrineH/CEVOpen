<p id="Par60" class="p">While menthol is highly abundant in peppermint (40%), it can also be found in sunflower petals (essential oils), tarragon (0.1%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>], basil, and thyme (traces). However, due to the high menthol content in peppermint compared to the other two herbs and given that sunflower petals are not an edible food, menthol can be considered a specific marker of peppermint. Given that menthol glucuronide is also detectable in urine, this compound could also be a suitable biomarker of peppermint intake, particularly after capsular oral administration. However, further analysis in peppermint administration is needed for a suitable evaluation of menthol as potential food intake biomarker. In the case of spearmint, because no studies have yet been performed for spearmint BFIs, it is clear that spearmint interventions studies need to be undertaken.
