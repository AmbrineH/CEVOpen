<p id="Par66" class="p">As mentioned earlier, other compounds present in rosemary and thyme are also present in sage. Interestingly, there are no intervention studies reporting any of these compounds after sage intake. While 1,8-cineole is detectable in urine after sage intake, it is important to note that 1,8-cineole is found in several other herbs belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Laminacea</italic> family. Therefore, 1,8-cineole and its derivates cannot be considered to be specific for sage intake. Furthermore, its rapid metabolism makes it a poor BFI for most members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Laminacea</italic> family. We conclude that there are no useful BFIs for sage intake that have yet been discovered or reported in the literature.
