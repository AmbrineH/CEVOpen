<p id="Par35" class="p">In the second study by Barfi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>], the authors developed and validated a multi-step method to extract 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole, estragole, and 
 <italic class="italic">para</italic>-anisaldehyde (three major components of fennel, basil and tarragon) from biofluids and then applied this extraction technique to real human plasma and urine samples. All three compounds were found in plasma and urine after the consumption of either 15 ml of fennel extract, 15 ml of tarragon extract or 15 ml of brewed basil.
