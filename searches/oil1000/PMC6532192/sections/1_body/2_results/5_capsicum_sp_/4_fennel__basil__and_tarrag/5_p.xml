<p id="Par34" class="p">Two studies have explored or assessed potential biomarkers of fennel (alone) or fennel, tarragon, and basil intake in humans. The first one, by Zeller et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>], studied the metabolism of estragole in humans consuming fennel tea. The metabolites identified in the urine of subjects were estragole, 1′-hydroxyestrogle, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole (also reported in anise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]), and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-allylphenol (also found in betel leaf oils and in oil of bay). However, the authors were unable to report concentrations for these compounds or to correlate them with fennel dosage. In terms of the specificity of these compounds, estragole, in addition to being found in fennel, is a known component of several herbs such as tarragon, basil, and anise. Estragole, which is structurally similar to safrole, is rapidly metabolized to 1′-hydroxyestragole and is quickly excreted as its glucuronic acid conjugate.
