<p id="Par36" class="p">While studies of fennel, basil, and tarragon phytochemicals and essential oils have identified several potentially unique compounds for each of these herbs, the same cannot be said of the BIFs that have been, so far, identified. To date, all of the food intake compounds identified for fennel, basil, and tarragon consumption [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>] are not sufficiently specific to identify one from the other or any of them from other widely consumed herbs. This is because all of the reported compounds found in human biofluids, so far, are also found in other herbs and spices (such as anise). Therefore, we conclude that no specific BFI for fennel, basil, or tarragon intake has, to date, been discovered or described in the literature.
