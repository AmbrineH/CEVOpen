<p id="Par31" class="p">Fennel is a seed (and bulb) spice, as well as a leaf herb, that is derived from 
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic>. This is a small flowering plant that was originally indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean, but which has since become widely naturalized in many parts of the world. Fennel is a highly aromatic and flavorful herb/spice and is one of the primary ingredients of absinthe. The distinctive licorice flavor and aroma from fennel comes from anethole. Other compounds known to be in fennel include estragole, fenchone, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), and

In addition to its use in culinary applications, fennel has long been used as a medicinal herb to treat gastrointestinal illnesses and upper respiratory tract infections as well as to increase milk production in breastfeeding mothers through the consumption of fennel tea.
