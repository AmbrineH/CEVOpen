<p id="Par55" class="p">Two research articles were found that focused specifically on measuring BFIs of parsley [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>]. The first article focused on the development of a method to analyze apigenin and the apigenin metabolite acacetin (4′-methoxyapigenin) in human samples using an HPLC–UV method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>] while the second article focused on an intervention study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>] that measured these two compounds after the consumption of parsley. In this randomized crossover trial, parsley consumption together with a low flavone diet revealed a strong correlation with urinary apigenin excretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>]. In addition to these two BFI parsley studies, several other studies have also assessed apigenin intake. One study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>], which looked at the ingestion of apigenin-rich foods like parsley, found that apigenin was elevated in urine, plasma, and red blood cells (RBCs). Although apigenin could be identified in plasma and RBCs, it was barely detectable (i.e., close to the limit of detection). On the other hand, apigenin in urine was easily identified in all individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]. In another study that used a randomized crossover design for the administration of parsley, apigenin could not be detected in plasma because it was below the lower the limit of detection for the type of assay and instrument used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">110</xref>].
