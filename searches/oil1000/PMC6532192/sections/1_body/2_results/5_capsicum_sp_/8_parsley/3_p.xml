<p id="Par56" class="p">Apigenin is a flavone not only found in parsley, but also in other vegetables from the same family (
 <italic class="italic">Apiacea</italic>), such as celery, and in lesser amounts in parsnip, carrots, and fennel. So while parsley certainly has a high content of apigenin, due to the poor specificity of this polyphenolic compound, we conclude that apigenin would not be a suitable BFI of parsley intake. Therefore, we conclude that there are no useful BFIs of parsley intake that have yet been discovered or reported in the literature.
