<p id="Par70" class="p">Due to curcumin’s poor absorption, poor bioavailability, and fast excretion, several studies have explored different vehicles for curcumin administration to increase its bioavailability. Oral administration of curcumin in “C3 complex,” which consists of 450 mg of curcumin, 30 mg of demethoxycurcumin (DMC), and 20 mg of bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) [
