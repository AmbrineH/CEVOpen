<p id="Par72" class="p">Almost all of turmeric/curcumin intake studies that we found were performed in blood (plasma or serum). A smaller number of studies looked at other biofluids or excreta such as urine and feces. In almost all cases, curcumin was barely detected. Moderately suitable biomarkers of curcumin consumption were reported in plasma after the intake of formulated curcumin, such as BDMC, DMC, THC, COG, and COS, as opposed to unformulated administration. However, in feces and colon tissue, only curcumin itself could be detected. In conclusion, formulated curcumin, curcumin biotransformation products, and curcuminoids can be detected in plasma and in feces, but due to the fact that curcumin was administered in a formulated preparation, these biomarkers cannot be considered robust BFIs of turmeric/curcumin consumption.</p>
