<p id="Par68" class="p">Curcumin is a particularly well-studied spice. A total of 18 research papers were found for this review just for curcumin. This interest is likely due to the multiple biological or health activities attributed to it, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">134</xref>]. Recent clinical studies with curcumin have demonstrated additional health benefits relating to treating immune deficiencies, improving cardiovascular health, treating depression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" class="xref">135</xref>], combating Alzheimerâ€™s disease, treating diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" class="xref">136</xref>], arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" class="xref">137</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>]. Curcumin has very low oral bioavailability, which is primarily due to its poor solubility, low absorption, rapid metabolism, and systemic elimination. As a result, most ingested curcumin is excreted through the feces unmetabolized. The small portion that is absorbed is extensively converted to its water-soluble metabolites, glucuronides, and sulfates. These metabolites include curcumin-O-glucuronide (COG), curcumin-O-sulfate (COS) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140" class="xref">140</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141" class="xref">141</xref>], and tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" class="xref">142</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143" class="xref">143</xref>]. Apart from glucuronidation and sulfation, other biotransformations could occur, which yield other unspecific metabolites such as ferulic acid and vanillic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" class="xref">132</xref>]. COG, the major curcumin metabolite, is relatively hydrophilic compared to curcumin due to its conjugation to glucuronic acid [
