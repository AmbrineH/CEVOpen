 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" class="xref">139</xref>]. Sharma et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145" class="xref">145</xref>] determined that there was no detectable curcumin or any of its metabolites in the blood or urine of patients after the administration of 440—2200 mg of “curcuma” extract per day (containing 36–180 mg of curcumin) in advanced colorectal cancer patients. Another study performed by Cheng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144" class="xref">144</xref>] demonstrated that the peak concentrations of curcumin in serum after administration of 4, 6, and 8 g of curcumin (given in the form of tablets) were 0.51, 0.64, and 1.77 μM, respectively. However, doses below 4 g were barely detectable. Lao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146" class="xref">146</xref>] could not detect curcumin in the serum of volunteers with doses ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 g of curcumin.
