<p id="Par71" class="p">Another interesting study of curcumin bioavailability has been conducted by Jager et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>]. These researchers studied the absorption of formulated curcumin versus unformulated curcumin. Their formulated curcumin used a combination of a hydrophilic carrier, cellulosic derivatives, and natural antioxidants. This formulation was found to significantly increase curcuminoid levels in the blood in comparison to the unformulated product [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>]. Theracurmin, a colloidal nanoparticle dispersion of curcumin, is reported to have a much higher bioavailability (27-fold higher) than any other available preparations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149" class="xref">149</xref>], looked at fresh turmeric-derived curcuminoids versus dry turmeric-derived curcuminoids. These researchers showed that fresh curcuminoids permitted better plasma delivery and better absorption. Baum and co-workers suggested that curcumin consumed with food appears to accelerate its absorption [
