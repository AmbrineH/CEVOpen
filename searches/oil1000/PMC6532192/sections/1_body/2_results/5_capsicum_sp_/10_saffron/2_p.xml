 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>]. This was a single dose study that looked at saffron products in the plasma of four healthy volunteers using solid phase extraction—high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC). Saffron was administered in the form of saffron tea [

Crocetin was tracked from the plasma of subjects and was found to be rapidly absorbed, being detected in systemic circulation after 2 h of administration, with the compound still being present for up to 24 h. A separate pharmacokinetic study that used purified crocetin extracted from
