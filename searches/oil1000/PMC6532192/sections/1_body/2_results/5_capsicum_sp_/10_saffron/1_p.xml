<p id="Par61" class="p">Saffron is among the world’s most costly spices. It comes from the dried flower stigma of 
 <italic class="italic">Crocus sativus</italic>. This is a flower that is native to Southwest Asia but which is now cultivated in Greece, India, Iran, Morocco, and Spain. Saffron is mainly used as a seasoning and coloring agent in food, particularly in Persian, Indian, European, and Arab cuisines. Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. Safranal (2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxaldehyde) is the major compound (70%) in the volatile fraction of saffron [

Saffron also has a number of non-volatile active components many of which are carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, the golden yellow-orange color of saffron is primarily the result of the carotenoid α-crocin, a glycosyl ester of crocetin. Picrocrocin (4-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde) has also been found in saffron spice from 0.8 to 26.6% on a dry basis. This compound is responsible for saffron’s bitter taste [

Riboflavin values range from 56 to 138 μg/g, and are the highest reported for any food. Thiamine values range from 0.7 to 4 μ g/g, which are well within the range of values reported in many vegetables [
