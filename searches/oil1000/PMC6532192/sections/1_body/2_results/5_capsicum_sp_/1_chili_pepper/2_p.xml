<p id="Par22" class="p">We found two published studies that explored possible BFIs associated with chili pepper consumption. In a cross-over study with 12 volunteers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>], capsaicin was detected in plasma by HPLC analysis after the administration of 5 g of capsaicin derived from chili pepper. This pharmacokinetic study showed that capsaicin was rapidly absorbed (being detected at 10 min) after ingestion and also rapidly metabolized (not detected in blood after 90 min). Another study, conducted by Bernard et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], analyzed the metabolites present in plasma by LC-MS/MS after the administration of a capsule of a variety of non-pungent (sweet) pepper (CH-19) extract. The compounds identified were the capsinoids capsiate, dihydrocapsiate and nordihydrocapsiate, and a capsinoid metabolite, vanillyl alcohol. However, these compounds were below the limit of quantification, so the authors could not perform proper kinetic studies.
