<p id="Par21" class="p">The chili pepper is a fruit spice derived from plants from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic>, originated in Mexico and brought to Asia by Portuguese navigators during the sixteenth century. The five domesticated species of pepper are 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum annuum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. frutescens, C. chinense</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. pubescens</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. baccatum.</italic> Chili peppers have a taste that is pungent, hot, and somewhat sweet (depending on the variety and type). Mild or sweet peppers contain similar constituents as 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic> but with little or no pungent components. Chili peppers are used as food colorants, flavoring agents, as predator repellants, and a source of pain relief. The compounds responsible for the “hot” flavor of chili peppers are called capsaicinoids, with capsaicin being the best known. Capsaicin occurs naturally in plants of the 
 <italic class="italic">Solanaceae</italic> family. It is commonly used in both food and medicine, but its strong pungency limits the quantity that can be employed. 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic> contains up to 1.5% (by weight) of pungent compounds, commonly composed of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and others. Other constituents present in chili peppers are carotenoids, vitamins A, C, and small amounts of volatile oils with more than 125 known components. Another class of capsaicin-like compounds found in chili peppers and non-pungent chili peppers are the capsinoids. Capsinoids have an estimated “hot taste threshold” that is about 1/1000 that of capsaicin making it possible to use capsinoids in food applications without the intense heat effect found in capsaicins [
