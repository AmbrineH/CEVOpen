<p id="Par52" class="p">In the BFI evaluation studies of thyme, thymol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>], and its derived metabolites (thymol sulfate, thymol glucuronide) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>], along with a number of polyphenols and polyphenolic metabolites including hydroxyphenyl propionic acid sulfate, coumaric acid sulfate, caffeic acid sulfate, ferulic acid sulfate, hydroxybenzoic acid dihydrophenylpropionic acid sulfate were identified in both rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>] and humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid was also detected in plasma after thyme administration in a controlled randomized trial performed on Wistar rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid is found in both thyme and rosemary and can be considered as a biomarker of intake for both spices. Romo-Vaquero and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>] evaluated the gut, liver, plasma, and small intestine of 24 Zucker rats after both acute and subchronic administration of rosemary extract. Although the main bioactive compound of rosemary is carnosic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">101</xref>], other derived metabolites (shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) were also detected in this Zucker rat study. Because the two studies we found for rosemary and oregano administration were performed on animals, the compounds identified are simply being reported here for completeness. The data cannot be used to infer human BFIs for these two herbs. More studies in humans for rosemary and oregano are needed to better understand the metabolites and establish a set of specific BFI for humans.
