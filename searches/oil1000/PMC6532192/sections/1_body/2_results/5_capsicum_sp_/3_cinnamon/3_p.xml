<p id="Par28" class="p">Coumarin possesses a pleasant spicy odor of fresh hay or vanilla [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. The occurrence of coumarin has been reported in a number of bedding plants such as 
 <italic class="italic">Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic> (sweet vernal grass), 
 <italic class="italic">Asperula odorata</italic> (sweet woodruff), 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterix odorata</italic> (tonka bean), 
 <italic class="italic">Eupatorium triplinerve</italic> (white snakeroot), 
 <italic class="italic">Hierochloe odorata</italic> (holy grass), 
 <italic class="italic">Melilotus coerulea</italic> (sweet trefoil), 
 <italic class="italic">M. officinalis</italic> (common melilot), 
 <italic class="italic">Melittis melissophyllum</italic> (bastard balm), 
 <italic class="italic">Primula elatior</italic> (oxlip), and 
 <italic class="italic">Trilisa odoratissima</italic> (deer tongue). However, none of these plants are usually used as edible foods; thus, the main source of coumarin in the diet is cinnamon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Coumarin, which is frequently used in perfumes, is also a well-known hepatotoxin (based on animal studies). Interestingly, different species of cinnamon have different levels of coumarin. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> cinnamon contains up to 1% coumarin, whereas the more expensive and less frequently used true cinnamon (
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</italic>) contains only trace levels (0.004%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Today, many commercially available food products are spiced with the cheaper 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> cinnamon and consequently contain high levels of coumarin. It is notable that German Christmas cookies (which contain considerable amounts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> cinnamon) have a coumarin content that often exceeds the maximum tolerable dose intake (TDI 0.1â€‰mg/kg body weight).
