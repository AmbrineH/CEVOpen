<p id="Par29" class="p">Based on the available data and based on the fact that the food matrix effect has been well tested, 7-hydroxycoumarin appears to be a plausible specific and robust biomarker of cinnamon intake. Additional cumulative/kinetic aspects of this biomarker need to be performed and most likely an inter-laboratory validation needs to be completed to fully validate this compound as a cinnamon BFI. However, the use of this metabolite as a BFI for cinnamon is confounded by the fact that it depends on the species of cinnamon being used. We believe that other cinnamon compounds (such as cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid or the essential oils as cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamyl acetate and eugenol)) should also be explored as potential biomarkers as, so far, the only reported cinnamon BFI study was limited to measuring coumarin and its derivatives.</p>
