<p id="Par27" class="p">Only one study has been performed in humans to identify BFIs of cinnamon intake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. While cinnamaldehyde might have been expected to be a useful BFI, it is quickly metabolized to cinnamic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>], making it unusable as a cinnamon biomarker. On the other hand, coumarin was deemed to be a potentially useful BFI for cinnamon. Because coumarin has a very strong first-pass effect in the liver, with only a small percentage reaching systemic circulation, the authors chose its main metabolite, 7- hydroxycoumarin as a measure of relative bioavailability. In the study by Abraham et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], 7-hydroxycoumarin was assessed as a biomarker of cinnamon consumption in both urine and plasma via HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The conversion of coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. 7-hydroxycoumarin and its phase II metabolite, 7-hydroxycoumarin glucuronide, are rapidly excreted via the kidneys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. Therefore, the total amount of 7-hydroxycoumarin (free and bound as a glucuronide) in urine could serve as an indirect measure of the extent of cinnamon consumption.
