<p id="Par25" class="p">Only one study was found that looked into the identification of biomarkers of food intake for paprika. Nishino and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] measured paprika carotenoids in the plasma and erythrocytes of five volunteers who were supplemented with paprika for 4 weeks. The results showed that several, non-unique carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-cryptoxanthin (also found in vegetables such as carrots and tomatoes) could be detected in the paprika-supplemented volunteers. However, the authors also detected other carotenoids specific for paprika, such as cryptocapsin, capsanthin, capsorubin (just found in paprika and lily pollen), cucurbitaxanthin A (found just in paprika and pumpkins), and finally capsanthone (a possible oxidative product of capsanthin). Paprika carotenoids, particularly capsanthin and capsorubin, have been reported to have a strong antioxidant activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Based on these results, cucurbitaxanthin A, capsanthin, capsanthone, and cryptocapsin could be potential paprika-specific carotenoid biomarkers. However, further analyses using untargeted MS-based approaches should be conducted to evaluate other possible biomarkers of paprika intake.
