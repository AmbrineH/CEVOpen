<p id="Par24" class="p">Paprika is a ground spice made from the red, air-dried fruits of the larger and sweeter varieties of the plant 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum annuum</italic>, which is also called bell pepper or sweet pepper. Paprika can also be modified with the addition of more pungent chili peppers and cayenne pepper. Originating in central Mexico, paprika was brought to Spain in the sixteenth century. Paprika spices can range from mild to hot, depending on the variety of the source plant. The flavor also varies from country to countryâ€”but almost all plants grown produce the sweet variety. The red, orange, or yellow color of paprika is due to its content of carotenoids. The intense color of paprika makes it an ideal and natural food colorant for many dishes.
