<p id="Par39" class="p">Based on the available data, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol glucuronides and sulfates along with 6-shogaols appear to be plausible, specific, and robust biomarkers of ginger intake. More studies are needed to confirm that they are also seen with actual ginger-based food intake. Additional cumulative/kinetic aspects of these biomarkers need further evaluation and most likely an inter-laboratory validation is required to make these compounds fully validated BFIs for ginger consumption.</p>
