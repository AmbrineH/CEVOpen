 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>) is a root or rhizome-based spice derived from the ginger plant, a member of the turmeric family (both are from 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiberaceae</italic>). Ginger is believed to have originated in India and is widely used as a culinary additive as a hot, fragrant spice as well as a popular medicine. In addition to ginger’s well-known use as a treatment for nausea, many components in ginger have been found to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antipyretic, antilipidemic, antitumorigenic, and antiangiogenic effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. Ginger’s flavor and aroma come from its volatile oils (∼1 to 3% of the weight of fresh ginger) and non-volatile pungent oleoresins. A variety of active components have been identified in the oleoresins of ginger including zingerone, gingerols (6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols), and shogaols (6-, 8-, and 10-shogaols) [

In dried ginger, the quantity of shogaols are significantly increased as evidenced by the reduction of the ratio of 6-gingerol to 6-shogaol from 10:1 in fresh ginger to 1:1 in dried ginger [
