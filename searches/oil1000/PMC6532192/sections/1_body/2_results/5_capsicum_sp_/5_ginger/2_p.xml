<p id="Par38" class="p">A total of three studies have been reported on potential BFIs for ginger or ginger extracts. The earliest study by Zick et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>] found that 6, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-shogaol are absorbed after oral ginger extract dosing and can be detected as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. Yu and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>] detected free 10-gingerol and 6-shogaol in the human plasma, whereas the majority of the 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-shogaol existed as glucuronide and sulfate metabolites after oral dosing of 2 g ginger extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. No free 6-gingerol was detected in plasma despite it being the most abundant component of ginger extracts (2.64%). In comparison, although 6-shogaol makes up 2.25% and 10-gingerol only accounts for 1.22% of most ginger extracts, 6-shogaol and 10-gingerol were readily detected in human plasma. Pharmacokinetic studies showed very short half-lives for these four analytes and their metabolites (1–3 h in human plasma). Due to their short half-lives, no accumulation was observed for 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-shogaol (and their metabolites) in either plasma or colon tissues even after multiple daily dosing. A third biomarker intake study was focused on the metabolism of shogaol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. The results of this study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) show that it was possible to detect all the major thiol-conjugated metabolites of shogaol in human urine using LC-MS/MS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. The authors suggested the mercapturic acid pathway as a major metabolic route for shogaols in humans.
