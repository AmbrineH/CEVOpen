<p id="Par20" class="p">Based on these two studies, we can conclude that anethole seems to be a robust and reliable blood BFI for anise consumption as assessed by observational studies involving the consumption of anise-based drinks. While a single, high-quality marker for specific food intake is ideal, the addition of other (unrelated) biomarkers to create a multi-component biomarker panel can substantially improve a biomarker’s sensitivity and specificity [

In this regard, two compounds, 4-methoxyhippuric acid and 4-methoxybenzoic acid have been specifically detected in urine after direct anethole intake. However, these two compounds are actually metabolites of anethole and so are unlikely to add to anethole’s sensitivity/specificity. We also believe that further studies are needed to confirm that these two compounds are seen with actual anise-based food intake. It is also worth noting that anethole is found in fennel, basil, and tarragon [
