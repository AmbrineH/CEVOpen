<p id="Par18" class="p">Just two papers have reported potential anise intake biomarkers. The most complete study was conducted in 1988 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], where Caldwell and co-workers performed an acute human study administrating 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole (using a synthesized radio-labeled 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C compound). The major routes of elimination of 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C were in the urine (54–69% of the administered dose) and as exhaled 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (13–17%). The principal metabolite (&gt; 90% of urinary 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C) was 4-methoxyhippuric acid (also known as anisic acid), accompanied by much smaller amounts of 4-methoxybenzoic acid (or also known as 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-anisic acid, an oxidation product of anethole) and up to three other unknown compounds. As the authors stated, metabolism of anethole in man was unaffected by changes in dose size, and is dominated by the ɷ-oxidation pathway ultimately leading to 4-methoxyhippuric acid, and by oxidative O-demethylation, leading to the exhalation of 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [
