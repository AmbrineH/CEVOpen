<p id="Par17" class="p">Anise is a seed spice derived from a flowering plant belonging to the family 
 <italic class="italic">Apiaceae</italic>, which is native to the Eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. The distinctive licorice flavor and aroma from anise comes from anethole. Anethole is a phenylpropene derivative found in anise (
 <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic>) and fennel (
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic>). Anethole occurs naturally in high concentrations in volatile oils such as anise oil (80–90%), star anise oil (over 90%), and fennel oil (80%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Anethole exists in both a 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and a 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> isomer with the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> isomer being more abundant. It is the main component of the anise essential oil (80–90%), with minor components including para-anisaldehyde, estragole, and pseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrates, among others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. In Mediterranean countries, the popularity of alcoholic and non-alcoholic anise-flavored beverages has led to a much greater consumption of 
 <italic class="italic">trans-</italic>anethole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Anethole is also used in medicines as an expectorant, an antitussive and an antispasmodic for treating gastrointestinal tract illnesses. As a result, anise is found in a number of pharmaceutical products.
