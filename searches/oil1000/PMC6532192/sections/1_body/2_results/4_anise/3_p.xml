<p id="Par19" class="p">The only other research article to look into anise BFIs was an observational study that measured the content of anethole in the blood after the intake of alcoholic anise-based beverages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. This study rigorously monitored a single individual, wherein the subject consumed the alcoholic drink ouzo over three different days under controlled conditions. In addition to this controlled single-participant study, the authors also looked at the blood collected from 50 motor vehicle drivers who claimed to have consumed drinks containing anethole (ouzo, raki and the German aniseed liqueur “Küstennebel”). The anethole concentrations detected for the tested volunteer showed rapid resorption of anethole as well as rapid elimination. Anethole concentrations above the detection level of 3.6 ng/ml serum were detected in the selected volunteer for 3 h after ceasing consumption of 120 ml of Helenas ouzo and for 3 h after ceasing consumption of 200 ml of regular ouzo, and for 7 h after ceasing consumption of 360 ml of regular ouzo. For the 50 motor vehicle drivers, 10 out of 50 serum samples had anethole concentrations of between 5.4 and 17.6 ng/ml. Of these, eight corresponded to confirmed cases of ouzo consumption, one of raki consumption and one of German aniseed liqueur “Kustennebel” consumption. The authors concluded that anethole can be reliably detected in blood/serum samples after consumption of spirits containing anethole. In no case was a positive result for anethole found where 40 ml or less of spirits containing anethole had been consumed or where the time difference between the cessation of drinking and the taking of the blood sample was greater than 4 h.
