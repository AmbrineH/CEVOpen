<p id="Par16" class="p">A systematic validation of the candidate intake biomarkers is assessed and presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. It should be noted that the search criteria were primarily targeted for BFIs in humans, but, in some cases, a small number of papers in which the BFI study was performed in animals were also investigated. These papers were used to provide supportive information to the studies performed in humans; however, the biomarkers observed only in animal studies were not considered eligible for further BFI validation. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> summarizes many of the findings of this review. It includes the most representative or strongly validated metabolites identified for each herb and spice, the molecule formula, the HMDB ID, and/or Phytohub code (if exists) and the biofluid or tissue in which each BFI has been found.
