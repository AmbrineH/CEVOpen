<p id="Par14" class="p">The research papers that identified, described, or evaluated potential biomarkers of intake for the set of 25 herbs and spices were further screened by one or more skilled researchers as described in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The initial PubMed search retrieved 527 matches, the Web of Science search generated 370 matches, and the Scopus search generated 284 matches, resulting in a total of 1181 hits. This number was reduced to 946 after the removal of duplicates. Subsequent screening of the titles and abstracts by the skilled researchers reduced the number of papers to 54. Further evaluation excluded 6 papers and a secondary search identified 1 more paper leading to a total of 49 papers that were included in this review (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Additional papers were identified from the reference lists in these papers and from reviews or book chapters identified through the literature search. This secondary search was used to evaluate the apparent specificity of the marker.
