<p class="p">The results in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> show that, in the case of the test group smokers and physically active, the indicators follow a similar evolution to the one observed in the Brazilian data (i.e., the smokers decrease and the physically active increase in both cases). On the other hand, a reduction in the obesity and overweight (−0.07%), and also, in the high glycaemia (−0.35%) indicators were identified in the test group. Relating to the same indicators, Brazilian data reveal an increase, respectively, of 1.28% and 0.23%. An increase in the high blood pressure indicator was identified both in test group and in the Brazilian data.
