 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> shows that, in general, interdisciplinary health intervention in the global workerâ€™s health reveals positive results in seven of the nine indicators assessed, namely: decrease of the percentage of smokers, increase of the physically active, decrease of the periodontal disease rate, decrease in the percentage of obese people and overweight, decrease in the number of caries, decrease in the number of workers with high glycaemia and a decrease in the number of days away from work. The remaining indicators where no improvements were observed, namely coronary risk and high blood pressure, should be considered as priorities for subsequent health interventions.
