<p class="p">To each indicator a negative or positive polarity was attributed according to the impact on the worker’s health, i.e., smoking has a negative polarity (–) due to its negative impacts on health and physical activity has a positive polarity (+) due to its positive impacts on health. An indicator trend was added to better understand the evolution direction, namely if increasing or decreasing, i.e., coronary risk had increased (↑) and caries had decreased (↓). Finally, an assessment was carried out aiming to identify which indicators had suffered improvement or aggravation since the beginning of the intervention, i.e., periodontal disease has a negative polarity (–) and its trend is to decrease (↓), which represents an improvement (Improvement). On the other hand, coronary risk has a negative polarity (–) and its trend is to increase (↑), representing an aggravation (Aggravation).</p>
