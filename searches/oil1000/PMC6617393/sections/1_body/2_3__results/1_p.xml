<p class="p">For a reliable assessment and comparison of the results obtained with the health intervention program, it is necessary to have similar characteristics of the participants, although opting for a convenience sample. Accordingly, 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution by sex of the control and the test groups, and it was verified that despite the difference in the absolute value of the number of participants between both groups, they are similar at the percentage level, in both male and female sexes, before and after the health intervention, allowing a real comparison of the data. It should be considered that, because the participants work in the oil industry, the male population (85.0–89.3%) will tend to be larger than the female population (10.7–14.9%), a predominantly male population occupation.
