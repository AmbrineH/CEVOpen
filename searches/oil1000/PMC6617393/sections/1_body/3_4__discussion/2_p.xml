 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows that the test group presented a higher prevalence for diseases in the initial study period (2006–2010), except for the indicators of smoking and obesity and overweight, which were slightly aggravated in the control group. After the implementation of the interdisciplinary interventions (2011–2015), an improvement of the profile of the test group for all the health indicators, with exception of the coronary risk and high blood pressure indicators, is observed, which may be justified by sociodemographic aspects such as sex, age and race, as reported by Khera et al.

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and report the improvements achieved by the test group in relation to the control group for all health indicators except coronary risk and high blood pressure. Regarding smoking, there was an equivalent reduction between both the test and the control groups, ranging from −0.61 to 0.60, without significant differences, this is explained by the fact that the Program to Combat Tobacco is interdisciplinary and applied in a similar way to both test and control groups.

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02148-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> present the advances obtained in the test group in relation to the Brazilian population for all comparable indicators, except for blood pressure. One of the main objectives of the interdisciplinary intervention is not be to seek that the test group presents better results than the control group, but that the results of the test group approach those of the control group, thus representing a global improvement in the overall health profile of the workers test group.
