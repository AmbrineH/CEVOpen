Behavioural risk factors related to oral diseases are common to other major CNCDs, including an unhealthy diet rich in free sugars, smoking, and harmful alcohol consumption [

In 2010, the prevalence of Brazilians with periodontal disease was 22.7%, in the age group of 35–74 years old, which is high when compared to the sample of this study, which presents a reduction of 4% (8% in 2006 for 4.2% in 2015), after the implementation of interdisciplinary health practices. The test group presents a higher percentage of workers with caries (0.9 ± 0.74%) compared to the control group (2.3 ± 2.16%), however it presents an average annual variation of −0.50% years, being more intense in the reduction of the disease in the studied period of 2006 to 2015, while there was an increase in the number of workers with caries in the control group in the range of 0.06% (
