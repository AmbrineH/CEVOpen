<p class="p">According to Brazilian Ministry of Health [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the Brazilian population. There is no single cause for these diseases, but several risk factors, which increase the probability of their occurrence. High blood pressure and diabetes mellitus represent two of the main risk factors, contributing decisively to the aggravation of this scenario at the national level [

With regard to altered glycaemia, a higher prevalence was observed in the test group, in addition to the more marked variation in the reduction of the percentage of workers in this group, in the order of −0.35%, whereas the control group varied in −0.23% and the Brazilian population in 0.23%. Although the results of the study for the high cardiovascular risk were not statistically significant, there was a stagnation of the data variation, which shows a control of cardiovascular risk behaviour, emphasizing the efficiency of the health practices implemented, namely at an interdisciplinary level. The study shows that cardiovascular risk and high blood pressure present better results after the interdisciplinary health intervention, indicating a tendency for improvement in both cases.
