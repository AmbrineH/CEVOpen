They comprise policies such as the integration and the articulation of the different sectors, organs and institutions for the construction of guidelines on CNCDs, actions in the scope of regulation of hypercaloric foods and advertisements, encouraging family farming to plant food, creation of conditioning environments for healthy living habits, agility in implementing tobacco-free environments throughout the country, and use of information as a management tool. With respect to achieving the goal of reducing the prevalence of smoking by 30% by 2022, a reduction up to 28% was already reached in 2017 and for the goal of increasing the prevalence of free-time physical activity by 10% in 2017, 23% in 2017 has already been achieved. However, the actions to curb the growth of obesity in adults need to be revised, since there was a growth up to 2017 of 25% in Brazil.
