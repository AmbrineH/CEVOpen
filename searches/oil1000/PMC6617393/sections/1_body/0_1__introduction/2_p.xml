 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] organized the surveillance of CNCDs aiming to respond to the scenario of growth of these pathologies in the country. This surveillance consists in a set of actions and processes allowing to know the occurrence, magnitude and distribution of the CNCDs and its main risk factors in Brazil, as well as to identify its economic, social and environmental determinants. In addition, one of the initiatives of the CNCDs surveillance aims to characterize the CNCDs time trend. These actions are essential for the planning, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of integral care and of the public policies of prevention and control of CNCDs in Brazil. The three essential components of CNCDs surveillance are: (a) Monitoring of risk factors; (b) monitoring the morbidity and mortality of CNCDs; and (c) monitoring and evaluation of health assistance and promotion actions to combat CNCDs.
