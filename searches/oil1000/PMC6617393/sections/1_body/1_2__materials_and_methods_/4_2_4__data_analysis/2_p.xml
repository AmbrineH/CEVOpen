<p class="p">The assessment of the impact of the health interdisciplinary practices was carried out at two levels with the application of inter and intragroup parametric tests. In the first level, the control group was compared with the test group before and after the health intervention through the Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test for independent samples. In the second level, the control group was compared before and after the health intervention, as well as the test group was compared before and after the health intervention through the Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test for paired samples. In order to complement the comparison of the means, the percentage variation of each indicator was calculated in the two groups, between the first year and the last year, respectively, 2006 and 2015. Once the first results of a health intervention project are analysed, it is important to know the trend (i.e., if indicators have been improved or, instead, were aggravated) of the health intervention in order to perceive if the changes that have been introduced lead to the initially defined goal of improving the overall health of the worker. Thus, a logarithmic prediction trend line was calculated in Excel 2016 [
