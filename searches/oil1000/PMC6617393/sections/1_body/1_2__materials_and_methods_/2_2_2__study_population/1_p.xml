<p class="p">The total population of workers was recruited at the occupational health service of an oil industry in Bahia, Brazil, and had, on average, the participation of 1736 subjects, starting with 1752 in 2006 and ending with 1460 in 2015. It is important to emphasize that this is a convenience sample and that, each year, the study population differed in number and composition. However, this difference between the two periods is not statistically significant, not limiting the interpretation of the results to the total population over time, which is dynamic. In all the years under study, Brazilian men, married, aged between 51 and 60 years, with administrative work regime, residing in the capital state and with high school education, prevailed in the sample. Workers included in the occupational health service and with a direct employment relationship with the oil industry studied were excluded, as well as participants with cognitive limitations or psychiatric disorders which did not allow the correct filling of electronic records, as those who were away from work.</p>
