<p class="p">This longitudinal retrospective study was developed with data collected from two periods: a first one referring to the years prior to the application of the interdisciplinary health assessment, from 2006 to 2010, and a second one, during its effective application, between 2011 and 2015. The subjects were assessed at the facilities of the occupational health service of an oil industry in Bahia, Brazil, during occupational annual assessments, in appropriate places, by health professionals with experience in the specific work area. In the period from 2006 to 2010, workers attended the oil industryâ€™s occupational health service to perform care with professionals in the areas of medical and dental dentistry and, between 2011 and 2015 assessments with nutritionists, nurses, preventive dentistry and physical educators were included. Data with the information requested by the researchers were obtained from the oil industry, subsequently treated to standardize the variable names. A randomly generated code was created in order to guarantee the anonymity of the study participants. </p>
