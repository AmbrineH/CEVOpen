<p class="p">During the period 2006 to 2015 under study there was a strong investment in public policies to control the CNCDs in Brazil. Changes were adopted by different domains of society either public or private institutions. In accordance to this, the oil industry incorporated company wide initiatives and allowed healthier life practices to be stimulated in the labour context, generating positive and improved health outcomes, when compared to the ones corresponding to the Brazilian population. The oil Worker Health Service studied in Bahia, Brazil, carried out specific health strategies, integrating interdisciplinary health interventions centred on the worker, which allow a personalized monitoring of individual needs of workers, something that Brazilian public policies are not able to accomplish. Reported positive results presented in this study are able to sustain the success of such initiatives. It is important to note that the main objective of this interdisciplinary health approach was achieved, namely the improvement of the test group health indicators, with exception of two interconnected indicators: coronary risk and high blood pressure, whose negative results are explained considering the workers sociodemographic profile. The logarithmic prediction trend lines indicate that, in the future, this type of interdisciplinary approach centred in the needs of workers will result in potential health gains, namely in the reduction of workers with coronary risk and high blood pressure, two of the main causes of death in the world.</p>
