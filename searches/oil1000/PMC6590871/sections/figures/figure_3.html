 <p> Taxonomic composition at the genus level (A) and a taxonomic cladogram obtained by the LEfSe analysis of 16S sequences within pairs of groups (B–D). The brightness of each dot is proportional to its effect size. Each circle’s diameter is proportional to the taxon’s abundance. HFD vs. HFD+PUE (B), HFD vs. NC (C), and NC vs. NC+PUE (D). </p>
