 <p> Intestinal barrier was strengthened by puerarin in vitro and in vivo. (A) Western blot analyses and quantification of the protein expression levels of tight junction proteins (TJPs) ZO-1 and occludin in the small intestine of mice. (B) Western blot analyses and quantification of the protein expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin in the colon of mice. (C) The protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin in Caco-2 cells with or without puerarin (5 or 10 Î¼M) treatment for 6 h. As compared with the NC group: *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01. As compared with the HFD group: #P &lt; 0.05, ##P &lt; 0.01. </p>
