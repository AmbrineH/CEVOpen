<p class="p">It is known that under normal conditions, at the phylum level, Firmicutes (F) and Bacteroidetes (B) constitute the majority (&gt;90% on average) of the gut microbial cells in humans and mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It has been suggested that the gut microbiotas of obese humans and mice have a notably greater F/B ratio than that of lean counterparts [

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]) demonstrated that there is no significant difference in the F/B ratio between obese and lean individuals. The contradictory observations indicate that the analysis of the microbiota at the phylum level might not be sufficient for identifying the anti-obesity components of the microbiota [
