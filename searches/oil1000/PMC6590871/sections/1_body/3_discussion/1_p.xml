<p class="p">HFD induced obesity in rodents well mimicked human metabolic syndrome with increase body weight and steatosis, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, and low- grade inflammation, thus, was broadly used in metabolic disease studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Various models that intended to understand this unwanted chronic condition, mechanistically and pathologically, have been proposed and focused, including glucose/lipid ill-metabolism-driven oxidative stress and fat tissue inflammation [

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Although, clinic manifestations of metabolic syndrome, e.g. lipid or glucose metabolic disorder dominant, were variable significantly, a low-grade inflammation appears to be a common feature [

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, the link between life style and food induced metabolic stress and body inflammation, locally/systemically, remains to be more rigorously established. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been linked to various metabolic disorders, including an obese phenotype, and presumed through impaired intestinal integrity and consequently low-grade inflammation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], raised the possibility that dysbiosis may be the link between the lipid overloading and the obese condition.
