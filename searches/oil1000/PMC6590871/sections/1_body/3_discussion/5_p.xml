<p class="p">We next showed that, at the family level, the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Bacteroidaceae was increased while the abundance of Verrucomicrobiaceae and Bacteroidales-S24-7 were decreased in the HFD+PUE group of mice as compared with that in the HFD group. Nevertheless, there was still no taxon that could be identified as a biomarker of the obese phenotype in all the four tested groups in this experiment. Moreover, puerarin in normal controls (NC+PUE) also altered the gut microbiota, both at the phylum and family levels, illustrated by the altered Proteobacteria abundance (

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the distribution profiles of all detected unique OTUs clustered all the samples in accordance with the experimental manipulations, suggesting that the intestinal flora as whole was sensitive to experimental conditions, but taxonomic profile showed irrelevant to obese phenotype (
