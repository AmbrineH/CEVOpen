 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], puerarin was injected i.p. in the present study. Thus, in contrast to gavage, the change in the gut microbiota in the tested mice was more stable and likely, at least in part, due to the direct effect of puerarin on the host cells. Indeed, we observed that puerarin stimulated the expressions of ZO-1 and occludin

Whether puerarin can target immune cells and functions in metabolic aspect (and regulating the gut microbiota through them) remains to be elucidated.
