<p class="p">Mechanistically, in HFD-induced metabolic disorders, the alterations of body mass, glycemia, insulin, and liver condition are all rooted to lipid overloading, which may affect either metabolic process per se or dysbiosis, or both. Here, we presented evidence to argue that puerarin may be through host cells (at least in part) to improve gut epithelial integrity and to reshape gut microbiota. Among the phenotypic changes of HFD mice, the body mass, the liver condition, the insulin level and, perhaps, the T cell homeostasis (indicated by Treg maker Foxp3) were more sensitive to puerarin treatment and largely reversed, while under the current experimental conditions with continuous HFD, the epithelial integrity, the status of the inflammation and the insulin resistance were all only partially rescued, thus, left the possibility that the remaining inflammation, presumably due to an incomplete recovery of gut barrier, is the reason for a compromised rescue of HFD phenotype by puerarin. The complicated mechanistic study is out of the focus of the current work. However, the lessons were learned that to protect diet-related metabolic conditions, both diet restriction and microbiota reshape are necessary and would be more effective.</p>
