<p class="p">Herein, we investigated the effect of puerarin on the gut microbiota in mice with HFD-induced obesity. The aim of this study was to establish a link between puerarinâ€™s anti-obesity effect and gut dysbiosis, and to identify the puerarin-induced specific microbiota which may help suppressing obesity. Our results suggest that puerarin is a potent therapeutic agent for gut dysbiosis and provide new evidence for understanding the involvement of the gut microbiota in HFD-induced metabolic disorders.</p>
