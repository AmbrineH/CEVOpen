<p class="p">We found that the beneficial effect of puerarin on body weight, and insulin level and glucose homeostasis in HFD-fed mice are associated with a change in the gut microbiota with a specific increase in the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">muciniphila</italic>. This result indicates a potential usefulness of puerarin in clinical practice. Puerarin treatment also promoted the growth and function of goblet cells by increasing the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Muc2</italic> and the antimicrobial-peptide gene 
 <italic class="italic">Reg3g</italic>. Thus, we propose that puerarin may prevent the obese phenotype through regulatory effects on the gut microbiota (especially on the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">muciniphila)</italic> and intestinal integrity through direct effect on the gut epithelial cells.
