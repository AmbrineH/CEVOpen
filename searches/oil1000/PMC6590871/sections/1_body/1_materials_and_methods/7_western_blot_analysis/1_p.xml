<p class="p">The fresh intestinal tissues (ileum and colons) were washed with PBS, harvested, and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by means of the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein (50 μg) of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel, followed by western blotting to detect the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin. An anti–ZO-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-occludin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, China), and anti–β-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) were used according to the vendor instructions. ECL Plus Blotting Reagent and a Quality One documentation system were employed to quantify the data (Bio Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA).</p>
