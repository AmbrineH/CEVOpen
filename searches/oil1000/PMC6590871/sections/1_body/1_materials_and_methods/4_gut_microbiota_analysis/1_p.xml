<p class="p">Stool samples were collected from the colon of mice and stored at −80°C before use. DNA was extracted from 0.18 to 0.22 g of each stool sample using the TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The yield and quality of the extracted DNA were measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA); one of the PUE group samples (PUE4) with low quality was excluded for the subsequent experiments. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primers
