<p class="p">For i.p. injection glucose tolerance testing (IPGTT), mice were fasted for 12 h overnight with free access to water followed by an i.p. injection of glucose (2 g/kg body weight; Sigma). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (Roche) immediately before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after glucose injection. Serum insulin concentration and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined by means of commercial ELISA kits (Excell, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</p>
