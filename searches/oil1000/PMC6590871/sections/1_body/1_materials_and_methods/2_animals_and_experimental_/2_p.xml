<p class="p">Mice were randomly divided into four groups (six mice in each group): NC (normal control), NC+PUE (NC+puerarin, 100 mg/kg), HFD and HFD+PUE (HFD + puerarin at 100 mg/kg). A schematic representation of the experimental process is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>. Mice of the NC group and NC+PUE group were allocated to a low-fat diet containing 10% calories from fat (D12450J; Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) while mice of the HFD group and HFD+PUE group were allocated an HFD containing 60% calories from fat (D12492; Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 13 weeks. The composition of the diets was listed in supporting information (

From the 6th week, mice of the NC+PUE and HFD+PUE groups were daily injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with puerarin (100 mg/kg), whereas the NC group mice were daily injected with the same volume of vehicle (5% propanediol, i.p.) for 7 weeks. Body weights were recorded weekly. All the animal experiments were repeated twice. Puerarin (batch number 130902) for injection was bought from Baiyunshan Tianxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).
