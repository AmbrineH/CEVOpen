<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted from intestinal tissues (ileum and colons, see above) before tissue fixation using the TRIzol Reagent (Bioteke Corporation, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA), and stored at –20°C. For RT-qPCR, cDNA was amplified with the SYBR Green Mix (Vazyme, China) on a Step One Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The relative amount of mRNA or gene toward an internal control was calculated by the 2
