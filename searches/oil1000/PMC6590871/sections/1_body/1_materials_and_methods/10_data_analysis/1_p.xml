<p class="p">Sequencing data on the gut microbiota were analyzed in the Uparse software (Uparse v.7.0.1001) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Sequences with ≥97% similarity were clustered to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and were annotated via the GreenGene Database based on the RDP classifier [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Subsequent analysis of α-diversity was performed on the output normalized data, which were evaluated using the Shannon index. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed to identify principal coordinates and visualize β-diversity in complex multidimensional data. Functional pathways of the gut microbiota were predicted using PICURSt (Version 1.1.1) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. LEfSe (Version 1.0) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] was employed to identify biomarkers for both species taxonomical analysis and functional pathways via calculation of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score among different phenotype groups.
