<p class="p">The animals were anaesthetized by isoflurane using an anesthetizing chamber (MSS International Limited, West Yorkshire, UK) to a sealed plastic box, and the concentration of isoflurane was monitored continuously using a Vamos gas analyzer (Drager, Lübeck, SchleswigHolstein, Germany) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We used 4% concentration of isoflurane for inducing anesthesia and 2% concentration of isoflurane for maintenance, the flow rate was kept at 0.6–0.8 L/min [

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The blood was initially collected by the heart punctures in mice. The animals were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver (the major lobe) and the small intestine (the ileum) tissues were removed from mouse bodies, flushed with PBS and fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature. After sectioning, hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining and Oil red O staining were performed for histopathological examination. For staining of goblet cells, the tissues of the small intestines (ileum) were recognized and dissected ~1 cm above the cecum (the colon tissue was obtained from the mid-portion of the colon between the cecum and the rectum) and incubated in Bouin’s fixative for 16 h at 4°C and blocked in 2% blocking agar for paraffin embedding. Next, 5~7-μm sections were prepared and stained with Alcian Blue, Periodic acid‐Schiff (PAS), or H&amp;E. The goblet cells stained pink to red, and the nuclei were blue.
