<p class="p">To assess the effect of puerarin on obesity, chow-fed (NC) or high fat diet-fed (HFD) C57BL/6 mice were treated with puerarin for 7 weeks (NC+PUE and HFD+PUE, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). The HFD+PUE group of mice experienced a significantly lower body-weight gain than did the HFD group of mice (P &lt; 0.001), whereas puerarin-treated control mice showed no obvious changes in their weights (P &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Similarly, puerarin significantly ameliorated the hyperglycemia in HFD-fed mice with a significantly higher glucose disposal rate at 30, 60, and 120 min when compared with that in the HFD group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1E</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) for i.p. injection glucose tolerance testing (IPGTT) was calculated to evaluate the overall glucose exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1F</xref>); these data indicated a significant improvement in glucose exposure in puerarin-treated mice as compared with that in the HFD group (P &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, puerarin treatment had no obvious effect on glucose exposure of control mice (P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, puerarin treatment decreased plasma insulin levels in the HFD+PUE group when compared with that of the HFD group (P &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). Microscopic assessment of liver samples revealed that the steatosis induced by the HFD was notably reduced by puerarin in comparison with that in the pair-fed mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s001" class="xref">S1A Fig</xref>), and Oil red O staining showed that puerarin treatment decreased liver lipid content in the HFD-fed mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s001" class="xref">S1B Fig</xref>). We also found that puerarin decreased ALT and AST levels (P &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s001" class="xref">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>), lowered expression levels of the HFD-induced gluconeogenic genes

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s001" class="xref">S1F and S1G Fig</xref>), and reduced liver weight in the HFD-fed mice (P &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s001" class="xref">S1E Fig</xref>). Thus, puerarin treatment provided additional metabolic benefits to the HFD-fed obese mice.
