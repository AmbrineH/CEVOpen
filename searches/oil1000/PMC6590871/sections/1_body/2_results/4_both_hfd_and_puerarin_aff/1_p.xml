<p class="p">The alterations of functional gene abundances in the microbial taxa were predicted based on our 16S rRNA gene datasets by means of PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved state) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>, overall, there was no coherent change in the KEGG pathway that was significant ([log10] LDA scores &gt; 2) and consistent with the change of the obese phenotype upon puerarin and/or HFD treatment. Instead, LEfSe did identify two KEGG pathways (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and protein folding and associated processing) that were both enriched significantly ([log10] LDA scores &gt; 2) in the groups of HFD-fed obese mice (HFD vs. NC and HFD vs. HFD+PUE) and PUE-treated mice (NC vs. NC+PUE), suggesting that these two pathways might simply characterize the responses of the gut microbiota to the environmental challenges. No KEGG pathway in all the comparisons related to puerarin or HFD treatment showed a significant and persistent reduction.
