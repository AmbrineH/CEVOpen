<p class="p">To determine possible correlations of the obese phenotype with the gut microbiota of the tested mice, LEfSe was used to examine the biomarkers of the detected gut microbiota at the genus level by comparing different pairs of mouse groups: HFD versus NC, HFD versus HFD+PUE, and NC versus NC+PUE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g003" class="xref">Fig 3Bâ€“3D</xref>). The genera that contributed to differences the most ([log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>] LDA scores &gt; 2) in the pairwise comparisons are listed in Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>), where the blue part illustrates the genera that contributed significantly to the difference between the HFD group and NC group or HFD+PUE group ([log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>] LDA scores &gt; 2). Notably, the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic> markered obese phenotype with its abundance was significantly lower in the HFD group but was recovered in the HFD+PUE group. To further characterize the relation between the gut microbiota and obese phenotype at the OTU level, increased stringency was imposed ([log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>] LDA scores &gt; 3) in all the four tested groups, and the remaining OTUs meeting the criteria were summarized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>); their differences were examined by the 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test within pairs of groups (HFD vs. HFD+PUE, HFD vs. NC, and NC vs. NC+PUE). Only one OTU that was annotated as 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic> (OTU_20, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) manifested significant differences in both comparisons: HFD vs. HFD+PUE and HFD vs. NC (P &lt; 0.05), while showed little difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the NC and NC+PUE groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s005" class="xref">S5 Fig</xref>). Thus, the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic> and the obese phenotype showed an inverse correlation of changes. Real-time PCR confirmed its identity as 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">muciniphila</italic> at the species level (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218490.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). In short, the abundance levels of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">muciniphila</italic> were significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.05) in the normal-weight mice (NC, NC+PUE, and HFD+PUE).
