<p class="p">Finally, the effect of puerarin on the intestinal goblet cells that synthesize and secret mucins in the intestine (which are known to stimulate

 <italic class="italic">Muc2</italic> (the major gene encoding mucin in goblet cells [

 <italic class="italic">Muc2</italic> in both NC+PUE and HFD+PUE groups in the small intestines were increased (P &lt; 0.05), indicating a stimulatory effect of puerarin on goblet cell function (

 <xref rid="pone.0218490.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]) was also lower in the HFD group and greatly upregulated in NC+PUE and HFD+PUE groups in both the small intestinal and colon tissues (P &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g007" class="xref">Fig 7D and 7G</xref>). Thus, puerarin promoted intestinal integrity in both the normal and HFD-fed mice.
