 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g002" class="xref">Fig 2C</xref> presents the detected phyla in the tested samples. The HFD significantly increased the abundance of Proteobacteria (from 2.75% ± 0.31% to 4.81% ± 1.32%, P &lt; 0.05) while significantly reducing the abundance of Verrucomicrobia (from 0.75% ± 0.56% to 0.10% ± 0.02%, P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, in the HFD-fed mice, the treatment with puerarin notably reduced the abundance of Bacteroidetes and of the phylum Tenericutes (from 27.48% ± 4.94% &amp; 0.69% ± 0.20% to 17.19% ± 1.77% &amp; 0.31% ± 0.03%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05), and significantly increased the relative abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia (from 0.10% ± 0.02% to 1.29% ± 0.70%, P &lt; 0.05). In the NC-fed mice, puerarin treatment altered only Proteobacteria abundance (from 2.75% ± 0.31% to 5.03% ± 0.99%, P &lt; 0.05).
