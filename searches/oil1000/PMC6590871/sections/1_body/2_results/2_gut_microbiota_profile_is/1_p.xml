<p class="p">To test whether the microbiota played a role in the HFD amelioration model in our experiment, the composition and abundance of the intestinal microflora were evaluated by bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing in colonic feces samples. A total of 8.8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> ± 2.1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> paired-end reads were generated in the 23 datasets and resulted in 8.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> ± 2.1 × 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>. The HFD notably increased the diversity of the gut microbiota (P &lt; 0.05), whereas puerarin hardly affected the diversity (P &gt; 0.05). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref> shows the PCoA based on the distribution profiles of all the detected OTUs across the 23 samples using Bray–Curtis ordination, this analysis explained 50.9% of intersample variance for taxonomic profiles. All the 23 samples clustered in accordance with the groups of mice, revealing obvious separation among the gut microbiotas of the four tested groups. These data showed that puerarin’s modulatory effects on the gut microbiota were not limited to the HFD-fed mice.
