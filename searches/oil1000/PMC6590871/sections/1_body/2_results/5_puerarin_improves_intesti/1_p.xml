<p class="p">Next, to assess the protective effect of puerarin on the intestinal barrier, the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin in the small intestine and colon were studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218490.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). The expressions of ZO-1 and occludin were reduced in the HFD group when compared to those of the NC group, and they were recovered in the HFD+PUE group. To test whether this effect of puerarin was direct, puerarin was incubated with human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 for 6 h (at 5 or 10 Î¼M). The protein levels of ZO-1 and occludin in Caco-2 cells were significantly upregulated compared with those in the cells treated with vehicle (

In agreement with this result, In HFD+PUE group, Foxp3 expression in the small intestine and colon was significantly increased, which was initially reduced in the small intestine (P &lt; 0.05) and colon (P &lt; 0.01) in the HFD group (
