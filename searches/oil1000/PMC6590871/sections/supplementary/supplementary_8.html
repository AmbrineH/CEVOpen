  <p class="p">(A) Liver H&amp;E staining of four groups of mice (magnification ×200). (B) Liver lipid content was assessed by Oil red O staining (magnification ×200). (C) Quantification of the steatosis percentage in the experimental groups. (D, E) ALT and AST levels in the liver of mice. (F) Liver weight at week 13. (G, H) Relative expression levels of the HFD-induced gluconeogenic genes 
   <italic class="italic">G6PD</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">PEPCK</italic> in hepatic tissues were assessed by RT-qPCR. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM; Six mice per group. As compared with the NC group: *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01. As compared with the HFD group:
