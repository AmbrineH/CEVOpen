<p class="p">Emitted volatiles were analyzed using a Supelco (Bellofonte, USA) SPME device coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm) in order to sample the headspace of each living/flowering plant. Plants of StuM population did not bloom, thus data on VOCs concerned eight populations, for a total of 33 plants. Sample was introduced individually into a 30 ml glass conical flask and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. After the equilibration time, the fiber was exposed to the headspace for 15 min at room temperature; once sampling was finished, the fiber was withdrawn into the needle and transferred to the injector of the GC system, where the fiber was desorbed. GC-FID and GC-MS analyses were performed according to Pistelli et al. (

The oven temperature was programmed rising from 60°C to 240°C at 3°C/min; injector temperature, 220°C; transfer-line temperature, 240°C; carrier gas, He (1 ml/min).
