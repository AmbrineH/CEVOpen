<p class="p">Portions of lavender branches were collected from wild plants during the flowering season of 2014, from August to September. In each of the nine selected sites, the main area of lavender distribution was identified as a central point and from there, an area with a radius of 10 m was plotted. Inside that area, 10 individuals were randomly chosen and twenty cuttings were immediately prepared from each individual. Specimens are currently available and cultivated in the DISAFA facilities (45°03′58.5″N; 7°35′29.1″E, WGS84 System). Cuttings were allowed to root in peat substrate under plastic tunnels in an organic nursery, specialized in medicinal and aromatic plants (Frat.lli Gramaglia, Collegno, Italy; 45°05′22.4″N, 7°34′26.4″E, 302 m. a.s.l.). In spring 2015, the percentage of successful rooting was calculated and the rooted plants were transplanted in pots, with a mixture of peat and green compost (70-30, % v/v) and transferred outdoors. Irrigation was provided when needed and manual weed control was performed. Plants were fertigated with NPK fertilizer (1:2:2) three times during spring and once during autumn. The cultivation cycle lasted two years and during the first one (Summer 2015), non-destructive VOC analysis was performed 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> on flowered pot plants to characterize lavender aroma and evaluate their potential differences. As ecological characteristics of the sampling site did have an influence on lavender performance, during the second year (Summer 2016), biometric parameters and EOs were analyzed.
