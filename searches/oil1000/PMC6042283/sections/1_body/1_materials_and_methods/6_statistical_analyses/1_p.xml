<p class="p">Data were tested for the homogeneity of variance, then one-way ANOVA was performed to analyze latitude and altitude effect on biometric parameters and means were separated according to Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch-F post-hoc test (REGW-F). Statistically significant differences induced by latitude on chemical classes and compounds of VOCs and EO were assessed with the one-way ANOSIM with Euclidean-based similarity. The percentage contribution of each compound to the observed dissimilarity was assessed through the similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER, Euclidean distance). For each compound the difference between valleys were tested with Mann-Whitney pairwise test. Besides, VOC and EO chemical classes were subjected to the regression analysis to investigate their eventual link to altitude or latitude of native environment. The value for statistical significance was
