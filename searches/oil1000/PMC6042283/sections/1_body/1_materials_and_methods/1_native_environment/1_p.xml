<p class="p">Lavender (
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic>) is widespread throughout Italy (Pignatti, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1982</xref>), where it is a common component of low-growing shrub vegetation on calcareous soils. 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> finds its phytosociological optimum in the sub-Mediterranean region within the order 
 <italic class="italic">Ononidetalia</italic>, that describes meso-xerophile, basophile, supra-oromediterranean vegetation communities (Theurillat et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). It is the only species naturally occurring in the West Italian Alps (Piedmont region). Nine peripheral populations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>) were selected according to the natural range of distribution of the species (Pignatti, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1982</xref>), in order to explore different ecological conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref>) in terms of latitude (Susa Valley in the northern range, Stura Valley in the core areas, and Tanaro Valley in the southern part of the Piedmont region) and altitude (low, medium and high altitude). Susa Valley represents the highest latitudinal range of distribution of the species in the Alps (Aeschimann et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). As the latitude decreases (from Susa to Tanaro Valley), the annual rainfalls decrease and yearly temperatures increase, thus there is a clear ecological gradient moving toward the typical Mediterranean conditions (Fick and Hijmans, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
