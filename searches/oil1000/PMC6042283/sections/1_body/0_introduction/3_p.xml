<p class="p">The populations of plants that are geographically situated at the peripheral limit of a species distribution range are usually expected to exhibit lower abundance and intra-genetic diversity, according to the widely accepted “abundant center model.” Moreover, a higher genetic differentiation than populations at the center is likely to occur (Eckert et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Altitudinal gradient was also proved to affect species diversification in peripheral populations of

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Unfortunately, intra-specific studies on secondary metabolites production performed in plants in different environmental conditions do not inform whether the observed variations represent the genetic adaptation to specific environments, or the short-term response to environmental factors (Spitaler et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Thus, trials under uniform cultivation practices are preferable to limit environmental influence on plant secondary metabolite production.
