<p class="p">We hereby provide the first phytochemical description of secondary metabolites in 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> peripheral populations of the West Italian Alps. The influence of sea distance (latitude) and altitude on VOC and EO composition was analyzed in plants grown under uniform cultivation conditions. Interestingly, results showed that the ecological gradient created germplasm heterogeneity. Compared to other studies, altitude seemed to affect mainly biometric parameters, and to a low extent the phytochemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic>, while sea distance had an influence on both morphological and phytochemical traits. Lavenders of West Italian Alps disclosed a great potential for the development of a valuable local product, where the cultivation of the thermophilous species 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. Ã— 
 <italic class="italic">intermedia</italic> cannot be applied due to the lower average temperature of the studied alpine areas. Among the studied alpine peripheral populations, plants of Tanaro Valley, which have evolved in almost Mediterranean ecological conditions, generally performed better in both morphological and phytochemical characteristics. To obtain uniform productions, the study of the phytochemical variation and the selection and propagation of interesting genotypes must be promoted, together with the improvement of cultivation protocols.
