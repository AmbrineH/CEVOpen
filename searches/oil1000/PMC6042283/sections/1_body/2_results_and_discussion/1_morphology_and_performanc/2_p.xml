<p class="p">Altitude affected also morphological parameters and flower yield (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Contrariwise to low altitude groups, plants from higher elevation developed a more compact shrub (GI = 2,003 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), with higher number (11.26) and longer spikes (37.8 cm) during cultivation, but producing lower yield of inflorescences (1.16 gDW/plant), attributable to a less number of flowers per spike. Altitudinal gradient effect has been previously observed in other Lamiaceae species, displaying lower height at high altitudes, to avoid wind damages and improve photosynthetic conditions (Kofidis and Bosabalidis, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref> and references in it). However, compact plants can facilitate field operations, especially harvesting. Growth and number of flower spikes were influenced also by the population distance from the sea. Plants from Susa Valley showed a compact growth (GI = 1,886 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and a low number of flower spikes (5.4), contrary to what observed in Stura plants (GI = 3,706 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> and 10.6). Tanaro plants were compact (GI = 2,470 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and produced a high number of spikes (8.8), showing an interesting habit for ornamental and field cultivation purposes. A latitudinal gradient in spike length and flower yield were not detected in the second cultivation cycle. These data could be helpful in the selection of alpine peripheral
