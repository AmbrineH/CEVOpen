<p class="p">Lavenders of West Alps differently performed under cultivation, and influence of sea distance (latitude) or altitude of the native environment was observed in some biometric parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Rooting percentage after 3 months in seed cells was generally below 40% and ranged among populations (SusH 23.9%, SusM 17.0%, SusL 38.0%; StuH 15.8%, StuM 9.6%, StuL 35.3%; TanH 37.5%, TanM 23.0%, TanL 39.5%). Rooting ability was therefore generally low, especially considering that selected lavender cultivars often reach 95% of successful rooting (Lis-Balchin, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, the propagation of wild adult plants by cutting is needed to produce genetically homogeneous individuals and the rooting percentage achieved in this study on 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> is considered of interest by local nurseries. Significant effects were observed due to both altitude and latitude of native environment, with a more successful rooting in plants evolved closer to the Mediterranean conditions (Tanaro) and from lower altitudes. The survival rate of rooted cuttings after 2 years of cultivation ranged between 54% (SusL) and 83% (StuL), but was independent from the geographical origin of the plants (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). During the first cultivation cycle, 9% of pot lavenders bloomed, while in the second year, all plants bloomed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>); the first flowered plants were recorded on June 6th 2016 and the last on August 19th 2016. Interestingly, almost all lavenders of high populations flowered simultaneously in 1 week (SusH 100%, StuH 100%, and TanH 96%) regardless the latitude, followed by medium and low altitude populations, with the latter group defining a more gradual trend during summer. Knowledge of flowering times is essential to plan nursery activities (Lis-Balchin, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) or harvesting time for the production of EOs or dried flowers. Indeed, the nurseries can exploit lavenders with a flower production concentrated in a short period, since higher number of plants are available per sale. Furthermore, producers can optimize flower harvesting in the field when a simultaneous blooming occurs. Nonetheless, a gradual blooming can ensure flowered plants availability in the nursery and gardens for a longer period.
