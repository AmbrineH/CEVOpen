 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">2</xref>). Plants from the lowest altitudes showed higher yields in Susa and Tanaro valley (0.69 and 0.37%, respectively). Previous studies highlighted the same behavior in other aromatic plants such as

 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> (Tuttolomondo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Giuliani et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found a correlation between higher yields at decreasing altitudes and, but not limited to, an increased presence of glandular peltate trichomes, the structures responsible for the accumulation of EOs. Considering distance from Mediterranean conditions, Susa lavenders were the most productive in terms of EO, followed by Tanaro and Stura plants.
