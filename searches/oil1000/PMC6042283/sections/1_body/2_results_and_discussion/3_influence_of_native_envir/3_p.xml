<p class="p">One-hundred-four compounds were identified in lavender EO (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">2</xref>), accounting for more than 99% of the total EO composition. The number of compounds in each population varied from 63 (SusH) to 83 (StuL). These numbers were higher than those previously reported in 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> species and cultivars cultivated in the Tyrrhenian coast (Venskutonis et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>; Pistelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Interestingly, each EO was a mixture of different compounds, but all populations shared at least 40 constituents. The EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> is reported to be the most variable inside the genus (Lis-Balchin, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, the characteristic compounds found in 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> oil usually are linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, β-ocimene, 4-terpineol, and camphor (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Accordingly, in the present study linalool and linalyl acetate were the most abundant in all the EOs analyzed, with the highest amount recorded in TanL (linalool 35.0%) and StuH (linalyl acetate 26.3%). However, linalool content was present in lower percentage than in previous studies on lavender (Venskutonis et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>; Pistelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In fact, linalool production in 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> varies widely (Prusinowska and Smigielski, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) depending on temperature, flower development, and rainfall (Hassiotis et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Linalyl acetate content registered in this work is in accordance with that reported for lavender ‘Maillette’ (Pistelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), but lower than in lavender species grow in Lithuania (Venskutonis et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). According to the percentage content of the characteristic compounds of lavender essential oil reported in the European Pharmacopoeia 6.0 (Ph. Eur.) none of the analyzed EOs completely fulfill the expected limits. StuH and TanL were closely related to the established ranges except for linalool (less than 20%) in StuH and linalyl acetate (less than 25%) in TanL. The percentages of 4-terpineol, 3-octanone, limonene, and lavandulyl acetate were in the range fixed by Ph. Eur. for all the tested EOs. Among the compounds reported in ISO 3515:2002 for lavender EO
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>
 </xref> only 3-octanone, limonene and lavandulyl acetate respected the fixed limits in all the analyzed EOs. The analysis of flower fragrance has been suggested as a good indicator of the EO composition (An et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). However, EO composition frequently differed from the aroma profiles (see section Influence of Native Environment on Volatile Emission), as already highlighted in several studies on lavenders (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). These differences were caused by processes such as hydrolysis, thermal degradation, and molecular rearrangements that are promoted during the hydro distillation method (Da Porto and Decorti, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
