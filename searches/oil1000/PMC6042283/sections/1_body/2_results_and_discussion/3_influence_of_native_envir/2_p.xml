<p class="p">The mean of the relative abundance of chemical classes was distributed as follows (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">2</xref>): OM (71.2%), OS (13.7%), SH (6.1%), NT (4.9%), MH (3.2%), and AC (0.3%). A different distribution was recorded by Pistelli et al. (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) in 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> ‘Maillette’, where the amount of OS and SH were lower than that observed in this study (0.5 and 1.8%, respectively). Commonly, monoterpenes represent the major class in the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> species (Lis-Balchin, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) and our data are consistent with values reviewed by Prusinowska and Smigielski (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In this study, significant positive linear regression fitted between MH and NT concentration with latitude (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A,B</xref>) and AC content with altitude (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6D</xref>); instead, a negative linear regression fitted between SH and latitude (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6C</xref>), an opposite behavior than that observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium polium</italic> EO by Sadeghi et al. (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
