<p class="p">The one-way ANOSIM performed on EO compounds revealed significant differences among populations at different latitudes (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.009), likewise to what observed in lavender aroma (see section Influence of Native Environment on Volatile Emission), with a clear separation between populations with more (Tanaro) and less (Susa) Mediterranean ecological conditions. According to the SIMPER analysis, thirteen compounds were responsible for 95% of this difference (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), with linalool being the major contributor (45.98%). The effect of sea distance was seen on nine out of the 13 compounds. In particular, linalool, 4-terpinenol, β-caryophyllene, thujapsan-2-α-ol, and (Z)-γ-bisabolene were higher in populations closer to the Mediterranean Sea (Tanaro), while 1,8-cineole, τ-cadinol, 1-octen-3-yl acetate and α-terpineol where higher in the furthest populations (Susa). Linalool and terpineol are of great interest for medicinal industry due to their positive effects on the central nervous system (Prusinowska and Smigielski, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). β-caryophyllene, with its woody and spicy aroma, is commonly used in the fragrance and cosmetic industry. However, it has also antibiotic, anesthetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-spasmodic activity (Buchbauer and Ilic, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, similarly to results on fragrance, the populations closer to Mediterranean conditions (Tanaro) could be considered valuable germplasm for selection and breeding purposes, aimed to the production of EO, despite the low yields obtained. Indeed it is needed to consider that the cultivation occurred in pot. In proper open field conditions higher biomass and EO yields are expected. No significant differences were detected in EO compounds according to altitude, likewise to VOCs composition (see Section Influence of Native Environment on Volatile Emission), despite there are evidence that altitude significantly affected chemical composition of EO in other Lamiaceae plants (Giuliani et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sadeghi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Chograni et al. (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) observed also a phytochemical variation in the leaf EO of wild 
 <italic class="italic">L. multifida</italic> belonging to the same bioclimatic zone, possibly explained by genetic factors. Similarly, in the present study, the ecological conditions of peripheral sites may have induced different adaptation mechanisms in lavender, leading to different phytochemical compositions. Since the EO obtained in this work did not respect the limit established by Ph. Eur., they can be used for other industrial application, or for cosmetic purposes.
