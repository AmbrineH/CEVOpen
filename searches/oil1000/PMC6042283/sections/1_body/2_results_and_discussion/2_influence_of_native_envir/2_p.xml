<p class="p">The volatile chemical classes of lavender fragrance were mainly represented by terpenes, with low amount of non-terpene derivatives (NT, 1.1–6.1%) and apocarotenoids (AC, 0.1–0.5%) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">1</xref>). Oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant VOCs in all the populations (OM, 61.2–78.1%), followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH, 8.9–22.4%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (SH, 4.8–20.5%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OS, 0.1–1.9%). Interestingly, SH were generally present in higher amounts in the aroma of the lowest-altitude populations (SusL 15.6%, StuL 18.3%, TanL 20.5%), and AC were not detected in SusM, SusL, and in TanM populations. One-way ANOSIM performed on chemical classes showed that populations far from the sea (Susa) significantly differed from the closest ones (Tanaro) in their phytochemical composition (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.038), indicating a clear distinction of aroma profiles. Moreover, a linear negative regression fitted between latitude and MH and a positive with OM (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A,B</xref>), whereas a negative regression model fitted between SH and altitude (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C</xref>). Monoterpenes are high volatile terpenoids emitted with warm temperature (&gt;20°C). Their amount in flower fragrance is variable and often exceeds 50% of the total flower emission (Holopainen et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), as found in our study. Sesquiterpenes are the most diverse class of terpenoids (Holopainen et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>); they are more abundant in plant volatiles than oils and are effectively used in aromatherapy (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), giving a sweet aromatic note (Prusinowska and Smigielski, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, altitude influence on sesquiterpenes content found in this study could be an interesting starting point to explore the selection of fragrance characteristics.
