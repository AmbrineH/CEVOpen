<p class="p">The one-way ANOSIM performed using VOCs composition showed a similar trend to what observed in chemical classes, with a clear differentiation between Susa and Tanaro populations (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.018), respectively the farthest and the closest sites to Mediterranean conditions. According to the SIMPER analysis, 11 compounds were responsible for the 95% of this dissimilarity in lavender fragrance (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), with 1,8-cineole, linalyl acetate and linalool as major contributors (50.65, 16.33, and 13.16% of the contribution, respectively). The effect of sea distance was particularly seen on five out of 11 compounds. In detail, linalool, (E)-Î²-ocimene and 4-terpineol increased in the populations closer to the Mediterranean Sea, whereas 1,8-cineole and bornyl acetate had an opposite behavior. These latter constituents usually adversely affect lavender fragrance (Prusinowska and Smigielski, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), while linalool is responsible for the fresh and floral smell (Chizzola, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Prusinowska and Smigielski, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). It is one of the best-examined and most often reported monoterpene in flowers (Buchbauer and Ilic, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Holopainen et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Moreover, there are evidences that linalool acts synergistically with linalyl-acetate and both compounds are required for the anxiolytic effect of the inhaled EOs (Buchbauer and Ilic, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Thereof peripheral populations adapted to Mediterranean ecological conditions (Tanaro) appear more interesting for the selection of fragrance genotypes.
