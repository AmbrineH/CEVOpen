<p class="p">Both isomers of β-ocimene, together with linalool, are frequently found in species pollinated by butterflies, bees, and moths (Andersson, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Dötterl and Schäffler, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Gong et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). TanM population emitted the highest quantity of both isomers [(Z)-β-ocimene, 6.4% and (E)-β-ocimene, 7.5%] and could have therefore differentiated its VOC emission to attract its peculiar type of pollinators (Dudareva et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
