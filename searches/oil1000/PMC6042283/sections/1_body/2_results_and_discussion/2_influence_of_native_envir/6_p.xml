<p class="p">Qualitative and quantitative variation was found in this study in the fragrance composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> species according to its distance from the sea, while Stark et al. (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) found only qualitative differences concerning other secondary metabolites (flavonoids and tannins). Several phenological events and environmental parameters may drive intra-specific floral scent variation, as observed also between and within 
 <italic class="italic">Phlox</italic> cultivars (Majetic et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), highlighting that species contain a great potential of variation. Nonetheless, the uniform cultivation conditions adopted in our trial pointed out that variation in lavender fragrance composition could be partly attributed to its genetic adaptation to ecological conditions of peripheral alpine sites.
