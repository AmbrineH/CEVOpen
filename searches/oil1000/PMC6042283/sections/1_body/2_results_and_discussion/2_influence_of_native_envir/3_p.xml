<p class="p">Considering single compounds, 88 VOCs were identified in lavender aroma profile (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">1</xref>). The identified compounds accounted for more than 97% of the total composition. The number of compounds in each population varied from 42 (TanM) to 62 (StuL). Interestingly, every population had a peculiar aroma composition and all populations shared only 27 compounds. Among these compounds, the sum of linalyl acetate, linalool and 1,8-cineole were present more than 50% in SusM and SusL populations and more than 40% in the others; 1,8-cineole was less abundant in TanM and TanL; 4-terpineol and (E)-β-ocimene occurred in high percentages only in TanM lavender (7.7% and 7.5%, respectively), which showed also higher amount of lavandulyl acetate (4.5%). Linalool (22.9%), β-caryophyllene (13.9%), as well as borneol (6.7%) evidenced the highest amount in TanL. Da Porto and Decorti (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) found a different arrangement in VOCs of lavender cultivated in Northeast Italy, in particular with 1,8-cineole, linalool, camphor, linalyl acetate, and β-caryophyllene being the 70% of the total aroma. Moreover, (E)-β-ocimene was present in smaller amounts (0.2–0.7%) compared to our study (1.6–7.5%).
