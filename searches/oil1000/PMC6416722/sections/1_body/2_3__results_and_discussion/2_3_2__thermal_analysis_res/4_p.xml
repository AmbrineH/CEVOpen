<p class="p">From the different plots, one can state that increasing the heating rate results in higher temperature, broader combustion ranges and increasing maximum mass loss rate. One can also see that the complete combustion starts around 550 °C in the different curves. Beyond this temperature and up to 950 °C, no additional weight loss is recorded. However, a supplementary mass loss of about 1% is recorded, notably for 5 °C/min. This loss is attributed to ash evaporation combined with calcination. Indeed, the sample holder crucible is almost empty at the end of the experiments.</p>
