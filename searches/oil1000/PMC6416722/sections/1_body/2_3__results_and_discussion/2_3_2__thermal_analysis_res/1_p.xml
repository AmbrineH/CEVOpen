<p class="p">The results of the thermal analysis of the thermal degradation of tomato waste in air, allowed us to follow the evolution at different heating rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00553-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The thermal degradation of tomato waste is composed of three stages: 
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">a small loss weight stage corresponding mainly to drying;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">a large weight loss phase in which volatiles matter departure is assumed;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">a final step of mass loss which tends to be constant (char oxidation and ash formation).</p>
