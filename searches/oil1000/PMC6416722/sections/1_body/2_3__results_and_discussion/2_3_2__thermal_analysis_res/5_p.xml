<p class="p">In general, the devolatilization temperature range and amplitude depend on the starting organic compound. The obtained results show that the combustion of Tunisian tomato waste occurs at temperatures lower than those found in literature. This behavior is very clear especially during the devolatilization phase and is explained by the difference in texture and climatic conditions of plantation. In addition, the temperature ranges and the intensity in which the combustion takes place depend on the nature of the waste to be degraded. For example, the degradation of volatiles occurs at low temperatures (135–325 °C) for sawdust, while that of present Tunisian tomato waste at high temperatures (225–650 °C) and from 470 to 800 °C in the work of Font et al.
