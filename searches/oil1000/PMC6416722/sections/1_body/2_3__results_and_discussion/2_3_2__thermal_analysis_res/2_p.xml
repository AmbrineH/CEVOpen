<p class="p">More precisely, in the beginning of the combustion process, the particle heats up and the moisture in the sample is removed [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. With the rise in temperature, pyrolysis takes place. A cloud of volatile matter is formed around the particle. This cloud may contain oxidizable materials [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The duration of this stage is generally very short (volatile matter contains a significant fraction of the heating value of the fuel). Once the volatiles are exhausted, the oxygen of the oxidizing gas (air) can then reach the surface of the solid residue [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The heterogeneous combustion phase then begins and lasts for a long time during the combustion process.
