<p class="p">The evolutions of the mass loss profiles are very similar and close to each other, regardless the heating rate. We observe a first mass loss of about 5 to 10% (related to the evaporation of the moisture) between room temperature and 100 째C, before the mass stabilizes. From 200 째C to 430 째C, we notice a large loss of mass, up to 85%. Afterward and until 950 째C, the mass loss is very slow and seems to stabilize. Ash residue of 5% of the initial mass is obtained at the end of all tests.</p>
