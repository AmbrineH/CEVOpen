<p class="p">Isoconversion methods were applied at four different heating rates (5, 10, 20 and 30 Â°C/min). Linear diagrams of KAS, FWO and Friedman are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00553-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Since the initial loss of mass is attributed to moisture loss, the first conversion rate selected to determine the kinetic parameters is 10% while the last point is taken at 85% for KAS and FWO and at 55% for Friedman. Above this value, no good correlation coefficient is obtained.
