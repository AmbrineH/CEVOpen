<p class="p">KAS and Friedman are very close while FWO is slightly off. The activation energy Ea calculated at different conversion rates can be attributed to the decomposition of macro-components contained in the tomato waste. At low conversion levels (10–30%), activation energies between 169.62 and 186.46 kJ/mol are probably related to hemicelluloses degradation. Activation energies continue to increase to 190.40–206.92 kJ/mol. These energies can be attributed to the cracking of cellulose and are close to values met in literature around 150–250 kJ/mol [
