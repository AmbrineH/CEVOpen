<p class="p">Since FWO method provided the best correlation coefficients, the corresponding results were adopted while using the first-order kinetic model for different heating rates (5, 10, 20 and 30 째C/min), Experimental and theoretical curves have almost the same profiles. A slight difference (4%) is noticed during the drying phase. This difference tends to cancel out in the active pyrolysis and oxidation phases at 10 and 30 째C/min but is still visible in the active pyrolysis and vanishes during the oxidation stage at 20 째C/min. This could be due to errors related to the uncertainties of the chosen models or to experimental errors. As for 5 째C/min heating rate, the curves obtained experimentally and numerically show a slight difference, not more than 4% during the drying step, but good agreement is recorded during the active pyrolysis phase. Beyond this phase, conversion rates are underestimated by the first-order model.</p>
