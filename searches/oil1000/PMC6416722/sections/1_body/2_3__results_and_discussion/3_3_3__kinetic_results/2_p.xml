The average activation energy values for tomato waste using the KAS, FWO and Friedman methods are, respectively, 231.21, 223.86 and 199.31 kJ/mol. The activation energy increases as the conversion rate increases until conversion rates of around 55% and 60% are achieved, recording maximum values of 494.96, 480,893 and 500.47 kJ/mol. Beyond these rates, there is a drop in activation energy values as the conversion rate increases until the end of the degradation process (
