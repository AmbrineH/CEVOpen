<p class="p">Heating effects on tomato waste result in mass loss and heat exchange. The evolution of mass loss can be followed by thermal analysis. In the present work, tests were conducted with Thermal Gravimetric Analysis coupled with a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TGA/DSC3) + (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) at different heating rates (5, 10, 20 and 30 °C/min) from room temperature to 950 °C. Each test was repeated at least three times.</p>
