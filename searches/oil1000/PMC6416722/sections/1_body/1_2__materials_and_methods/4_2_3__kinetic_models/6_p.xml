<p class="p">Kinetics can be determined in isothermal conditions (plot of X vs. t or dX/dt vs. t at constant temperature) or in non-isothermal conditions (plot X vs. T or dX/dt vs. T while gradually increasing the temperature). Three variants of this last method are usually used: Friedman, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) (
