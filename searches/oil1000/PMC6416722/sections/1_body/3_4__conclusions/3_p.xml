<p class="p">Finally, in an increasing competitive context for the Tunisian agricultural sector, where the circular economy has become a frontline issue, the combustion of tomato waste can be an advantage in the tomato processing industries. Besides, a better environmental management of tomato by-products requires a better understanding of the economics of these wastes processing for bio-fuel production and for resolving issues related to the capabilities of combustion in practical applications. In this vein, the results of this study would serve as support in the manufacture of reactors in the first place, and in facilities of higher production in a second place.</p>
