<p class="p">Based upon the total quantity and the HHV of the tomato waste, and assuming a total recovery, the energy recovered is around 16.3 kTOE (tons oil equivalent); that is around 6â€° of the deficit in the energy balance of Tunisia. However, this calculation is rough and very approximate. Indeed, the main failing is that the input is presented in the form of a lot of small quantities spread out over a large area (30 factories), making the aggregation challenging or uneconomic, even if these units are all located in the Cap-Bon region (North East) in Tunisia. In this case, the tomato waste may need to be processed with other wastes, as it was mentioned in our previous paper [
