<p class="p">The great quantities of generated tomato waste as well as the scarcity of works dealing with their thermochemical degradation were motives to carry out this work. The characterization of the tomato residues showed their suitability for combustion processes. Our results showed that the oxidation operation is a complex reaction involving several mechanisms. In order to offer a decision support to develop a recovery process in biofuel, biogas and bio char while meeting both environmental and economic requirements, combustion was run at different heating rates. Kinetic parameters could then be extracted and the kinetic model constructed. The fittings were good and the models validated by first-order or contracted sphere models according to the applied heating rate.</p>
