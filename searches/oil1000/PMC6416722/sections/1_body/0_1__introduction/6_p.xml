<p class="p">Just like most of the lignocellulosic materials [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], tomato residues are made of three major constituents, namely cellulose (28.8%), hemicelluloses (19.4%) and lignin (8.2%). Hemicelluloses content is close to that of grape marcs [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] whereas cellulose percentage is not far from that of olive cakes [
