<p class="p">Tomato waste constitutes 90% of fruit and vegetable canning waste with more than 35 thousand tons per year [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Seasonal discharges and centralized tomato waste from agri-food industries have negative effects on the environment due to high humidity (over 60%), low pH, high contents of phosphorus, potassium, organic and phenolic phytotoxic and antibacterial substances, which makes them resistant to biological degradation [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Despite the low cost, tomato waste-based fertilizers are declared not cost-effective [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Further available technologies of tomato waste valorization include pharmaceutical and cosmetic usage but the corresponding by-products meet the same first problematic. It is, therefore, essential to find alternative practices for better management [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-00553" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. According to a thorough literature review, management by thermochemical valorization was rarely addressed. In fact, the energy conversion of tomato waste thermochemically combines several processes based on the cracking of biomolecules under the effect of heat [
