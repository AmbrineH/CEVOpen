<p class="p">The elemental composition also made it possible to calculate the (H/C) and (O/C) ratios of a given hydrocarbon. These ratios ranged from 12.9 to 14.9% and from 37 to 78.6%, respectively, which confirms again the applicability of a thermal degradation process. However, low mineral content and mass densities limit direct use as a biofuel. This is why some researchers have opted for the preparation of pellets or pellets in order to densify these residues in order to optimize energy production. In fact, the contents of mineral salts such as nitrogen, potassium, chlorine, calcium and heavy metals such as iron and manganese are in small quantities in the various works. For sulfur, the quantities obtained are small in comparison with those found in conventional fossil fuels. This result is interesting from an environmental and technical point of view.</p>
