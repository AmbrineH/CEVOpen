<p class="p">Tomato (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) is a fleshy fruit, originally from northwestern South America, but is widely consumed in many countries, fresh or processed. According to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, world tomato production is steadily increasing from 64 Mtons in 1988 to more than 100 Mtons, with China being the worldâ€™s largest producer followed by the United States, Turkey, India, Egypt, Italy and Iran. More than 30% of these quantities are processed (dried, concentrated, frozen, etc.). This leads to the generation of a variety of by-products and wastes including pulp, skins and seeds, which account for 3% of the fresh tomato i.e., about 0.9 million tons. Moreover, as tomatoes are processed for long periods, the daily production of the residual rate is very high. Tunisia is ranked the eleventh producer, but it is the first world consumer of concentrated tomatoes. In fact, tomato cultivation in Tunisia covers an average area of 29,000 ha/year, with an average production of around 1.2 million tons. This production comes from field crops, i.e., seasonal and late tomatoes (mainly in the west, north west and north east) and crops grown under shelter, i.e., cold greenhouse, also called glasshouse (in the center of the country) and greenhouse heated by geothermal waters (exclusively in the eastern south). The varieties include Rio Grande, Durinta, Tylka, Abigaile, etc.
