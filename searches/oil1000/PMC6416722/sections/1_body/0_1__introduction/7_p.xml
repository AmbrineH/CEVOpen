<p class="p">Fatty acids are common in vegetable oils (grapes, corn, sunflower, etc.) and are predominant in tomato waste. The oil content is estimated to be between 19.5 and 25.7 %W/W db by Mangut et al. while Rossini et al., found that it was around 21% [

Unsaturated fat in olive seeds is mainly composed of monounsaturated fatty acids (C16 and C18 make up over 96% total fatty acids), while polyunsaturated fats are the major acids in grape seed oil. The oil extraction processes carried out on several samples of tomato seeds showed that the latter have a mass fraction of unsaturated fatty acids greater than 80%, in particular linoleic acid (C18).
