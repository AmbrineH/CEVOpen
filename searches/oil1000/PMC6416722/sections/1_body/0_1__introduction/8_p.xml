<p class="p">Gonzalez et al. have pelletized tomato waste to optimize the fuel feed of a 11.6 kW mural boiler for domestic heating. For 92.4% boiler efficiency, the optimum mixture was 75% of tomato residues and 25% of forest wastes [

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The initial small endothermic peak was attributed to the evaporation of the humidity while the subsequent three small exothermic peaks were due to oxidative pyrolysis. The significant exothermic process and the two final small fractions observed in the last part of the decomposition were due to the combustion of char or carbonaceous residue [
