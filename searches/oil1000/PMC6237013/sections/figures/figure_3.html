 <p> a Biomass yield and composition and b sugar and nitrogen concentration in spent media produced from the validation experiment. Fermentations conducted at optimal conditions (pH 4.5, 33.6 °C) for 7 days. Oil and protein content expressed as %, w/w DB, where w/w DB is the mass of the component (oil or protein)/mass of dry biomass. Values sharing the same letters are not statistically different at p &lt; 0.05 </p>
