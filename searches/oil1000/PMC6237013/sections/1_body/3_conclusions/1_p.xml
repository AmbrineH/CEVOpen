 <italic class="italic">Mucor circinelloides</italic> produced oil when grown on cheese HWP. Response surface methodology was useful to determine the optimum pH and temperature, within the range evaluated, for increased biomass yield and oil accumulation. Similar to other oleaginous species, biomass yield and lipid accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> was triggered by high temperature, while a low pH (4.5) helped decrease microbial competition during fermentation. Maximum biomass yield of 9.4 g/L and lipid content of 24% were achieved at optimal condition of 33.6 °C and pH 4.5 during 168 h of fermentation. Oleic and palmitic FAs were predominant in the lipid fraction, suggesting the possible use of 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> oil as food or as a feedstock for biodiesel production. In addition, the relatively high content of γ-linolenic acid might enable the use of this oil for nutraceutical applications. This study demonstrated that the use of 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor circinelloides</italic> is a viable approach to convert the high organic load in HWP into value-added compounds such as oil. This signifies a starting point for further studies aimed at assessing the development of a fully functioning fungi-to-food/fuel system on an industrial scale for several agricultural streams.
