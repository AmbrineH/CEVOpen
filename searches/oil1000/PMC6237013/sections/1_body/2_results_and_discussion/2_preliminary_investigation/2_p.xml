 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, biomass yield is favored by lower pH values and longer fermentation times, with maximum biomass yield achieved at pH 4.5 and a fermentation time of 90 h. These results demonstrated that a low pH was optimal for biomass production from pasteurized HWP, likely due to reduced bacterial competition during fermentation [
