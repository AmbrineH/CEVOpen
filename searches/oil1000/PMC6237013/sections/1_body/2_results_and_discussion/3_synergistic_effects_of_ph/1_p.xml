Although autoclaving effectively eliminates most microbes, it is an energy intensive and costly process considering the high production volume of agricultural streams that can be used as cultivation mediums. Therefore, using alternative sterilization methods such as high temperature short time pasteurization (HTST) may be more economic and energy efficient.
