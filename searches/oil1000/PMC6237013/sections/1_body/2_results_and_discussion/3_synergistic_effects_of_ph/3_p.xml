<p id="Par52" class="p">To corroborate those findings, the viable cell counts of the pasteurized spent media (post-fermentation) at pH 4.5 and 6.5 were determined. Total bacteria counts were higher at pH 6.5 (5.8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) than that of pH 4.5 (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">1</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>), demonstrating that the use of low pH inhibits bacterial growth, thus favoring fungal biomass accumulation. Consequently, the use of low pH may enable the replacement of sterilization of the medium with pasteurization, a well-established unit operation in the dairy industry. Limited studies have investigated the fungal conversion of food by-products under non-aseptic conditions. Specifically, Moustogianni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] achieved suppressed bacterial contamination of non-aseptic oleaginous Zygomycetes cultures using a combination of low pH (4.0) and antibacterial agents such as essential oils. Tchakouteu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] reached similar results in oleaginous yeast cultures using pasteurized media with the addition of NaCl. However, our study provides a novel method of non-aseptic fermentation that omits the cost of additional media supplementation (e.g. antibacterial agents). In this case, the use of pH 4.5, in conjunction with pasteurization, not only reduced bacterial counts in the culture, but also resulted in a cell growth of
