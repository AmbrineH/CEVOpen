<p id="Par51" class="p">To evaluate the potential of replacing autoclaving with HTST pasteurization in such protocols, we compared the fermentation results obtained with pasteurization (72 °C, 15 s) to those obtained with sterilization (121 °C, 20 min) using pH (4.5 and 6.5). According to the preliminary assessment of the effect of pH on biomass yield, fermentation of pasteurized HWP at pH 4.5 resulted in increased fungal biomass yield (6.5 g/L) compared to that of pH 6.5 (3.0 g/L). Using autoclaved HWP, fermentations conducted at pH 4.5 and 6.5 both resulted in a fungal biomass yield of 6.3 g/L. Consequently, the biomass yield obtained from low pH and pasteurization (6.5 g/L) was comparable to those obtained under aseptic conditions (6.3 g/L). These results indicated that the use of low pH (4.5) combined with standard HTST pasteurization (72 °C, 15 s) might reduce bacterial growth in the medium, as evidenced by the increased capacity of
