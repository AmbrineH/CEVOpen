<p id="Par61" class="p">Maximum biomass production of 9.37 g/L was observed at approximately 80 h, after which the biomass yield did not significantly change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Simple sugars (glucose, galactose) in the culture media were incorporated by 72–96 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Glucose was consumed preferentially by 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>, with full fermentation of glucose accomplished within 72 h. However, the simultaneous assimilation of both sugars occurred, suggesting the absence of diauxic growth of the fungus. This occurrence is further illustrated by the biomass growth curve that continued without visible disturbance. Similarly, Lübbehüsen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] reported that 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> was able to switch rapidly from one sugar to another when cultivated in a mixture of glucose and xylose. Consequently, 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> may have the capacity to readily adapt to a new carbon source. Moreover, the nitrogen in HWP was quickly exhausted within 24 h, corresponding to the cells leaving exponential phase (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S2). The observed increase in biomass yield after exponential phase in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> may be due to the cells accumulating oil as a secondary metabolite, rather than an increase in cell number. This is corroborated by the calculated lipid-free biomass (∆X − ∆P), which increases to a much lesser extent during this stage of fermentation (data not shown). Likewise, Meeuwse et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] found that the lipid-free biomass yield of 
 <italic class="italic">Motierella isabellina</italic> remained relatively constant after exponential phase. Nitrogen depletion, combined with excess sugar supply, most likely shifted fungal metabolic activities from rapid cell growth toward de novo lipid accumulation. The total biomass yield in our study plateaued after sugar exhaustion at 72–96 h, while the lipid content of the fungal cells increased to 24%. This trend is supported by the specific lipid yield coefficient (Y
 <sub class="sub">P/X</sub>), which shows that the lipid amount in the biomass continued to increase throughout the fermentation, despite the biomass yield becoming stationary. The underlying mechanisms of nitrogen depletion in a fermentation medium leading to FA accumulation has been suggested for

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] discovered six isoforms of malic enzyme (ME) in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>, with only isoform IV appearing under nitrogen starvation conditions to provide NADPH for lipid accumulation. A study conducted by Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] further found that overexpression of the gene encoding ME isoforms III/IV in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> led to a 2.5-fold increase in total lipid content. Consequently, nitrogen depletion in HWP may have triggered enzymatic changes to induce lipid biosynthesis under non-growth conditions, leading to an observed increase in oil content [
