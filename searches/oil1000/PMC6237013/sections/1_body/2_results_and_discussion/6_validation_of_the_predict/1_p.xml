<p id="Par60" class="p">To validate the predictive model for biomass yield and oil content, the best processing conditions identified in the experimental design were conducted in triplicate. Fermentations were carried out at 33.6 °C and pH 4.5. Since pH within the values of 3.6–4.7 was shown to not be a significant variable, the pH value of 4.5 was selected because it favors efficient lactose hydrolysis prior to fermentation. Sugar and nitrogen concentration of the spent media were measured to better understand substrate utilization and its impact on biomass yield and composition, as seen in Fig.
