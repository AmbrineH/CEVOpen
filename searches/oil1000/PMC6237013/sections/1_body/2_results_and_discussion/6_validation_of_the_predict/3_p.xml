<p id="Par62" class="p">According to Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, the lipid yield increased from 0.52 to 2.20 g/L with fermentation time, while the biomass yield coefficient, Y
 <sub class="sub">X/S</sub>, remained constant at approximately 0.18 g/g after 72 h, which coincides with almost complete sugar depletion. At around 168 h of fermentation, the highest lipid yield (2.20 ± 0.25 g/L) was observed, which corresponds to a lipid content of 24% in dry biomass. This suggests that prolonged nutrient-starvation conditions resulted in a statistically significant higher lipid accumulation in the strain used in our study. Interestingly, reserve lipid turnover was not observed after transition from carbon excess to carbon starvation conditions. Papanikolaou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] found that reserve lipid in 
 <italic class="italic">Cunninghamella echinulata</italic> was not degraded after glucose exhaustion, suggesting that reserve lipid turnover in oleaginous fungi could be repressed in multiple-limited media. Thus, the absence of lipid turnover might be related to the lack of sufficient concentrations of several nutrients in HWP (e.g. vitamins, trace minerals or metalloids) that are essential for functioning the biochemical mechanisms involved in the mobilization of reserve lipid. For example, lipases need metallic co-factors for activation while magnesium is crucial for the action of isocitrate lyase, an enzyme involved in FA degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Additionally, several strains of oleaginous yeast such as 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus curvatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> have been found to accumulate intracellular polysaccharides in nitrogen-excess conditions, which may be degraded in the late fermentation stages in favor of storage lipids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The utilization of storage polysaccharides under nutrient starvation conditions may further explain the increasing accumulation of lipids in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> biomass in our study despite sugar depletion occurring in HWP.
