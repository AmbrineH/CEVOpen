<p id="Par63" class="p">The lipid yield achieved in this study (1.36 g/L) at 72 h was similar to findings observed from the fermentation of

 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> has been extensively studied for its oil accumulation, its lipid production in our study is reduced compared with other recently studied fungal strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. This may be due to the lack of supplementation of the HWP, causing the fermentation to start with a lower quantity of nutrients. Although enhancement of lipid production may be observed by adding an external carbon source or microelements, the addition of nutrients for microbial fermentations is associated with higher processing costs [
