<p id="Par64" class="p">It is also important to note that a decrease in the protein content is paralleled by an increase in oil content during fungal growth and stationary phase. The oil content in dry biomass reached a maximum of 24%, while protein reached a minimum of 20.22%. For oleaginous microorganisms, it has been reported that the lack of nitrogen limits the capacity to synthesize proteins and nucleic acids necessary for biomass production [

 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> may have taken advantage of alternative metabolic pathways for inorganic carbon fixation such as FA synthesis, and hence, store those de novo FAs as TAG. Consequently, nitrogen starvation within 30Â h may have imposed a reduction in cellular protein content and inhibited the growth rate.
