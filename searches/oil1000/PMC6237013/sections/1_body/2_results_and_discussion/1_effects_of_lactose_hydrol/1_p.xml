<p id="Par47" class="p">The effects of different types of sugars on the biomass yield were investigated by hydrolyzing lactose into glucose and galactose prior to the fermentation step. Sugar utilization was assessed at the level of biomass produced after 72 h of cultivation. Biomass yields of 2.5 and 7.9 g/L were observed for WP and HWP, respectively. The higher biomass yield observed for HWP (~ 3.2 times than that of WP) was coupled with an increased consumption of sugar (9 vs. 86%) when using HWP (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). These results demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> ferments glucose and galactose more efficiently than lactose, with increased biomass yield resulting from monosaccharide utilization. Indeed, Botha et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] reported that 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> could not efficiently utilize disaccharides containing a D-galactopyranosyl or a D-fructofuranosyl moiety. This is likely a consequence of the low expression or activity of enzymes in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> strain required to hydrolyze disaccharides such as lactose for effective growth. 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> has been found to contain extracellular β-glucosidases, which not only have the ability to convert cellobiose to glucose, but also hydrolyze the β-glucosidic linkages in lactose. However, the enzyme most likely has a low substrate specificity for lactose since β-glucosidase in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> was shown to be part of an enzymatic system mainly responsible for cellulose hydrolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Our results are in agreement with other studies that observed a low biomass yield when 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> was grown on lactose (1.6 g/L of biomass) as a carbon source compared to that of glucose or galactose (7.0 and 5.3 g/L of biomass) [
