<p id="Par68" class="p">The FA composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> lipid grown in HWP was comparable to that of other oils produced from zygomycetes fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Carvalho et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] conducted a comparison of microbial oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> and palm oil commonly used for biofuel, showing that both oils have similar oleic acid content (39%) and monounsaturated FA composition. In particular, palmitic acid (C16:0), and oleic acid (C18:1), which are the predominant FAs observed in our oil, are potential targets of interest due to their oxidative stability and potential adaptability in the industrial production of biodiesel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. The total lipids from 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> oil measured in our study were saponifiable lipids and FFAs, which can be easily converted to FAMEs for high quality biodiesel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Additionally, the oil in our study contained an adequate amount of γ-linolenic acid (10%), which is an omega-6 FA found mostly in plant-based oils and can be used to supplement dietary intakes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. The total amount of GLA synthesized at 96, 144 and 168 h of fermentation was approximately 53.4, 73.4 and 69.4 mg/L, respectively. The GLA concentration in our strain is lower than that of other 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> strains investigated in the literature, which were cultivated in vegetable oils and vitamin enriched mediums as opposed to simple sugars [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. Additionally, several strains of Mucor spp., such as 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor rouxii</italic> were found to increase GLA concentration during cellular oil degradation. According to Aggelis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>] and Kavadia et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], the reserve lipid may be degraded to produce fat-free biomass and provide the growing mycelial membrane with the necessary amount of GLA. If lipid degradation was achieved in our study within the fermentation time tested, a higher GLA concentration may have been produced. Overall, the lipid composition suggests that the lipids are potentially suitable for second generation biodiesel production.
