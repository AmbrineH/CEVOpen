<p id="Par66" class="p">According to Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, the majority of FAs were esterified into TAG molecules, which is similar to the lipid profile of most oleaginous fungi. Fungi store a large proportion of their energy carbon as neutral lipids, thus the amount of neutral lipids is usually higher than that of PLs for membrane constituents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. Likewise, Fakas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] reported TAG to be the major constituent of the lipid extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. echinulata</italic> cultivated on tomato waste hydrolysate, accounting for 90% of the total lipid, while FFAs and sterols were present in lower quantities. It was observed in our study that the percentage of lipid distributed into TAGs increased during fermentation time. It was also accompanied by a significant decrease in FFA at 144 and 168 h compared to that of 96 h, possibly due to the assimilation of FFA into the TAG-synthesis pathway over time. However, there seemed to be no significant differences in fermentation times for the amount of CE and PLs in the oil.
