<p id="Par65" class="p">The biomass lipid was extracted from dry biomass harvested at 96, 144 and 168 h. Lipid classes in the corresponding samples were separated by thin layer chromatography and FA profiles were determined by gas chromatography. The lipid distribution of TAG, PL, CE and FFA, expressed as a percentage of the summed total, are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. It should be noted that the summed total of FAs derived from TAGs, CEs, PLs and FFAs extracted by the Folch method was less than the total measured by direct acid transesterification (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2). This is expected since acid hydrolysis can degrade the fungal cell wall structures and transesterify TAGs and other lipids. However, the Folch solvent does not degrade the cell wall, which is why lipid accessibility and extraction is limited.
