<p id="Par56" class="p">According to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>., the 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> biomass contained a higher protein content than that of oil within the fermentation time evaluated (48–72 h), which is in agreement with several studies using filamentous fungi. Satari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] found that 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor indicus</italic> produced a biomass containing 40% protein and only 10% oil under optimal conditions in corn waste free sugars. Similarly, the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus oligosporus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Neurospora intermedia</italic> in thin stillage resulted in a biomass containing 43 and 50% crude protein and 20 and 12% oil, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. However, our results also demonstrated a small reduction in the biomass protein content at higher fermentation temperatures (≥ 32 °C). An average protein content of 23% was observed in experiments #3, 4, and 8 at 72 h compared to that of the runs conducted at ≤24 °C (~ 26%). These results suggest that while higher temperatures seem to improve lipid accumulation, it is at the expense of protein.
