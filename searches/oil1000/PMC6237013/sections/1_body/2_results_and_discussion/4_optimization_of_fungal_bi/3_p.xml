<p id="Par55" class="p">The maximum biomass yield (7.6 g/L) and oil content (18%) was observed at 72 h at 33.6 °C. Our results are in agreement with the literature, where small increments in cultivation temperatures within a certain range resulted in increased biomass yield and lipid content. Xia et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] reported an optimal growth range between 24 and 30 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> grown in glucose-containing media, with the total lipid content significantly increasing from about 10 to over 22% when the temperature reached 35 °C. Likewise, the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">Mortierella ramanniana</italic> at 30 °C led to higher lipid accumulation compared to that of lower cultivation temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. These results indicate that high temperature facilitates lipid accumulation, independent of nitrogen depletion. Similarly, the 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> oil content reported herein increased when exposed to high temperature, implying that temperature may serve to induce lipid synthesis. In some cases of extreme temperatures, stress conditions can inhibit cell growth and redirect the available nutrient for lipid accumulation, therefore leading to a decreased biomass yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, our results show that an increase in oil content was also paralleled with an increase in biomass yield. This suggests that the temperature range evaluated in our study (22.4–33.6 °C) did not include extreme temperatures that could lead to the suppression of cell growth.
