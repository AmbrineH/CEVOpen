<p id="Par53" class="p">Temperature and pH are two important reaction parameters affecting fungal growth and biomass composition. Because fungal biomass growth was shown to be favored by a lower pH, the simultaneous interaction of temperature and a narrower pH range (3.6 to 4.7) was evaluated using a central composite rotatable design. In order to identify possible improvements in the fermentation rate during the experimental design, shorter fermentation times (48 and 72Â h) were evaluated for each experimental condition, with total biomass and supernatant collected at both time points.</p>
