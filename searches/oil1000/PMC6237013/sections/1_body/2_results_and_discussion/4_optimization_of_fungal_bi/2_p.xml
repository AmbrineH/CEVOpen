 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">d</xref>, respectively. As observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, higher biomass yields (6.8–7.6 g/L) were observed at experimental conditions where temperatures above 28 °C were used (experiment #3, 4, and 8). However, the acidic pH range (3.6–4.7) used had a less pronounced effect on biomass yield, indicating that the pH values evaluated were already within the optimum range explored in the preliminary optimization. Biomass yield increments ranging from 6.89 to 17.17% were observed by increasing the fermentation time from 48 to 72 h. Experiments #3, 4, and 8 were subsequently correlated with higher sugar consumption in the spent media (73–84%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). This demonstrates that this fungal strain consumes sugars at a faster rate at temperatures above 28 °C, evidencing the effect of temperature on fungal metabolism and growth. However, full consumption of sugars was not achieved at the longest fermentation time (72 h), indicating that fungal growth was not yet completed. Likewise, oil content in the biomass was also favored by longer fermentation times and higher temperatures. By increasing the fermentation time from 48 to 72 h, the oil content had a percent increase ranging from 4.13 to 22.08%. Highest intracellular oil contents (15.8–18%) were observed for experiments 3, 4, and 8, where higher temperature values were used (Fig.
