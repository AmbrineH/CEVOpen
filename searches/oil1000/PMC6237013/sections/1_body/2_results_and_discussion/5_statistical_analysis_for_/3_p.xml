<p id="Par59" class="p">The independent variable pH was not statistically significant in the range evaluated (3.6–4.7) and therefore was not included in the models. According to the estimated regression models, optimum condition for increased biomass yield, higher oil content and sugar consumption can be achieved at temperature of 33.6 °C (+ 1.41). The regression models demonstrate a positive linear relationship with temperature. Under the optimum temperature, within the conditions tested, the values for biomass yield, lipid accumulation and sugar consumption were 7.63 g/L, 18.09 and 83.37%, respectively, which were close to the predicted responses of 7.9 g/L, 17.44% and 83.45%, indicating the applicability of the proposed model. A decrease in sugar concentration in HWP during fermentation suggests effective substrate uptake for better fungal growth and/or oil accumulation, as seen in previous reports [
