<p id="Par57" class="p">Since pH values were already within the optimized range revealed from the preliminary tests, temperature was shown to be the only parameter having a statistically significant effect on biomass yield and intracellular oil. Because higher biomass yields and oil contents were obtained at 72 h, only the estimated regression models for biomass yield (g/L), oil and protein contents (%) at 72 h are shown in Table
