<p id="Par58" class="p">The optimal level for each independent variable evaluated was determined by multiple regression analysis of the experimental data. Only parameters significant at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were used in the regression models. The regression equation of second order shows the dependence of the biomass yield to temperature at 72 h, where X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the independent variable temperature. The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the predictive model for biomass yield at 72 h was 0.82. This indicates that the regression model was able to explain 82% of the total variation between the observed and predicted values with the remaining 18% being attributed to the residual values. According to the estimated regression model, biomass yield increases when the temperature value increases from − 1.41 to + 1.41 (22.4–33.6 °C), for any of the pH levels tested. Similarly, oil and protein contents showed a dependence on temperature. The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the predictive models for biomass oil and protein content were 87.1 and 77.8%, respectively, indicating that 12.8 and 22.2% of the total variations were not explained by the model, thus being attributed to the residual values.
