<p id="Par27" class="p">Bovine whey was kindly provided by Hilmar Cheese Company, Inc. (Hilmar Inc., CA, USA). To assess the ability of the fungus to utilize different sugar sources (lactose, glucose, galactose), lactose was hydrolyzed prior to the fungal cultivation. A food grade fungal lactase (Bio-Cat Inc., Troy, Virginia, USA) derived from the fungus

Immediately following lactose hydrolysis, whey proteins were removed by ultrafiltration using a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane (Synder Filtration, Vacaville, CA, USA) to produce hydrolyzed whey permeate (HWP). After ultrafiltration, samples were pasteurized using a continuous UHT/HTST lab pasteurizer (MicroThermics, Raleigh, NC, USA) at 72 °C for 15 s and stored at − 20 °C until used. The HWP contained 6.3% solids, 0.26% protein, and 23.99, 21.63, and 0.11 g/L of glucose, galactose, and lactose, respectively.
