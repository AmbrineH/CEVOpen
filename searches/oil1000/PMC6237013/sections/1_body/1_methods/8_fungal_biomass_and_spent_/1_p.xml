<p id="Par43" class="p">Monosaccharide composition (glucose and galactose) of the spent media was determined by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD ICS-5000+; Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Calibration curves (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &gt; 0.999) were prepared with glucose and galactose for simple sugar determination. WP and HWP samples were diluted 10 to 1000 times and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. For monosaccharide analysis, a 25-uL aliquot was injected into a Carbo-Pac PA10 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) column at 1.2 mL/min flow rate as described previously [

The nitrogen in the spent media and biomass was quantified using the Dumas combustion method (AOAC 990.03) (vario Max cube; Elementar Americas Inc., Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). A nitrogen conversion factor of 6.25 was used to determine the crude protein content [
