<p id="Par40" class="p">The results of this preliminary evaluation were used as the basis for another optimization study (CCRD with 2 variables, 3 central points and 4 axial points) where a narrower pH range from 3.60 to 4.7 and temperature values from 22.4 to 33.6 °C were evaluated at 48 and 72 h of fermentation regarding biomass yield and composition. The total number of experiments followed the equation 2
 <sup class="sup">k</sup> + 2 k + n
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>, where k is the number of independent variables (2) and n
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> is the number of repetitions in the central point (3). Cultivation temperature and pH, the independent variables, were evaluated according to the following coded levels: - α, − 1, 0, + 1, + α. Coded and uncoded levels and their corresponding independent variables are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The dependent variables (e.g., evaluated responses) were fungal biomass yield (g of dry biomass/ L), biomass oil content (%, weight of dry biomass) and protein content (%, weight of dry biomass). Data were analyzed by the Protimiza Experiment Design Software (
