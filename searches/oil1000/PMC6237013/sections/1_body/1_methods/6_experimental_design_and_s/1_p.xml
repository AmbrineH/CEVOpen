<p id="Par39" class="p">Factorial designs and response surface methodologies were used to investigate the optimal cultivation parameters affecting fungal biomass growth and oil accumulation. The simultaneous analysis of multiple variables using factorial designs has been shown to increase the accuracy of the results while reducing the overall number of experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. After the identification of the upstream unit operations needed (enzymatic reactions and heat treatments) to favor fungal growth, a preliminary optimization study using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) (2
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, plus 3 central points and 4 axial points) was conducted to identify the individual and combined effects of pH (4.7–6.8) and fermentation time (19.8–90.3 h) on the biomass yield. Fermentations were performed at 34 °C, an intermediate value in the 20–40 °C temperature range commonly accepted to favor the growth of most filamentous fungi [
