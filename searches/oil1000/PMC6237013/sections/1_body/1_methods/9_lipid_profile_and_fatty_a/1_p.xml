<p id="Par44" class="p">To determine total FA concentrations, 20 mg of dry biomass was directly transesterified in methanolic HCl. Samples were mixed with 0.40 mL of toluene spiked with triheptadecanoic acid as an internal standard. Three mL of 100% methanol and 0.60 mL HCl:methanol (8:92 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/v) were added in this order and vortexed vigorously. The sample was then incubated at 90 °C for 60 min for derivatization. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL of hexane and 1 mL of water were added for the extraction of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and then vortexed. The hexane layer was separated and added to a new centrifuge tube containing 45 mL water. After centrifugation, the top hexane layer containing FAMEs was transferred to a new tube, dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.10 mL hexanes for GC analysis.
