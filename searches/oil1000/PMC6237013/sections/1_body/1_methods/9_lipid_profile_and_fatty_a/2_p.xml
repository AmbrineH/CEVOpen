<p id="Par45" class="p">To determine the FA composition of the different lipid classes, the lipid fraction of the fungal biomass was first extracted by the Folch extraction method for lipid class analysis. Dry biomass (~ 20 mg) was first sonicated in 3 mL chloroform for 1 min on ice, followed by additional sonication in 2.50 mL chloroform/methanol (2:1, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/v) and resuspension in 4.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline. The solvent phase was separated from the biomass by centrifugation (20 min), dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.2 mL chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipid classes were separated using thin layer chromatography. Briefly, 0.1 mL of the extract spiked with free fatty acid (FFA) internal standard (17:0) was loaded on a silica plate pre-washed with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The plate was placed in a tank containing heptane/ethyl ether/ acetic acid (60:40:3, v/v/v). The migration was stopped once the solvent front reached 1–2 cm below the top of the plate. The bands were revealed under UV after spraying the plate with a solution of 0.02% 2′,7′-dichlorofluoroscein in methanol and scraped into new tubes. Fractions containing TAGs, cholesterol esters (CEs) and phospholipids (PLs) were spiked with esterified internal standard (triheptadecanoic acid for TAG and CE; di − 17:0 phosphatidycholine for PL). All fractions were transesterified in methanolic HCl as described above for total FA analysis.
