<p id="Par46" class="p">FAMEs were analyzed on a GC Clarus 500 (Perkin Elmer) equipped with a DB-FFAP column (30 m length, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 um film thickness; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 240 and 300 °C, respectively. For each run, the oven temperature was held at 80 °C for 2 min, increased to 180 °C at 10 °C /min, increased to 240 °C at 5 °C /min and held at 240 °C for 13 min. A custom mix of FAME standards was used to identify the different FAs based on their characteristic retention time.</p>
