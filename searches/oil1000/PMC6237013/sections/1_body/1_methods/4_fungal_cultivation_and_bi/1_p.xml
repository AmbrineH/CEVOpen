<p id="Par30" class="p">Fungal cultivation was performed by aseptically transferring 5 mL of the preculture into 100 mL HWP in 250 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks. Samples were incubated in the rotary shaker according to the processing conditions described in the experimental design at constant stirring of 200 rpm. After fungal cultivation, the fungal biomass was harvested from the spent media using a simple mesh screen with 1 mm openings. Total dry weight of fungal biomass was determined by drying the wet biomass to constant weight in a vacuum oven (Jeio Tech, Model OV-11/12, Billerica, MA, USA) at 60 °C. Biomass was analyzed for oil and protein content, while the spent medium was analyzed for sugar and nitrogen content.</p>
