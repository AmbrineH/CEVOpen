<p id="Par41" class="p">In order to determine the accuracy of the predictive model, a set of shake-flask experiments were performed under the predicted optimal conditions (pH and temperature) at several time points. The validation experiments were conducted in 250 mL Erlyenmyer flasks containing 100 mL aliquots of the HWP. The model validation allowed for further evaluation of the growth kinetics under conditions at which biomass yield and oil content were optimal. All time points were carried out in triplicate and the results are shown as the mean ± one standard deviation.</p>
