<p id="Par28" class="p">pH and thermal treatments determine the growth and survival of most bacteria; therefore, microbiological analyses of the fermented pasteurized HWP at pH 4.5 and 6 were performed by the plate count agar method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Samples were added to the agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) and incubated at 34 °C for 1 day, after which the viable cell count was determined and expressed as colony-forming units per milliliter. All growth experiments were performed in triplicate. HWP was pasteurized as described above or sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min (Model 69,150, Tuttnauer, Hauppauge, NY, USA) to compare the efficiency of both heat treatments to inactivate microorganisms.
