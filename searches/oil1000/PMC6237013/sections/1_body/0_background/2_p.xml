<p id="Par24" class="p">Recently, oleaginous microorganisms, such as microalgae, yeast, and filamentous fungi, have been identified as efficient tools in converting agricultural waste streams into valuable food, feed and fuel ingredients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. These oleaginous microorganisms can accumulate over 20% of their biomass as lipids. Their fast growth potential and high lipid productivity make them a viable choice for the conversion of many nutrient-rich streams into added-value compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thus far, industrial adoption has typically been hindered by economically infeasible separation costs of the oleaginous cells from the media [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Hence, the use of filamentous fungi, which can grow into pellets or agglomerates that are easily dewatered by simple screening strategies, becomes attractive when compared with other oil-producing microorganisms such as algae and yeasts. The possibility of avoiding the use of high-energy separation techniques such as centrifugation can potentially reduce downstream processing costs, thus improving the economic feasibility of fungal biomass derived products. As an example, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus microsporus</italic> has been successfully cultivated on thin stillage, a by-product from the ethanol fermentation, from lab- to pilot-scale (1300 L) producing a biomass with high oil content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. In addition to being a source of oil, fungal biomasses can also be a source of crude protein containing several essential amino acids.
