<p id="Par23" class="p">The increasing production and concomitant underutilization of industrial waste streams and food coproducts is a growing threat to the environmental and financial sustainability of the food industry. The dairy industry not only consumes a large volume of water, but also produces a high amount of effluent per unit of production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Cheese whey, a major coproduct from cheese making, is primarily used to produce whey protein concentrates. However, the production of whey protein concentrates by ultrafiltration generates another stream, known as whey permeate (WP), which is composed of minerals (6–20%), proteins (0.5–3%), a high content of lactose (70–90%), and a small amounts of lipids (&lt; 2%) on a dry weight basis. Current utilization practices of WP include land spreading, incorporation into animal feed, lactose crystallization or selling as dry permeate powder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. As with many other agricultural streams, WP has a high biological oxygen demand of 40,000–48,000 mg/L and chemical oxygen demand of (COD) of 80,000–95,000 mg/L [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Therefore, WP cannot be disposed of in the environment without previous pretreatments to reduce its BOD and COD, representing costs for the processors. Consequently, alternative strategies for the cost-effective use of WP are needed for the dairy industry to decrease economic losses and environmental pollution.
