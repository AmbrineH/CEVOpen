<p id="Par26" class="p">Optimized processing conditions enable tailoring the fungal biomass yield and composition for specific agricultural streams or food coproducts. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to optimize the use of a filamentous fungus (
 <italic class="italic">Mucor circinelloides</italic>) to convert the organic matter present in WP into an oil- and protein-rich biomass that can be further converted into value-added nutraceuticals, food, and fuel. The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate the effects of upstream lactose hydrolysis on sugar utilization and fungal growth; 2) determine the effects of heat treatments (pasteurization and sterilization) and cultivation pH on biomass yield and 3) simultaneously optimize processing conditions for increased biomass yield and lipid accumulation. A central composite rotatable design totaling 11 experimental conditions was used to identify the ideal combination of pH and temperature to improve biomass yield and composition. The fungal biomass was further characterized for protein, lipid content and composition to better identify potential industrial applications (e.g., food, feed, and fuel).
