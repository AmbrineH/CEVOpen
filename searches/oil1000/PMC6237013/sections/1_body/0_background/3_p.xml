<p id="Par25" class="p">Nitrogen limitation resulting from a high carbon to nitrogen ratio can stimulate lipid accumulation when using filamentous fungi. When cells run out of a key nutrient, such as nitrogen, excess carbon substrate continues to be assimilated by the cells for lipid synthesis and oil droplets containing triacylglycerides (TAG) are formed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. The TAG fraction of most filamentous fungal oils is similar to that of conventional plant oils, indicating its potential use as a favorable oil feedstock for the food and fuel industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. The biotechnology industry has also focused on the ability of oleaginous fungi to convert agricultural waste streams and residues into specialty lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) of nutraceutical and pharmaceutical importance, such as Î³-linolenic acid [
