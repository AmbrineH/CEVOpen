 <p class="p">Sea fennel (
  <italic class="italic">Crithmum maritimum</italic> L.), a perennial halophyte typical of coastal habits, is well known for several food and non-food uses. This review presents both the characteristics and ethnobotany as well as the findings, technical advances and potential of sea fennel research with the aim to improve and disseminate knowledge regarding the value and potentials of this halophyte. Current knowledge suggest that sea fennel shows good potential as an emerging crop, being a refined food and also an interesting source of human health compounds and crop protection products. Moreover, sea fennel may be proposed as an alternative and sustainable cash crop also in the context of a saline agriculture regime. On the other hand, some aspects of sea fennel require further understanding; therefore, new research and development activities should be carried out before full commercial exploitation.
