 <xref rid="B13-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. By varying the salinity level during the vegetative stage, different eco-physiological responses can be observed. For example, Ben Hamed et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported that plant growth was higher by using a nutrient solution with 50 mM NaCl as compared to a nutrient solution with 300 mM NaCl; in either case, no toxicity symptoms were reported. With a high salinity level, the antioxidant system activity was reduced [
