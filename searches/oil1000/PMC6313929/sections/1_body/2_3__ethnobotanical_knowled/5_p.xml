<p class="p">With the aim to promote full exploitation of sea fennel, Renna et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] proposed a new dehydrated sea fennel-based product by using several treatments such as air-drying, freeze-drying as well as microwave-drying or microwave-assisted air-drying. These Authors reported that all these treatments enabled a desirable water activity but with a significant reduction of essential oils and chlorophylls content. Both microwave-drying and freeze-drying premised to preserve colour parameters better than other treatments, while freeze-drying enabled the best colouring power [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Moreover, after the sensory analysis, the best scores were observed for microwave-dried, microwave-assisted air-dried and freeze-dried samples. In conclusion, results of this study suggest that both microwave-drying and freeze-drying are optimal for preserving qualitative traits of dried sea fennel for food use [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Finally, this study highlights the fact that dried sea fennel has impressive aromatic traits as well as an interesting colouring power similar to other food plant-derived colorants [
