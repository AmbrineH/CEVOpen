<p class="p">Current knowledge suggests sea fennel shows good potential as an emerging crop, being a refined food and also an interesting source of human health compounds and crop protection products. Moreover, sea fennel may be an alternative for both horticultural and industrial crops when in the presence of low quality soils and/or availability of irrigation water with high electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, more knowledge is needed before any large-scale diffusion, including chemical composition depending on the geographical origin as well as the effect of commercial cultivation on yield and quality. Therefore, new research and development activities should be carried out in order to increase consumer and farmer acceptance of this species as a new functional food and/or alternative crop.</p>
