<p class="p">Finally, another important aspect to highlight is the fact that sea fennel extract was proven to be highly sensitive to extraction techniques and extraction conditions. In a study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two extraction techniques from

The amount of total extract, contents of total phenolics and flavonoids and antioxidant capacity of the extracts were measured. The authors reported that by using UAE the amount of extracted antioxidants was approximately 10-fold higher compared to SFE. In particular, UAE was able to obtain the highest content of total phenols (23.44 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent g DW
