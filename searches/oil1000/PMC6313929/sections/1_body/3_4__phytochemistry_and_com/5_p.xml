<p class="p">Beyond the macronutrient and cations content, sea fennel is rich in several chemical constituents. The essential oil of sea fennel contains several volatile compounds such as limonene, α-pinene, sabinene, p-cimene, β-terpinene, β-myrcene, thymol, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, p-cymol, β-ionone, dillapiole, anisaldehyde, β-caryophyllene, carvone and myristicine [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. These volatile compounds are responsible for some sea fennel aromatic notes such as celery, common fennel and the peel of green citrus [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, the essential oil composition of sea fennel can vary considerably based on the geographic origin of the plants; therefore, it could distinguish different chemotypes: aromatic monoterpenes-type, monoterpene hydrocarbons-type, phenylpropanoids-type and their intermediate forms [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For example, Pateira et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] found that the percentage of diallopil in sea fennel harvested from the same location and the same year was 42.1, 33.3 and 35.1% for vegetative, flowering and fruiting stage respectively. At the same time, these Authors found that the percentage of diallopile in sea fennel harvested during the vegetative stage was 42.1 and 14.5% in two different years of collection [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Apart from the composition, it is important to highlight that the amount of essential oils in sea fennel reaches about 0.8% in fruits and from 0.15 to 0.3% in leaves [
