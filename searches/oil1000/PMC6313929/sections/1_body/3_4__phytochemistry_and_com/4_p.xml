<p class="p">This is because, in the marine coastal habitat, wild plants of sea fennel are more exposed to ions such as Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> with respect to K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. It is well know that potassium, although it is not a constituent of any plant structures or compounds, represents the element required in the highest amounts by plants for both biophysical and biochemical roles. Therefore, especially the higher amount of sodium in wild sea fennel could be a plantâ€™s response to alleviating the negative effects of a non-optimal potassium availability level for vegetable tissues. This, considering the role of sodium in replacing potassium for both biochemical and physiological non-specific plant functions.
