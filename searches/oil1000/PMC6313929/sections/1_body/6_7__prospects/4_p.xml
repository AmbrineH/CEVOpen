<p class="p">Thanks to its richness of health-promoting components, sea fennel seems to be a very promising candidate for both pharmaceutical and food industry in order to produce new functional products. At the same time, the richness in chemical compounds make this halophyte also interesting for industrial production of botanical insecticides and other crop protection products. At any rate, according to Petropoulos et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], a multi-step approach could be need for hypothesizing a full commercialization of these new products. In this context, the evaluation of several sea fennel populations from different geographical areas should be firstly carried out in order to select the best chemotypes for specific uses. At the same time, it could be needed also an evaluation of the potential differences regarding bioactive compounds content of plants under commercial cultivation conditions with respect to wild plants or ones grown under experimental conditions. On the other hand, some threats may also arise due to the potential resistance of consumers and farmers regarding this species as functional food and/or new cash crop. This may require a few preventive activities including clinical trials for evaluating effects on health and a specific marketing project to achieve increased consumer acceptance [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In this context, the establishment of consortia between research institutes, business companies and governmental organizations aiming to carried out these research and development activities, could be a good opportunity.
