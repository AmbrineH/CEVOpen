<p class="p">Being a halophyte with great adaptation to salinization, sea fennel can be considered an alternative for both horticultural and industrial crops also in the case of low quality soils and/or the availability of irrigation water with high electrical conductivity. Moreover, this species can be proposed also as a potted plant by using sustainable growing media instead of peat-based substrates. Unfortunately, the cultivation of this halophyte is currently very limited, and therefore more knowledge and technical solutions are needed before any large-scale diffusion.</p>
