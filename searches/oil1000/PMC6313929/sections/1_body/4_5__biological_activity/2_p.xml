<p class="p">Sea fennel contains interesting bioactive compounds that show antiradical, peroxidation inhibition and reducing power abilities [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In a study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of different parts of sea fennel plant, Houta et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found that the methanolic extract of seeds displayed the highest DPPH· scavenging ability with the lowest IC50 value (406 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) followed by leaves, flowers and stems (IC50 value of 500, 706 and 726 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively). According to some Authors [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], the strong antioxidant activity of the sea fennel extracts is due to the high content of phenolic compounds. However, it is important to highlight that both the content and composition of these compounds are highly influenced by the plant’s physiological stage [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The very high antiradical activity of sea fennel extracts reflects a high health potential in the context of functionality and antioxidant activity of food [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Apart from the soluble compounds, essential oils also show interesting antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], although to a lesser extent [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. For example, Mekinić et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] found that the ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) of essential oils was of 22.0, 42.0 and 8.4 µmol Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respectively for flowers, stems and leaves, while the FRAP of ethanolic extracts was of 16,065.6, 3009.4 and 17,335.0 μmol Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respectively for flowers, stems and leaves. The same Authors found that the DPPH· scavenging ability (expressed as inhibition percentage of DPPH radical) of essential oils was of 2.8, 2.8 and 2.6% respectively for flowers, stems and leaves, while the the DPPH· scavenging ability of ethanolic extracts was of 61.0, 13.0 and 61.8% respectively for flowers, stems and leaves [
