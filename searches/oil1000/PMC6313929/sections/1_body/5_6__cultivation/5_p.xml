 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00092-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Following the harvest carried out 60 days after transplantation, these Authors found an average yield of about 5.4 g DW plant

Furthermore, these Authors hypothesized that the halophyte aptitude of sea fennel can help to overcome the limitations posed by the high salinity of some compost-based growing media [
