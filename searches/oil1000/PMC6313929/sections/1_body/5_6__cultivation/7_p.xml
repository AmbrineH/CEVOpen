<p class="p">In this regard, considering the differences in the mineral composition between wild and cultivated sea fennel plants [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], future research activities could be carried out with the aim to evaluate the effect of cultivation techniques on yield and quality of this facultative halophyte. For example, the use of different nutrient solutions for soilless production of sea fennel could be a useful way to affect the mineral composition in plant tissue and for biofortification purposes [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In this context, the implementation of a biofortification process in sea fennel cultivation could be carried out for improving its nutritional value. Being a facultative halophyte, it could also be useful assessing the effect of saline stress on minerals enrichment in sea fennel grown by soilless systems [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Finally, since data about open-field cultivation of sea fennel is not present in literature, the influence of soil composition and salinity on this cropping system should be evaluated to optimize yield and nutritional quality of this facultative halophyte.
