<p class="p">In order to assess salt response of sea fennel, Hamed et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] cultivated this halophyte in pots filled with sand by using nutrient solutions at different NaCl concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 mM). Plants were harvested 13 weeks after transplanting while NaCl treatments started 8 weeks after transplanting. These Authors reported a biomass production of 1 and 13 g DW plant
