<p class="p">It is well known that factors such as temperature, salinity, and light conditions have a significant effect on the seed germination process and seedling production of sea fennel [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Marchioni-Ortau and Bocchieri [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] showed that the optimal conditions for seed germination of a Mediterranean population of sea fennel were a temperature of 20 Â°C and absence of light by using deionized water or at a very low salt concentration. It is important to highlight that the optimal conditions for germination of seed populations from the Atlantic coast seem to be very different from those reported for sea fennel populations from the Mediterranean basin [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In order to improve sea fennel seed germination for producing sea fennel seedlings, some interesting information is available in the literature. For example, Atia et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] reported that the use of red light and nitrogen-based compounds can significantly promote and accelerate germination. At the same time, pretreatment of seeds with L-ascorbic acid or ethanol can improve the seed germination rate by 30% [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-07-00092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. At any rate, seed priming may be carried out in order to accelerate seed germination as well as to obtain a better homogeneity as a consequence of an improved early seedling growth [
