 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels was 20.4%, having a very low amount of myristic acid. Based on our results, it can be concluded that the SFA of 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels are unlikely to have detrimental health effects by increasing the LDL cholesterol level. Moreover, the kernels were a good source of linoleic acid suggesting 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels as a valuable source of EFA that can be used in feed and food.
