  <italic class="italic">Sitophilus zeamais</italic> (Motschulsky) is considered as one of the most destructive foodstuff pests. Due to their efficiency, low toxicity for mammalians and low environmental impact, plant-derived essential oils (EOs) are promising tools for pest control. In particular, the OEs extracted from Lamiaceae are considered among the most bioactive in terms of repellent and/or insecticidal effect. Here, we investigated the repellence of the EOs extracted from two aromatic plant species typical of the flora of the Ecuadorian Andes, 
  <italic class="italic">Clinopodium tomentosum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. nubigeum</italic>, against adults of 
  <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>. The behavioral assays carried out at concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 23.9 μL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> air in a two-way static olfactometer showed a significant repellent effect starting from the concentration of 8.4 mL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> air both for the EO of 
  <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>. We also carried out a complete structural analysis of the antenna of 
  <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> using scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in order to characterize the olfactory sensilla equipment. In this species, there is no sexual dimorphism also as regards to the antennal morphology and the sensilla type and distribution. We identified six type of sensilla, among which at least three types (Sensillum Trichoideum 1, Sensillum Trichoideum 2 and Grooved Peg Sensillum) can be considered as olfactory. Electroantennography (EAG) recordings carried out on 
  <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> revealed a positive dose-response to both EOs, without differences between the two sexes.
