 <p> Chaetic Sensilla Type 1 (CS1). ( A) SEM micrograph showing an CS1 sticking out from the rest of the antennal sensilla. Dotted lines represent the section planes showed in Figure 3B,C, respectively. ( B) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross section of CS1, the cuticle (CU) appears thick, the internal lumen is partly occupied by five outer dendritic segments (ODS) enveloped by a dendrite sheath (DS). ( C) TEM section taken at the socket level, showing the large socket rich in suspension fibers (SF) and the outer dendritic segments (ODS) grouped by the dendrite sheath into two separated spaces, one occupied by five neurons and the other by a single neuron ending in a tubular body (TB). Bar scale: ( A) 10 µm; ( B) 0.1 µm; ( C) 1 µm. </p>
