 <p> Basiconic Sensilla Type2 (BS2). ( A) SEM micrograph showing BS2 sensilla, appearing longer than the surrounding sensilla and distinctly curved. Dotted line corresponds to the TEM section plane. ( B) TEM micrograph showing a cross section of BS2. The cuticle is thick and perforated by few pores (arrowheads). The sensillum lumen is filled by branched outer dendritic segments (ODS). Bar scale: ( A) 5 µm; ( B) 0.5 µm. </p>
