 <p> Basiconic Sensilla Type1 (BS1). ( A) SEM micrograph showing a bunch of SB1 with the typical curved shape. Thin cuticular grooves longitudinally oriented can be observed. The dotted line represents the section plane reported in ( B). ( B) TEM cross section of BS1, with evidence of numerous cuticular pores (arrowheads) distributed all over the surface and corresponding to the external cuticular grooves. The internal lumen is completely occupied by branched outer dendritic segments (ODS). Bar scale: ( A) 5 µm; ( B) 0.5 µm. </p>
