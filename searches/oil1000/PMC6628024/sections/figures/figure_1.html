 <p> Behavior of adults of Sitophilus zeamais in the presence of Clinopodium nubigenum and C. tomentosum essential oils (EOs). Histograms represent the percentage of insects that chose the cue or the control chamber. In brackets, the number of insects that made the choice. NT, % of insects that chose the control chamber; T, % of insects that chose the EO treated chamber; NC, number of non-choosing insects. Each EO was tested vs. clean filter paper in two-choice bioassays. Asterisks indicate significant differences in the number of the choosing insects ( Ï‡ 2 test; *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001). ( A), C. nubigenum EO; ( B), C. tomentosum EO. </p>
