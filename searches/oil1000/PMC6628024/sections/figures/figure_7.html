 <p> Grooved Peg Sensilla (GPS). ( A) SEM micrograph showing an GPS sensillum characterized by the presence of finger-like projections in the apical part. Dotted lines correspond to the TEM section planes. ( B, C) TEM cross section taken at the apical and proximal region, respectively. In ( B) the sensillum shows a cuticle organized in thick cuticular elements corresponding to the external finger-like projections. At the level of the grooves several pores can be observed crossing the whole cuticle. The internal lumen is occupied by two outer dendric segments (ODS). In C the section is taken at a lower level and shows a typical double-walled organization, with the external cuticular wall (EC) and the internal cuticular wall (IC) enclosing three outer dendritic segments. Bar scale: ( A) 5 µm; ( B, C) 0.5 µm. </p>
