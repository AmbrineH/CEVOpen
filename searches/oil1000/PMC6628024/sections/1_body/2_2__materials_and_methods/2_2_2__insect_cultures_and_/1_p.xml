 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> population was reared under laboratory conditions (24 °C, 45–65% R.H., and in the dark) at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment of the University of Pisa. Plastic boxes (20 × 27 × 11 cm) containing corn and wheat, covered by a nylon net allowing air exchange, were used for the rearing. The bioassays were conducted on insects homogeneous in age, obtained by removing the adults present in the rearing boxes by sieving the grain and collecting the newly emerged insects (0–3 days old) the following day.
