<p class="p">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ten adult individuals of each sex were used for the observations. Insects were anaesthetized by exposure to cold temperatures (−18 °C) for 120 s, then they were immediately soaked in 60% alcohol. The antennae of each individual were dissected from the head capsule as a whole; in a few cases, the last antennal segment was isolated from the rest of the antenna to achieve better view of the apical part of the antenna. Specimens were dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol, from 60% to 99%, 15 min for each step. After dehydration, 99% ethanol was substituted with pure HMDS (Hexamethyldisilazane, Merck
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and the specimens were allowed to dry under a hood, at room conditions; this step was repeated twice. Up to 5 samples were mounted on aluminium stubs, taking care to place them with different orientations in order to obtain a clear view of the ventral, dorsal and lateral sides of the antennomeres. Mounted specimens were gold-sputtered using a “Balzers Union
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> SCD 040” unit (Balzers, Vaduz, Liechtenstein). The observations were carried out using a Philips
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> XL 30 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA), SE detector, operating at 7–10 KV, WD 9–10 mm.
