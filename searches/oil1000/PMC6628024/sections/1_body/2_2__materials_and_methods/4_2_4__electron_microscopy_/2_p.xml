<p class="p">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ten individuals of both sexes were anesthetized by exposure to cold temperatures (−18 °C) for 60 sec, then immediately immersed in a solution of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde 2.5% in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer +5% sucrose, pH 7.2–7.3. Each antenna was detached from the head capsule, the last flagellomere was removed to help fixative penetration, and left at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, the specimens were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer +5% sucrose, pH 7.2–7.3 for ten minutes, repeated twice. Afterwards, the specimens were post fixed in 1% OsO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (osmium tetroxide) for 1 h at 4 °C and rinsed in the same buffer. Dehydration in a graded ethanol series from 60% to 99%, was followed by embedding in Epon-Araldite with propylene oxide as bridging solvent. Thin sections were taken with a diamond knife on a LKB Bromma ultramicrotome (LKB
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Bromma, Sweden), and mounted on formvar coated 50 mesh grids. Then, sections on grids were stained with uranyl acetate (20 min, room temperature) and lead citrate (5 min, room temperature). Finally, the sections were investigated with a Philips
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EM 208 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Digital pictures (1376 × 1032 pixels, 8b, uncompressed greyscale TIFF files) were obtained using a high-resolution digital camera MegaViewIII (SIS
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Muenster, Germany) connected to the TEM.
