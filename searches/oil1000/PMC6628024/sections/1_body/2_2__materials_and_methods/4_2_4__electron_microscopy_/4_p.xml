 <italic class="italic">v</italic> in paraffin oil were delivered as 10 µL samples placed on a filter paper (15 mm × 15 mm). The impregnated filter paper was placed into a glass Pasteur pipette (150 mm length) constituting an odor cartridge. The control stimulus consisted of a similar pipette containing a filter paper impregnated with 10 µL aliquot of paraffin oil. Fresh stimulus pipettes were prepared every day. The tip of the glass pipette was placed about 3 mm into a small hole in the wall of a L-shaped glass tube (130 mm long, 12 mm diameter) oriented towards the antennal preparation (5 mm away from the preparation). The stimuli were provided as 1 s puffs of purified, charcoal-filtered air into a continuous humidified main air stream (up to 60% RH obtained by bubbling air through a washing glass bottle) at 2500 mL/min, that was flowing over the antennal preparation at a speed of 50 cm/s generated by an air stimulus controller (CS-55, Syntech, Germany). At least a 1 min interval was allowed between successive stimulations for antenna recovery. The two essential oils of

 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> were furthermore tested to determine dose-dependent responses at four different concentrations

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> in paraffin oil (0.1%, 1%, 10%, 20%), using a 10 µL solution starting with the lowest concentration to minimize olfactory adaptation. To evaluate EAG responses, the maximum deflection of the recorded EAG signal after stimulation with an odor was used. For dose-dependent response analysis,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> used as reference standard stimulus. This allows compensation for changes of the sensitivity of an antenna during the course of an experiment and the comparison between experiments performed with antennae of different sensitivities. After the EAG test, each insect was dissected to be sexed. The tests were conducted on 13 females and 17 males. For dose-dependent response, the dose sequence was repeated 2–4 times for each individual, using the mean values of each individual for the analysis. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C).
