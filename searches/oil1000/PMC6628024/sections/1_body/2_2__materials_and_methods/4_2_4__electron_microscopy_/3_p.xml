<p class="p">EAG Analysis. Electrophysiological experiments were performed to evaluate the olfactory response of 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> antennae to essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigeum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>. Octanal (99%) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as reference standard stimulus to normalize the electrophysiological responses. To prevent rapid evaporation of test compounds and for the dose-dependence experiments, odor stimuli were dissolved in paraffin oil (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> adults were anaesthetized by refrigerating them at 4 °C for about 120 s. A single insect was inserted into the end of a truncated plastic pipette tip allowing the insect head to come out of the tip. The insect was immobilized inside the pipette with the help of Patafix (UHU Bostik, Milan, Italy) and the tip of the rostrum was carefully excised for about half of its length using micro scissors to allow the contact with the reference electrode. The pipette with the insect was placed on a dental wax base close to a coverslip portion and the insect head was fastened to the dental wax base by a tungsten hook. One antenna was fixed in place by double-sided tape to the coverslip portion to access the antennal club tip. Electrical activity was recorded by inserting the reference electrode into the rostrum, while the tip of the recording electrode was connected to the edge of the specialized elliptical area in the distal part of the apical antennomere. Glass capillary electrodes (1.5 mm outer Ø, 0.9 mm inner Ø) filled with Ringer solution [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], containing 5 g/L of polyvinylpyrrolidone (Fluka), in contact with a silver wire were used. The capillary tubes were drawn to a fine point using a microelectrode puller PC-10 (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to get an inner diameter wide enough to enable the contact with a small portion of the club. The analog signal was detected through a probe with a high-input impedance preamplifier (10×) (EAG Kombi-probe, Syntech, Germany), captured and processed with a data acquisition controller (IDAC-4, Syntech, Germany) and analyzed using EAG 2000 software (Syntech, Germany).
