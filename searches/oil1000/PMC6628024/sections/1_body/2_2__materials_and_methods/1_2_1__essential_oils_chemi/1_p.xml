<p class="p">Essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation in a clevenger-type apparatus for two hours from the flowering aerial parts of plants collected in March 2017 on the mountains nearby the Hacienda Zuleta (Imbabura, Ecuador) collected with the Ecuadorian Environmental authorization No. 006-2017-IC-FAU-FLO-DPAI/MAE. The obtained EOs have been diluted to 0.5% in HPLC grade 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane prior to GC–MS injection. The GC/EI-MS analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 apparatus equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion-trap mass detector. The oven temperature was programmed rising from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer-line temperature, 240 °C; carrier gas, He (1 mL/min); injection volume: 1 μL. The acquisition parameters were as follows: Full scan; scan range: 35–300
