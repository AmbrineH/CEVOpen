<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are natural extracts composed of a wide variety of volatile compounds, occurring as secondary metabolism products in several plant groups. EOs can be produced in different amounts by several plant organs, ranging from leaves, stems, seeds and flowers, from which they can be extracted using different methods [
