<p class="p">In this paper, we investigated the activity of the EOs extracted from two species of Lamiaceae belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> (Kunth) Kuntze and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> (Kunth) Govaerts. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic> includes more than 140 species distributed worldwide. Several species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic> are used as natural remedies in traditional medicine in different regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This applies to 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> as well, which are commonly known in Ecuador as “Santa Maria” and “tipo de cerro”, respectively, and used in the traditional medicine as remedies against cold, flu, stomach-ache and other disorders [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. EOs from collected plants of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and by gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectroscopy (GC/EIMS). To evaluate the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic> spp. EOs extracts, dual choice behavioural assays were performed. We also investigated the antennal morphology of 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> to describe in detail the antennal sensilla, particularly as regards the olfactory sensilla. 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus</italic> spp. was already investigated using mainly scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], but a comprehensive study of the antennal structures in terms of fine structure and distribution is still lacking. We finally tested the antennal sensitivity to different concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs on 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> males and females, using the EAG (electroantennography) method.
