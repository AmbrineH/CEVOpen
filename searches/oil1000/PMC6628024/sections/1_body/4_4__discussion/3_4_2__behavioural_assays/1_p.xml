<p class="p">In this study we observed an increasing repellent effect of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> adults, in relation to increasing concentration of the EOs. This is in agreement with the results of the EAG analysis. This suggests an insect olfactory response to at least some of the EOs compounds, which releases a repellence behavior. In line with these results, a clear repellence against 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> adults was also observed by Bougherra et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] for the EO extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus</italic> L. (RD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values ranging from 0.010 L cm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) who reported that 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> was overall more susceptible to the 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> EO than 
 <italic class="italic">Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Tribolium confusum</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). In line with our results, 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> exhibited a negative chemotaxis also in the presence of the EO extracted from two chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill., with RD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.176 and 0.124 mg cm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively. In our trial we observed a higher repellence of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> than the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> even if 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> showed a more ready reaction (shorter latency time) to the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> compared to that of 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>. Such differences in the efficacy and latency time may be due to the different chemical composition of the EOs whose bioactivity depend not only but also on to the combined action of their single chemical constituents [
 <xref rid="B41-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] with synergistic and antagonistic effects on the insect behavior [
