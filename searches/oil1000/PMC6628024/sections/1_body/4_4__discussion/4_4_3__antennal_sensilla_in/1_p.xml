<p class="p">The antennae of 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> are made of a distal club that presents apically a specialized sensory area. Indeed, most of the antenna sensilla are located at the level of this area, while the rest of the antennal sensilla are sparsely distributed on the other antennomeres. This is particularly true if we restrict our observation to the olfactory sensilla. Among weevils, a similar organization of the antenna was reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Rhynchophorous palmarum</italic> L., where the sensory area was restricted to the apical, remarkably modified apical antennomere [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The antennae of Sitophilus spp. were studied and analyzed in previous papers, however most of the reported data were obtained only using scanning electron microscope. Abd El-Ghany and Abd El-Aziz (2017) [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] reported the occurrence of antennal sensilla in 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic>, but only few SEM pictures are shown, while in a previous paper in the same species, Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] analyzed the antennal sensilla using bot SEM and TEM approach. However, the information reported in this paper are rather confused and supported by incomplete TEM data. To date, this is the first contribution to the study of antennal sensilla in Sitophilus spp. with a comprehensive analysis of the different antennal sensilla. In 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> there is no sexual dimorphism as regards the general structure of the antennae (shape and size of the antennomeres, number of antennal sensilla) and the type and distribution of the different antennal sensilla. Antennal sexual dimorphism was reported for species belonging to different insect orders, with different biological significance. In Hymenoptera, antennal dimorphism can occur either in terms of antennal shape (i.e., filiform in males vs. clubbed in females) or presence of specialized antennomeres housing pheromone glands (mostly common in males) ([
 <xref rid="B43-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and refences therein). In Lepidoptera relying on long-distance communication mediated by female-produced sex pheromone, males often possess modified bi-pectinate antennae housing large number of specialized olfactory sensilla [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The absence of sexual dimorphism in 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> could be related with the relatively narrow involvement of the antennae in the sexual behavior, possibly due to the absence sex-pheromone based communication. Among the five different type of antennal sensilla, Chaetic Sensilla Type 1 (CS1) are numerously less represented than the others but are the most evident because of their length and their wide insertion angle with the antennal wall, that makes them easily visible. This feature is consistent with a contact-chemoreceptive gustatory role for CS1, strongly supported also by the presence of a combination of five chemosensory neuron and a single mechanoreceptive neuron ending with a tubular body. This neuronal scheme is quite common among different insect orders such as: Hemiptera [

Chaetic Sensilla Type 2 (CS2) are also present in low numbers and are typically characterized by a bi- or multi-partite distal region. The absence of cuticular pores, sensory neurons within the cuticular shaft, presence of a single sensory neuron with tubular body and positioning along the external border of the antenna deals with a possible mechanoreceptive function [
