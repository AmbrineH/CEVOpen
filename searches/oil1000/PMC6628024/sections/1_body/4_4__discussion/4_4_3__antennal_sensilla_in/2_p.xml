<p class="p">The main olfactory organs in 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> are Basiconic Sensilla Type 1 (BS1) and Type 2 (BS2), which makes also the two most represented classes of antennal sensilla in this species. The proposed olfactory function is strongly supported by ultrastructural evidences, i.e., the presence of porous cuticular wall and dendritic branches. Given this, their possible involvement in the perception of volatile chemicals, including EOs extracts, is highly probable. In 
 <italic class="italic">R. palmarum</italic>, Type IV and V sensilla were reported as olfactory sensilla on the basis of their external and internal morphological features [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], strongly resembling Basiconic Sensilla 1 and 2. We found that antennal sensilla distribution does not follow a particular pattern, with most of the sensilla distributed evenly on the sensory area (with the exception of CS2 located along the outer edge). This organization of olfactory sensilla could be related with was found in other weevils, where the absence of distinct area bearing specific sensilla types is quite a normal feature. As already suggested by Said et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], the hypothesis of a mosaic-like organization of olfactory sensilla in regards to their functional response to different volatiles could apply to 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> as well, with different olfactory receptor neurons from the same sensilla type responding to different volatiles.
