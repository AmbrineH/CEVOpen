<p class="p">Besides sensory structures, we reported also the presence of cuticular pores located at the level of the specialized sensory area, mostly located very close to the socket of the sensilla but without a specificity for the different sensilla type. Our investigation did not allow us to characterize such structures, although they are very similar to openings of epidermal glands belonging to the third class, according to Quennedey (1998) [
 <xref rid="B67-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Antennal glands were reported to occur on different species and with very different functions, ranging from courtship behavior [

 <xref rid="B68-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] to appeasement of ants in myrmecophilous beetles [
 <xref rid="B69-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> we found cuticular pores in both sexes, therefore, a possible role such as pheromone-producing glands should not be considered. In this species we hypothesize a role for antennal glands in maintaining fully operational the sensilla, releasing a protective and/or lubricant secretion helping with removing and preventing dust particles accumulating on the sensilla, considering the dusty environment (grain storage facilities) visited by this species. However further investigations are needed to unveil the role of these glands in
