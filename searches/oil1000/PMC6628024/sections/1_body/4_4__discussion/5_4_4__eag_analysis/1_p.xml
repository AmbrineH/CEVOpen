<p class="p">Stimulation of the antenna with different concentration of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> elicited a response in both sexes of 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>. EAG tests revealed a difference in the antennal response when exposed to 10% concentration of the EOs from both 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic> species. In the concentration-dependent response test, 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> antennal activity showed an increasing response at the increase in the concentration of the EOs, starting with 0.1% of concentration. Despite the differences found in the different components of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs, we found a similar EAG response following the increase in concentration of the EOs, and this response was similar in male and females of the weevil. All these data revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> detects the EOs through olfactory sensilla located on the antennae, and that antennal olfactory sensilla are able to detect different concentration of EOs. In a previous study carried out on 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. oryzae</italic>, it was demonstrated the ability to discriminate different concentration of propionic acid through antennal olfactory sensilla [
