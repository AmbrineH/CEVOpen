<p class="p">To date, the control of foodstuff pests has been mainly based on synthetic insecticides and fumigants, however, since their use has raised food and environmental safety concerns, alternative treatments are highly demanded. EOs are regarded as very promising substances for the formulation of low-toxic, eco-friendly pest control products. In this context, the huge richness of the Andean flora may represent an important source of bioactive substances. In this study, we report the behavioral effects of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs on the maize weevil 
 <italic class="italic">S. zemais</italic>. While 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> EOs were already tested for their toxic effect as well as oviposition deterrent effect on 
 <italic class="italic">L. sericata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], this is the first report showing a repellent effect of 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> against insects. We also made a chemical characterization of both 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium</italic> species to highlight differences. We report a complete mapping of the antennal structures in 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> with a characterization of the olfactory sensilla, and we also tested the antennal activity of different concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs.
