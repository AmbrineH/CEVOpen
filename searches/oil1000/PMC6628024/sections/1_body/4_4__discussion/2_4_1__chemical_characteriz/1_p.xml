<p class="p">As reported in the literature, monoterpenes are the most relevant compounds detected in the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> EO, mainly in their oxygenated form. All the described 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> EOs were extracted from plants gathered on the Andean highlands of Ecuador, and quantitative differences emerged from these samples, probably depending on the latitude of collection. The specimens studied in the present work were gathered on the mountains of the Imbabura region, which is situated in northern Ecuador. Noriega et al. studied the composition of the EO extracted from plants collected in the Pichincha province, situated in a slightly more central area of Ecuador. Carvacrol and its acetate were the most abundant compounds in the composition, with the latter, which was not detected in the sample of the present study, accounting for over 40% of the total composition (vs. 21.21% of the former) [

Pulegone was far less represented (6.09%) compared to our sample, whilst thymol, which accounted for over 5.5% in Noriega et al., was not detected in our EO. Ruiz et al. collected their plant samples in Piedra Bola, in the Loja region, situated in the central area of Ecuador. Similarly to Noriega et al., carvacrol and its acetate were the most abundant compounds evidenced in the EO. Moreover, thymol showed a significant relative abundance, whilst pulegone relative content went down to 1.9% [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The farthest EO, both in terms of geographical provenience of the plant material and composition, is the one reported in Gilardoni et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Their 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> specimens were collected in the Saraguro territory of the Loja province, in southern Ecuador. Their EO was dominated by pulegone, which accounted for over 70% of the total composition. Carvacrol was not detected, whilst linalool was found with a relative abundance higher than 7% [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], whilst it accounted only for 0.1% in our sample. To the best of our knowledge, only one study reported 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EO composition. Consistently with our findings, Benzo et al. detected isomenthone and pulegone as the most abundant compounds in the EO extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> collected near river Chambo, in central Ecuador; moreover, piperitenone was over 1.8% [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-10-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Conversely, menthone was significantly more represented in their EO (6.6%) compared to our sample.
