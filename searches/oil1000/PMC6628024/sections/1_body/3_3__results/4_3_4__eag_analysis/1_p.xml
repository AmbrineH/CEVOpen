<p class="p">Depolarizing EAG responses were recorded in both males and females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). The EAG responses to 10% concentration of the different compounds tested were not statistically different between the two genders, but they were different among the compounds. The interaction between the genders and the various compounds was not statistically significant (

 <italic class="italic">C. nubigeum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs were higher than those to paraffin oil (

 <italic class="italic">C. nubigeum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EOs, the EAG responses were not statistically different between the insect genders, but they were different among the concentrations. The interaction between the sexes and the concentration was not statistically significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>A,B table inset). In particular, for both the EOs, the response to 0.1% concentration was not statistically different from the control, while the responses to 1, 10 and 20% concentrations were higher than the control (
