<p class="p">The complete compositions of the essential oils extracted from flowering aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> are reported in 
 <xref rid="insects-10-00171-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Oxygenated monoterpenes represent the most abundant chemical class of compounds in both the EOs, accounting for up to 74.0 and 96.2% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>, respectively. The identified compounds belonging to this class, though, are quite different in the two species. Carvacrol is the most abundant oxygenated monoterpene (and overall compound) in 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> EO, whilst it was not detected in the 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>. Conversely, isomenthone accounts for over 45% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>, with the highest detected relative abundance in this EO; its presence in 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> is still relevant (6.4%), but it is significantly less represented. Pulegone follows as the second most abundant volatile organic compound (VOC) in both EOs. Piperitenone and its epoxidized derivative were only detected in 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>. Monoterpene hydrocarbons showed a far more relevant relative abundance in the composition 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic> EO (19.7% vs. 1.9% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic>). Among them, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and Î³-terpinene showed the highest contents (9.1 and 5.3%, respectively), whilst their presence was not detected in 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> EO. Non-terpene derivatives were also more represented in the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nubigenum</italic>, with 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-yl acetates as the main ones.
