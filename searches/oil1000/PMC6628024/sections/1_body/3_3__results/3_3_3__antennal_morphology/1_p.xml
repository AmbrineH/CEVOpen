<p class="p">General Description. In 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>, the antennae are of the geniculate type, typically inserted laterally on the basal part of the head capsule. During normal activity, insect antennae are brought in a forward or lateral position. In both male and female, the antenna is about 850 µm long, and is composed of a total number of eight antennomeres (

The first one is the scape (connecting the antenna with the head capsule), which is the most developed antennal segment in terms of length (about 250 µm long). The scape is followed by the pedicel (about 75 µm long) and the flagellum, which is composed of six antennomeres. The proximal five flagellomeres are sub-cylindrical in shape, and together measure about 300 µm in length. However, the most elongated one is actually the last antennal segment, measuring about 200 µm in length. It is characterized by a cylindrical shape, with a conical, pointed apical part (
