<p class="p">Grooved Peg Sensilla (GPS). GPS are small sensilla evenly distributed all over the antennal sensory area. They are inserted on the antennal wall through a rigid socket: Their base is inserted almost orthogonally, whilst the whole structure is bent downward and runs almost parallel to the antennal wall. Distally, the cuticular shaft appears clearly grooved, giving rise to digitiform cuticular elements reaching the rounded tip (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>A). The basal part of the cuticular shaft is smooth. GPS sensilla are often found interspersed within BS1 and BS2. TEM cross sections revealed the actual structure of the sensillum, with the typical double-walled organization. Apically, 10â€“12 cuticular ridges are present, while the proximal half of the cuticular shaft is smooth externally. Spoke channels are found between the ridges (

Proximally, each sensillum presents 2 cuticular chambers: The innermost chamber is occupied by the outer dendritic segments of three sensory neurons (
