<p class="p">Chaetic Sensilla Type 1 (CS1). These sensilla are characterized by a straight cuticular shaft inserted on to the antennal wall with a variable angle, but normally exceeding 45Â° (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). CS1 are characterized by the absence of wall pores, the longitudinally grooved cuticle and by the presence of a wide basal socket, through which the sensillum in inserted on the antennal wall. They were found to occur in various parts of the sensory area, i.e., at the level of the inferior margin as well as at the tip. CS1 represent the less abundant sensilla occurring on the sensory area (see 
 <xref rid="insects-10-00171-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Serial TEM cross sections of CS1 cuticular shaft revealed the presence of five unbranched sensory neurons enclosed in a single dendritic sheath (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B). This bundle of dendrites runs inside the sensillum up to the tip. At its base, CS1 is equipped with an elaborated flexible socket, which suspends the sensillum around the antennal wall. A mesh of suspension fibers was observed, as well as the presence of a sixth sensory neuron, which ends at the socket level in a typical tubular body (
