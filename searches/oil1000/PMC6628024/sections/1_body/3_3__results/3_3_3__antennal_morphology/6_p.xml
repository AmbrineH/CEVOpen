<p class="p">Basiconic Sensilla Type 2 (BS2). These sensilla show an elongated and strongly curved at the distal half level cuticular shaft (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>A). They are inserted on the antennal wall through a socket analogous to SB1, with a starting angle of about 35Â°. The distal half of the sensilla is curved downward, therefore following the curvature of the antennal wall. Because of these features, SB2 are positioned above the other type of sensilla, except for the SC1. The antennal cuticular wall is smooth, and the apical part is pointed. SB2 are distributed quite evenly at the level of the sensory area, with a preference for the apical part of the antenna; they represent the second most abundant type of sensilla. Ultrastructural details reveal the thick cuticle, where a few pores open (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>B). The cuticle is thicker and less porous, quite different from the cuticle we described for SB1. TEM sections taken at the medial sensillum region revealed the presence of branched dendritic processes that fill the sensillum lumen.
