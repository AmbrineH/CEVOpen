<p class="p">Chaetic Sensilla Type 2 (CS2). The sensilla belonging to this class are typically characterized by a branched structure, i.e., the distal part of the cuticular shaft is divided into 2–4 branches ending with a sharp tip (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00171-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A). These sensilla are inserted on the antennal wall through a socket according to an angle below 30°, therefore CS2 do not protrude above the antenna profile. The cuticular wall appears smooth and poreless. We counted about 40 CS2 per antenna, and, similarly to what we observed for CS1, they are comparatively less numerous than the other sensilla type we described. CS2 are distributed randomly on the whole apical sensory area, although they are preferentially found along the lower margin. TEM sections revealed the presence of a thick cuticle without sensory neurons (
