<p class="p">Basiconic Sensilla Type 1 (BS1). They are typical “peg” sensilla, with an average length of about 12 μm. The cuticular shaft is slightly curved and finely grooved for all of its length, except for the basal part, where the cuticle appears smooth (

This type of sensilla was often found grouped in some regions of the apical sensory area, forming clusters of sensilla. Because of their length and their curved shape, BS1 are arranged almost parallel to the antennal profile, often hidden by other type of sensilla. BS1 are the most abundant sensilla type. TEM investigations revealed the presence of a cuticular wall, with pores (diameter about 30 nm) distributed all over the surface. The sensilla lumen is completely filled with the dendritic branches of the associated sensory neurons (
