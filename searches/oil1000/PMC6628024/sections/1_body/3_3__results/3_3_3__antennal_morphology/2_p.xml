<p class="p">The cuticular surface of the whole antenna appears as finely sculptured, with the presence of a single type of structures; these appear as flattened setae, distributed in variable number along the antennomeres, including the apical one. The most interesting part of the antennae is, however, the distal part of the apical antennomere, which is defined by a specialized area, elliptical in shape (if observed from the top) (

It is noteworthy that no differences occurred as regards the general structure of the antenna and the presence and distribution of the sensory structures. Ultrastructural investigations revealed the presence of five different types of antennal sensory structures. In order to map the sensilla, at least six SEM photographs were taken at a given magnification (3000×) in order to picture the whole apical part of the antenna. These images were composed together into a single, high magnification picture (12,000 × 5000 dpi, 8 bit greyscale) using the software Photoshop
