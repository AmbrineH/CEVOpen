<p class="p">Besides the aforementioned sensilla, the analysis of the antennal surface revealed peculiar structures concentrated at the very tip area of the antenna. These structures show a wide, ampulla-like base rising from the antennal wall without an apparent socket. The basal part continues as an elongated, thin and pointed structure (

Ultrastructural observations revealed the absence of “peg in pit” or “coeloconic” sensilla (typically hidden below the cuticle and communicating with the surface through a small opening), while the pores could be associated with glandular structures.
