<p id="Par20" class="p">Dried plant aerial parts (leaves) were pulverized. Each 15 g of ground sample was placed into a separate Erlenmeyer flask. Then, 100 mL of ethanol (100%) was added, and the samples were incubated in a water bath at 55 °C for 6 h. Separation of the extraction mixture from the residue was achieved by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Each plant residue was re-extracted in triplicate with ethanol. After filtration, the two portions were mixed. The residual solvent in the ethanolic extracts were removed under reduced pressure at 48–49 °C using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor IKA VB 10, Germany). Water in the extracts was lyophilized using a freeze dryer (Thermo Savant Modulyo D, USA) for 8 h at − 50 °C and 0.040 mbar. The yields of these fractions were 20.16% (
