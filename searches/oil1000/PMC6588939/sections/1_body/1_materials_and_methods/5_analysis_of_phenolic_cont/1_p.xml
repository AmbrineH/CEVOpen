 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] was adopted for the analysis of phenolic contents. The conditions utilized were as follows: a C-18 column (CTO-10ASVp, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μM), an injection volume of 20 μL, a mobile phase composed of solvent A (3% formic acid in distilled water) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile), gradient elution from 15 to 100% B over a run time of 45 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and a UV-Vis detector. For analysis, the samples were dissolved in ethanol, and 20 μL of this solution was injected into the column. Chromatograms were plotted based on detection at 280 nm with the UV-Vis detector. The retention times and UV absorption spectra of the phenolic compounds were compared with those of pure standards. Gallic acid, 3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, rutin, ellagic acid, naringin, and quercetin were used as standards. Peaks were identified by matching the retention times and UV spectra with those of the standards. The quantity of each phenolic compound was reported in μg per gram of the extract.
