<p id="Par31" class="p">Measurements of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), defined as the minimum concentration at which more than 80% of the microbial growth is restrained, were performed in 96 flat-bottom microtiter plates (TPP, Switzerland) in accordance with the microdilution method, as previously reported by Bardaweel et al.

Ampicillin and amphotericin B (positive controls), as well as media (negative control), were employed under comparable experimental conditions. Plates containing bacteria were placed in a shaker incubator for 48 h at 37 °C, whereas plates containing
