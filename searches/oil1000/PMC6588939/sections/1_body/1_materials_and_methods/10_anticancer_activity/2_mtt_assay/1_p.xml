<p id="Par33" class="p">The anticancer activity of the phenolic extracts and essential oils were studied in 96-well round-bottom microplates using the MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as previously described by Bouziane et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In summary, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a cell density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL and incubated for 24 h to permit attachment. Each well was treated with different concentrations (0.001–1000 μg/mL) of the prepared extracts in triplicate and incubated for 48 h. Subsequently, 10 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well and further incubated for 4 h before measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. Growth inhibition was determined based on the following equation: inhibition (%) = 100-(mean Abs of test sample - mean Abs of negative control) ×100
 <bold class="bold">/</bold>(mean Abs of positive control-mean Abs of negative control). Graph Pad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for data analysis to determine the inhibition percentage, and the results are presented as the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value, described as the concentration that produces 50% growth suppression. The positive control doxorubicin was employed under the same experimental conditions.
