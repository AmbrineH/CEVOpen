<p id="Par22" class="p">The total flavonoid content was estimated using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method of Boulanouar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL of diluted extract was mixed with 1 mL of a 2% AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> methanol solution. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 430 nm using a spectrophotometer (OPTIZEN 2120 UV). The total flavonoid content was calculated from the calibration curve of rutin and expressed as milligrams of rutin equivalents per gram of dry weight (mg RE/g dry weight).
