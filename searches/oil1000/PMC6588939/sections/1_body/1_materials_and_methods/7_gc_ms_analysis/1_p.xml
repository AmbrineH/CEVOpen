<p id="Par25" class="p">GC-EIMS analyses were accomplished with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness of 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector. The following analytical specifications were used: injector and transfer line temperatures of 220 °C and 240 °C, respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas of helium at 1 mL/min; injection volume of 0.2 μL (10% hexane solution); and split ratio of 1:30. For the identification of each compound, a comparison of the retention times with the standards’ retention times was performed. In addition, we evaluated the linear retention indices in relation to the retention times of a series of
