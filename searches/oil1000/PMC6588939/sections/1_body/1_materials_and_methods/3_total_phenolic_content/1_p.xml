 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (7.5%, w/v) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 760 nm using a spectrophotometer (OPTIZEN 2120 UV). An ethanol solution of gallic acid was tested in parallel to obtain a calibration curve. Values were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents per gram of dry weight (mg GAE/g dry weight).
