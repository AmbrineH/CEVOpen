<p id="Par27" class="p">The antioxidant capacity was estimated following the procedure described by Re et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] with minor modifications. In brief, a 7 mM ABTS stock solution was reacted with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate at room temperature for 12–16 h while protected from light to produce the ABTS radical cation (ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup>). The ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> mixture (1450 μL) was diluted with methanol to reach an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm, followed by the addition of 50 μL of either the test sample or Trolox standard and incubation at room temperature while protected from light for 6 min. The absorbance was read at 734 nm using a spectrophotometer (OPTIZEN 2120 UV). For each test sample, the percent inhibition of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> was computed using the following formula: (% inhibition) = [100*(A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> - A
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> / A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>)], where A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> is the control sample absorbance and A
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> is the test sample absorbance. The concentration of oil or extract that could scavenge 50% of the ABTS radicals (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated. Trolox was used as a reference compound.
