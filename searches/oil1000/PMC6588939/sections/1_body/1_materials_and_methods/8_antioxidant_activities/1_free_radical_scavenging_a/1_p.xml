<p id="Par26" class="p">The DPPH radical-scavenging capacity was measured as previously described by Boulanouar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. In this study, 1 mL of either ethanolic extract or essential oil was added to 2 mL of a 60 μM DPPH methanol solution, and the reaction mixture was kept at room temperature and away from light for 30 min before the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. The following equation was used to estimate the scavenging activity: scavenging effect (%) = [100*(A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> - A
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>/ A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>)], where A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> is the control sample absorbance and A
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> is the test sample absorbance. The concentration of oil or extract at which 50% of the DPPH radicals (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) were scavenged was calculated. Ascorbic acid was employed as a reference compound.
