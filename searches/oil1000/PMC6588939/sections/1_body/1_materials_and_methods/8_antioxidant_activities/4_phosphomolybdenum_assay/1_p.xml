 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. In summary, 0.3 mL of each diluted extract was added to 3 mL of a phosphomolybdic reagent solution containing ammonium molybdate (4 M), sodium phosphate (28 mM) and sulfuric acid (0.6 M). The mixture was placed in a water bath at a temperature of 95 °C for 90 min. After cooling to room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 695 nm against a blank solution containing 0.3 mL of ethanol mixed with 3 mL of phosphomolybdic reagent. The results are expressed in terms of the ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC).
