<p id="Par44" class="p">The ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> as well as their essential oils were evaluated in terms of potential antimicrobial activity against a group of pathogenic microorganisms, comprising gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and a fungus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Superior antimicrobial activity was observed against the gram-positive bacteria examined in this study, while both plant extracts and essential oils demonstrated moderate activities against gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activities observed after essential oil treatment appeared to be generally more potent than those associated with the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis.</italic> As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> moderate antifungal activity was associated with both the ethanolic extracts and essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> when examined against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>. Numerous literature studies have provided support for the antimicrobial activities of several of the compounds in the 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> ethanolic extracts and essential oils. For instance, quercetin has been reported as a very efficient antimicrobial compound against several pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that the antibacterial activities of flavonoids, such as quercetin, were effectively enhanced in the presence of rutin, a major component of the ethanolic extracts of both plants, although rutin did not show activity on its own [
