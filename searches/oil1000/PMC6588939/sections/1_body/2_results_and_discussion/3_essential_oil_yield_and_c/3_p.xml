<p id="Par39" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> essential oil, 29 compounds were identified, of which 74.7% were oxygenated monoterpenes and 15.6% were monoterpene hydrocarbons. Among the minor compounds, oxygenated sesquiterpene (4.4%) was characterized. The major compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> EO were α-terpinyl acetate (47.4%), neryl acetate (9.6%), and α-pinene (6.8%). The main compounds in essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> from different geographical areas have been frequently reported to include camphor and/or α-pinene, while thymol and linalool have been occasionally reported as the main compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Interestingly, the chemical composition of the 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> essential oil reported in this study appears to be unique, as α-terpinyl acetate and neryl acetate were detected as the major compounds in the oil but thymol was not detected at all.
