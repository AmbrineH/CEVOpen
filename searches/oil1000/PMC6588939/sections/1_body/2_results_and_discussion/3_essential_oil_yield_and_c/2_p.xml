<p id="Par38" class="p">In the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic>, 26 compounds were identified, accounting for 98.3% of the oil. Interestingly, the content of oxygenated monoterpenes (92.0%) was 23 times greater than that of monoterpene hydrocarbons (4.0%). Linalool (52.1%) and linalyl acetate (19.1%) were detected as the major compounds in the oil. The composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> is extremely variable because of the existence of several chemotypes, i.e., linalool, methyl chavicol, eugenol, methyl eugenol and neral are the main compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. The essential oil obtained in the present study can be classified as a linalool-linalyl acetate chemotype, a characteristic chemotype of European basil [
