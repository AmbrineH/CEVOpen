 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic>, respectively. Chromatographic analyses resulted in the identification of 61 compounds, representing 98.3% (

 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic>) of the essential oils (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). These compounds were grouped into six chemical classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, apocarotenes, and non-terpene derivatives.
