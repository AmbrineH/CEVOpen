<p id="Par36" class="p">In this study, 15 phenolic compounds in the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> were investigated by HPLC
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> The concentrations of the identified polyphenolic compounds in all analysed samples are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> (shown in the order of their retention time). The data in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> revealed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> had high amounts of rutin, epicatechin and vanillic acid: 476.28 μg/g, 225.01 μg/g, and 138.24 μg/g, respectively. Two phenolic compounds, quercetin (0.36 μg/g) and caffeic acid (6.48 μg/g), were found in low concentrations. In the 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> ethanolic extract, six compounds were detected in notably high concentrations: epicatechin (major compound; 824.79 μg/g), 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (778.76 μg/g), ellagic acid (374.58 μg/g), rutin (280.39 μg/g), vanillic acid (182.67 μg/g), and naringin (120.67 μg/g). Epicatechin was found to be the major compound in the 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus algeriensis</italic> ethanolic extract (824.79 μg/g), and 3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was detected in the lowest concentration (1.42 μg/g). Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, HPLC identification of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus algeriensis</italic> has never been previously reported.
