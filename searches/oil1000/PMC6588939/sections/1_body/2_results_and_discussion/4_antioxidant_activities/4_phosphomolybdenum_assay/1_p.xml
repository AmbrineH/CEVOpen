<p id="Par43" class="p">The different extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> were also used to determine their antioxidant capacities from the formation of the green phosphomolybdenum complex. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were referenced to that of ascorbic acid in terms of equivalence by calculating the AEAC value. This method is based on the reduction of molybdenum from an oxidation state of VI to an oxidation state of V in the presence of an antioxidant. This reduction is materialized by the formation of a greenish complex detectable in the visible region at 695 nm at an acidic pH [

 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> EOs are potent antioxidants, while their phenolic extracts have the lowest potential to reduce molybdenum. The 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> oil recorded the highest AEAC, which surpassed vitamin E’s AEAC under the same experimental conditions. This result may be attributed to the chemical composition of the
