Considerable attention has been focused on the determination of total antioxidant capacity using the antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid in terms of equivalence and reflected in the AEAC, defined as the concentration of ascorbic acid (μg/mL) that gives an antioxidant power equivalent to that of a concentration of 1 mg/mL of the EO and EE. A high AEAC indicates a notable antioxidant capacity [
