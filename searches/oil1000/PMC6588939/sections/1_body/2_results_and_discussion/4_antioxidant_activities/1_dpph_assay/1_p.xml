<p id="Par40" class="p">DPPH is a stable radical that appears purple in solution and has an absorbance maximum at 515 nm. Upon reduction, its colour changes into yellow with a concomitant decrease in absorbance at 515 nm. The colour change is monitored spectrophotometrically and is utilized for the determination of antioxidant capacity [

 <bold class="bold">.</bold> To evaluate the different antioxidant potentials of the phenolic extracts and essential oils, their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, as determined by the DPPH assay, were compared to the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the reference compound ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in mg/mL. The results are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The ethanolic extracts demonstrated excellent DPPH radical-scavenging activities. Generally, the activity associated with the 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> extract was stronger than that associated with the 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> extract, and both extracts had less activity than ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.002 ± 3.826 × 10
 <sup class="sup">− 6</sup> mg/mL). For the essential oils, the strongest activity was associated with the 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> oil, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 1.437 mg/mL, followed by BHA (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 1.437 mg/mL) and the 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 16.296 mg/mL). However, all examined samples were less active than the standard antioxidant ascorbic acid.
