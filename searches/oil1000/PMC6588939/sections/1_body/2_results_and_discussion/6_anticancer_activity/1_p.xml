<p id="Par45" class="p">The in vitro antiproliferative effects of the ethanolic extracts and essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic> were assessed on five human cancer cell lines, namely human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the human adenocarcinoma HeLa cell line, the human prostate cancer PC3 
 <italic class="italic">cell line</italic>, and the human leukaemia K56S cell line. The observed antiproliferative activities on the examined cell lines are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> as LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, referring to the concentration at which cancer cell survival was reduced by 50%. The dose-dependent curves obtained by nonlinear regression were used to calculate the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values. Doxorubicin, a well-known anticancer agent, was used as a positive control and demonstrated LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values ranging from 1-20 μg/mL against the different cancer cell lines used in this study. Generally, the essential oils from both plants were much more effective in suppressing cancer cell growth than the ethanolic extracts.
