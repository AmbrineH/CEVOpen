<p id="Par47" class="p">In summary, the chemical composition of ethanolic extracts and essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus algeriensis</italic> cultivated in the Algerian Saharan Atlas was reported for the first time in this study. A rich flavonoid content of the EEs of both plants was revealed by HPLC analysis of the phenolic compounds. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that linalool (52.1%) and linalyl acetate (19.1%) are the major compounds in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum,</italic> while α-terpinyl acetate (47.4%), neryl acetate (9.6%), and α-pinene (6.8%) were identified as the major compounds in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">T. algeriensis</italic>. Additionally, diverse bioactivities of the ethanolic extracts and essential oils from both plants were observed against a range of clinically relevant strains of microorganisms, with enhanced activities against gram-positive bacteria. The essential oils from both plants were much more potent in inhibiting cancer cell growth than the ethanolic extracts. Moderate antioxidant activities were elucidated, suggesting their potential for use in pharmaceutical industries and food production technologies.
