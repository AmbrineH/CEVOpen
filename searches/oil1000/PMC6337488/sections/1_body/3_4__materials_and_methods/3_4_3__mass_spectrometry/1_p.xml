<p class="p">The EOs were analyzed with a PerkinElmer TurboMass detector (quadrupole, PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France), directly coupled to a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL (PerkinElmer), equipped with a fused silica gel capillary column (50 m × 0.22 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm), BP-1 (dimethylpolysiloxane). Carrier gas, helium at 0.8 mL/min; split: 1/75; injection volume: 0.5 µL; injector temperature: 250 °C; oven temperature programmed from 60 to 220 °C at 2 °C/min and then held isothermal (20 min); ion source temperature: 250 °C; energy ionization: 70 eV; electron ionization mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 40–400 Da.</p>
