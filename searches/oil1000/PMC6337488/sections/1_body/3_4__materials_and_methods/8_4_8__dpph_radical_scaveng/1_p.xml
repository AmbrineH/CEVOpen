<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was measured on a sample of EO (Collective sample Fesdis F1–6). The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO was measured on the basis to scavenge of the 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>) free radical, according to the experimental protocol of Blois [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. A volume of 2.5 mL with various concentrations (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125 and 0.015625 mg/mL) of the EO in absolute ethanol were added to 1 mL of an ethanolic solution of DPPH at 0.03 mg/mL. For each concentration, a blank was prepared. In parallel, a negative control is prepared by mixing 2.5 mL of absolute ethanol with 1 mL of ethanolic solution of DPPH. After incubation in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured against a blank at 517 nm. The activity of the EO was compared to ascorbic acid as a positive control. DPPH free radical scavenging activity in percentage (%) was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">DPPH scavenging activity (%) = [(A
  <sub class="sub">control</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">control</sub>] × 100
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>with: A
 <sub class="sub">control</sub> is the absorbance of the negative control; A
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of the tested sample.
