<p class="p">GC analyses were performed on a Clarus 500 FID gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France) equipped two fused silica gel capillary columns (50 m × 0.22 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm), BP-1 (polydimethylsiloxane) and BP-20 (polyethylene glycol). The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 220 °C at 2 °C/min and then held isothermal at 220 °C for 20 min, injector temperature: 250 °C; detector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: hydrogen (1.0 mL/min); split: 1/60. The relative proportions of the oil constituents were expressed as percentages obtained by peak area normalization, without using correcting factors. Retention indices (RIs) were determined relative to the retention times of a series of
