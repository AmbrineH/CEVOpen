 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR analyses were performed on an AVANCE 400 Fourier Transform spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) operating at 100.623 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, equipped with a 5 mm probe, in CDCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, with all shifts referred to internal tetramethylsilane (TMS). 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded with the following parameters: pulse width (PW): 4 µs (flip angle 45°); acquisition time: 2.73 s for 128 K data table with a spectral width (SW) of 220.000 Hz (220 ppm); CPD mode decoupling; digital resolution 0.183 Hz/pt. The number of accumulated scans ranged 2000–3000 for each sample (around 40 mg of oil in 0.5 mL of CDCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>). Exponential line broadening multiplication (1.0 Hz) of the free induction decay was applied before Fourier transformation.
