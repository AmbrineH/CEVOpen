<p class="p">A composite oil sample (F1 to F6, Fesdis; 247.9 mg) was submitted to flash chromatography (silica gel: 35–70 µm). Nine fractions (Fr1-Fr9) were eluted with a mixture of solvents of increasing polarity (pentane:diethyl ether, 100:0 to 0:100, and pure methanol); Fr1 (10.3 mg) and Fr2 (12.6 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 98:2; Fr3 (9.2 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 95:5 Fr4 (14.4 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 90:10 Fr5 (18.8 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 75:25 Fr6 (86.5 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 50:50 Fr7 (18.7 mg); pentane:Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 0:100; Fr8 (22.3 mg) and pure methanol, Fr9 (15.6 mg). All fractions of chromatography were analyzed by GC (RI), GC/MS and
