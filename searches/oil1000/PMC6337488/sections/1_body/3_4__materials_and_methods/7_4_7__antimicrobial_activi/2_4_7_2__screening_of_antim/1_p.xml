 <sup class="sup">4</sup> spores/mL for filamentous fungi) was spread on the solid media plates, using Mueller–Hinton agar for bacteria, Sabouraud dextrose for yeasts and PDA for filamentous fungi. Filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 15 μL of the oil and 5 μL of DMSO and placed on the surface of inoculated plates. The activity was determined by measuring the inhibitory zone diameter in mm after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C for bacteria, 24–48 h at 30 °C for yeasts and 3 to 5 days at 25 °C for filamentous fungi. Fluconazole (FLU 25 µg/disc), nystatin (NY 30 µg/disc) were used as reference antifungal against yeasts and filamentous fungi and chloramphenicol (CHL 30 μg/disc), ciprofloxacin (CIP 10 μg/disc), gentamicin (GMN 10 µg/disc), vancomycin (VAN 30 µg/disc) were used as positive controls against bacteria. DMSO was used as negative control. Each test was performed in duplicate or in triplicate.
