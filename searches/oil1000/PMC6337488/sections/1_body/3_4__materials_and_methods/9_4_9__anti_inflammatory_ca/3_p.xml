<p class="p">The LOX inhibition assays were performed by mixing 10 µL of LOX solution with 10 µL of inhibitor solution in 970 µL of boric acid buffer (0.2 M; pH 9.0) and incubating them briefly at room temperature. The reaction started by addition of 10 µL of substrate solution (Linoleic acid, 25 mM) and the velocity was recorded for 30 s at 234 nm. One assay was measured in absence of inhibitor solution and one assay was measured with DMSO mixed with distilled water (99.85% of DMSO in distilled water) which made it possible to eliminate the inhibition effect of DMSO. No inhibitor effect of DMSO on the LOX activity was detected and the LOX activity measured without inhibitor solution was considered as control (100% enzymatic reaction). All assays were performed on triplicate. The percentage of lipoxygenase inhibition was calculated according to the equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Inhibition % = (V
  <sub class="sub">0control</sub> − V
  <sub class="sub">0sample</sub>) × 100/V
  <sub class="sub">0control</sub>
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>V
 <sub class="sub">0control</sub> is the activity of LOX in absence of inhibitor solution and V
 <sub class="sub">0sample</sub> is the activity of LOX in presence of inhibitor solution [
