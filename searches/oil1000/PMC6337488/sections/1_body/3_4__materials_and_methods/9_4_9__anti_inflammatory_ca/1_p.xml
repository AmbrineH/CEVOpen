The in vitro analysis for lipoxygenase inhibitory activity was performed using Lipoxidase type I–B (Lipoxygenase, LOX, EC 1.13.11.12) from Glycine max (soybean) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chimie (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). It was determined by kinetic mode of spectrophotometric determination method, which was performed by recording the rate of change in absorbance at 234 nm. Indeed, the increase of absorbance at 234 nm due to formation of 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic acid (substrate used for LOX inhibition activity assay) [
