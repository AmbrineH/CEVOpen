 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00204" class="xref">Table S1</xref>), in which the plan defined by the two axes F1 and F2 described 51.05% of the total variance of the population (the two axes F1 and F2 accounted for 31.70% and 19.35%. respectively). It may be noted that the composition of all samples was qualitatively quite similar. Although the compositions of the individual samples varied substantially for various components, it was not possible to distinguish groups within the essential oil samples. Therefore, one main group (16 samples) and differentiated two atypical compositions (B5 and B6, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00204-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) were observed. Indeed, B5 and B6 were discriminated by a high percentage of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (bicyclogermacrene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bisabolene, γ-curcumene) and particularly germacrene D, 25.3% (B5) and 20.2% (B6) vs. 0–7.5% for the other samples. All the samples from the Fesdis location were homogeneous, while the composition of the samples from the Hamla location appeared much less homogeneous. Conversely, it appeared that the Bouilef samples, located between the two others locations (Fesdis and Hamla) were different, so two samples (B3 and B4) were aggregated to those of the Fesdis location, whereas the two samples B1 and B2 were quite similar to the Hamla samples (
