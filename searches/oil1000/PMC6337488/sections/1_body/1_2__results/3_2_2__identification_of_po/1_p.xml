<p class="p">In this study, the identification of four compounds proposed by the MS library was achieved. These compounds were presumed to be two pairs of stereoisomers (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> = 200 and 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> = 198) corresponding to spiroacetalenol derivatives. Indeed, polyacetylene compounds are commonly found in the Asteraceae family [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The identification of these compounds was achieved by 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy after fractionation (fractions Fr4 and Fr6, see Experimental part) by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tonghaosu (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> = 200) were identified by comparison with data previously described by Chanotiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-(2′,4′-Hexadiynylidene)-1,6-dioxaspiro[4.4]-nona-3,7-diene was identified according to literature data [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00204" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>). In the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of Fr4 in which the 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> ratio was close to 8/1 (46.6%/6.3%), a series of 13 peaks corresponding to the 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> isomer was observed. It is the first time that the four spiroacetalenol derivatives [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] were identified in an EO from 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic>. The contents of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-(2′,4′-hexadiynylidene)-1,6-dioxaspiro[4.4]-nona-3,7-diene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tonghaosu reached 7.3% (B3) and 3.8% (B6), respectively. These compounds were previously reported in EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Chrysanthemum coronarium</italic> L. (aerial parts) [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] and in some solvent extracts from
