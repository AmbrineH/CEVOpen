<p class="p">Aerial parts of wild

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> vs. dry material varied drastically from sample to sample ranging from 0.03 to 0.17% even within a location (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00204" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). As it could be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00204" class="xref">Table S1</xref>, the highest yields were obtained from Hamla (0.08–0.14%, samples H1–6) and Bouilef (0.15%, sample B5 and 0.17%, sample B6) and the lower from Bouilef and Fesdis (0.03% for samples B2, B4 and F6).
