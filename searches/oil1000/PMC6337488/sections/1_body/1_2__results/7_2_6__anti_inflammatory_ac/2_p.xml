<p class="p">The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO to inhibit soybean lipoxygenase was determined as an indication of potential anti-inflammatory activity. 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO exhibited an inhibition of LOX activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00204-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The percentage of inhibition increases with the concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO, i.e., 23.4% at 0.015 mg/mL to 57.6% at 0.075 mg/mL of EO. No LOX activity could be detected in the presence of 0.1 mg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO, suggesting almost complete inhibition of LOX activity. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (concentration at which 50% of the lipoxygenase was inhibited) were determined for the 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO and for the non-competitive inhibitor of lipoxygenase, the nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> essential oil (0.065 ± 0.004 mg/mL) is 5-fold higher than IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of NDGA (0.013 ± 0.003 mg/mL).
