<p class="p">The anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO was evaluated by determining its ability to inhibit lipoxygenases (LOX). Indeed, LOXs are a non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases that convert linoleic, arachidonic and other polyunsaturated fatty acid into biologically active metabolites involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. Several inflammatory processes such as arthritis, bronchial asthma and cancer are associated with an important production of leukotrienes catalysed by LOX pathway from arachidonic acid [

The inhibition of the LOX pathway with inhibitors of LOX would prevent the production of leukotrienes and therefore could constitute a therapeutic target for treating of human inflammation-related diseases. Thus, the search for new LOX inhibitors appears us critical because many of which exhibit significant anti-inflammatory activity.
