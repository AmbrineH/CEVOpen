 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00204" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>. The EO of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> have a high antioxidant activity at concentrations of 32, 64, 128 and 256 mg/mL, with inhibition percentages ranged between 85.54 ± 2.17% and 100 ± 0.00% and an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 1.51 ± 0.04 mg/mL. However, the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO was found to be low than that of ascorbic acid (positive control), with a percentage inhibition of 100%, at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and a significantly lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.02 ± 0.0005 mg/mL.
