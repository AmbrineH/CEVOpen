<p class="p">The oil was considered active when the diameter of inhibition zone was equal to or greater than 13 mm [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The agar diffusion method showed that the oil was effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the two yeasts and the three filamentous fungi with diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 13.0 mm to 19.7 mm. The most potent activity was demonstrated against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> with inhibition zones of 19.7 mm and 17.5 mm respectively. In contrast, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> were not inhibited by the EO. This assumption is in accordance with previous studies on the 
 <italic class="italic">Santolina</italic> genus. Indeed, the 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO which contained acenaphtane (25.23%), calarene (21.54%), ocimene (17.44%) as its major components, exhibited a moderate or low activity against the same microorganisms with diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 6.50 mm to 20.15 mm. 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were the most susceptible to this EO, with inhibition zones of 20.15 and 19.5 mm, respectively [
