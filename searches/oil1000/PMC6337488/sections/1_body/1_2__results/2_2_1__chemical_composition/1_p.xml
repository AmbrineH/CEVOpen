<p class="p">Aerial parts oils samples were submitted to GC-FID analysis, to determine the retention indices (RIs) of the EO components on two columns of different polarity and to GC/MS analysis. Further analysis by 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR confirmed the identification of the main components. To allow the identification of four polyacetylene derivatives present at moderate or low levels, a composite sample (F1 to F6) was submitted to column chromatography (CC) over silica gel. Nine fractions were obtained and analyzed by GC-FID, GC/MS and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR. In total, 91 components accounting for 92.4% and 96.1% of the whole oil chemical composition were identified (

 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EOs is generally homogeneous; the oils were found to possess little differences in the chemical composition but considerable variation in the levels of the individual components. All the samples were characterized by high proportions of monoterpenes (51.5–69.7%), except three samples: B4, B5 and F6 which were dominated by sesquiterpenes (44.3–55.9%). The main components were germacrene D (0.1–25.3%), myrcene (4.2–20.9%), spathulenol (2.5–20.7%), α-bisabolol (2.2–20.0%), β-pinene (2.4–18.7%), 1,8-cineole (5.0–16.8%), 
 <italic class="italic">ci</italic>s-chrysanthenol (0.7–16.5%), capillene (0.1–16.9%), santolina alcohol (0.2–14.0%), camphor (0.2–7.9%), terpinen-4-ol (1.8–7.3%) and lyratol (0.1–6.7%). Other two oxygenated monoterpenes: lyratal (tr-2.7%) and chrysanthenone (tr-4.5%), three sesquiterpene hydrocarbons: α-curcumene (0.3–3.2%), γ-curcumene (0.1–2.6%) and bicyclogermacrene (0.1–6.3%) as well as two oxygenated sesquiterpenes: β-elemol (up to 3.5%) and β-eudesmol (tr-3.0%) were present in appreciable amounts. Then, one sample for each location (B1, F5 and H1) and five other samples which exhibited various compositions (B3, B4, B5, B6 and H6) were presented in
