<p class="p">For instance, the content of capillene (a polyacetylene derivative) reached 16.9% in sample H6 vs. (0.2–7.5%) for the other samples of Hamla and vs. (tr-0.4%) for the samples of Fesdis and Bouilef. The samples B3 and B4 were characterized a high amount of oxygenated sesquiterpenes: spathulenol (15.1% and 20.7%, respectively) associated with α-bisabolol (13.2% and 20.0%, respectively). In the last two atypical samples (B5 and B6), a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (germacrene D) was present as main compound (25.3 and 20.2%. respectively) vs. (0.0–7.5%) for all other samples.</p>
