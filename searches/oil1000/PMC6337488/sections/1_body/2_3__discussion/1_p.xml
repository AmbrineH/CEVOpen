<p class="p">The composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> aerial part oils isolated from plants growing wild in eastern Algeria (Batna) was different from those reported for oils from Morocco [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], Tunisia [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and Algeria (Constantine) [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], but it should be pointed that a similar composition has been reported for flowerhead oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chamaecyparissus</italic> from Tunisia, which also contained 1,8-cineole, β-eudesmol (10.49%), terpinen-4-ol (6.97%), spathulenol (5.80%), camphor (5.27%) and germacrene D (5.03%) as major components [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Other compounds also occurred as main constituents: δ-cadinene (6.55%) and myrtenol (4.26%) which are present at low amounts in all our samples (tr-0.4%).
