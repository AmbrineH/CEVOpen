<p class="p">We can assume that the moderate or low antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> EO is related to one or various major components: 1,8-cineole (12.8%), germacrene D (7.2%), spathulenol (6.2%), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-chrysanthenol (6.0%), myrcene (5.8%), β-pinene (5.2%), α-bisabolol (5.2%), terpinen-4-ol (3.2%), santolina alcohol (3.1%), lyratol (2.4%), capillene (2.2%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bisabolene (2.0%), limonene (1.9%), camphor (1.6%) and β-elemol (1.4%). 1,8-Cineole was previously described as antibacterial against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] while myrcene which accounted for 57.2% in the fraction Fr1 [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] was already reported as ineffective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It has been reported also that β-pinene, α-pinene and germacrene D had slight activity against a panel of microorganisms. Indeed, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus nigra</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">pallasiana</italic> (α-pinene. 42.3%; germacrene D. 30.6%) exhibited a low antimicrobial activity against the same strains with MICs in the range 10–20 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], so it has been demonstrated in the literature that the inhibitory activity of an EO results from a complex interaction between its different constituents, which may produce additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects, even for those present at low concentrations, i.e., 1,8-cineole in combination with camphor has shown higher antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In parallel, Lemos et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] reported that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> which contained camphor (24.4–35.9%) as major compound exhibited a high antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with MICs in the range 0.5–2.0 µL/mL. Otherwise, an interesting antimicrobial activity of a lyratol-rich fraction (84%) was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (19 mm), suggesting that lyratol could be the main responsive of the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Santolina corsica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It has been summarized also that oxygenated terpenes, as well as alcohols which are present in appreciable amounts in our oil, are active but with differing specificity and levels of activity [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
