<p class="p">In previous studies, Derouiche et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] reported a percentage inhibition of the free radical DPPH of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> flower EO of about 13.80% at a concentration of 0.1 M, a value much lower than ascorbic acid (more than 70% of inhibition) used as a positive control. Nouasri et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] evaluated the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chamaecyparissus</italic> using two methods, the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> free radical scavenging test and the β-carotene bleaching test. They reported that 
 <italic class="italic">S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO had low antioxidant capacity to reduce DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> radical with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of about 43.01 ± 8.04 mg/mL, compared to BHT (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.072 ± 0.001 mg/mL) and ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.004 ± 0.001 mg/mL). The β-carotene bleaching test revealed that the EO had a moderate activity with a percentage inhibition of the oxidation of linoleic acid of the order of 47.00 ± 3.13%, a value that is higher than that of ascorbic acid tested (11.05%), but much lower than BHT (96.92%).
