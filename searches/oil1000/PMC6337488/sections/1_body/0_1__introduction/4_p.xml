<p class="p">Conversely, only five studies have reported on the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> oil. The chemical composition of the volatile compounds isolated from various parts of the plant have been substantially investigated. Fdil et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] compared the chemical composition of three oil samples isolated from different organs (stems, leaves and flowers) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> plants harvested in Marrakech province (Morocco). The three samples oils exhibited respectively a composition dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes: camphor (69.14%/71.36%/80.44%), borneol (20.33%/18.13%/12.34%) and bornyl acetate (7.08%/8.12%/3.50%). The stem oil contained also noticeable amounts of α-humulene (3.14%) while the flowers oil exhibited an appreciable content of 1,8-cineole (3.32%). Another aerial part oil sample of Moroccan origin exhibited a similar composition, with camphor (54.3%), borneol (17.24%), bornyl acetate (8.61%) and 1,8-cineole (5.27%) as main components [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. A Tunisian oil sample (stems and leaves) was characterized by a high content of terpinen-4-ol (54.96%), followed by α-terpineol (14.06%) and borneol (8.37%) [

 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic>, only two studies are reported in the literature. An oil sample (flowers) harvested in Constantine province (Algeria) was dominated by acenaphtane (25.23%), calarene (21.54%) and ocimene (17.44%) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. A drastically different composition has been reported for an aerial parts oil sample collected in the same region, β-eudesmol (14.58%) and β-pinene (12.78%) being the major compounds, followed by 1,8-cineole (10.02%), curcumene (7.96%), myrcene (6.94%) and spathulenol (5.96%) [
