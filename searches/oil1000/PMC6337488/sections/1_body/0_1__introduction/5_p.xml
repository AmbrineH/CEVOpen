<p class="p">It appears from literature data that the essential oil (EO) from aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic> exhibits a tremendous chemical variability. Moreover, most of the papers reported on the analyses of only one or two oil samples and obviously, the reported compositions are not always representative of 
 <italic class="italic">S. africana</italic>. Thus, the aim of the present work is to characterize the EO produced by this plant growing wild in Batna province (Algeria). Eighteen oil samples isolated from aerial parts at full flowering stage harvested in three locations have been analyzed by GC, GC/MS and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR. Then, the biological activities of the EO have been investigated as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, this latter has never been investigated in any previous papers.
