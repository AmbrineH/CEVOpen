 <p class="p">The chemical composition of 18 oil samples of 
  <italic class="italic">Santolina africana</italic> isolated from aerial parts at full flowering, collected in three locations in eastern Algeria was determined by GC(RI), GC/MS and 
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR analysis. The major components were: germacrene D, myrcene, spathulenol, α-bisabolol, β-pinene, 1,8-cineole, 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-chrysanthenol, capillene, santolina alcohol, camphor, terpinen-4-ol and lyratol. The chemical composition appeared homogeneous and characterized by the occurrence of four derivatives which exhibited a conjugated alkene dialkyne moiety. They were identified for the first time in an essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">S. africana.</italic> The collective oil sample exhibited moderate antimicrobial and antioxidant activities whereas the anti-inflammatory activity presented a real potential. IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 
  <italic class="italic">Santolina africana</italic> essential oil (0.065 ± 0.004 mg/mL) is 5-fold higher than IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of NDGA used as positive control.
