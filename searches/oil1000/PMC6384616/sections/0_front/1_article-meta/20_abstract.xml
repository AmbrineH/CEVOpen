 <p class="p">The essential oil (EO) of 
  <italic class="italic">Xanthium strumarium</italic> L. leaves (family: Asteraceae) was extracted by hydrodistillation, and then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Forty-three essential compounds were identified. The sesquiterpenoids represented the major constituents (72.4%), including oxygenated (61.78%) and non-oxygenated (10.62%) sesquiterpenes, followed by monoterpenes (25.19%). The diterpenoids and oxygenated hydrocarbons were determined as minor compounds. The main constituents of the EO were 1,5-dimethyltetralin (14.27%), eudesmol (10.60%), l-borneol (6.59%), ledene alcohol (6.46%), (-)-caryophyllene oxide (5.36%), isolongifolene, 7,8-dehydro-8a-hydroxy (5.06%), L-bornyl acetate (3.77%), and aristolene epoxide (3.58%). A comparative analysis was stated here between the EO of Egyptian 
  <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> and those previously reported from Pakistan, Iran, and Brazil based on chemometic tools such as principal components analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The EO of 
  <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> showed weak 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity with IC

  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was comparable to ascorbic acid as a reference. However, the EO exhibited significant allelopathic potential regarding the germination and growth of the noxious weed 
  <italic class="italic">Bidens pilosa</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, further study is recommended to characterize the EO from 
  <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> as an eco-friendly green bioherbicide against weeds, as well as determine their mode of actions.
