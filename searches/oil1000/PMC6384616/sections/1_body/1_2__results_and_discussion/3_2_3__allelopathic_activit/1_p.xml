 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), the germination of seeds, root, and shoot growth were inhibited by 97.34%, 98.45%, and 93.56%, respectively. This strong inhibition could be attributed to the major compounds reported in the EO such as eudesmol, (-)-spathulenol, l-borneol, ledene alcohol, caryophyllene oxide, isolongifolene, 7,8-dehydro-8a-hydroxy, and aristolene epoxide, where these compounds may act either singular or synergetic as allelopathic agents against weeds. These are mainly oxygenated sesquiterpenes where they were reported to have various biological activities, including allelopathic activity [
