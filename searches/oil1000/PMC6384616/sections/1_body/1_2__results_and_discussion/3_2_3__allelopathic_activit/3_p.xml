 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> is a noxious weed species, where it reduces the yield in several crops due to its fast growth and potential competitive activity [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. It is worth mentioning here that the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> in the present study revealed double fold the allelopathic activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> than those from 
 <italic class="italic">Cullen plicata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, we can say that the 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> EO could be considered as a potential green source for bioherbicides, at least against the noxious weed 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic>; it can also be integrated into the eco-friendly weed control strategies. However, further investigation is needed in order to characterize its mode of actions, as well as the biosafety in the application at the field level.
