<p class="p">The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the EO exhibited that this plant is very enriched with monoterpenoids (25.19%), including both non-oxygenated (14.27%) and oxygenated (10.92%) types. Non-oxygenated monoterpenes are represented by only one compound (1,5-dimethyltetralin). However, the oxygenated monoterpenes were represented by l-borneol (6.59%) and L-bornyl acetate (3.77%) as majors, while Î±-terpinyl acetate (0.56%) was detected as a minor.</p>
