<p class="p">The sesquiterpenes represented the major components by a ratio of 72.40%. The identified sesquiterpenoids were classified into two classes, including oxygenated and non-oxygenated types with a ratio of 61.78% and 10.62% respectively. The major constituents in the identified non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes were 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-cadinene (1.36%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-calacorene (1.34%), and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-selinene (1.16%), but 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-himachalene (0.29%) was identified as a minor one. However, eudesmol (10.60%), ledene alcohol (6.46%), (-)-caryophyllene oxide (5.36%), and isolongifolene 7,8-dehydro-8a-hydroxy (5.06%) represented the main components of the oxygenated sesquiterpenes. Also, aristolene epoxide (3.58%), calarene epoxide (3.52%), and aristolone (2.84%) were identified with high ratios from the total mass of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, while 9-methoxycalamenene (0.22%) represented the minor component.
