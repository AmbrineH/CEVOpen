<p class="p">Several reports described the constituents and biological activities of EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> collected from Pakistan [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], Iran [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and Brazil [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In harmony with our study, all of them are very commonly enriched with different classes of essential compounds, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. According to these previous studies, we described here for the first time the chemical constituents of the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> collected from Egypt. Our findings were in agreement with those previously reported studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00584-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Esmaeili et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and Sharifi-Rad et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported that the EO from leaves of Iranian (Iran-Sistan and Iran-Lurestan) 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> are enriched with mono and sesquiterpenes as two main classes of components by 46.60% and 47.81%, respectively, in addition of diterpenes and hydrocarbons as minors. Parveen et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] described that the monoterpenoids are main components (55.80%), followed by sesquiterpenes (26.40%), in addition to diterpenes and hydrocarbons as minors in the EO from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> collected from Pakistan. However, the EO of leaves of Brazilian 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> was stated to include the sesquiterpenes as main components (88.13%) in addition to monoterpenes (4.00%) without any diterpenes and hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, our study exhibited that the EO of leaves of Egyptian 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> were close to the EO of Brazilian ecospecies, in which the sesquiterpenes are the main components (72.40%). Meanwhile, our findings deduced that the Egyptian species are similar to the Pakistani and Iranian species in which the monoterpenes (25.19%) represent the second major components, followed by the minors of hydrocarbons and diterpenes (
