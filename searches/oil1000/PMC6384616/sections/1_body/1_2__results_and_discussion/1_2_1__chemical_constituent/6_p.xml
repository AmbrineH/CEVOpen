<p class="p">The chemical composition of EOs is complex and very rich with several bioactive substances [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, hydrocarbons, and their aldehyde and phenolic derivatives. The concentrations and chemical constituents of EOs of the aromatic herbal plants depended upon several environmental factors such as plant species, geographical sources, soil, climatic conditions, weather, seasons of the year, and vegetative cycle stages [
