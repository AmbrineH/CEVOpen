<p class="p">In conclusion of our chemical study, the variations of the chemical composition of extracted EOs from plant species often occur, since the production of metabolites, involving EOs, is substantially influenced by environmental factors such as seasonality, age, plant development, circadian rhythm, temperature, water availability, altitude, nutrients, atmospheric composition, the different plant organs, and attack of pathogens and herbivores [
