<p class="p">The major compounds of the Egyptian ecospecies (1,5-dimethyltetralin, eudesmol, (-)-spathulenol, l-borneol, ledene alcohol, caryophyllene oxide, isolongifolene, 7,8-dehydro-8a-hydrox-, and aristolene epoxide) had high positive loading on PC1. However, spathulenol seems to be more correlated with the Pakistani ecospecies than the Egyptian species.</p>
