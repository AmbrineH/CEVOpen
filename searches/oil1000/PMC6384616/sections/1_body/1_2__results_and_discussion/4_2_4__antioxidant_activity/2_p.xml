<p class="p">In our study, the capabilities of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> essential oil to donate hydrogen atoms or electrons were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The ability of the tested oil to possess antioxidant activity by the reduction of DPPH to diphenyl-picrylhydrazine (the yellow-colored product), and decreasing the absorbance at 517 nm comparable to ascorbic acid as a reference antioxidant agent. Our evaluation result exhibited that the EO of
