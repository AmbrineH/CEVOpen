<p class="p">Mata et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] reported that the weak DPPH radical scavenging activity of the terpene components can be attributed to them not having the ability to donate hydrogen atoms and their low solubility in the medium of the assay. Thus, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> exhibiting weak activity can be attributed to the main constituents of the oil being almost monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. According to Viuda-Martos et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], these previous factors may be the main limitation of measuring the DPPH radical scavenging activity of lipophilic samples, similar to many essential oils. In addition, Ruberto and Baratta [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], the presence of methylene group molecules may play an important role in increasing the antioxidant behavior. So, the weak antioxidant activity of EO of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> is attributed to the major compounds in this oil being monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and/or substituted oxygenated ones. Our finding is consistent with that reported from the EO extracted from the Brazilian ecospecies of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>].
