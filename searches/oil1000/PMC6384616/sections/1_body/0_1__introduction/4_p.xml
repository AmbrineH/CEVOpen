<p class="p">According to our knowledge, no study has yet revealed the composition of EOs from Egypt. Herein, the goals of our study were (i) identification of the chemical constituents of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> leaves collected from Egypt, (ii) comparison the EO of Egyptian 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> with those previously documented from Pakistan, Iran, and Brazil, depending upon principal components analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), (iii) evaluation of the allelopathic potential of the EO on the germination and growth of the noxious weed 
 <italic class="italic">Bidens pilosa</italic> and (iv) assessment of antioxidant activity of the EO.
