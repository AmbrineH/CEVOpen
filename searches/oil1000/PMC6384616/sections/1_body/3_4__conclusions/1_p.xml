<p class="p">The present study revealed that the chemical composition of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic>, an Egyptian ecospecies, was different from other ecospecies reported from Pakistan, Iran, and Brazil. This difference could be attributed to the variation in climatic and environmental conditions. The Egyptian 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> ecospecies EO contained 43 compounds with major constituents related to sesquiterpenoids. The main constituents were 1,5-dimethyltetralin, eudesmol, l-borneol, ledene alcohol, (-)-caryophyllene oxide, isolongifolene, 7,8-dehydro-8a-hydroxy, L-bornyl acetate, and aristolene epoxide. The EO showed weak antioxidant activity. However, the EO showed strong allelopathic activity against the weed, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic>, which considered as strong nuisance weeds. Therefore, further study is recommended to characterize the mode of actions of the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> as well as determine the biosafety of the integration of this EO as a bioherbicide in agricultural practices as an eco-friendly, green tool.
