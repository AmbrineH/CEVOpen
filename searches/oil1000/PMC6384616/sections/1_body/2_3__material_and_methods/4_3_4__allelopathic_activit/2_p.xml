Subsequently, 20 seeds were transferred to sterilized Petri plates (nine centimeters) lined with two layers of Whatman No. 1 filter papers. An aliquot of four mL of either the EOs or Tween as control was added to the plates and sealed with a Parafilm
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> tape (Sigma, USA) and kept at 27°C in a growth chamber (Abd El-Gawad, 2016).
