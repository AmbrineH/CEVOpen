<p class="p">The EO of the fresh leaves (300 g) of 
 <italic class="italic">X. strumarium</italic> (0.021 mL) was extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours. The oily layer was separated using diethyl ether and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (0.5 g). This extraction was repeated two times, which afforded two samples of EO. The extracted two samples of EO were stored in sealed air-tight glass vials at 4 ÂºC until further analysis.
