<p class="p">The EO components of the two extracted samples were analyzed separately and identified depending upon GC-MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis of the EO samples were carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument stands at the Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Center, Dokki, Giza, Egypt with the following specifications, Instrument: a TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific Corp., Miami, CA, USA), coupled with a thermo mass spectrometer detector (ISQ Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer; Model ISQ spectrometer, THERMO Scientific Corp. ). The GC-MS system was equipped with a TR-5 MS column (30 m × 0.32 mmi.d., 0.25-μm film thickness, THERMO Scientific Corp. ). Analyses were carried out using helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
