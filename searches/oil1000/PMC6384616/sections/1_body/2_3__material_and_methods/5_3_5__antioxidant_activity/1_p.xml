<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the EO was measured based on the radical scavenging activity of the stable radical, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the methods of Miguel [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-00584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. A reaction mixture of one mL of different concentrations of the EO and an equal volume of the alcoholic solution of 0.3 mM of DPPH were prepared, mixed well, and incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature (25 Â°C). In addition, various concentrations of ascorbic (standard antioxidant) were subjected to the same procedures. The absorbance at 517 nm was determined using a spectrophotometer (Spectronic 21D model, Milton Roy, CA, USA). The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, which is the amount of material necessary to decrease the absorbance of DPPH by 50%, was calculated graphically.
