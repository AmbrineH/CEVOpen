<p class="p">In this paper, we have reported a potentiometric e-Tongue based on polymeric coatings obtained from pyrrole- and aminophenyl-substituted porphyrins for Apulian red wines recognition and defects qualitative evaluation. The results obtained indicate a potential utility of the developed e-Tongue system as an effective tool of wine brand uniformity control, permitting an inexpensive, rapid and accurate monitoring of several fault compounds in concentrations higher than the maximum permitted amount.</p>
