 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-sensors-18-02584" class="xref">Figure S1</xref> the clear differences in sensors responses upon the concentration variation mainly of benzaldehyde, acetic acid and isoamyl alcohol. In fact, PLS1 regression method applied for e-Tongue calibration has shown a good correlation between the amount of added defect compound and potentiometric response of array with the correlation coefficients R
