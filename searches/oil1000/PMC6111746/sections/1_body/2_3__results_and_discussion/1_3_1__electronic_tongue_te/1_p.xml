<p class="p">The porphyrin electropolymers for e-Tongue have been chosen thanks to their particular binding properties when interacting with metal cations (for free base-porphyrins) or several anions (for porphyrin metallic complexes). Moreover, the enhanced cross-sensitivity of porphyrin electropolymers was shown recently and was one of the main criteria for the compounds
