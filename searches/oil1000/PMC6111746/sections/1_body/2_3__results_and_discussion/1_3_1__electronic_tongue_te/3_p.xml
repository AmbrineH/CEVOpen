<p class="p">ME arises as a reduction “off-odour” defect attributable to heavy sulphur compounds (as methionine), present in the must and providing an unpleasant odour of cooked cabbage. The ME formation occurs via methionine deamination and decarboxylation, followed by methional aldehyde formation, which is then enzymatically reduced to ME. ME perception threshold is 1.2 mg/L and higher concentrations are considered as a wine defect. IA is also called “fusel oil” and it is formed by yeast metabolism during alcoholic fermentation process from sugars and from amino acids (Erlich mechanism). IA is the major higher alcohol found in wines (more than 50%) and its concentration in wine has been reported in the range of 90 to 292 mg/L. IA may influence aromatic wine profile and hence its amount must be controlled. BA is the marker of the yeast activity in wine, it arises from enzymatic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by yeasts (especially 
 <italic class="italic">Schizosaccharomyces japponicus</italic>). The typical BA concentration in wine varies significantly, usually being 0.015 mg/L but it may rich up to 6 mg/L; while olfactory threshold is 1.5–3.5 mg/L. BA provides to wine aroma and taste of bitter almonds; BA concentrations higher than 3 mg/L are considered as a wine defect. AA in wine is often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or vinegar taint and it can originate from many wine spoilage yeasts and bacteria and forms either as by-product of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine by acetic acid bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">Acetobacter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gluconobacter</italic>. Further during the esterification with ethanol, AA produces ethyl acetate and together this fault compounds give to wine a smell of vinegar, paint thinner and nail polish remover. The typical concentration of acetic acid in wine is in the range of 100–1150 mg/L, the sensory threshold for acetic acid is 700 mg/L; in concentrations greater than 1.2–1.3 g/L it becomes to be unpleasant.
