<p class="p">No tests on sensors sensitivity towards wine defect compounds were performed previously; for this reason, as a first task of the present work we have evaluated the e-Tongue array response toward several compounds responsible for the wine organoleptic faults: methionol (ME), isoamyl alcohol (IA), benzaldehyde (BA) and acetic acid (AA) in a wide range of concentrations (from maximum permitted or alarm levels in wine to the amounts in several times higher than the olfactory or taste threshold) [
 <xref rid="B1-sensors-18-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The artificial wine solution was employed as background in order to mimic the real wine composition and to obtain as much reliable results, as possible. The amounts of wine defect compounds in artificial wine calibration solutions and in Negroamaro wine (NA14) used as real wine sample with adulterations are listed in
