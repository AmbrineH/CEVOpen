<p class="p">Primitivo and Negroamaro are typical grape varieties of Apulia region of Italy. These grapes have a prevalent bitter taste and are generally employed for blending but they can also be used to produce monocultivar wines, which require ageing in order to receive a balanced, well recognized test. During the aging process, several aroma compounds arise in wines mainly from the grapes itself, from oak barrels or as the fermentation products. An enhanced concentration of these compounds may result in wine organoleptic faults. The wine samples listed in 
 <xref rid="sensors-18-02584-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> were previously tested by SPE/GC–MS analysis and more than 50 volatile compounds were correctly identified (for Primitivo wines), 36 of them were present from 0.1 to 100 mg/L range, whereas the leftover 15 were present in not quantifiable traces [

Moreover, in the same paper an Electronic nose device based on eight Si-based MOX microsensors (Silsens SA, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, MSGS 4001-3005-3004-3003-3007 series) and chemometric PCA method were employed to distinguish between the two wine types.
