<p class="p">Inspired by the obtained result, we have performed an assessment of real Negroamaro wines, in order to identify the possible presence of defect compounds in the threshold, alarm and/or defect amounts. On the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-sensors-18-02584" class="xref">Figure S2</xref> the potentiometric responses of e-Tongue array in the Negroamaro wine NA14, doped with the different concentrations of defect BA, AA, IA and ME compounds are shown. The significant difference in sensor array response can be noted for different samples. On the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-02584-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> the PLS-DA classification of 29 Negroamaro wines (15 samples with added fault compounds and 14 authentic wines) is presented. The first two PCs represent 84% of total system variance and the clear discrimination among original Negroamaro wines and wines with adulterations was obtained. Besides, as it is demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="sensors-18-02584-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, only one wine sample was misclassified and the correct classification of 97% of Negroamaro wines was obtained, thus demonstrating the utility of porphyrin electropolymersâ€”based e-tongue for red wines defects detection.
