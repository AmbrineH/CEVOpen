<p class="p">With an aim to distinguish Primitivo from Negroamaro wines and assure the brand uniformity by means of the developed e-Tongue, we have first evaluated the dispersion of sensor array data obtained in all tested samples with PCA method. A clear separation of artificial wine used for sensors conditioning before and after every measurement, distilled water used to clean sensors and real wines was observed,
