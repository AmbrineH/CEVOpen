<p class="p">The possibility to substitute human sensory panels with artificial olfaction and taste sensory systems, such as Electronic Nose (e-Nose), Electronic Tongue (e-Tongue), has been actively investigated over the last two decades [

Although artificial sensory systems cannot provide information about the analysed sample without preliminary calibration and/or additional analytical determination, they may provide a cheap, rapid and not tedious possibility for either the classification of samples of different quality, or the quantitative determination of several parameters.
