Among them, the last method permits to obtain a stable sensing film chemically attached to the transducer surface, to increase significantly the sensor lifetime and to avoid a ligand leaching, which could be a serious problem for the alcoholic environment analysis, as wine is. Porphyrins, thanks to their rich chemistry and particular chelating ability, appear very promising ligands for the development of potentiometric chemical sensors and multisensory systems for wine analysis, including wine authentication, taste evaluation and faults detection [
