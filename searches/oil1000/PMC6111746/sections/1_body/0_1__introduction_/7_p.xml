<p class="p">In the present work, an e-Tongue system based on porphyrin electropolymers, obtained by electrodeposition of n-alkyl-(1-pyrrole) phenyl-substituted porphyrins or aminophenyl substituted porphyrin polymeric coatings, was employed for the authenticity assessment of 24 samples of Apulian wines produced by different cantinas and made of 100% Primitivo (10 wines) or Negroamaro (14 wines) grape varieties. Moreover, the correct discrimination of authentic Negroamaro wine and wine contaminated with several fault compounds was performed by the developed e-Tongue system. The possibility to detect in analysed Apulian wines the defects related to the presence of so-called wine “off-odour” compound 3-(methylthio)-propanol (methionol), isoamyl alcohol fusel oil, the marker of the yeast activity benzaldehyde and acetic acid as wine acidification marker was also investigated; the satisfactory results were obtained for isoamyl alcohol and acetic acid in particular.</p>
