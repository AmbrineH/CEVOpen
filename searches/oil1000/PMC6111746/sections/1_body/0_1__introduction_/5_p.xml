 <xref rid="B21-sensors-18-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], since potentiometry provides the simple measurement procedure and does not change irreversibly the composition of analysed samples, which is important, for instance, during the wine fermentation assessment. Most of the previously reported sensors were prepared by incorporation of membrane-active components inside inert polymeric matrix and then deposited on the transducer (via simple adhesion or either chemical linking) to the transducer surface.
