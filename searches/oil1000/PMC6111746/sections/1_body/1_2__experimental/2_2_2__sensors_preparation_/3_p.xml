 <xref rid="B29-sensors-18-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Sensor potentials were measured versus double junction SCE reference electrode (AMEL, Milan, Italy) and recorded using high-impedance 8-channel potentiometer LiquiLab (Ecosens, Rome, Italy). An artificial wine solution was employed to mimic the real wine matrix, while testing e-Tongue response toward selected wine fault compounds. The artificial wine solution had the following composition: 5 g/L tartaric acid, 123 g/L ethyl alcohol, 0.3 g/L isobutyl alcohol, 0.06 g/L isoamyl alcohol, pH = 3.2. The calculated amounts of wine fault compounds were added in known volume of artificial wine solution prior the first measurement; every compound was tested in 4 different concentrations: C
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>-standard concentration, C
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>-alarm concentration, C
 <sub class="sub">d1</sub>-defect concentration 1, C
 <sub class="sub">d2</sub>-defect concentration 2. In total 16 calibration solutions were prepared. All the measurements were performed in triplicate and the final data matrix had a dimension: 4 compounds × 4 concentrations × 3 replicas × 8 sensors = 384 points. Between the measurements the solutions were stored in sealed containers with limited headspace.
