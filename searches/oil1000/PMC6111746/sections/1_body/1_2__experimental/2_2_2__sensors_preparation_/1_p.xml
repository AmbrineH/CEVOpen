<p class="p">The e-Tongue array was composed by 8 potentiometric chemical sensors obtained by electrodeposition of n-alkyl-(1-pyrrole) phenyl- and aminopenyl- substituted porphyrin polymeric coatings on flat Pt working electrodes surface (3 mm in diameter). The properties of utilized porphyrin electropolymer sensing films were studied in our previous works [

 <xref rid="B29-sensors-18-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The films were formed via cyclic voltammetry technique, carried out in a three-electrode cell versus SCE reference and Pt wire counter electrodes, with AMEL 7050 (AMEL, Milan, Italy) potentiostat for 20 cycles, with 100 mV/s potential scan rate from the 1 mmol/L monomer solutions in CH

Prior of the electropolymerization process, Pt WE surface was buffed with alumina slurries, cleaned in ultrasonic bath, rinsed with methanol and dried on air. After preparation, the sensors were soaked in 0.01 mol/L NaCl solution for 24 h and then tested versus ORION (model 90-02) reference electrode. The chemical structures of the employed porphyrin monomers are given in
