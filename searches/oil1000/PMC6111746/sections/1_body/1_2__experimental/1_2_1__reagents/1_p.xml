All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. For electrochemical measurements, the analytical grade solvents, electrolyte salts and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate supporting electrolyte salt (TBAClO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were used. Solutions for potentiometric and optical evaluations were prepared with distilled water.
