<p class="p">The 24 samples of monovarietal Italian red wines produced in the Apulia region and bottled in 2007 by different cantinas were evaluated by e-Tongue array in order to confirm wines authenticity and reveal possible adulterations. Among them, 10 wine samples were made of 100% Primitivo and 14 wine samples were made of 100% Negroamaro grapes varieties correspondingly, 
 <xref rid="sensors-18-02584-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. All wines were measured immediately after opening the bottles, without any sample pre-treatment, 3 times in a random order. e-Tongue array was first conditioned in distilled water and then in the artificial wine solution before and after measurement in every wine sample. Sensors were preserved in 0.01 M NaCl solution between consecutive measurements days. The sketch of the experimental set-up and e-Tongue image are given in
