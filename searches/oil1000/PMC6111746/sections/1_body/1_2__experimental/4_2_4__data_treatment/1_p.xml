<p class="p">Principle component analysis (PCA) and Soft Independent Modelling by Class Analogy (SIMCA) were applied for wines identification and supervised classification respectively. Partial Least Regression (PLS1) method was used in order to correlate e-Tongue output with known amounts of wine defect compounds in calibration solutions. PLS Discriminant analysis, PLS-DA was employed for wines discrimination. Validation was performed using one-leave-out procedure. The RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction) and correlation coefficient, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, of predicted versus measured correlation line was used to evaluate the efficiency of applied regression model. Data treatment was performed with a commercial Unscrambler (v. 9.1, 2004, CAMO PROCESS AS, Oslo, Norway) software.
