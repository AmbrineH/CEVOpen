 <p class="p">The potentiometric electronic tongue system has been tested as a potential analytical tool for brand uniformity control of monoculture Apulian red wines (Primitivo and Negroamaro). The sensor array was composed of eight porphyrin coatings obtained by electrochemical polymerization process and was employed for both wines discrimination and quantitative detection of wine defect compounds: “off-odour” 3-(methylthio)-propanol; isoamyl alcohol fusel oil; benzaldehyde (marker of the yeast activity) and acetic acid (marker of vinegar formation). PLS-DA applied to Electronic tongue output data has permitted a correct discrimination of more than 70% of analysed wines in respect to the original brand affiliation. Satisfactory PLS1 predictions were obtained in real wine samples; with R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.989 for isoamyl alcohol and R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.732 for acetic acid. Moreover; the possibility to distinguish wine samples on the base of permitted levels of fault compounds content was shown.
