<p class="p">In the wild, weaning in pigs is a long and progressive process that occurs between the 9th and 22nd week of age, allowing piglets a gradual transition from milk to solid foods [

 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In contrast, early weaning practices common in commercial pig husbandry occurring around 21–28 days of age depict an artificial scenario, in which piglets struggle to overcome the post-weaning adaptation syndrome with detrimental consequences on its subsequent performance [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Under such circumstances, feed consumption is well below the animal’s maximum capacity and is often unable to fulfill the nutrient requirements for optimal growth in piglets. Bruininx et al. 2001 [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reported that approximately 45% of pigs do not start feed consumption until the first 15 h post-weaning. A nutritional strategy to promote an early feed consumption after weaning (e.g., by reducing the latency to first bite) is the use of highly palatable ingredients in the post-weaning diet, such as milk-derived products, or highly digestible cereal or animal origin protein sources [
