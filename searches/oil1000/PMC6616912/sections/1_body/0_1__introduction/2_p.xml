 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Each one of these tastes is activated by different nutrients, such as simple carbohydrates that evoke sweetness, or L-amino acids and peptides that evoke umami [

 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The umami taste, first discovered by Ikeda in 1909 [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], is an innately hedonic taste in pigs related to dietary amino acids [

 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The main compound eliciting umami taste is L-glutamic acid, an acidic non-essential amino acid widely present in foods. Physiologically, glutamic acid has been described for having several roles in cell metabolism, including the participation in synthetic and oxidative pathways in tissues, and serving as energy substrate for the small intestine, among others [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The hedonic potential of glutamate (MSG) in pigs is enhanced by 5â€²-ribonucleotide monophosphates such as inosine or guanosine monophosphates [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The primary porcine umami receptor is the heterodimer pT1r1/pT1r3. However, additional receptors are also involved in umami taste sensing in pigs, such as the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR4, which may respond exclusively to glutamic acid [
