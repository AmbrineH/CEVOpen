<p class="p">On the other hand, it is already known that maternal experiences during gestation and lactation have an impact on the progeny and its subsequent development [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. During pregnancy, the human fetus becomes familiar with external sounds, as well as interacting with other sensory stimuli such as smell and taste [

 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In particular, the amniotic fluid in which newborns develop contains flavors derived from foods eaten by the mother [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Some of these flavors are also later transmitted to the milk, so that fetuses and lactating animals experience the flavors of their mother’s diet before their first exposure to these flavors in solid feeds [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], rats [

 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. It has gained attention in an attempt to find strategies to improve dietary habits in humans, and in pigs related to the improvement of feed intake at weaning. Thus, there are a number of studies of flavor continuity in swine, mostly published during the last 10 years [

In general, they provide evidence for a reduction of stress around weaning, an increase in post-weaning performance and improvements in animal welfare. However, most of the work in pigs has been around feed volatiles, as opposed to taste active compounds. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that taste active compounds included into maternal diets may similarly exert an influence on the sensitivity of the same taste in young animals after weaning. In the present work, we hypothesized that the inclusion of MSG in maternal gestating and lactating diets would modify the feeding behavior of post-weaning pigs. The aim was therefore to assess changes in preference thresholds, sensory-motivated intake, total consumption, and consumption patterns of animals as dependent of a pre and postnatal inclusion of MSG into sows’ diets.
