 <sup class="sup">®</sup>337 × (Landrace × Large White)) born from these sows were selected to be used. On day 85 of gestation, sows were selected based on similar parity number (2.6 ± 0.8 (mean ± S.D.) parities), body condition (3.5 ± 0.6), and back fat thickness (9.6 ± 2.2 mm). Sows were then randomly divided into two experimental groups, consisting of a standard commercial feeding program (gestation and lactation diets) without (control) or with (MSG) dietary inclusion of 50 g/kg of MSG (Prinal S.A.; Santiago, Chile). The commercial feed was formulated to provide a complete and equilibrated nutrient content in order to fulfill the requirements of sows in each productive stage according to NRC [

In the case of MSG-fed sows, MSG was directly and homogeneously included within the complete diet without manipulation of feed formulation. The diets were offered individually for each sow in mash form following a restriction pattern during gestation and an ad libitum regime during lactation period.
