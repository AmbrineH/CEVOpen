<p class="p">After training, preference thresholds of pigs for MSG and sucrose solutions were determined in animals born from control and MSG-fed sows. Monosodium glutamate concentrations evaluated were 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 3 mM, 9 mM, and 27 mM. On the other hand, sucrose concentrations evaluated were 0.03 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 6 mM, 12 mM, and 18 mM. These concentrations were selected as they are close to the detection zone of each taste active compound, according to previous studies [

 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In these, each pair of pigs was offered two drinkers in the testing area, one containing plain water and the other containing the experimental MSG or sucrose solutions under evaluation. Five-hundred mL were offered in each drinker, and after 2 min of exposure they were removed, and the remaining content recorded. The consumption for each drinker was calculated by subtracting the remaining solution to the initial 500 mL. Preference values were calculated as the percentage of intake of the treatment solution (MSG or sucrose) relative to the total fluid intake from the two drinkers (treatment and water) and were compared to the neutral value of 50% (no preference). The preference threshold was then determined as the lowest concentration of MSG or sucrose to reach a preference value significantly greater than 50%.
