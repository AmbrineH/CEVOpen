<p class="p">Six milk samples were collected from three different sows of each experimental group with different parity number (1 sample/sow), by using an adaptation of the method described by Peters et al. 2010 [

An intramuscular injection of 20 IU of oxytocin (Veterquímica S.A.; Santiago, Chile) was administered on day seven after farrowing. After 10 min of injection, approximately, a manual stimulation of mammary glands started. Milk was collected from all functional glands and was placed into 50 mL sterile polypropylene containers, with a minimum of 10 mL of milk per sample. They were then frozen and stored at -20 °C prior to chemical and amino acid analysis. Samples were analyzed using standard AOAC methods [
