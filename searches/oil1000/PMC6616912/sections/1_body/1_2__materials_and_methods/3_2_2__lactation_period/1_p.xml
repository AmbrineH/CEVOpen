<p class="p">At farrowing and during the lactation period (21 days), piglets born from each sow were identified by colored ear tags and remained with their respective mothers. Cross-fostering was available only between animals from the same experimental group. A commercial creep-feed was offered to all piglets starting from day 10 of life.</p>
