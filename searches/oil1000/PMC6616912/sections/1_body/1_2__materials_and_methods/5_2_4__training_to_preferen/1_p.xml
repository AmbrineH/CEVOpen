<p class="p">Pigs were trained in performing preference test procedures on days five and six after weaning, by using a variation of the methodology described by Roura et al. 2011 [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The 26 pigs from each pen were separated alternately within the same pen into 13 randomly determined pairs of animals by means of a removable dividing fence. Thus, each pair of pigs had an exclusive training area of 2.8 m Ã— 1.0 m approximately. Each pair was simultaneously offered two drinkers, containing either 500 mL of tap water or 500 mL of a 200 mM sucrose solution. The drinkers were located at the center of the training area in an equidistant point from the midline at the left and the right, whose positions were determined at random. Training sessions were once a day for each pair of pigs and lasted 10 min on the first day and 5 min on the second day. The objective was that animals progressively realized that the two drinkers offered a choice of options that differed in hedonic value.
