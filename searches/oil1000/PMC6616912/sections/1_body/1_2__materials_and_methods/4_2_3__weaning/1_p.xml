<p class="p">Piglets were weaned on day 21 of life, when they were transferred to a nursery room with a total of 24 pens. Two-hundred and eight of the pigs born from control and MSG-fed sows were selected, 104 animals from each experimental group, and were allotted into eight nursery pens (26 pigs/pen, 4 pens/group). Pens were sized 2.8 m × 3.5 m (length × width) and were equipped with a feeder of 1.05 m × 30 cm with eight feeding spaces and three drinkers. During the first four days after weaning, pigs recovered from weaning stress and got accustomed to the room. After adaptation to the new environment, the pigs were trained to perform preference tests.</p>
