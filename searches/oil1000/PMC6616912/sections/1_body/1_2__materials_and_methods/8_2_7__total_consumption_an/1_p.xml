<p class="p">The total consumption and consumption patterns of MSG and sucrose solutions in pigs born from control and MSG-fed sows was later assessed in this experiment. To assess the total consumption, a single drinker containing 500 mL of solution was offered to each pair of animals for 2 min. Concentrations used in these tests were 1 mM, 3 mM, 9 mM, and 27 mM of MSG; and 1 mM, 6 mM, 12 mM, and 18 mM of sucrose. The consumption was calculated by subtracting the remaining solution to the initial content.</p>
