<p class="p">In order to quantify the consumption patterns, pigs were recorded by means of eight video cameras (1 camera/pen; SENKO S.A.; Santiago, Chile) placed in front of the pens to allow behavioral sampling during total consumption tests (2 min). Consumption time (total time in seconds drinking at the drinker) and approaches (number of times the drinker was approached with a consumption result) were assessed from the video recordings over the testing period. Consumption patterns were then calculated by dividing consumption time per number of approaches, analogous to the licks/bout measure used in rodents in lick cluster size analysis [
