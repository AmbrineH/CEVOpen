<p class="p">Mean preference and sensory-motivated intake values for MSG and sucrose solutions were compared to the neutral values of 50% of preference and 0 intake, respectively, using a Student’s t-test through the MEANS procedure of SAS (9.4; SAS Inst. Inc.; Cary, NC, USA), considering experimental group (MSG inclusion in sows’ diets) as a main effect. Each pair of pigs was considered the experimental unit. The ANOVA was performed for total consumption and consumption patterns by using the GLM procedure of SAS, taking into account the experimental group as main factor. Milk data was also analyzed by parity number (2, 3, or 4 parities). For all of the analysis, average values were compared by least-squares means with the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. The alpha level used for the determination of significance was 0.05. Statistical trends for 0.05 &lt;
