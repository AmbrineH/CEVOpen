 <xref rid="animals-09-00336-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the mean preference values obtained for MSG and sucrose solutions in post-weaning pigs from control or MSG-fed sows. In pigs born from control sows, the preference threshold for MSG was determined at 1 mM (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the preference threshold for MSG was observed at 0.1 mM in pigs born from MSG-fed sows (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.045). Regarding sucrose, the threshold was stablished at 12 mM in animals coming from control sows (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003). In contrast, the threshold for sucrose in pigs coming from MSG-fed sows during gestation and lactation was found to be 1 mM (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.032).
