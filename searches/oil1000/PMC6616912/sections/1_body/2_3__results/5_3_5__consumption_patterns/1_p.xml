<p class="p">Consumption time, number of approaches, and consumption patterns of pigs born from control or MSG-fed sows during the 2-min exposure to MSG and sucrose solutions are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00336-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Pigs coming from control sows exhibited a higher consumption time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.038) and number of approaches (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.024) than did animals coming from MSG-fed sows at 1 mM MSG. However, no difference in the consumption pattern was observed between both groups of animals at this MSG concentration (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.610). Similarly, no differences in consumption time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.125), approaches (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.452) or consumption patterns (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.143) were found at 3 mM, 9 mM, or 27 mM MSG among pigs born from control or MSG-fed sows. The same situation was observed with sucrose, since no differences were registered between pigs from the control or MSG-fed sows in consumption time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.212), approaches (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.444), or consumption patterns (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.275) at any concentration tested (1 mM, 6 mM, 12 mM, or 18 mM) over 2 min.
