<p class="p">Sensory-motivated intake values generated by MSG and sucrose solutions in pigs born from control or MSG-fed sows are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00336-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The MSG sensory-motivated consumption was significantly higher than water consumption in concentrations above 1 mM in pigs born from control sows (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.017) higher intake than water was 3 mM. Significantly higher sucrose consumption related to water was observed only at 12 mM in pigs born from control sows (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005). Conversely, in pigs born from MSG-fed sows, concentrations above 1 mM generated sucrose consumptions significantly higher than the negative control (
