<p class="p">The chemical and amino acid composition of the milk samples collected from control and MSG-fed sows are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00336-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. No differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were determined in milk composition of control and MSG-fed sows according to their contents of moisture, crude protein, ether extract, N-free extract, ash, and energy. A tendency (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.074) to a higher content in the N-free extract was observed in the milk of MSG-fed sows compared to sows fed standard diets. No effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) of the parity number of sows was determined among these parameters. In relation to the amino acid profile, no differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were detected in the amino acid contents between the two groups. No differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in milk composition were observed relative to the number of parities.
