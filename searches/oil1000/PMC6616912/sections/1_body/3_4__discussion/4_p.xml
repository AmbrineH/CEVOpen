<p class="p">In order to evaluate the effect of MSG supplementation on maternal fluids that could explain some of the behavioral changes previously described on the progeny, the milk chemical and amino acid profile of control and MSG-fed sows was assessed. However, it was observed that the inclusion of 50 g/kg of MSG did not modify milk composition of treated sows. Amino acid profiles were consistent with previous reports from Wu and Knabe 1994 [

 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], indicating that glutamic acid is one of the most abundant free amino acids in sows’ milk to support growth of piglets. In particular, the lack of response to dietary glutamate was also consistent with previous reports showing that most of the dietary glutamic acid was catabolized in the small intestine of pigs and used as a major energy source for the gut [

 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In young animals approximately 97% of dietary glutamate is utilized by the small intestine, and only 3% enters the portal vein [

 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. As suggested by Brosnan et al. 2014 [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], the gastrointestinal tract in animals and humans functions as a barrier to prevent the distribution of ingested MSG to the rest of the body. When free or protein-derived glutamate is absorbed from the intestinal lumen, it is oxidized by enterocytes to generate ATP, converted to other non-essential amino acids (e.g., alanine, aspartate) and other small molecules (e.g., glutathione), and used to synthesize intestinal proteins [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Therefore, even when MSG is ingested in large amounts such as in this study, it may have resulted in no or only a small transient increase in circulating levels of glutamate [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In addition, it has also been informed that the ingestion of MSG in maternal diets do not expose fetuses or newborn animals to increases in glutamate concentrations in biological fluids [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. During gestation, the placenta is a natural barrier to the penetration of glutamate from the maternal into the fetal circulation, as it normally extracts glutamate from both maternal and fetal circulations to be used as energy substrate [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In relation to milk, studies in humans have shown that breast milk-free glutamate concentrations did not increase after the ingestion of a single dose of 150 mg/kg of MSG [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], which is similar to the results presented here with a much higher dose of supplemental MSG. All this evidence suggests that feeding behavior modifications observed in nursery pigs in this study do not seem to be related to a direct animals’ exposure to MSG during gestation. However, during lactation, piglets might be exposed to the sow’s diet and learn from the MSG supplement. The specific metabolic pathways from which MSG-derived metabolites influence feeding behavior patterns on the progeny require further research.
