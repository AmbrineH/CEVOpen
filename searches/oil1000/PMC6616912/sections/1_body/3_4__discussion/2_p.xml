<p class="p">It was observed that pigs born from MSG-fed sows showed a lower preference threshold for MSG (0.1 mM) in comparison to pigs born from control sows (1 mM), indicating that the sensitivity for umami increased 10 times in animals whose mothers were fed diets included with 50 g/kg of MSG during gestation and lactation. These results prove the concept that feeding behavior of post-weaning pigs can be influenced by pre and postnatal inclusion of a taste active compound into maternal diets. Previous studies have already demonstrated the high gustatory preferences of pigs for umami tastants [

While most pig studies have focused on feed volatile compounds and/or feed flavors, emphasis here was on the effect of a sapid water-soluble compound such as MSG. The observed preference threshold for MSG in pigs born from control sows showed just 3 mM difference with a reference threshold previously reported by Roura et al. 2016 [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], who informed that nursery pigs without previous maternal experience with MSG showed a threshold for this compound at 3 mM. Thus, the results obtained under commercial conditions are consistent with previous knowledge developed under experimental conditions. We were also interested to assess the effect of MSG inclusion in gestating and lactating diets of sows on the sensitivity of pigs for other taste qualities other than umami. Sucrose is a disaccharide that elicits a hedonic taste (described as sweet in humans) in mammalian species including pigs [

 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Similar to the MSG response, pigs born from MSG-fed sows showed a lower preference threshold for sucrose (1 mM) compared to the control group (12 mM), reflecting a 12-fold increase in sweet sensitivity. Earlier work reported a sucrose preference threshold at 6 mM in animals without manipulation of maternal diets [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Thus, these results may indicate an umami-sweet taste interaction occurring in pigs regarding the pre and postnatal high-concentration umami inclusion and the post-weaning sweet sensitivity threshold [

 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Umami taste in pigs has been related to the sensing of dietary amino acids while sweet taste to simple carbohydrates. Thus, the results enhancing the sensitivity for both amino acids and energy seem to respond to a nutrient balance principle aimed at maintaining a narrow range of protein-to-energy ratios in order to gain optimal growth and gut development [
