<p class="p">The sensory-motivated consumption of MSG and sucrose solutions was also assessed in this study. Given that MSG and sucrose were tested in water solution, and pigs had ad libitum access to water, their desire to drink during the choice scenario might have been mainly a function of the appetite linked to that solution. In pigs born from MSG-fed sows, it was observed that MSG solution was unable to promote a significant consumption at concentrations different from 3 mM, while MSG-driven consumption was significantly higher from that of water at concentrations above 1 mM in animals born from control sows. On the contrary, an opposite behavior, and closely related to preference thresholds outcomes, was registered regarding sucrose-motivated intake among both groups of pigs. Pigs born from MSG-fed sows showed sucrose consumptions significantly higher than water at concentrations higher than 1 mM. In contrast, pigs born from control sows did not display significant sucrose intakes until 12 mM concentration. This indicates that MSG inclusion during gestation and lactation not only increased the sensitivity of post weaning pigs for sweet solutions, but also it increased their sensory-motivated intake for sweet taste compounds during the nursery period.</p>
