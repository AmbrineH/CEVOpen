<p class="p">Even though MSG inclusion in prenatal and postnatal diets modified the preference thresholds and sensory-motivated intake of post-weaning animals, no effects on total consumption and consumption patterns of MSG or sucrose were observed after the short-term single-exposure to these solutions. One possible explanation could be attributed to that these measures were registered after the preference tests, consequently, later in pigsâ€™ post-weaning life. This may have generated an attenuation in the influence of MSG-derived metabolites through maternal fluids. Another explanation may rely on the low MSG and sucrose concentrations used in these tests that did not allow us to observe significant differences between the two experimental groups. Previous studies in nursery pigs associated consumption patterns to palatability, or hedonic perception related to MSG that was directly linked to the concentration at lower suprathreshold levels while the consumption reach a plateau at higher concentrations [

In contrast, the highest concentration tested in this study was 27 mM. The impact of prenatal and early postnatal experiences with specific taste qualities such as umami on the acceptance of the same taste later in life was systematically reviewed in children [
