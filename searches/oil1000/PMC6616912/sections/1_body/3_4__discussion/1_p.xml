<p class="p">The early weaning practice common in modern intensive pig production systems, represents one of the most critical phases because piglets are subjected to social, environmental, and nutritional stressors [

 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As a result, pigs at weaning show reduced solid feed intake and growth performance. Under such scenario, the present work was conducted to test the hypothesis that the inclusion of MSG, an umami taste compound, in gestating and lactating diets for sows would modify the feeding behavior of nursery pigs. A better understanding of the factors driving voluntary feed intake and diet selection in pigs at this stage may contribute to the design of feeding strategies to promote an early post-weaning feed consumption.
