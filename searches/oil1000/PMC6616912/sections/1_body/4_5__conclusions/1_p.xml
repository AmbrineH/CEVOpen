<p class="p">It is concluded that feeding behavior of nursery pigs can be influenced by pre and postnatal inclusion of a taste active compound into maternal diets. This is reflected by lower preference thresholds for MSG and sucrose in pigs born from MSG-fed sows in comparison to pigs born from control sows. In addition, pigs whose mothers were fed diets included with 50 g/kg of MSG during gestation and lactation showed an increased sensory-motivated intake for sucrose compared to animals from the control group. In contrast, MSG supplementation decreased MSG-motivated intake and did not influence the total consumption and consumption patterns of pigs for these solutions. Monosodium glutamate inclusion in maternal diets modifies feeding behavior in pigs by increasing specific appetites for basic nutrients not present in the maternal diets such as increasing the liking for sucrose. Further research is required to elucidate the specific metabolic pathways from which MSG-derived metabolites influence feeding behavior patterns on the progeny.</p>
