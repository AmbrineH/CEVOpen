<p class="p">In summary, these articles cover a range of roles and functions for microbial exopolymers in the marine environment. One challenge remains to develop methods that can accurately trace the production of exopolymers to their biological source in environmental samples. Such methods and approaches would be invaluable for understanding what type(s) of exopolymers participate in marine snow formation, as well as in the formation of MOS, and for consequently linking these exopolymers to their producing organism(s). We hope that this special issue stimulates more discussion and inspires new lines of research on the incredibly profound, and still largely enigmatic subject of microbial exopolymers.</p>
