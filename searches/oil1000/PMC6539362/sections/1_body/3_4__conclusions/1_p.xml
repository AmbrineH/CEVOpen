<p class="p">In this study, TEM and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR technique were employed to characterize the PAMAM G4.0 material and the marjoram essential oil was analyzed for chemical composition using GC-MS. The two samples and the oil/PAMAM G4.0 were jointly analyzed by FT-IR, showing the successful associating of oil and PAMAM G4.0 dendrimer. The resulting PAMAM G4.0@oil was shown to be more effective in terms of antifungal activity compared with PAMAM G4.0 and marjoram volatile oil with same concentration. The enhanced anti-microbial property of the oil/PAMAM G4.0 could be due to the restricted evaporation of the essential oil, caused by the encapsulation. These results suggest that the association of marjoram oil with PAMAM G4.0s is promising in combating late blight in tomatoes and that later studies should focus on determining the suitable concentration for optimal inhibition and conducting field trials.
