<p class="p">Recently, fungicides of biological origin have been strongly accentuated as it could overcome the inherent limitations of chemical pesticides. In addition, the approach of using antifungal substances extracted from plants was reported to be a promising agent against fungi. Marjoram (
 <italic class="italic">Origanum majorana</italic> L., Lamiaceae) is a perennial species originating in southern Europe. The plant has been widely cultivated and used in cooking as a spice. More importantly, distillates from marjoram are highly valued for its antimicrobial, antifungal and antioxidant activity. In one study, marjoram oil has been tested against various bacterial and fungal species, demonstrating improved effectiveness against

 <italic class="italic">Erwinia carotovora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Moraxella</italic> [

 <italic class="italic">P. infestans.</italic> It is considered to be a fungicidal alternative to chemically derived drugs [

 <italic class="italic">P. infestants</italic> was reported to be inhibited by pathogen-induced proteins in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, the process for utilizing the pathogen is quite complicated and not suitable for excess products. When it comes to combating microbes, the use of essential oils has various advantages. First, since essential oils are of natural origin, it is completely safe for humans and the environment. Second, since essential oils are mixtures of many different compounds, the use of essential oil as an antimicrobial agent could impair the adapted resistance against drugs of microbes in various ways.
