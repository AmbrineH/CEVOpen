<p class="p">However, essential oil from herbal sources demonstrates many disadvantages including poor stability, solubility, and volatility. One of the approaches to remedy such limitations is the application of nano-encapsulation, which is capable of reducing volatility, improving the stability, water solubility, and efficiency of essential oil-based formulations, while still maintaining therapeutic efficiency of the drug [

The dendrimer consists of three parts including core, inner branches, and lateral groups. Among dendrimers, polyamidoamine (PAMAM), a group of branched-chain dendrimers, including amine branching and amide bridging, is the most widely used dendrimer due to its amine functional groups (for even-numbered PAMAMs) and carboxylates (for odd-numbered PAMAMs) that help dissolve dendrimer in polar solvent [
