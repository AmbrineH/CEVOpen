<p class="p">PAMAM dendrimer generation 4.0 (PAMAM G4.0) was synthesized from the EDA core utilizing divergent approach as previously reported in our literature [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], in which the EDA’s primary amine groups react with MA’s acrylate groups via Michael addition reaction to form half generation PAMAM, followed by the reaction between half generation PAMAM’s methyl propionate groups with excess EDA to form full generation PAMAM dendrimer, denoted by Gn.0. Briefly, EDA (20 mL) was added to 150 mL of MA dissolved in methanol. The reaction was in turn kept under stirring for 3 h at 0 °C and then 48 h at room temperature. The removal of impurities and solvent was performed using rotary vacuum evaporator (Strike 300, Lancashire, UK), resulting in the core precursor G0.5. Next, G0.5 was added to EDA solution (130 mL) to obtain PAMA G0.0. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at room temperature, rotated under vacuum using mixed solvent (toluene: methanol is 9:1 v/v). Finally, the resulting mixture was dialyzed by dialysis membrane against methanol to remove excess toluene and EDA and dried under vacuum to remove methanol. This protocol was repeated continuously to obtain PAMAM G4.0.
