<p class="p">A rotating system was used to drain out all water vapor in the PAMAM G4.0 dendrimer to ensure that PAMAM G4.0 is completely dry. Marjoram essential oil (500 μg, 1000 μg, 2000 μg, and 5000 μg) was quickly added to PAMAM G4.0 according to the ratios (1:1). After being ultrasonicated for 15 min at room temperature, the samples were rotated at 100 °C for 2 min, allowing the oil molecules combine with the dendrimer structure. Samples were stored in refrigerator for later use.</p>
