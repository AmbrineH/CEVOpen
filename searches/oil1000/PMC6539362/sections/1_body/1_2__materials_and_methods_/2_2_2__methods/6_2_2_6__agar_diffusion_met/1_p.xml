<p class="p">The antifungal effect of marjoram oil, PAMAM G4.0 and the system were assessed using agar diffusion method. The PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) agar plates were prepared by potato infusion at 250.00 g/L, glucose at 20.00 g/L, and agar at 20.00 g/L. After that, fungal solution was prepared and obtained the density of 6.0465 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL after 48 h of incubation. The solution was then diluted 2 times, followed by the inoculation of 100 µL diluted fungal solution on the agar surface. Appropriate amount of synthesized oil/PAMAM sample was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water first to get the desired final concentration, which are 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm, and 5000 ppm. Next, 100 µL of sample solution was added to each well of 6 mm in diameter. After 48 h, the inhibition zone was measured in diameter. The data were expressed as mean ± SD.
