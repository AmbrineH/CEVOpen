<p class="p">The chemical structure of dendrimer PAMAM G4.0 was analyzed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (Bruker Advance 500, Bruker Co., Billerica, MA, USA). Deuterated chloroform was used as solvent. For illustration of size and morphology, Transmission Electron Spectroscopy (JEM-1400 TEM; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was utilized. A drop of sample solution prepared in distilled water was placed on a carbonâ€“copper grid (300-mesh, Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA) and air dried in 10 min for the TEM observation. </p>
