 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates FT-IR spectra of marjoram essential oil, PAMAM G4.0 and oil/PAMAM G4.0. The characteristic peaks of PAMAM G4.0 at positions 1661 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1553 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are the signals of the (-CO-NH-) bonds of grades I and II, respectively, which were also observed clearly on the spectrum of oil/PAMAM G4.0. Five characteristic peaks of the essential oil at position 2967 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; 2927 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; 1740 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; 1451 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; and 1376 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> have also been observed clearly on the spectrum of oil/PAMAM G4.0. Signaling of the essential oil and dendrimer PAMAM G4.0 were both observed in the spectrum of the synthesized oil/PAMAM G4.0 sample, indicating that the synthesis of dendrimer PAMAM G4.0 associating marjoram oil was successful. Additionally, there is a disappearance of carbonyl peak at 1700 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in oil/PAMAM G4.0 spectrum as compared to essential oil spectrum. C-O absorption band at 1300 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of alcohol functional groups of essential oil’s components is not detected as well, indicating the formation of hydrogen bonds between essential oil’s components and PAMAM G4.0.
