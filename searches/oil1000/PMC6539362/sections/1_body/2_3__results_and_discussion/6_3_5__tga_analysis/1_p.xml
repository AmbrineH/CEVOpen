<p class="p">The actual amount of marjoram essential oil mixed with PAMAM G4.0 was estimated by TGA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The experimental temperature was ramped to 200 °C with heating rate at 3 °C/min and from 200 °C to 600 °C with heating rate at 50 °C /min. The weight loss from room temperature to 100 °C corresponds to the evaporation of marjoram oil. As shown in TGA curves of oil/PAMAM G4.0 with 1000 μg essential oil, the weight loss at 100 °C was around 56%. This means the actual amount of essential oil successfully mixed with 1000 μg PAMAM G4.0 in the final product was about 560 μg. This result indicated the existence of essential oil in oil/PAMAM G4.0 sample.
