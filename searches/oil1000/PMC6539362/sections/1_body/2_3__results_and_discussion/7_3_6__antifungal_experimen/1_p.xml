 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora infestants</italic> properties of the essential oil, PAMAM G4.0 and the mixture of these two compounds at concentrations of 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 ppm are displayed and summarized in

 <xref rid="materials-12-01446-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The combination of PAMAM G4.0 and volatile marjoram exhibits superior antifungal properties compared to the marjoram essential oil and PAMAM G4.0. At the lowest test concentration (500 ppm), PAMAM G4.0 has a diameter of inhibition zone of 6.16 ± 0.34 mm. PAMAM G4.0 anti-fungal properties are due to the fact that their surface containing –NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– positively charged particles which could interact and destroy negatively charged microbial membranes. It is also shown that the antifungal property of the essential oil is minimal, as demonstrated by the very small diameter of inhibition zone of 6.33 ± 0.33 mm at 500 ppm concentration and the presence of mycelium around the well. In other words, there are no significant inhibition at both 500 and 1000 ppm of essential oil and PAMAM G4.0, individually. This is contrasted by wells of oil/PAMAM G4.0 at all concentrations, showing recognizable inhibition zones. At higher concentrations of 1000, 2000 and 5000 ppm, the antifungal activity of PAMAM G4.0 and oil, individually, was gradually increased and the strongest activity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. infestans</italic> was achieved by the oil/PAMAM G4.0. In other words, oil/PAMAM G4.0 was found to have stronger antifungal ability than that of each individual component. After a series of experiments, it can be concluded that the concentration of oil/PAMAM G4.0 at 500 ppm, which respectively exhibited 10 and 22 times bigger inhibition diameter (9.50 ± 0.50 mm) than that of essential oil and PAMAM G4.0 at the same concentration (500 ppm), provided the optimal antifungal result as compared to other combinations of PAMAM G4.0 and oil. At higher concentration (5000 ppm), the synergistic effect seemed to be lost. This could be explained by the reason that not all marjoram essential oil used was successfully mixed with PAMAM G4.0, as revealed in TGA analysis. Due to steric hindrance effect, reduced ability of essential oil to be mixed and combined with PAMAM as the concentration of PAMAM increased. In addition, the diffusion of mixed essential oil from the mixture oil/PAMAM G4.0 out of the well to the agar surface in agar diffusion test could also be restricted with the increasing of PAMAM molecules concentration. Taken together, thanks to the synergy between PAMAM G4.0 and oil, not only the required concentration for each component was reduced significantly, it was also possible to maintain the sufficient result, which is important for reduction of environmental pollution risk.
