<p class="p">As revealed in GC-MS result, marjoram essential oil comprised several components with very different chemical structures, which are mostly hydrophobic and some containing hydrophilic functional group in the structure. We also interpreted that there must be a hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic OH or C=OH groups of some components in the essential oil and NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups on the surface of PAMAM G4.0. The rest hydrophobic components tended to be entrapped within the large internal cavity of dendrimer, which is a common tendency of hydrophobic substances when being mixed with PAMAM, thus reducing the essential oil volatility. This phenomenon has been reported in many previous studies [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– groups facilitates the interaction and destruction of microbial negatively charged membrane. As a result, oil/PAMAM G4.0 fully interacts with the fungus’s cell membrane as well as easily penetrates into the cell layer, thus destroying fungal cells.
