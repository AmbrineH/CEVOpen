<p class="p">The synergistic effect in antifungal properties between the essential oils and oil/PAMAM G4.0 could be explained by the reduction of the oil volatility when it is mixed with PAMAM G4.0 structure, therefore improving the stability and maintaining the antifungal effectiveness better than essential oil in its free form. Moreover, the extremely poor water solubility of essential oil could also be improved by associating with PAMAM dendrimer, which perhaps due to the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the essential oils and functional groups of PAMAM G4.0. There are numerous literatures that successfully demonstrated the use of dendrimer to enhance the solubilization of hydrophobic molecules [
