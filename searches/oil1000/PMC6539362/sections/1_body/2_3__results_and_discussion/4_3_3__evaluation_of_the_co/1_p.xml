 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the composition and content of the substances in marjoram essential oil analyzed by GC-MS. From the GC-MS analysis, it is revealed that major components in the oil are 1R-alpha-pinene, sabinene, cymol, cyclohexanol, cineole, alpha-terpinolene, alpha-terpineol, linalyl ester, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-caryophyllene. Chemical structures of these components of marjoram oil are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Cineole (28.59%) is the predominant constituent in the oil, followed by alpha-terpinolen (14.75%) and cymol (11.82%). Compared to the analysis results of other studies, the reported composition of the oil is similar. However, component contents are different, possibly due to the difference in cultivation process, the habitat of the plant, the extraction and preservation method [
