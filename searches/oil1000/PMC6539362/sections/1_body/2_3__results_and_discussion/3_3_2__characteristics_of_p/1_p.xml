 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> displays the morphology and particle size of PAMAM G4.0 dendrimer. Since the eradication of the fungi depends on the transportation of marjoram essential oil, it is more likely for the dendrimer to penetrate into the spore or mycelium (the size of the spore ranges from 19 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−12</sup> to 23 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−12</sup> mm) as its size gets tinier [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Analysis of TEM results showed that dendrimer PAMAM G4.0 was 20 to 30 nm in size and fairly uniform. There are some aggregates (&lt;70 nm) were shown to occur but in low frequency. After the oil was associated with dendrimer, a significant increment in the diameter of obtained oil/PAMAM G4.0 (40–150 nm) was observed, indicating the successful combination of essential oil with PAMAM G4.0 structure. There are many studies reported that the particle size of less than 500 nm is sufficiently good for the penetration of nanocarriers into fungal cells [
