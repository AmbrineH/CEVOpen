 <p class="p">In this study, the introduction of 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum majorana L.</italic> essential oil into a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) G4.0 dendrimer was performed for creation of a potential nanocide against 
  <italic class="italic">Phytophthora infestans</italic>. The characteristics of marjoram oil and PAMAM G4.0 was analyzed using transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The success of combining marjoram oil with PAMAM G4.0 was evaluated by FT-IR, TGA analysis, and the antifungal activity of this system was also investigated. The results showed that the antifungal activity of oil/PAMAM G4.0 was high and significantly higher than only PAMAM G4.0 or marjoram essential oil. These results indicated that the nanocide oil/PAMAM G4.0 helped strengthen and prolong the antifungal properties of the oil.
