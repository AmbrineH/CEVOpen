<p class="p">The supplementation of oregano EO (4 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> or 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) had no effects on the ruminal pH and negative effects on the abundance of ruminal protozoa. In addition, supplementation with oregano EO increased the abundance of three primary cellulolytic bacteria (4 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and the abundance of ruminal fungi (7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). Our results suggest that supplying sheep with oregano EO could manipulate the rumen microbial. These results also demonstrate that adding a lower amount (such as 4 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) is beneficial to the ruminal microbial population, while adding higher (such as 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) amounts can be detrimental to the ruminal microbial population. However, the low number of animals used in this study, and the impacts of active components of oregano EO on rumen fermentation and the microbiota community also should be deepen studied in future.
