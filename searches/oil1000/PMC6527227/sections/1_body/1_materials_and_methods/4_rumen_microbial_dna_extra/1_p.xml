<p class="p">The DNA extraction procedures were performed by using a super clean bench (SW-CJ-2FD, Airtech, Ltd., Suzhou, China) to ensure that the samples were protected from environmental contaminations. The microbial DNA was extracted from the ruminal fluid samples using a TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., LTD., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of the frozen rumen fluid samples was centrifuged (TGL-16, Cence, LTD., Changsha, China) at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C after thawing. The supernatant of each sample was collected and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The sediments of the second centrifuged samples were transferred to 2 ml tubes for cell lysis by subjecting the samples twice to a 5 min pulse using the Mini-Beadbeater-8TM (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) with 1 min cooling in ice between the two pulses. The DNA yield and purity were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoPhotometer Pearl 360 Thermo Scientific, Implen, Germany). The DNA samples were stored at -20°C until further analysis.</p>
