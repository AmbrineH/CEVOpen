<p class="p">The abundance of the protozoa was quantified as described by Sylvester et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The abundance of the fungi and the target bacterial species were quantified using SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Switzerland). A sample-derived qPCR standard was prepared using the respective specific PCR primer set and a composite DNA sample that was prepared by pooling an equal amount of all the metagenomic DNA samples [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The efficiency of the PCR amplification was checked for the various primer concentrations and annealing temperatures. The optimal amplification conditions for each primer pair were achieved with 0.36 μM of each primer, and the annealing temperature of each target microorganism was 60°C. The reaction mixture had a final volume of 20 μl, containing 10 μl of FastStart Essential DNA Green Master Mix (Roche, Germany), 2 μl (20 ng) of template DNA, 6.8 μl of nuclease-free water and 0.36 μM of each forward and reverse primer, respectively. The amplification program was as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 10 s, and a final elongation at 72°C for 15 s. The negative controls (without DNA template) were run with every assay to assess the overall specificity. The detection of the fluorescent product was set at the last step of each cycle. To determine the specificity of the amplification, an analysis of the product melting was performed after each amplification. The melting curve was obtained by slow heating with a 0.1°C•s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> increment from 65°C to 95°C, with fluorescence collection at 0.1°C intervals. Each of the standards was purified using a PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, USA). For each of the standards, the 16S rRNA (or 18S rRNA) gene copy-number concentration was calculated based on the length of the PCR product and its mass concentration [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Tenfold serial dilutions were made in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer prior to the qPCR assays. To minimize variations, the qPCR assay for each species or group was performed in triplicate for both the standards and the metagenomic DNA samples using the same master mix and the same PCR plate. The absolute abundance was expressed as the 16S rRNA (or 18S rRNA) gene copies/ml of each sample [
