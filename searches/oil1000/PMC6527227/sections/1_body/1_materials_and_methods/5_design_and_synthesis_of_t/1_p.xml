The sequence specific regions for a given species (with &gt; 97% similarity) were designed online against the GenBank sequences with Primer Premier 3.0 (

All primers were tested for the requirements imposed by quantitative realâ€”time PCR. The housekeeping gene was tested, and no significant effects were found (
