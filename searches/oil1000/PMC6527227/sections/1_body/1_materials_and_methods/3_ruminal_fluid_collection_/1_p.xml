<p class="p">The ruminal fluid was evacuated manually through the rumen fistula before adding OEO at 0 h and additional rumen fluid samples were collected at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after supplying. When the rumen fluid was evacuated from the rumen, the initial 10 ml was discarded, and the subsequent 50 ml collected was used for the determination of pH and the microorganisms analyses. The collected rumen fluid was squeezed through 4 layers of 100 mm × 100 mm medical gauze (Winner Inc., LTD, Shenzhen, China). The pH value of the ruminal fluid was immediately measured and recorded using a glass electrode pH meter (Type CG 842, Blueline 14 pH, Schott Instruments, Deutschland, Germany) and the samples were immediately frozen and stored at -80°C (ULT Freezer Model DW-86L828, Haier Biomedical, Zingdoo, China) until DNA extraction.</p>
