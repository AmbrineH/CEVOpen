 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In contrast, several studies reported feeding 110 mg•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> mixed EO (thymol, guajacol, and limonene) to sheep resulted in no effects on rumen protozoa [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and supplementing a steer ration with cinnamaldehyde oil (0.4–0.6 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) had no effect on total ruminal protozoa numbers [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The inconsistencies in the total ruminal protozoa populations reported in these studies were probably due to the differences in the chemical structures and properties of the different EO blends used. Each specific EO would have unique performance characteristics due to its chemical structure. In the rumen ecosystem, a large mount of H

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Actually, protozoa was demonstrated has ecto- and endo-symbiotic relationships with methanogenesis, and about 37% of rumen-derived CH
