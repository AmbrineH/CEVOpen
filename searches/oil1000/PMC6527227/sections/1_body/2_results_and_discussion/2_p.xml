<p class="p">Ruminal microbial fermentation is crucial for the optimal growth and meat or milk production of ruminants. Thus, the microbial composition and their functions as well as other factors (i.e., ration) affecting the rumen microbiome would all impact the nutrients available for absorption. During ruminal fermentation, it is well known that fungi can penetrate the cell wall to enhance cellulose degradation from lignin, which cannot be degraded by bacteria and protozoa [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. These data demonstrate that sheep supplied OEO7 had greater (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) abundances of fungi than the sheep supplied with CON or OEO4 (
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Thus, feeding sheep with OEO at 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> shifted the microbial populations to enhance the proliferation of rumen fungi, which could lead to an enhancement in ruminal fiber digestion. However, Wang et al. reported there was a depression in fiber digestibility when sheep were supplied with 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> OEO. Therefore, the correlation between fungi and fiber digestibility needed to explore in depth through more studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In agreement with our results, Agarwal et al. reported that the ruminal fungi populations were increased four times and the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> true digestibility of feed was depressed when feeding a low amount (0.33 ml•L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) of peppermint oil, and feeding a high amount (1.0 ml•L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) decreased the ruminal fungi populations in an 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In contrast, Lin et al. reported that supplementing with a blend of EO (clove, oregano, cinnamon, and lemon) did not affect the ruminal fungi populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Thus, the specific type of EO supplemented may explain the discrepancy between this study and the literature reporting fungi populations because not all EO would have the same antimicrobial properties. The sheep supplied OEO7 demonstrated an increase (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the abundance of ruminal fungi at 4 and 12 h after feeding compared with sheep supplied CON and OEO4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217054.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). This finding agreed with the results of Denman et al., who reported that anaerobic fungi growth increased quickly between 4–8 h after culturing, and that a second growth spike appeared at 12 h [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Moreover, McIntosh et al. reported that feeding an EO mixture (thymol:eugenol:vanillin:limonene = 1:1:1:1) at levels greater than 20 mg•L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> significantly inhibited rumen fungi growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. These data suggest that the EO supplementation amount was an important factor affecting the ruminal microbial populations. However, to date, few studies have reported EO effects on rumen fungi. Therefore, further studies are required to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of EO to enhance or inhibit rumen fungi.
