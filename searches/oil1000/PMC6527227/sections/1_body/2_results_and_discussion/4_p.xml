<p class="p">The total abundance of ruminal bacteria was similar (

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), therefore supplementing OEO did not influence the abundance of ruminal bacteria. In accordance with previous studies, Benchaar et al. and Thao et al. reported that there was no change in the total bacterial population when sheep and swamp buffaloes were fed rations with mixed EO (thymol, eugenol, vanillin, and limonene) or eucalyptus EO (2 ml•hd

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217054.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), the sheep supplied OEO4 contained a greater (

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Our results corroborated of Wang et al., who reported that the NDF degradation rate was higher for sheep supplied 4 g•d

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Also, these results demonstrated that supplying a specific amount of EO (such as 4 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) could alter the microbial population of the rumen, but supplying a large amount of EO (such as 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) could have a detrimental impact on the microbial population. Carvacrol and thymol, as the main compounds of oregano oil, are phenolic structures that have more effective antimicrobials than other nonphenolic secondary plant metabolites due to the presence of a hydroxyl group in the phenolic structure [

The specific phenolic structure make them more attractive to the cell membrane structures, which could cause membrane expansion, increases fluidity and permeability, disturbs embedded proteins, inhibits respiration, and alters ion transport processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. However, more studies are needed to deep understand the mechanisum of these active compounds and verify the result of this study.
