<p class="p">It is known that the pH is an important index for evaluating the comprehensive EO effects for potentially altering the ruminal microbial population and fermentation to influence the ruminal environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In addition, the ruminal pH values were the highest before the OEO was supplied in the morning and declined afterward, as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217054.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), with the lowest pH values being achieved at approximately 8 to 12 h after supplying OEO, but the sheep in all treatments were similar (

These results corroborated the results from previous studies that showed that oregano leaf (essential oil presented 1.4% or 1.58% of oregano leaf DM) supplementation to lactating dairy cows had no effect on rumen pH [

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Lin et al. concluded that the ruminal pH value was not altered by the addition of a blend of EO (1.0 g•d
