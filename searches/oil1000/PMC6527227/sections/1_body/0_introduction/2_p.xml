<p class="p">Oregano essential oil (OEO) is an aromatic volatile oil extracted from oregano (
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare L</italic>.). The principal compounds of OEO are carvacrol, thymol, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cimene and linalool [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Several studies have reported that OEO possesses antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Feed efficiency was improved when feeding OEO via stimulating the beneficial gut microbes [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] while inhibiting pathogenic microorganism growth, i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Feeding OEO to swamp buffalos [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and rabbits [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] reduced the total microbial load and specific pathogens. In the previous study, we observed that the NDF degradability was increased by supplying 4 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> OEO in the diet of sheep, and the concentrations of acetate and propionate were increased by supplying 7 g•d
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> OEO [
 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, there is a lack of ruminant (sheep) data for hypothesis testing that feeding OEO maybe beneficial for altering ruminal pH and microbial populations. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of OEO on the ruminal pH and microbiota using qPCR in further.
