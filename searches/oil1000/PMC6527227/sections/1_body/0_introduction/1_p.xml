<p class="p">In recent decades, a large number of chemical additives (antibiotics, ionophores, etc) have been used in ruminant production to modulate rumen fermentation and to improve growth and feed efficiency. However, the residues of most chemical additives in animal products and bacterial resistence to antibiotics led to the growing public concern over the health risks and environment impacts [

 <xref rid="pone.0217054.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. As a result, a number of studies have been conducted to investigate natural alternatives (essential oils, tannins, saponins, etc) to the chemical feed additives in ruminant production. Among these natural alternatives, essential oils (EOs) have been demonstrated that could manipulate rumen fermentation [
