  <p class="p">Interaction of compound 25 with OASS-B. Panel (A) Dependence of the percent inhibition of OASS-B catalytic activity on compound 25 concentration. Activity assays were carried out in the presence of 0.6 mM bisulphide and 1 mM OAS at 25 °C. Line through data points is the fitting to a hyperbolic function, drawn to guide the eye. Panel (B) Competitive binding assay. Fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation at 412 nm were collected in the absence and presence of 200 µM 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (1-ECP-1,2-DCA). The increase in the fluorescence emission indicates the formation of a specific complex with OASS-B. Addition of 190 µM compound 25 does not change the emission spectrum. Spectra were collected in 100 mM Hepes buffer, 1% DMSO, pH 7, 20 °C.</p>
