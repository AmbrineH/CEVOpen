 <bold class="bold">General procedure for the synthesis of phosphonoacetates 35</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">38.</bold> The desired heterocycle (1.1 equiv) was added to a solution of ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate (1 equiv) in triethylamine (1 equiv). The solution gradually turned pale yellow and after 15 min at room temperature the starting material was completely consumed and the volatiles were evaporated to dryness. The crude material obtained was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using a gradient of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether to afford the desired compounds. Yields, purification methods and other analytical data are reported below.
