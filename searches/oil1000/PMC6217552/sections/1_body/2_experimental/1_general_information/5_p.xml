 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-BuLi (2 equiv) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> (2 equiv) in dry DME (2.5 ml/mmol), stirring under nitrogen at room temperature. After 30 min, the proper styrene oxide (1 equiv) was added in one portion. The reaction was stirred at 90 °C for about 18 h and then quenched with the addition of saturated NH
