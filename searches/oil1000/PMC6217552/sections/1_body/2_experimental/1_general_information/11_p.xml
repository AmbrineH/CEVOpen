 <bold class="bold">General procedure for the synthesis amides 16</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">22.</bold> To a solution of 1-(4-methylbenzyl)-2-phenylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (1 equiv) in dry DMF (20 ml/mmol), 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-ethyldiisopropylamine (5 equiv), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (1.5 equiv) and N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (2 equiv) were added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then the proper amine (2 equiv) was added. Afterwards, reaction mixture was heated at 50 °C overnight. Volatiles were evaporated and the residue was solubilised in acetonitrile (1 ml), filtered and purified by HPLC. Yields and other analytical data are reported below.
