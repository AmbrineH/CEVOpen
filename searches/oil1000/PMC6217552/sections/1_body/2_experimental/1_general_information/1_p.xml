<p class="p">All the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Alfa-Aesar (Haverhill, MA), or Fluorochem (Hadfield, UK) at reagent purity and, unless otherwise noted, were used without any further purification. Dry solvents used in the reactions were obtained by distillation of technical grade materials over appropriate dehydrating agents. MCRs were performed using CEM Microwave Synthesizer-Discover model. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography on silica gel-coated aluminium foils (silica gel on Al foils, SUPELCO Analytical, Sigma-Aldrich) at 254 and 365 nm. Where indicated, intermediates and final products were purified by silica gel flash chromatography (silica gel, 0.040−0.063 mm), using appropriate solvent mixtures.

 </xref> C NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER AVANCE spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, with TMS as internal standard. 1H NMR spectra are reported in this order: multiplicity and number of protons. Standard abbreviation indicating the multiplicity were used as follows: s: singlet, d: doublet, dd: doublet of doublets, t: triplet, q: quadruplet, m: multiplet, and br: broad signal. HPLC/MS experiments were performed with an Agilent 1100 series HPLC apparatus, equipped with a Waters Symmetry C18, 3.5 μm, 4.6 mm × 75 mm column and an MS: Applied Biosystem/MDS SCIEX instrument, with API 150EX ion surce. Analytical, preparative HPLC and Electron Spray Ionization condition (ESI) mass spectra were performed on an Agilent uHPLC (1290 Infinity) and an Agilent Prep-HPLC (1260 Infinity) both equipped with a Diode Array Detector and a Quadrupole MS Dusing mixture gradients of Formic acid/water/acetonitrile as system solvent. HRMS experiments were performed with an LTQ ORBITRAP XL THERMO apparatus. All compounds were tested as 95% purity or higher (by HPLC/MS).
