 </bold>. Ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate (1 g, 4.5 mmol) was added dropwise to a cooled suspension of NaH (196 mg, 4.9 mmol) in dry DME (9 ml). After stirring at room temperature for 2 h, 1-(bromomethyl)-4-methylbenzene (910 mg, 4.9 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for additional 2 h. After quenching with water, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 ml), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na
