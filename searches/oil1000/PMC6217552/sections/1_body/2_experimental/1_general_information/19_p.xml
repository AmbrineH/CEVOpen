 </bold> Dry triethylamine (300 µL, 2.2 mmol) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (365 µL, 1.7 mmol) were added to a solution of compound 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold> (409 mg, 1.5 mmol) in dry 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-BuOH (5 ml). After stirring overnight at 90 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction mixture was then concentrated under vacuum and gently poured into a 10% Na

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and concentrated under reduced pressure, to give a black pitch that was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:9 9 → 3:97). The title compound was obtained as a yellowish oil in 50% yield.
