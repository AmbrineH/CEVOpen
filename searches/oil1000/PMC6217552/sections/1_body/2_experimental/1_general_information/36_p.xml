 <bold class="bold">General procedure for Corey-Chaykovsky reaction (synthesis of compounds 4, 32, 43</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">46).</bold> Trimethylsufoxonium iodide (1.2 equiv) was added to a suspension of NaH (1.2 equiv) in dry DMSO (5 ml/mmol) stirred under nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 0 °C, a solution of the desired acrylate intermediate (1 equiv) in dry DMSO (2 ml/mmol) was added dropwise over 20 min, and the resulting mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. Water (80 ml) was added and the resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 ml). The organic phases were separated, washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na
