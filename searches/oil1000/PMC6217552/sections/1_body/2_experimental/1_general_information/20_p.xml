 <bold class="bold">General procedure for the preparation of sulphonamides 24 and 25.</bold> Trifluoroacetic acid (55 equiv) was added dropwise to a solution of tert-butyl (1-(4-methylbenzyl)-2-phenylcyclopropyl)carbamate (1 equiv) in dichloromethane (18 ml/mmol) kept at 0 °C, and the reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 h. After removal of the solvent in vacuum, the residue was dissolved in dry dichloromethane (7 ml/mmol) and cooled to −15 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Dry triethylamine (3 equiv) and the proper sulphonyl chloride (1 equiv) were then added, and, after stirring at −15 °C for 1 h, additional triethylamine (3 equiv) and sulphonyl chloride (0.1 equiv) were added dropwise. After 90 min, the reaction was quenched with the addition of water (2 ml), and the organic layers were separated, washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na
