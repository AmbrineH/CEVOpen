 <bold class="bold">Ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate (34).</bold> Triethyl phosphonoacetate (2.23 mmol, 440 µL) was added to a suspension of paraformaldehyde (4.46 mmol, 138 mg) in piperidine (0.02 mmol, 22 µL) and methanol (5.4 ml) at 80 °C, and the reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for about 36 h until consumption of the starting material. The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue obtained was taken up in toluene (1 ml/mmol), treated with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.22 mmol, 38 mg), and refluxed in a Dean-stark apparatus for 16 h. After removal of the solvent, the desired compound was obtained as a yellow-brownish oil in quantitative yield and used in the next reaction step without further purification.
