 <italic class="italic">t-</italic>BuOK (1 M in THF, 1.2 eq) was added dropwise to a solution of the properly functionalised propanoate (1.1 equiv) in dry THF (0.9 ml/mmol) stirring at 0 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. After reacting for 30 min, the proper aldehyde (1 equiv) was added to the mixture, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. After complete consumption of the starting material according to TLC volatiles were evaporated. The residue was taken up with ethyl acetate (15 ml), that was washed with water (3 × 10 ml), brine, dried over anhydrous Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a residue that was purified by flash column chromatography. Yields, purification methods and other analytical data are reported below.
