After stirring 2 h at room temperature, benzyl bromide (2.14 ml, 1.8 mmol) was added and the reaction was heated at 60 °C for 2 h. Water (10 ml) was carefully added and the resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 ml). The organic phases were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na
