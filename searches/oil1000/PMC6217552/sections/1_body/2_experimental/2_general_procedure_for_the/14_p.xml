The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at 130 °C for 16 h until TLC monitoring revealed complete consumption of the starting material. 1 N HCl aq. solution (10 ml) was added and the resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 ml). The organic phases were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na
