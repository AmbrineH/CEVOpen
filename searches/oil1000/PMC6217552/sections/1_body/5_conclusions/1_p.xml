<p class="p">Small-molecule inhibitors of OASS enzymes have been developed since the inhibition of cysteine biosynthesis might be a valuable means to tackle down resistant infections. Despite the most potent molecule of the series exhibits a nanomolar affinity towards OASS isoforms, it was not able to interfere with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> growth in minimum medium, allegedly because of the poor permeability of the compound. Although the physicochemical properties that enable small molecule accumulation in the Gram-negative bacteria are yet not understood, previous analyses with different sets of compounds suggested that including nitrogen atoms in the structure is a fruitful option in order to obtain compounds able to cross Gram-negative cell wall. Therefore, we modified our hit molecule towards more polar derivatives by including in the structure nitrogen-containing groups or heterocycles. On the other side, the carboxylic acid group was replaced by several isosters. Most of the compounds synthesised were found to maintain good binding affinity in the biochemical assays, corroborating the rational design of the analogues and allowing additional body of SAR to be reported. Substitution of the carboxylic acid group by a sulphonamide not only was found to be tolerated, but a novel mechanism of partial inhibition, to be further investigated, was disclosed. The most potent enzyme binders, assayed on the Gram-negative model organism 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in minimum medium, did not show MIC lower than 256 μg/mL. It might be hypothesised that despite the increase of polarity through the introduction of nitrogen-containing functional groups is tolerated in terms of SAR, probably some features such as the negative charge of the carboxylic acid are detrimental for the accumulation of the compounds. Based on these novel SAR insights, further chemical modifications are currently ongoing in our laboratories.
