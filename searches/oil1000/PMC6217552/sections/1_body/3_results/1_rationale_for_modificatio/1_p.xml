<p class="p">In our previous works, the structure of a poorly bioavailable peptide inhibitor was first simplified to obtain a substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acid, the further optimisation of which led to compound 
 <bold class="bold">II</bold>, a nanomolar binder of OASS-A

 </xref>. The cyclopropane ring, that maintains the two moieties in the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> configuration, proved to be a valuable spacer. An additional substitution at the C1 of the cyclopropane strongly affects both the potency of the compound and its selectivity toward both 
 <italic class="italic">St</italic>OASS-A and 
 <italic class="italic">St</italic>OASS-B isoforms. Interestingly, stereochemistry proved to be extremely important in conferring high potency, as the 
 <italic class="italic">2S</italic> enantiomer resulted more potent than the 
 <italic class="italic">2â€‰R</italic> counterpart by a 1000-fold average. Based on these preliminary hints, in this work we have further investigated the chemical space around compound 
 <bold class="bold">II</bold> with the aim of maintaining high inhibitory potency of the enzyme while improving the bacterial cell penetration. The aromatic ring attached at the C2 of the cyclopropane, the carboxylic acid, and the benzylic moiety attached at the C1, were considered as key characteristics for the activity. Taking this into account, modifications of the molecule at three different parts were proposed (
