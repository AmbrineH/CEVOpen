<p class="p">To investigate whether the carboxylic acid functionality might be modified, we replaced it with isosteric groups. Among the set of possible substituents, sulphonamides, a tetrazole ring and amides were initially investigated. While the sulphonamide group is a nonplanar isoster of the carboxylic acid, the tetrazole is planar and presents a similar acidity. On a similar vein, substituted amides were prepared because it is well known that the nature of the substituents might affect the selectivity of action toward different bacterial strains, either Gram-positive or Gram-negative
