<p class="p">Pyridylmethyl substituted carboxylic acid 
 <bold class="bold">33</bold> was prepared starting form triethyl phosphonoacetate (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>). This was transformed to ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-3-(pyridin-4-yl) propanoate (
 <bold class="bold">30</bold>) by alkylation with 4-(bromomethyl) pyridine in the presence of sodium hydride. The reaction of intermediate 
 <bold class="bold">30</bold> with benzaldehyde provided substrate 
 <bold class="bold">31</bold> for Corey–Chaykovsky cyclopropanation that gave ester 
 <bold class="bold">32</bold>. The condensation of triethyl phosphonoacetate (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) with paraformaldehyde gave unsaturated phosphonoacetate 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold> which was subjected to Michael addition with a set of heterocycles, affording compounds 
 <bold class="bold">35</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">38</bold>. Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction of these intermediates gave the corresponding acrylates 
 <bold class="bold">39–42</bold>, that were subjected to cyclopropanation using Corey–Chaykovsky conditions, as described above.
