<p class="p">Compounds 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7,</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">14</bold> were synthesised using an already reported protocol
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>
 </xref>. The reaction of phosphonoacetate 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> with styrene oxides allowed the stereoselective synthesis of the required stereodefined 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-R-phenyl-1-(4-methylbenzyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylate esters 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">14</bold>. On a similar vein, Wittig reaction between phosphonoacetate 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> and the proper aldehydes provided intermediates 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">31</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">39–42</bold>, that were cyclopropanated under Corey–Chaykovsky conditions to give the corresponding esters 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">32</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">43</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">46</bold>. Styrene oxides, when not commercially available, were synthesised from the styrene or the aldehyde derivatives in good overall yields. Nucleophilic substitution of chloride with 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>-propylamine in intermediate 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> gave an ester 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold> which was hydrolysed to acid 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold>, whereas catalytic hydrogenation of nitro group in intermediate 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> and subsequent hydrolysis of ester 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold> provided acid 
 <bold class="bold">12</bold>.
