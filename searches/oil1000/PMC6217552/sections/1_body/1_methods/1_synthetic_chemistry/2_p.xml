<p class="p">Hydrolysis of ester 
 <bold class="bold">14</bold> gave raise to key intermediate acid 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>, that was used as key intermediate for the synthesis of amides 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold>â€“
 <bold class="bold">22</bold> using standard amide bond forming conditions. Carboxylic acid 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold> was also subjected to Curtius rearrangement in the presence of diphenylphosphoryl azide, triethylamine, and using 
 <italic class="italic">tert-</italic>butanol as a solvent. The resulting Boc-amine 
 <bold class="bold">23</bold> was deprotected under acidic conditions and transformed to sulphonamides 
 <bold class="bold">24</bold> and
