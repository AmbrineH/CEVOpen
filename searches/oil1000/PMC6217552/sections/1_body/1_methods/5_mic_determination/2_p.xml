 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922 was grown until log phase on liquid Mueller–Hinton broth at 37 °C in a shaker at 225 rpm. Bacterial suspension was then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min and diluted with phosphate buffer to obtain a solution with a turbidity of about 0.5 McFarland. Bacterial suspension was further diluted (1:100) with fresh LB 20%. Fifty microliters of the bacterial suspension containing 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL were inoculated into each well, to obtain a final concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL. Each plate contained growth control wells and sterility check wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C without agitation during 16h–24h and MIC was determined.
