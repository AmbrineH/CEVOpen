<p class="p">Minimal inhibitory concentration assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Twenty-Fourth Informational Supplement; CLSI document M100-S24, CLSI; 2014.). The compounds were dissolved in DMSO to obtain a stock solution 100-fold more concentrated than the desired higher concentration and then 10 serial dilutions were performed. One microliter of each dilution was transferred to the microtiter plate.</p>
