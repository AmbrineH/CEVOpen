<p class="p">Several attempts to rationalise the properties that allow small molecule penetration in Gram-negative bacteria and therefore increase the success of antibacterial drug-discovery programmes have been made

 </xref>. Quantification of drug accumulation with a set of compounds exhibiting different properties was performed, and these studies provided an observation that positively charged compounds possessing a non-sterically hindered amine, show higher permeability. Also rigidity, low globularity and amphiphilicity contributed significantly to enhance the compound penetration

However, despite the numerous attempts made, there are not unequivocal rules available to predict the physicochemical properties required for the accumulation of a small molecule into the bacterial cell, therefore the chemical manipulation of hit compounds still remains the most valuable means to improve activity in cells. These considerations prompted us to carry out a ligand-based drug design approach for the synthesis of analogues of compound
