 <bold class="bold">II</bold> was evaluated in minimal medium against 
 <italic class="italic">E.coli</italic>. Despite its high potency in the enzymatic assays, it failed to show appreciable inhibitory activity on cell growth. Further biological evaluation suggested poor permeability as the main reason for the lack of activity on bacterial cell growth, as the co-administration of sub-lethal concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), a permeabilizing agent, eventually led to a measurable MIC for this derivative [manuscript in preparation].
