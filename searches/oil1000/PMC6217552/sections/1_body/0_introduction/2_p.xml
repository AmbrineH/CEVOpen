<p class="p">OASS-A is a homodimer of 315 amino acid residues 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> subunit and the two active sites are located on opposite side, far from the dimer interface. Each subunit is made of two domains, a C-terminal and an N-terminal domain. In turn, each domain is composed of an α/β-fold with a central twisted β-sheet surrounded by α-helixes
