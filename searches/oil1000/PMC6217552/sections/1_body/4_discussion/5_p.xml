<p class="p">We investigated the ability of the new set of compounds to interfere with bacterial growth. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in a medium with limiting cysteine, using the Gram-negative model organism, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC25922, was calculated for the most potent enzyme binders: compounds 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">12</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">24</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">33</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">47â€“50</bold>. Unfortunately, none of the synthesised compounds was able to interfere significantly with bacterial growth (data not shown), which shows that the chemical modifications, although suitable to grant enzyme inhibition, did not allow to achieve sufficient inhibitor accumulation in bacteria.
