<p class="p">It is worthwhile to notice that one of the main hurdles in the development of small molecules inhibitors of OASS is the consistent lower affinity that compounds display towards the B-isoform with respect to the A-isoform. Also in this case, the molecules reported showed dissociation constants in the high-micromolar range for the B-isoform and this could be too high to completely saturate the enzyme
