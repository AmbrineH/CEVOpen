<p class="p">Medicinal chemistry rationales were used to modify the structure of cyclopropane carboxylic acids as inhibitors of OASS in a Gram-negative bacterium. A total of 20 compounds were designed and synthesised in this study to evaluate the effect of the chemical modifications to both enzymatic and antibacterial activities, leading to additional SAR information. The cyclopropane motif was kept since it contributes to the favourable positioning of the substituents in OASS pocket, and, moreover, it provides rigidity to the molecule. The new set of molecules was then biochemically evaluated on both isoforms of the recombinant OASS enzyme from

For most compounds the potency was assessed by fluorometric titration, exploiting the increase in the fluorescence emission of the cofactor upon binding to the active site. Compounds with substituents different from carboxylate were unable to elicit the fluorescence changes and for this reason their potency was measured by activity assays.
