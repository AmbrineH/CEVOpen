 <p> Response of recovery of reducing equivalents ([2H]) (%) to CH 4 produced per gram of OM truly digested. Solid lines represent responses and dotted lines are 95% confidence bands. [2H] recovery (%) into: (i) VFA and gases: • y = 37.0 (±1.82; p &lt; 0.001) + incubation (random, p = 0.77) + 0.041 (±0.0050; p &lt; 0.001) x; R 2 = 0.58; (ii) VFA, gases and amino acids (AA) with maximum incorporation of [2H] into AA synthesis: • y = 42.9 (±2.83; p &lt; 0.001) + incubation (random, p = 0.34) + 0.035 (±0.0044; p &lt; 0.001) x; R 2 = 0.62; (iii) VFA, gases and AA with minimum incorporation of [2H] into AA synthesis: • y = 38.1 (±1.89; p &lt; 0.001) + incubation (random, p = 0.60) + 0.038 (±0.0045; p &lt; 0.001) x; R 2 = 0.60. </p>
