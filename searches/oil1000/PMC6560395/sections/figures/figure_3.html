 <p> Dendrogram of bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile of the rumen in vitro batch cultures. ( a) DGGE bacterial profiles of: BTCM, bromotrichlorometane; CL, chloroform; BES, 2-bromoethanesulfonate; Control, control treatment containing no inhibitor; AQ, 9,10-anthraquinone; ( b) DGGE bacterial profiles of: SN, sodium nitrate; Control, control treatment containing no inhibitor; LO, linseed oil; E2B, ethyl-2-butynoate; PA, propynoic acid. Samples of two replicates per treatment of incubation run three were run on two DGGE gels. </p>
