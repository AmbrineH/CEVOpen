<p class="p">It has been proposed that some of the unaccounted [2H] incorporated into the main fermentation products when methanogenesis is inhibited may be explained by increases in microbial biomass production, along with changes in its composition [

 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] observed that inhibiting methanogenesis decreased deamination of AA in trypticase. Amination involves incorporation of one mol of [2H] per mol of ammonia, whereas deamination involves the release of [2H] [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Thus, part of the unaccounted [2H] resulting from methanogenesis inhibition could perhaps be explained by greater AA synthesis and lesser deamination. The main objective of this experiment was to study the changes in fermentation products and microbial AA as a consequence of inhibiting methanogenesis in rumen batch cultures using a range of chemical inhibitors and linseed oil. Our hypothesis was that changes in the synthesis of microbial AA could partly explain the decrease in [2H] recovery in main fermentation products when methanogenesis is inhibited. We also conducted a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to provide insights about how changes observed in fermentation and microbial growth associated with changes in the microbial community composition. Under the conditions of this experiment, uptake of [2H] for microbial AA biosynthesis did not explain the consistent decline occurring in [2H] recovery when methanogenesis is inhibited.
