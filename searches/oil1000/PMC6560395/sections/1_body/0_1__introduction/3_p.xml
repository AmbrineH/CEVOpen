<p class="p">Various strategies to control CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> formation in the rumen are currently being investigated. Rumen methanogenesis can be strongly inhibited by various chemical compounds [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and oils such as linseed oil [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Whereas some of these additives and ingredients can inhibit methane production effectively, benefits in production have been inconsistent despite the theoretical gain of energy not lost as CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In vitro evidence from multiple experiments meta-analyzed has shown some undesirable and incompletely understood consequences of inhibiting methanogenesis, such as a decrease in total enthalpy output in volatile fatty acids (VFA) and a consistent decrease in the recovery of reducing equivalents pairs ([2H]) recovered in the main fermentation products [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It would be important to gain a thorough understanding of the changes occurring in [H] sinks when methanogenesis is inhibited in rumen fermentation.
