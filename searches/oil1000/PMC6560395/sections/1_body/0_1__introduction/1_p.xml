<p class="p">Ruminants can transform roughages and non-protein nitrogen (N) otherwise unavailable to humans into meat, milk, wool, and traction. Essential to this nutritional flexibility is the presence of a complex microbial community in the rumen, which is able to degrade structural carbohydrates and synthesize amino acids (AA) by incorporating ammonia into carbon chains. In the fermentation of monosaccharides released from the degradation of complex carbohydrates in the rumen, metabolic hydrogen ([H]) is generated in redox reactions in bacterial, protozoal, and fungal cells, reducing intracellular cofactors. For fermentation to continue reduced cofactors need to be re-oxidized, which to an important extent occurs through the formation of dihydrogen (H
