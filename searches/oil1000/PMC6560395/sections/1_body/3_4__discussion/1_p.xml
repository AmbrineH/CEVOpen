<p class="p">We used a chemically pure, N-depleted substrate such as pure cellulose to be able to quantify the production of microbial N and AA without a microbial marker. We decreased both microbial and non-microbial N initially present in the incubations by drastically decreasing the proportion of inoculum from 20 [

The rationale was that decreasing non-ammonium N initially present in the incubations would increase the proportion of N and AA in the incubation residue corresponding to microbial N, allowing to better evaluate the effects of the methanogenesis-inhibiting treatments. However, because such a pronounced decrease in the amount of inoculum would increase the lag time of the incubations substantially, the total incubation time was extended to 72 h based on preliminary results [
