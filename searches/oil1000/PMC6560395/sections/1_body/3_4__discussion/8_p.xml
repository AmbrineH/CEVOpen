<p class="p">Taking into account microbial AA synthesis could increase [2H] recovery by between 1.0 and 5.7 percentage units (calculated as the differences in the intercepts in [2H] recovery in VFA and gases, and [2H] recovery in VFA and gases plus AA;

It is important to consider that in the microbial cultures of the present experiment, the incorporation of [H] into AA biosynthesis was maximized by not providing preformed AA. However, the increase in [2H] recovery due to considering the incorporation of [2H] into AA synthesis was independent of the extent of methanogenesis inhibition, as reflected by the similar slopes of the responses of [2H] recovery in VFA and gases, and in VFA and gases plus AA, to CH
