<p class="p">Inhibiting rumen methanogenesis in vitro has been found to steadily decrease the recovery of [2H] in the sum of main [H] sinks CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, propionate, butyrate, and the intermediate H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which typically accumulates when CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production is inhibited [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Ungerfeld [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] speculated that greater availability of [H] resulting from methanogenesis inhibition may stimulate the incorporation of NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> into carbon chains for AA synthesis. Under the concentrations of NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> generally found in the rumen, incorporation of NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> into carbon chains predominantly involves low-affinity systems such as NADP- and NAD-glutamate dehydrogenases, and alanine dehydrogenases [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], reactions that are coupled to the incorporation of [H] [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, inhibiting methanogenesis did not increase the production of microbial OM or N, nor the incorporation of [2H] into the synthesis of microbial AA. Some inhibitors altered the proportion of particular AA in the total, but a general consequence of methanogenesis inhibition on the AA profile could not be established.
