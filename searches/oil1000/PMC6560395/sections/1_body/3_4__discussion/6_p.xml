<p class="p">The additives effects on digestion, fermentation, and microbial AA composition seemed to associate well with changes in the microbial community composition as reflected by the pattern of bands in the DGGE analysis. Chloroform and BTCM, both being chemical halogenated analogues of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, had similar effects on digestion, fermentation, and microbial AA composition, and clustered together in the DGGE analysis. Sodium nitrate and PA had similar effects on digestion and fermentation, inhibited the synthesis of the same AA, and also clustered together in the DGGE analysis. In previous work, however, PA and SN had clustered apart in a DGGE analysis [

The exception to the associations between the effects on digestion, fermentation, and the AA profile with the DGGE pattern of bands was linseed oil, which was largely inert to digestion and fermentation but clustered apart from the Control treatment.
