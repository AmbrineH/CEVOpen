<p class="p">All additives except for linseed oil inhibited CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. Even though most additives also inhibited digestion and fermentation, as reflected by lower or numerically lower OM digestibility, total gas production, and total VFA concentration, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was not decreased solely on the basis of less OM being digested, as CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production per unit of truly digested OM was also decreased. A negative effect of linseed oil on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production had been expected because the predominant fatty acid in linseed oil is the highly unsaturated α-linolenic acid [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], a strong inhibitor of methanogenesis in batch culture [

 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. It is possible that the small amount of inoculum used in this experiment was insufficient for hydrolyzing triacylglycerides in linseed oil to release substantial amounts of α-linolenic acid during the incubations in order to exert its toxicity to methanogens [
