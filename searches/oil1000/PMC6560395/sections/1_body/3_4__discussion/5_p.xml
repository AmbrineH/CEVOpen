 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found increases or lack of effects of AQ at an initial concentration of up to 5 ppm in rumen batch cultures on propionate molar percentage, although 10 ppm in continuous cultures decreased propionate molar percentage. It seems that the greatest concentrations of AQ, PA, and E2B evaluated in the different studies may negatively affect succinate or propionate producers or both. In the present study, this might have been exacerbated by the small volume of inoculum, which could have decreased the initial microbial diversity in the incubations. The smallest final E

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in total gas caused by AQ suggests that the system had problems to dispose [H] into pathways alternative to methanogenesis such as propionate formation.
