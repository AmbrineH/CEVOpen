<p class="p">Fermentation was atypical in some aspects, such as propionate being a more important sink of [H] than CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in the Control treatment. The proportion of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in total gas in the Control treatment was also high considering that it was only surpassed by BES and AQ. Also, [H] recovery both in the control treatment and under methanogenesis inhibition was lower than what was reported in a previous meta-analysis of methanogenesis inhibited batch cultures [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The lower than typical importance of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> as a [H] sink compared with propionate and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and the relatively small acetate to propionate molar ratio for a cellulose substrate, suggest that some conditions in the Control treatment might have negatively affected the growth of methanogens [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. It is possible that the small volume of inoculum, and perhaps the artificial nature of the pure cellulose substrate, resulted in deficiencies of vitamins or micronutrients which could have negatively affected methanogenesis, even though yeast extract and a complex micromineral solution were added to the medium intending to cover for possible deficiencies in minerals and vitamins.
