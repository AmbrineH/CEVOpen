<p class="p">Guyader et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] reported a linear increase in acetate molar percentage in rumen batch cultures with increasing initial concentration of nitrate, although propionate molar percentage and the acetate to propionate molar ratio were not affected in their study. Nitrate has a dual mechanism to inhibit methanogenesis, by competing for [H] as a strong electron acceptor in its reduction to NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, and through its reduction intermediate nitrite, which is toxic to methanogens [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The observed increase in the acetate to propionate ratio and the numerical decrease in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration suggests that the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> competed not only with CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> but also with propionate as a [H] sink. In the present experiment, total reduction of nitrate to NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> would have potentially incorporated 5.2 mmol of [2H] and decreased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by 1.3 mmol (calculations not shown), which is greater than the observed decrease in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. However, complete reduction of nitrate to NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> did not seem to occur, as the final NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> concentration was not altered by SN. The unaffected final NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> concentration was not a consequence of increased NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> incorporation into microbial biomass, as SN resulted in lower microbial N production. Although nitrite concentration was not measured, it seems likely that much of added nitrate probably accumulated as nitrite, which could in turn explain the strong inhibition of fermentation reflected by the decrease in total VFA concentration in the SN treatment. Possibly, low availability of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the SN treatment limited the reduction of nitrate to NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. Part of N in added nitrate might have also been incorporated into other compounds such as nitrous oxide [
