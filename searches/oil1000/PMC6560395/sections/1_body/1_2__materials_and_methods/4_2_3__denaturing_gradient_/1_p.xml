<p class="p">Frozen samples for DGGE analysis from the third incubation run of the experiment were thawed and total microbial gDNA was extracted using the repeated bead-beating protocol of Yu and Forster [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. gDNA concentration was measured using a Maestrogen spectrophotometer (Maestrogen, Hsinchu City, Taiwan). The V3 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was amplified by PCR using primers 341f-GC and 543r, following procedures described by Martínez et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Purified PCR products were quantified using the NanoQuant Plate (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples of two replicates per treatment from incubation run three were run on two DGGE gels. To standardize the amount of PCR amplicon loaded onto the gel, 100 ng of the purified bacterial PCR product was loaded into each well of a DGGE gel. PCR products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel with a denaturing gradient of 30 to 60% urea/formamide in a solution of 0.5× TAE buffer at 60 °C using the DCode System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and run at 100 V for 18 h. A ladder with multiples bands was run in two separate positions in the gel to aid in normalization during gel analysis. The gel was stained using the silver staining method [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Digitalized bacterial DGGE profiles were analyzed to calculate similarity matrices, and dendrograms with UPGMA algorithm for each gel based on band patterns with an optimization of 2% were constructed using Phoretix 1D (TotalLab Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).
