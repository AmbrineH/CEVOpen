<p class="p">Incubated cellulose contained 95% DM, and 0.03% total N, 97.7% NDF (DM basis), and undetectable total ashes. The amount of undigested cellulose substrate expressed as DM was calculated by dividing the NDF content in the undigested residue by cellulose NDF content. As incubated cellulose had undetectable total ash content, undigested cellulose DM was assumed to be equal to undigested cellulose organic matter (OM):
