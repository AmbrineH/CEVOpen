<p class="p">Total gas pressure in the serum bottles at the beginning and at the end of the incubations was calculated as the measured gas pressure plus 101,325 Pa (1 atm). The number of moles of total gas present at the beginning and at the end of the incubations was calculated using the ideal gas law [
