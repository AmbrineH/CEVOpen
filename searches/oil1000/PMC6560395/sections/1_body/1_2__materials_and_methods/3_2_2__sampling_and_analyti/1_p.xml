Bottles were then shaken for a few seconds to re-suspend solid particles, and 1-mL aliquots were sampled using plastic Pasteur pipettes, and transferred to eppendorfs and stored at −80 °C until DNA was extracted for DGGE analysis. Bottles were again shaken for a few seconds to re-suspend solid particles and 10 mL were transferred to 15 mL Falcon tubes and kept frozen at −20 °C until lyophilized and analyzed for AA content. The remaining content of the bottles was centrifuged into pre-weighted bottles at 10,956×
