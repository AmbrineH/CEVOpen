 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a Clarus 580 PerkinElmer GC equipped with a 60/80 Carboxen 1000 (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) packed column and a thermal conductivity detector and an isothermal oven temperature of 180 °C, using N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 30 mL/min as a carrier gas. Samples for VFA analysis were thawed, vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was then filtered through 0.45 µm pore cellulose filters into 2 mL GC vials. One microliter VFA sample was injected in a PerkinElmer Clarus580 GC equipped with an Elite-FFAP (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA) capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Helium at 1.5 mL was the carrier gas. Initial temperature was 90 °C with a 12 °C/min ramp until 150 °C, which was held for 5 min.
