Amino acids contents were analyzed in Falcon tubes containing 10-mL culture aliquots with suspended solid particles stored frozen. Tubes were lyophilized and subsamples of approximately 20 mg were transferred to hydrolysis tubes and added 1 mL of a 6 M hydrochloric acid and 1% (

Tubes contents were filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose filters and 20 µL of the filtrate diluted with ultrapure water to 500 µL. Ten microliters of the resulting dilution were derivatized with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidylcarbamate using the Waters
