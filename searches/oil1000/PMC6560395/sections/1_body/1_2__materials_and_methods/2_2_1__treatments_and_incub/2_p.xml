<p class="p">One hundred milliliters of pooled rumen fluid were delivered under oxygen (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)-free carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and approximately 50 mL of rumen solids from both cows were added. The resulting mixture of fluid and solids was subjected to an eggbeater at low speed under O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-free CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 1 min (composed by bursts of approximately 3 s followed by 2 s breaks) to detach microorganisms adhered to solid particles. After egg beating, the mixture of fluid and solids was filtered through two layers of synthetic cloth under O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-free CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to obtain the rumen inoculum.
