<p class="p">Approximately 0.5 L of rumen contents were sampled from the center of the rumen of each of two ruminally-cannulated non-pregnant, non-lactating, Holstein cows. Cows were fed ryegrass (
 <italic class="italic">Lolium multiflorum</italic>) hay [5.8% crude protein, 59.4% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 6.0% total ashes, dry matter (DM) basis] once per day in the morning. Rumen contents were sampled before feeding around 10 am, and filtered through two layers of synthetic cloth. The fluid fraction from both cows was pooled, and the pooled fluid as well as the solids were transported to the laboratory in separate insulated containers.
