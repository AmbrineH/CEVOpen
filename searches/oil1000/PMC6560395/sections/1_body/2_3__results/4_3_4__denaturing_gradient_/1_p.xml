<p class="p">There was variation among treatments in the DGGE patterns of bands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00115-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Bromotrichloromethane and chloroform clustered together. Bromoethanesulfonate showed a similar pattern of bands than the Control treatment. Sodium nitrate and AQ showed less intense band patterns than the Control and the other additives, with AQ forming a cluster by itself. A cluster of PA, E2B, and LO was also evidenced, with PA and E2B clustering closer.
