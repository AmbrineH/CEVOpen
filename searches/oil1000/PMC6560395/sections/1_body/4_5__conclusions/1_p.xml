<p class="p">Under the conditions of this experiment, biosynthesis of microbial AA accounted for a minor, but not negligible percentage of [2H] recovery, but it did not explain the decline in the recovery of [2H] in main fermentation products that occurs when methanogenesis is inhibited. In general, changes in fermentation and microbial biomass production and AA profile caused by eight different inhibitors of methanogenesis associated with the changes in the microbial community composition that they seemed to cause.</p>
