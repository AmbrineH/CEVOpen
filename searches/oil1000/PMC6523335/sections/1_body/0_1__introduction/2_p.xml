<p class="p">Terpenes and terpenoids (the oxygenated derivatives of terpenes [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]) are the chemical compounds representing the majority of molecules in essential oil composition [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This class of molecules is characterized by the combination of isoprene units (C
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>). Terpenes can be classified according to the number of isoprene units in their structure (e.g., hemiterpenes are formed by one isoprene unit, monoterpenes are formed by two isoprene units, sesquiterpenes by three isoprene units, and diterpene formed by four units) [

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Smaller terpenes, up to three isoprene units, are highly volatile, and the volatility decreases with an increased number of isoprene units [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Many biological activities of terpenes and terpenoids are described in the literature, being this class of molecules a valuable source of therapeutic agents with pharmaceutical applications, such as anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], antineoplastic applications [

 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In addition, some compounds of the class are widely investigated and reported as penetration enhancers for percutaneous drug delivery, being used as excipients in the preparation of nanostructured systems [

 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Smaller terpenes are usually thermolabile and susceptible to volatilization and degradation, mainly by oxidation and isomerization [
