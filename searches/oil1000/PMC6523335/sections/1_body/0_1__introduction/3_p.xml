<p class="p">The topical administration of drugs consists in the localized administration of formulations to an organism, comprising dermal and mucosal administrations (e.g., ocular, vaginal, nasal, and rectal routes). Among those, the most widely employed is the cutaneous route, which may be attributed to the easiness of access compared to other topic routes [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. When applied to the skin, a drug delivery system can be considered dermal (when the targeting site of the drug is the skin) or transdermal (when the drug needs to pass through skin layers in order to reach its target); for mucosal tissue administration, delivery can be mucosal and transmucosal [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Many issues concerning these delivery routes are described in the literature, such as the resistance to diffusion through the skin and mucosae when aiming towards transdermal or transmucosal delivery and the reduced contact of the formulation with mucosal tissues due to mucus and, thus, reduced drug bioavailability [
