Special nanostructured systems have been designed intending topical administration as approaches to overcome the drawbacks inherent to these administration routes, such as mucoadhesive systems that prolong the contact with mucosae and systems that favor the passage of the drug trough skin or mucosal tissue layers [

Molecular encapsulation through complexation with cyclodextrins is another strategy employed to improve the stability of essential oil components, avoid volatilization (and, consequently, prolonging contact,) and enhance permeation of the bioactive molecules [
