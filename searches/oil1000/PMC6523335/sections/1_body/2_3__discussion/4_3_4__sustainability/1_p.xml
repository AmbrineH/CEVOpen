<p class="p">In recent decades, the efforts to reduce the environmental impact of chemical compounds and develop green chemistry have been growing. Terpenes and essential oils comprise a renewable source of chemical compounds and have been already described in the literature as “greener” alternatives to pesticides [
 <xref rid="B116-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] and solvents [
 <xref rid="B117-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Concerning the preparation of nanostructured systems, essential oils and terpenes can be used as more sustainable additives, being able to substitute organic solvents in the preparation of nanocapsules [
 <xref rid="B118-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>] and in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B119-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. Also, effort has been made for the development of essential oil extraction techniques with no or less solvent and energy use without quality loss [
 <xref rid="B120-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. When observing the 12 principles of Green Chemistry [
 <xref rid="B121-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>], it is possible to see that the use of terpenes and essential oils may have some positive effects, since, as aforementioned, they are renewable supplies and present low toxicity [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Furthermore, in the development of new formulations containing essential oils and terpenes, the 12 principles (prevention, atom economy, less hazardous chemical synthesis, designing safer chemicals, safer solvents and auxiliaries, design for energy efficient, use of renewable feedstocks, reduce derivatives, catalysis, design for degradation, real-time analysis for pollution prevention, and inherently safer chemistry for accident prevention) should be respected, since, besides reducing the environmental impact of chemicals, they can also lead to lower costs of production [
 <xref rid="B122-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>], which can balance out investments made in the development and implementation of sustainable alternatives.
