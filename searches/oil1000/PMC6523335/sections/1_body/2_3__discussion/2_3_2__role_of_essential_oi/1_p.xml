<p class="p">In order to understand the applications of EO containing terpenes and/or isolated terpenes encapsulated in nanosystems intended for topical administration, the studies were divided between those in which EO/terpenes were used as excipient and those in which they were used as bioactive compounds. Of 82 studies, 56 employed terpenes/EO as bioactive ingredients in formulations, whereas 29 reported terpenes/EO as excipients in formulations (
