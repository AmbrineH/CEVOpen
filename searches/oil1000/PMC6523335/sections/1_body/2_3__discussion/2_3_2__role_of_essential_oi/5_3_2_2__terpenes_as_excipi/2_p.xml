<p class="p">Permeation enhancers are used as excipients in formulations and are capable of facilitating the passage of a drug through the skin. Besides their biological activities, essential oils and isolated terpenes have been described as promising permeation enhancers for transdermal drug delivery. They can enhance the passage of drugs through the skin by interacting with stratum corneum lipids and modifying the solubility characteristics of these lipids, facilitating drug partitioning towards deeper layers of the skin [

Furthermore, terpenes are considered safer than other permeation enhancers from a toxicological point of view, with some terpenes being included in the list of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) compounds from the US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) [
