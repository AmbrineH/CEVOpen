 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00138-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. The majority of systems are based on vesicular structures (LS, I,V and permeation-enhancing vehicles (PEV)), with the invasomes representing 27% of the nanostructured systems reported, followed by liposomes and nanoemulsions (20%).
