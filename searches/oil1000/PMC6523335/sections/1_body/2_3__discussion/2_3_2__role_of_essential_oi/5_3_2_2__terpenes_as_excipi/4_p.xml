<p class="p">Invasomes (also found in the literature as invasosomes) are special drug delivery systems that contain terpenes and are the most recurrent among the formulations of nanosystems using terpenes as excipients (

They are, by definition, vesicular systems consisting of terpenes, ethanol, and phospholipids as fundamental raw materials and present elasticity and deformability, which favors penetration across skin layers, and thus they work as penetration-enhancing vehicles [
