<p class="p">As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00138-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, a variety of different nanostructured systems are used in the encapsulation of EO and terpenes. It can be noticed that lipid-based nanosystems are used in 67% of the formulations reported, which may be attributed to their low toxicity.
