 <xref rid="B104-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>], it is important to pay attention to the preparation technique in terms on its influence on EO/terpene stability, because of their sensitivity to heat and pressure. In this context, the quantification of chemical markers of EO or terpenes is essential, especially in cases where they play a role as bioactive compounds, in order to ensure the integrity of EO/terpene content in the final formulation and, thus, the safety and efficacy of the final product [
