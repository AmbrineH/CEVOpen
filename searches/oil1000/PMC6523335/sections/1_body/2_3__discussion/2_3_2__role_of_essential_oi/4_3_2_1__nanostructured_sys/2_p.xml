 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Polymer-based systems can be constituted by natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic polymers and comprise systems such as nanocapsules (NC), nanoparticles (NP), nanofibers (NF), and nanogels (NG). On the other hand, the lipid-based systems, namely, nanoemulsions (NE), liposomes (LS), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), and vesicular systems (VS) which comprehend ethosomes, phytosomes, niosomes, glycerosomes, and invasomes (IV) [
