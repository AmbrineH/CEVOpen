<p class="p">Also, the complexation with cyclodextrins can be an interesting alternative, since it is reported to provide protection against environmental factors, improve stability, avoid volatilization of EO components, improve oral bioavailability, and reduce mucosal irritation [

Rode et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] studied the influence of cyclodextrin complexation on the percutaneous penetration in pig skin of the triterpenoid sericoside from a
