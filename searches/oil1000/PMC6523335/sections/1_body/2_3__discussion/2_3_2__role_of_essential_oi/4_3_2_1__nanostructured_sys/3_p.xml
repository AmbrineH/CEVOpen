<p class="p">Encapsulation in nanometric systems is widely described in the literature as an approach to overcome many disadvantages concerning essential oils by providing protection against environmental factors that can cause chemical degradation and avoiding volatilization of EO components. In addition, nanoencapsulation can improve the bioavailability, allow controlled drug release, and enable the passage of the bioactive compounds through biological barriers [

 <xref rid="B62-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] compared the cutaneous permeation of the sesquiterpene Hurpezine A from transdermal gels after encapsulation in three different systems, i.e., microemulsion (ME), SLN, and NLC, and the in vivo activity in an experimental mice model of induced amnesia. The ME formulation presented the highest cumulative permeated amounts, followed by NLC and SLN. The in vivo experiments presented no significant difference between the three formulations, but positive outcomes when compared to the negative control. In other study of comparison between different nanostructured systems, Flores et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] investigated nanocapsule suspensions and nanoemulsions containing tea tree oil against in in vitro onychomycosis models. Although both nanometric systems presented better antifungal activity compared to the coarse emulsion containing tea tree oil, the nanocapsule formulation was more effective against the microorganism. This may be attributed to the polymer barrier that prevents the volatilization of bioactive compounds as well as the capacity of the aqueous suspension to hydrate the tissue and therefore enhance the penetration of nanostructures.
