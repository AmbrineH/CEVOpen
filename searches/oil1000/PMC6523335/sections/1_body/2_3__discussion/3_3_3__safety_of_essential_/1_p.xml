 <xref rid="B114-biomolecules-09-00138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>] investigated the skin irritancy of essential oils and their isolated compounds, concluding that, in many cases, there is a potential induction of sensibilization upon exposure to these compounds. Some terpenes, as described in previous sections of this review, are used as permeation enhancers in drug delivery systems. They are considered non-toxic, nonirritant, and, therefore, a safe option for permeation enhancement [
