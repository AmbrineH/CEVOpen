<p class="p">The interest in the development of nanostructured systems containing essential oils and terpenes designed for topical administration routes has been rising in recent years. The majority of the formulations employ EO and/or terpenes as active ingredients encapsulated in nanostructured systems as means to improve the physicochemical properties and/or achieve greater bioavailability and controlled release of drugs. On the other hand, a part of the studies also shows the growing interest in using terpenes as permeation-enhancer excipients in transdermal delivery systems, a promising strategy for efficient and noninvasive drug delivery to the skin deeper layers.</p>
