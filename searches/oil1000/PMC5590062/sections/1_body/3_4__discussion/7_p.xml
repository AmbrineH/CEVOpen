<p class="p">Essential oil 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, containing mainly palmitic and myristic acids, and oil 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>, containing mostly eugenol, eugenol acetate and palmitic acid, showed an antimicrobial effect within the range already described for other oils. Furthermore, some fatty acids have already been studied for antimicrobial activity, but their MIC values were not as low as expected for high activity compounds [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The MIC values of myristic and palmitic acids were respectively 1600 μg/mL and &gt;1600 μg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Palmitic acid was also evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> with an MIC of 312.50 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and with MIC values &gt;256.42 μg/mL against

 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. As can be seen in these references, the antimicrobial activity of myristic and palmitic acids always showed MIC values higher than 100 μg/mL.
