  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">Fleagrass, 
   <italic class="italic">Adenosma buchneroides</italic>, is an aromatic perennial herb that occupies an important position in the life of the Akha people. They regard it as a tribal symbol and a gift of love. Fleagrass also has many medicinal uses, and there is considerable potential for its development as an insect repellent. Traditionally, Akha people plant it in swidden fields, but there are few swidden fields in China now. Therefore, the first question this study aims to answer is as follows: how is fleagrass planted and utilized now? At present, fleagrass is only reported to be used by Akha people in Mengla. We also try to understand the following questions: Is fleagrass used in nearby area? If so, how is fleagrass used in nearby area? Furthermore, why is fleagrass used in that way?

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">From August 2016 to July 2018, field surveys were conducted six times. The ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological uses of 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">buchneroides</italic> in 13 Akha villages were investigated by means of semi-structured interviews. We assessed the responses of a total of 64 interviewees (32 men and 32 women; mean age, 58.6) from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China, and from Phongsaly Province, Laos. To explain the bases for the ethnobotanical uses of fleagrass, we used Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to review the bioactivities of the chemical constituents of 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">buchneroides.</italic>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass cultivation is disappearing in China. However, most Akha people in Xishuangbanna still remember and yearn for its traditional uses, and Akha people in a nearby area (northern Laos) continue to plant and utilize it. We documented ten uses of 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">buchneroides</italic> within five discrete categories
   <italic class="italic">.</italic> The whole plant of fleagrass has a distinct strong aroma, of which Akha villagers are particularly fond. Akha villagers mostly use this aromatic property as a decoration, perfume, and insect repellent. 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">buchneroides</italic> is also used as a condiment and for medicinal and ritual purposes, including its use as a cure for insect bites, headaches, influenza, and diarrhoea, and as a part of pray ritual for a bumper harvest. From our literature review, we identified many major chemical compounds contained in the essential oil of 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">buchneroides</italic>, including thymol, carvacrol, 3-carene, and 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, which have insecticidal or insect-repellent, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties.

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">Fleagrass is an aromatic plant that is widely used by Aka people. Its chemical composition also has a variety of biological activities. With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass utilization in China is disappearing and its cultural importance is reduced. However, its economic and medicinal value is assignable.</p>
