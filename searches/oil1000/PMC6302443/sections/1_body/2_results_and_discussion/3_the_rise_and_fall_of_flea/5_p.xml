<p id="Par34" class="p">No matter how it begins, the current situation of fleagrass is not optimistic. With the continuing population growth and the introduction of cash crops and new policies, swidden agriculture in China is being replaced and is disappearing. Therefore, the resource of fleagrass is in danger of vanishing, particularly in China. Moreover, with improvements in the living standards of the Akha people, modern goods are increasingly replacing traditional materials. Therefore, the importance of fleagrass in Akha villages is declining, and with this decline, the traditional knowledge of fleagrass is becoming lost. Through field surveys, we accessed a total of 45 interviewees from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest China. There are 31 interviewees who have knowledge of a plant called fleagrass (or ‘lao-wo-suo-du’ in the Akha dialect) with morphological features as presented to them during the survey. Most of them have not cultivated fleagrass since 1990, when they began the large-scale planting of rubber. The significance of fleagrass in Akha traditional culture is therefore likely to die with reduced resources. An overwhelming majority of the young generation of Akha claim that they never see this plant and do not know about it. During the survey, we found only three people who continue to use fleagrass today. They save seeds and plant them in small scale, and they use fleagrass mostly in perfumes, to repel insects and alleviate insect bites, while other medical uses have been replaced by modern medicine.</p>
