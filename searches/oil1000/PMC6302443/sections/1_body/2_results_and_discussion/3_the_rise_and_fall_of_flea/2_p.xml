<p id="Par31" class="p">In China, someone said the Akha name of fleagrass ‘Lao-wo-suo-du’ means ‘grass that is from Laos’; ‘Lao wo’ means Laos in Chinese. Two informants reported a legend about the name. A short man brought fleagrass from Laos, and he sent it to the local people, but the local people did not take it because they did not know what it was. Then, the short man spread it everywhere, and there was abundant fleagrass in the field. Thus, they call it ‘Lao-wo-suo-do’. This legend may explain how fleagrass came to China from Laos. However, current wild distribution of fleagrass occurs only in Vietnam. It is still unclear how fleagrass spread from Vietnam.</p>
