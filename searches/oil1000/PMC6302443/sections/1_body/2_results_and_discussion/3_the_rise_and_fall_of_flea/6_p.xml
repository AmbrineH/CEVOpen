<p id="Par35" class="p">Although fleagrass has died down from the daily life of the Akha people in China, they still remember the uses of fleagrass, and they yearn for it. When we showed the plant to the Akha people, they were happy and wanted to replant it. In the process of modernization, they accidentally lost fleagrass.
