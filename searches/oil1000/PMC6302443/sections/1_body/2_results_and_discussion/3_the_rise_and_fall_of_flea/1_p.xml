 <italic class="italic">A. buchneroides</italic> in China, until Shen et al. (1991) found that fleagrass was introduced into swidden cultivating systems by Akha people in the Xishuangbanna area and served as a useful plant a long time ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Because the Akha people do not have tribal scripts, their knowledge of plant uses is passed on verbally, and thus, there is no written record about fleagrass in China in ancient times. When and how the Hani began their domestication of the plant in the area remains uncertain.
