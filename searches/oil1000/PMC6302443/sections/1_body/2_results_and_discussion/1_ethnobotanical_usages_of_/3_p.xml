<p id="Par24" class="p">Akha villagers live in tropical and subtropical rainforests, where many types of insects are both a source of annoyance and can pose a risk to human health. As a preventative measure, in China, the Akha villagers place bundles of fleagrass in their rooms or spread fleagrass on beds to keep fleas or other insects away from human bodies (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). They also plant fleagrass around sheds in fields to repel insects. Fleagrass is also an important medicinal plant that is utilized by Akha people of China. They use fleagrass by making a potion for drinking to gain relief from headaches, influenza, or diarrhoea, which serves as a means of family health care in remote areas. They also crush fresh fleagrass and apply it to the skin to treat insect bites, as the sap aids in relieving itching and swelling. Furthermore, they make an infusion of fleagrass by boiling the grass in water and use this infusion to scrub and clean insect bite wounds. This infusion is also used in treating acne. In addition, they believe that when the body has been washed with this boiled preparation, they will not be bitten by insects.
