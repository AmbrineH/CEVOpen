<p id="Par26" class="p">Akha swidden farmers of China and Laos have similar cultivation experiences. They cultivate fleagrass together with upland rice as an inter-cropping system. Fleagrass seeds are planted simultaneously with dry rice seeds in April (the beginning of the rainy season), although in different holes in the fields. Fleagrass plant growth is slower than that of rice plants, and thus, fleagrass plants are always below a canopy of rice foliage, which inhibits fleagrass growth. Swidden farmers harvest rice from fields in October, at which time the fleagrass is flowering. With the rice harvested, the fleagrass is exposed to considerably more sunlight, and the open field conditions are favourable for pollination. When the fleagrass fruits are sufficiently mature, they are harvested for family use. However, with the continuing disappearance of swidden agriculture in China, there are only a few people who still plant fleagrass. Considering the requirement for shade, fleagrass is now planted together with tea trees. The Akha typically collect dried plants bearing seeds, the bundles of which are hung around their homes. The seeds are separated in the following year and subsequently planted. Generally, each family grows fleagrass annually in a small plot of upland rice.</p>
