<p id="Par42" class="p">Fleagrass is also used as a food condiment by the Akha of northern Laos. In addition to its odour and taste, we believe that this use may be related to the plantâ€™s content of antimicrobial compounds. Temperatures in the regions inhabited by the Akha are generally high, and people like to eat raw materials; thus, there may be plenty of microorganisms in the food. The antibacterial and fungicide activities of fleagrass are helpful in keeping food fresh and safe to consume.</p>
