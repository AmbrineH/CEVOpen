 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>] and Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] have examined the chemical constituents of the essential oil of fleagrass, identifying 26 and 34 chemical compounds, respectively. Most of the chemical constituents identified were common to both studies, and in total, 39 different constituents were recorded. However, the contents of the main compounds showed considerable variation, which could be attributable to differences in the materials examined. Shen et al. (1991) collected mature whole plants and dried plants that are harvested from swidden fields by Akha villagers [
