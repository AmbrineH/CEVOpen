 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, have been proven to have insecticide or insect-repellent activities, by virtue of their odour or contact toxicity. Traditionally, Akha villagers placed bundles of fleagrass in their rooms or caps and utilized the aroma to repel insects. The Akha villagers of Laos hung fleagrass on the wall of granaries and planted it in the field to protect the grains from grain pests which benefits the crop harvest. Therefore, they used fleagrass to pray for a bumper harvest. However, the Akha live in a humid tropical mountainous region where insect bites cannot be completely avoided. Such bites are often accompanied by swelling, itching, and even secondary infection. Like many other traditional plants used to treat itching skin, the mechanism of fleagrass is used to treat insect bites. Nevertheless, the analgesic activity of carvacrol and the anti-inflammatory activity of several chemicals are helpful in relieving pain and preventing infection.
