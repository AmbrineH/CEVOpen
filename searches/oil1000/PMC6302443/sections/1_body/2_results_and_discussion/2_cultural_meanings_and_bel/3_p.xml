<p id="Par29" class="p">Traditionally, the Akha have been a migratory people who practice swidden (slash and burn) agriculture. The mountain crops mainly include upland rice, corn, and cotton. The Akha plant fleagrass together with upland rice as an inter-cropping system. When the rice matures, the Akha harvest it and store the rice in the barn. At the same time, they pick up a bunch of fleagrass that is hanging outside the barn. This is a ritual that is used to pray for stored crops without insects and for the crops of the upcoming year to be bumper harvested without pests and disease.</p>
