<p id="Par28" class="p">Akha young men and women enjoy full social freedom. Each village has a ‘public house’ that is dedicated to providing space for young people to have parties and dates. Unmarried men and women can go to the public house to sing, dance, play, and talk to each other about love. When the young girl or boy comes to date, he or she will wear the fleagrass on his or her head as a sign. The girls put a bunch of fleagrass on the laces of their hats. The boys also wear a bunch of fleagrass on their ears. The scent of fleagrass makes the public house full of pleasant, fragrant tastes and provides a romantic atmosphere. When a young person falls for someone, they will also give ‘fleas grass’ as a gift of love.</p>
