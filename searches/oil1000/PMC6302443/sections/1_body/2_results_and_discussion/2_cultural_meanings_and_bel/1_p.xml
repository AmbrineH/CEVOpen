<p id="Par27" class="p">The Akha people like the scent of fleagrass and often wear fresh or dried branches on their heads as decoration and perfume. Other ethnic groups, including other swidden groups such as the Jino, Yao, Miao, and Lahu, within the same area do not use fleagrass. The Akha people regard it as a tribal symbol, which indicates that they are different from other tribes. Because this kind of grass is only planted and used by the Akha people, when they wear the fleas on the head, they also have a sense of pride and belonging. Akha villagers make use of fleagrass as decorations and perfume in different styles according to age, sexuality, and tribal identity. Elders among the Akha villagers use fleagrass in small bundles to wear in their ear-holes or only in the right ear-hole as a decoration and perfume. Akha women wear a small bundle of fleagrass attached to their colourful womanâ€™s cap. However, Akha men and little boys and little girls do not usually make use of fleagrass as a decoration.</p>
