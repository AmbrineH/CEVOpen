<p id="Par43" class="p">Fleagrass is a versatile aromatic plant that is traditionally planted in swidden fields by the Akha people. With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass in China is disappearing, and its cultural importance has been reduced. However, its economic and medicinal value is assignable. On the basis of an ethnobotanical survey of fleagrass in northern Laos and in China, we documented the Akha villagersâ€™ use of fleagrass as a perfume, insect repellent, condiment, herbal medicine, and ritualistic plant. To the best of our knowledge, we report here for the first time that Akha villagers crush fresh fleagrass and apply it to the skin to treat insect bites, and the Akha in northern Laos eat the fresh leaves of fleagrass as a flavouring. Furthermore, they hang bundles of fleagrass in their granaries as a ritualistic offering in the hope of a bumper harvest. From our literature review, we identified chemical constituents of the essential oil of fleagrass that have good bioactivities related to antimicrobial, sterilization, insecticidal, insect repellent, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral properties. Overall, we consider that fleagrass is a multi-functional plant with tribal characteristics, particularly with respect to its use as an insect repellent and in the treatment of insect bites.</p>
