<p id="Par44" class="p">Although some of the aforementioned folk uses can be assigned tentatively to the bioactivities of certain chemical constituents that are found in fleagrass, further targeted research is warranted in this respect. As a traditional insect repellent, further in-depth research on fleagrass may help us to develop new, effective plant-based repellents. In addition, with continuing economic development and environmental changes, the resources and traditional knowledge of fleagrass are in danger of vanishing. As an important plant resource, we should focus on the protection and exploitation of fleagrass. We therefore highlight the need for further research that focuses particularly on the cultivation of fleagrass, the biological activities of its essential oil or extracts, the mechanisms underlying its various activities, and product development.</p>
