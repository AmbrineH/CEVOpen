<p id="Par9" class="p">Peasants of all regions knew well how to use specific local plants to protect themselves against insects. They named some of them according to the insect for which they were used to repel. For instance, almost all species in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Polygonum</italic> have the same local name, kirburohi, or ‘flea herb’ in Estonian scientific nomenclature, which is because these species are used exclusively against human fleas. The whole plant was cut, dried, and then placed on the floor or in the bed to kill fleas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. In addition, some special plants are endowed with special cultural meanings. A typical example is 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia vulgaris</italic>, which is hung on the door as part of a ceremony to drive away pests and diseases for the Dragon Boat Festival. In rural China, the burning of bundles of dried 
 <italic class="italic">A. vulgaris</italic> to produce smoke had been used to repel insects for centuries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. After the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather starts to heat up, and the snake worms and ants began to move. Therefore, people usually put a branch of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vulgaris</italic> at their doorsteps to ward off diseases, prevent mosquitoes, and ward off evil spirits. Although modern products have replaced traditional protection, this ritual continues today.
