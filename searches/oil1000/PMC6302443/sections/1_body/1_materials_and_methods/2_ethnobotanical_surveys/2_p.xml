<p id="Par18" class="p">With the ongoing disappearance of swidden agriculture, the resource of fleagrass in China is decreasing, and knowledge about fleagrass is currently restricted to only few people. Among these, the majority are traditional healers and herbalists, and therefore, for our survey work, we selected eight villages that are inhabited by traditional healers and herbalists. In each village, we held the first meeting with the village chief and his advisors to inform them of the purpose of our work. The village head would consent to the research and recommend traditional healers or herbalists to be interviewed for the study. Furthermore, we also interviewed some other informants who were elderly villagers or had a sound knowledge of fleagrass. With the assistance of a guide who can speak Lao, Akha, and Chinese, we also selected three Akha villages in Phongsaly Province, Laos, where they still cultivate fleagrass. In the villages of Laos, we selected informants randomly. A voucher specimen (KUN: 1341141), which was deposited in the herbarium of the Kunming Institute of Botany, China (KUN), was used as a representative sample of the plant for identification by respondents. Informants were asked whether they were able to identify the fresh plant. If they recognized the fleagrass, they were asked to provide information about their knowledge of the plant, the local name, medicinal use, place and mode of collection, preservation, plant preparation, and administration.</p>
