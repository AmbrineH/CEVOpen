<p id="Par21" class="p">To explain the ethnobotanical knowledge of fleagrass, we surveyed the literature relating to fleagrass chemical composition and selected the constituents that are related to the uses of fleagrass. For this purpose, literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). We wanted to identify scientific publications and patents describing in vitro or in vivo studies of fleagrass and the bioactive components relevant to its uses and applications. The search for biological activity was conducted individually for the species and each chemical constituent. We combined the following keywords using the Boolean operators ‘AND’ and ‘OR’: ‘
 <italic class="italic">Adenosma buchneroides</italic>’; ‘chemical compound’ (e.g. thymol); ‘biological’; ‘pharmacological’; ‘activity’; ‘bioactivity’.
