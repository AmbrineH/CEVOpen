<p class="p">The hydrogen atoms or electrons donation ability of the corresponding oils and some pure compounds were measured from the bleaching of purple coloured methanol solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). This spectrophotometric assay uses stable radical DPPH as a reagent (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Various concentrations (50 ÂµL) of the essential oil in methanol were added to 5 mL of a 0.004% (w/v) methanol solution of DPPH. After a 30 min incubation period at room temperature the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm. Inhibition free radical DPPH in percent (I%) was calculated in following way:
