<p class="p">The cells were seeded into 96-well microplates (1×10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells well
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of the essential oil and linalool (5-500 μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cytotoxicity of the essential oil and linalool was assayed by CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay. The assay is based on the ability of living cells to convert a redox dye (resazurin) into a fluorescent end product (resofurin). Nonviable cells rapidly lose metabolic capacity and thus do not generate a fluorescent signal (
