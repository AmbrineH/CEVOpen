<p id="Par6" class="p">In order to broaden the studies of sterol function in bacteria, we experimentally investigated the contribution of sterol synthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">Gemmata obscuriglobus</italic>, a member of the phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomycetes</italic>, unrelated to 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic>. Further reasons to select 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> include that it possesses the most minimal sterol synthesis pathway yet reported, producing only lanosterol and its isomer parkeol

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> is the only planctomycete reported to produce sterols while all its relatives are potentially hopanoid producers. Also, the majority of planctomycetes have a complex endomembrane system, although it is arguably most developed in this species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. In eukaryotes, the membrane composition of sterols contributes to the function and organization of the cell’s endomembrane system

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> is ideally suited to study the functional differences between hopanoids and sterols. Here, we address these fundamental questions through a combination of genetic, chemical, and microscopy approaches.
