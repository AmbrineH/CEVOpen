<p id="Par8" class="p">We next applied a chemical approach that, in contrast to the genetic strategy, allowed partial inhibition of sterol synthesis, to permit further characterization of sterol depletion phenotypes. Terbinafine hydrochloride is an allylamine anti-fungal compound
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> that specifically inhibits squalene epoxidase in fungi

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. Based on sequence homology between 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> and eukaryotic Sqmo proteins
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, we predicted that terbinafine hydrochloride could specifically inhibit the 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> Sqmo enzyme. Terbinafine treatment indeed reduced 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), and a reduction in total sterol levels was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), suggesting that the growth defect was specifically due to sterol biosynthesis inhibition. Supplementation of terbinafine-treated cultures with exogenous lanosterol substantially improved growth at all terbinafine doses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>), supporting our conclusions. Further evidence of sterol essentiality was provided by an experiment in which growth was completely suppressed by treatment with zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of squalene synthase
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, but again rescued with the provision of exogenous lanosterol (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This growth rescue is consistent with that observed in the terbinafine experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Lipotoxicity of accumulated squalene has been reported in yeast deficient in lipid storage organelles
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>, and a similar effect cannot be completely excluded for 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> at this time. However, the results of this experiment suggest that it is primarily sterol essentiality rather than squalene lipotoxicity that is responsible for the phenotypes observed in terbinafine-treated cultures and the interruption mutants.
