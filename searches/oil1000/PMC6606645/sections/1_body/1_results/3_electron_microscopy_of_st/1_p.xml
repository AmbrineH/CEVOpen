<p id="Par9" class="p">As sterols have never been reported as essential for bacterial growth, we attempted to identify phenotypic defects associated with their inhibition in 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic>. Because of the lack of growth of the mutants, we investigated these defects by electron microscopy. In the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> mutant, we observed diverse striking phenotypes that have never been described in wild-type cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). A series of abnormal membrane conformations were observed, including nested vesicles, stacks of membrane layers inside the cytoplasm, multiple elongated sausage-like structures, cellular space crowded with small vesicles, or a mixture of these features (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We also observed numerous extracellular membranous structures, presumably cellular debris (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Similar but milder phenotypes were also observed in terbinafine-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). This supports the conclusion that the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> mutant phenotypes are indeed due to sterol depletion and not to the use of aged cellular material, necessitated by the slower growth of mutants. We also observed mutant cells that appear to be undergoing aberrant cell division, including cells with multiple buds and closed neck between cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g, h</xref>). In contrast to wild-type dividing cells, the membranes at the bud of the necks in mutant cells seem to be occluding the length of the neck (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, g, h</xref>).
