<p id="Par10" class="p">In order to observe these cellular defects in real-time, we returned to the chemical inhibition approach, monitoring terbinafine-treated cultures through time-lapse microscopy assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; Supplementary Movies 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Terbinafine addition resulted in the development of phase-bright inclusions in approximately one-third of the cells within 4–5 h after the start of the time-lapse experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b–d</xref>), which roughly correspond to half a cell cycle in

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. The cells containing inclusions appeared to be undergoing failed budding attempts, although we cannot exclude the possibility of dynamic membrane processes other than budding. Nevertheless, normal division was not observed in any cell containing an inclusion, and some of these cells appeared to prematurely release a phase-bright bud. The presence of inclusions was also associated with external cell debris, most likely related to that observed in the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> mutant (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Addition of exogenous lanosterol led to the disappearance of these structures and to the rescue of budding replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref> and Supplementary Movies 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). This rescue effect strongly suggests that sterols are required for 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> cell division, the first reported evidence for an essential role of sterols in cell division outside of the domain Eukarya. To the best of our knowledge, hopanoids have never been reported to be essential for lab growth conditions nor have they been involved in cell division in bacteria, with one possible exception
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. Because 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> is the only planctomycete reported to produce sterols, while all its relatives are hopanoid producers, the sterol essentiality reported here opens interesting avenues to study the functional differences between these molecules.
