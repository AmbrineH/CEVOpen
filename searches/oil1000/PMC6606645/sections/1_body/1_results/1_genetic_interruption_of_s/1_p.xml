<p id="Par7" class="p">In order to determine the phenotypic effects of sterol synthesis inhibition in 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic>, we first applied a genetic approach. Sterols are synthesized from squalene by the enzymes squalene monooxygenase (Sqmo) and oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc). We independently interrupted the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">osc</italic> genes, which are co-located in the 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> genome

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Wild-type and mutant cells interrupted in non-essential genes form colonies on solid media after approximately 10 days of growth. Colonies were observed for the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">osc</italic> mutants only after nearly a month. These colonies were of a more intense red color than the wild-type ones (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Transconjugants were unable to grow when they were transferred to fresh solid medium or liquid broth, even in the presence of exogenous lanosterol. Thus, the mutant cells are unable to sustain normal unlimited growth. We speculate that the sterol-depleted colonies were able to undergo a few cycles of division, although inefficiently, by dilution of residual sterols present in their membranes. In order to demonstrate that the observed phenotype was due to the lack of sterols and not to plasmid integration, a similar plasmid containing a fragment of the 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> gene under its own promoter was transferred into the wild-type strain. This chromosomal integration resulted in reconstruction of the wild-type operon, alongside the disrupted version, and produced cells resembling wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Colonies appeared following 10 days of incubation, and in contrast to the interrupted mutants, these transconjugants could be regrown in liquid and solid medium, demonstrating that the 
 <italic class="italic">osc</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">sqmo</italic> gene interruption was responsible for the originally observed no-growth phenotype.
