 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> that chemical inhibition of the downstream sterol synthesis enzyme, oxidosqualene cyclase, resulted in cell death. Although depletion of sterol levels was not directly detected, the authors achieved rescue of the growth defect with exogenous lanosterol supplementation, supporting the sterol inhibition as causative of cell death. Our study however provides the first evidence for an association between sterol synthesis, intracellular membrane morphology, and cell division, which is also novel for bacterial species. It appears likely that future studies of 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic>, and perhaps other sterol-synthesizing bacteria, will identify novel functions of sterols in the context of bacterial cell biology. This will contribute to an improved understanding of fundamental similarities and differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
