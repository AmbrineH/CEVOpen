<p id="Par20" class="p">Derivatization of the dried extracts was performed by adding 40 μL of MSTFA (N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide; Sigma Aldrich) to the GC AS vial inserts, capping the vials, and heating at 40 °C for 30 min in an oven. The resulting solutions were directly analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A series of lanosterol standard solutions ranging from 50 to 450 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were prepared, each with 120 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> D6-lanosterol internal standard and derivatized with MSTFA as described above.
