<p id="Par19" class="p">Dried pellets were weighed into 10 mL glass vessels (CEM Corp.) to obtain the dry weight of cell material. A 2 mL aliquot of 18-megaohm deionized water was added to each vessel. Samples were spiked with 40 μL of 120 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> D6-lanosterol internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids) in dichloromethane (DCM, Fisher Chemical). The solutions were sonicated by three 15-s, 6 W root mean squared (RMS) pulses while chilled on ice for cell lysis (Fisher Scientific 60 Sonic Dismembrator). The pH of each vessel was adjusted by the addition of 2 mL of 6% (w/w) potassium hydroxide in methanol. Vessels were sealed with crimp top caps (CEM Corp.), saponified at 90 °C for 1 h in an oven, and then cooled to room temperature (RT). A 2 mL aliquot of DCM was added through the septa, vessels were vortexed for 5 min and then centrifuged for 3 min to separate the aqueous and organic layers. Sterols were extracted with DCM two times by suction of the organic layer with a glass pipette and extracts were combined in a new sample vial (Supelco 27149). The DCM solvent was evaporated in vacuum at RT. Extracts were resuspended in 100 μL DCM and transferred to gas chromatography (GC) autosampler (AS) vials with 250 μL inserts (Restek). A second 100 μL DCM wash was used to rinse the sample vial and added to the GC AS vial for a more complete transfer. The DCM solvent was evaporated in vacuum at RT.
