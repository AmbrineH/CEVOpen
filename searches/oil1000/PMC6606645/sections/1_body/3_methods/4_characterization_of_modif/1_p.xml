<p id="Par17" class="p">Strains harboring the mutations was verified by fluorescence microscopy. Southern blotting analysis with 2 μg of genomic DNA was also performed for the complemented strain (DV026). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). The digested DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR amplicon used as probe was synthetized with the primers GFP pDV020 fwd and GFP pDV020 rv (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Probes were labeled according to the manufacturer’s instructions (DIG DNA Labeling Kit, Roche). DIG-labeled probes were detected with anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments and CSPD (Roche). Visualizations were performed using Chemidoc XRS, and images were analyzed with the ImageLab 5.0 software.
