 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> mutant cells were scraped from the agar plates. The cells were frozen in an HPM010 (Abra Fluid, Switzerland) high-pressure freezing machine and freeze substituted with either 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1% uranyl acetate, and 5% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and embedded in Epon or with 0.5% uranyl acetate and embedded in Lowicryl HM20. Thin sections were placed on formvar-coated grids and post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Thin sections were imaged on a CM120 Phillips electron microscope

 </sup> For terbinafine inhibition assays, 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> cultures were grown with or without terbinafine at 10, 20, or 50 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 4 days as described above. Cryofixation and freeze substitution were realized similarly and performed at the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Electron Microscopy Facility, University of Colorado-Boulder. Ultrastructure images were acquired with use of a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7000) at 75 kV, Gatan digital camera and Gatan software.
