<p id="Par16" class="p">Genetic transformation of 
 <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> was performed by triparental mating using 200 μL of an exponentially growing culture (OD600 ~0.4) of the donor (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) and helper (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> DH5α pRK2013) strains in LB, with a cell pellet from 15 mL of the receptor strain culture (OD600 ~0.4). Each culture was previously individually washed in phosphate buffer and resuspended in a total volume of 100 μL of phosphate buffer that was spotted onto the corresponding agar plates containing Cyclo. The conjugation patches were incubated for 24 h at 28 °C, and resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate buffer. Transconjugants were plated on Ap 100 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and Km 30 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with or without lanosterol dissolved in chloroform (20 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> from a 1000× stock). Viable cells were plated on Ap 100 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Colonies appeared after 10–30 days of incubation, depending on the plasmid integrated.
