<p id="Par22" class="p">Lanosterol and parkeol quantification was performed with an internal standard (ISTD) multipoint calibration curve of lanosterol and D6-lanosterol as the ISTD. Peak area ratios of sterol (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 393) to ISTD (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 399) were measured in all samples and sterol content was computed from the calibration curve. Sterol content was then normalized to dry cell mass. For calculation of total sterol content, measurements for both sterols were summed. After testing for variance equivalency (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-test), the two-tailed Studentâ€™s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test at the 95% confidence interval was used to determine statistical support for differences in sterol content between different samples.
