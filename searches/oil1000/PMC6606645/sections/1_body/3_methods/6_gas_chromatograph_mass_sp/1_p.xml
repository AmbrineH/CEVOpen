<p id="Par21" class="p">Sterol quantification was performed using a gas chromatograph (Trace GC Ultra) equipped with an autosampler (Triplus AutoSampler, liquid injection) and interfaced with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (DSQ II; all from Thermo Scientific). GC instrument settings were: splitless injection, 1 μL liquid injection volume, 220 °C injector temperature. The oven program was: 150 °C for 2 min, 20 °C min

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The column used was a (5% phenyl)-95% dimethylsiloxane (Phenomonex ZB-5 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). MS settings were: positive ion mode with electron ionization, 70 eV electron energy, 200 μA filament emission current, 130 V lens, 250 °C source temperature, the quadrupole scanned
