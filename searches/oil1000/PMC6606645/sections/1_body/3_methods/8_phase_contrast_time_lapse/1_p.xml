The pad was covered with a glass coverslip and sealed with a mixture of equal amount of petroleum jelly, lanolin, and paraffin wax (VALAP), leaving enough empty space around the agarose pad to provide the cells with sufficient oxygen. A single field of cells was imaged every 30 min during 14 h on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca-Flash4.0 sCMOS camera and a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.46 Oil Ph3 objective. The images were collected in the Zen Blue software and processed using ImageJ and the EBImage package in Program R
