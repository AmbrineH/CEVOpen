 <p> Terbinafine treatment inhibits normal budding replication in Gemmata obscuriglobus. Selected frames of phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy of 4-day G. obscuriglobus cultures. a Control culture. b Culture treated with 100 μg mL −1 terbinafine. c Culture treated with 100 μg mL −1 terbinafine and 1 μg mL −1 lanosterol. a– c Scale bar represents 1 μm. d Incidence of phase-bright inclusions in TB-treated culture with or without lanosterol supplementation. Phase-bright inclusions were never observed in untreated cultures. Means and standard deviations are shown for three biological replicates. Source data are provided as a Source Data file </p>
