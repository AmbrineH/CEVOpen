 <p> Transmission electron microscopy of G. obscuriglobus cells deficient in sterol synthesis. Representative membrane phenotypes observed in the G. obscuriglobus mutant interrupted in the sqmo gene. Wild-type cell ( a). Various membrane organizations are shown, including b cellular space crowded with small vesicles, c stacks of membrane layers inside the cytoplasm, d multiple elongated sausage-like structures, e, f or a mixture of these and undefined features, g multiple budding. g, h Arrows indicate necks between dividing cells. Black dots correspond to localization of the GFP used to interrupt the sqmo gene. Scale bar represents 0.5 μm </p>
