   <italic class="italic">G. obscuriglobus</italic> growth relative to untreated cultures, measured spectrophotometrically over a 6-day time-course. Means and standard deviations are shown for three biological replicates. The points are represented by circles, upside-down triangles, triangles, and diamonds for increasing terbinafine concentrations, respectively. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Total cellular sterols, measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at 3-day and 6-day culture growth time points. Data is presented in boxplot of four biological replicates, each analyzed in triplicate. The center line represents the median, the box represents the upper and lower quartiles, and the lines represent the minimum and maximum observations. Any points outside the lines are considered outliers. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Lanosterol supplementation of TB-treated cultures partially or completely restores growth to the level of untreated cultures, measured spectrophotometrically at 3-day and 6-day culture growth time points. Means and standard deviations are shown for three biological replicates. Source data are provided as a
