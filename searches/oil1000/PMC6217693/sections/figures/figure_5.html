 <p> (a) Survival curve of S. littoralis third-instar larvae after spray application of dH 2O, 0.01% Triton X-100 with conidia, silica-NH 2 Pickering emulsion with and without M. brunneum formulation. Larvae were incubated for seven days at 25 Â°C, 85% RH. (b) Corrected mortality % of S. littoralis larvae seven days postinoculation with M. brunneum conidia in a water based formulation (Triton X-100) and silica-NH 2 Pickering emulsion. Mortality correction was calculated for each system with the respective blank. Data are the average of three independent experiments. S. littoralis third instar larva assay. (c) Larva treated with M. brunneum Pickering emulsion formulation 10 days postinoculation. (d) Nontreated larva. </p>
