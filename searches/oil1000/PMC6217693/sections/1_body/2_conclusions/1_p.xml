<p class="p">In summary, we presented a new approach for single cell encapsulation by eco-friendly o/w Pickering emulsions stabilized by amine-functionalized silica NPs. The emulsions were stable for months.

The studied formulation resulted in a higher cell distribution on the leaves, leading to a high mortality rate of

The formulation exhibited significantly higher pest control activity in comparison to the controls. This successful single cell encapsulation along with its high biopesticide activity is thus a promising, cost-effective, innovative approach for tackling the pest control challenge.
