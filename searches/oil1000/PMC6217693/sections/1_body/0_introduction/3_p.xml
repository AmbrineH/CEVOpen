<p class="p">In recent years, in response to growing public demands, health concerns, and new regulations, in addition to the need for increased food production, synthetic pesticides have been removed from the market. Biopesticides are low risk, environmental friendly pesticides based on living microbes. Their active compounds are designed to be a natural and environmentally safe alternative to the synthetic pesticides used in crop protection. However, the difficulties in running efficient field trials and the high cost of biopesticides have prevented them from making a significant global dent.

 </sup> The development of new advanced formulation systems for biopesticides could thus lead to more efficient pest control, increased shelf life, and greater persistence in the field.
