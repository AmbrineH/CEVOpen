<p class="p">Single microencapsulation of cells by Pickering emulsion presents a significant potential for the development of new biopesticide formulations. The most commonly used myco-biopesticides are conidia. These microorganisms must remain nongerminated before application in the field; that is, unexposed to water. This means that conidia must be encapsulated in the oil phase of the emulsion, which makes encapsulation in the w/o system impractical. Furthermore, the chemical nature of the outer surface of most conidia is hydrophobic, resulting in their arrangement in the oil phase. Hence, developing advanced o/w Pickering emulsions that can encapsulate conidia in the oil phase is a top priority.</p>
