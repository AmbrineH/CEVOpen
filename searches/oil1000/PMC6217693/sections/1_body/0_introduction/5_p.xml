<p class="p">The development of advanced formulations for biopesticides that can meet the demands for high pest control efficiency is of paramount importance. These formulations must achieve high functionality under a range of environmental conditions. This can be done by (1) maximizing their distribution on the plant canopy, (2) protection against UV, (3) maintaining microenvironmental humidity control, and (4) increasing their shelf life.

 </sup> The microencapsulation of biopesticides using Pickering emulsions and colloidosomes constitutes an excellent candidate for tailoring new advanced formulations with high protection performance. Pickering emulsions make it possible to tune the emulsion properties in terms of droplet diameter and proper surface functionalization of the NPs to achieve high activity and a prolonged shelf life of the incorporated microorganisms. Silica NPs is an eco-friendly
