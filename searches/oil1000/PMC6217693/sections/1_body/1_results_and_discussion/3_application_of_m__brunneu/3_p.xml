<p class="p">In order to quantify the number of conidia cells on the leaves, a Z series was taken and a Z projection was performed. The results of the Z projection showed a higher count of conidia on the studied system than the controls (

The single cell encapsulation in the Pickering emulsions maintains the dispersibility of the cells during the spray assay resulting in a higher number of conidia cells on leaves. On the contrary, the lower amount of conidia cells in the control samples resulted from cell agglomeration during the spraying process because of poor dispersibility of the cells in the aqueous medium. Triton X-100-based suspension was used as a standard in the screening of entomopathogenic fungi in many studies.
