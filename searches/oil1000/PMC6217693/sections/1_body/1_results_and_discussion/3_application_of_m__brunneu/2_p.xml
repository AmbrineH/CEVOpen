 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>
 </xref>a,d) exhibited a significantly higher distribution of conidia cells on the leaves compared to the controls (0.01% Triton X-100, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>
 </xref>b,e; and water, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>
 </xref>c,f). The higher cell distribution of the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsion is thus derived from the single cell encapsulation in the emulsions. These findings were supported by SEM analysis showing individual encapsulation of the conidia in the compartments of the silica/paraffin honeycomb structure (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>
 </xref>e). Single cell encapsulation is required for efficient distribution of conidia cells on the leaf surface. The conidia cells, which are hydrophobic, will localize in the oil phase. Obtaining the suitable droplet size and composition has led to single cell encapsulation. After the spray assay on the leaves with the Pickering emulsion formulation, higher cell distribution was observed on the leaf surface compared to water and Triton X-100 samples.
