<p class="p">These results confirm the successful bioassay of encapsulated 
 <italic class="italic">M. brunneum</italic> conidia on 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> third instar larvae after spray application. The results also demonstrate the low toxicity of the Pickering emulsions (without conidia) against the larvae and leaves. The activity of the conidia was enhanced by their incorporation in the o/w silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsions. The increased efficiency of the Pickering emulsion-based formulation can thus be attributed to the successful single encapsulation of the conidia cells, which resulted in a significantly higher cell distribution on the leaves.
