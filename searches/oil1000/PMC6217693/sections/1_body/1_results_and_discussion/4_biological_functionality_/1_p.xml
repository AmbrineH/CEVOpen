 </xref>a). Larvae treated with conidia incorporated in the Pickering emulsion showed 75% mortality, whereas the formulation alone resulted in a mortality of only 25%. Treatment with conidia in 0.01% Triton X-100 led to 40% mortality. Corrected mortality and probability tests were performed on the data. The analysis of corrected mortality is based on Abbottâ€™s formula

 </xref> clearly shows the higher pesticidal activity of conidia incorporated in the Pickering emulsions compared to the controls. The sporulation processes started seven days postinoculation. The dead larvae were kept separately under moist conditions to promote sporulation and confirm mycosis. Cadavers were monitored daily for sporulation. Of the 14 dead larvae, 13 were mycosed. An example of a sporulated larva cadaver is presented in
