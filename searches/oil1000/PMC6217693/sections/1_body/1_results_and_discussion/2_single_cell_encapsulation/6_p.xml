<p class="p">The obtained fluorescent signal of the GFP conidia is a clear indication of the viability of the cells when encapsulated in the oil phase of the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsions. The conidia in the emulsions remained viable for three weeks. The viability of the 
 <italic class="italic">Metarhizium</italic> conidia cells while encapsulated in the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsions was further characterized by culturing the conidia on a Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) growth medium (see 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other" class="xref">Materials and Methods</xref>). The germination percentages of the encapsulated conidia were 85 ± 8.3%, demonstrating their viability and their ability to germinate. The control system (without emulsion) had germination percentages of 95 ± 5%.
