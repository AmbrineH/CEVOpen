<p class="p">The conidia cells assemble at the oil phase in the water/paraffin biphasic system because of their hydrophobic surface.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the conidia cells have to overcome the barrier made by the NPs that are located at the interface. The preparation of the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsions is performed by an ultrasonic probe. The exposure of a liquid sample to ultrasonic waves results in vigorous agitation characterized with high shear forces that are responsible for emulsification. However, ultrasonication cannot take place in the presence of the conidia cells because it will lead to cell lysis. Therefore, the conidia cells were incorporated only after the emulsion formation, through gentle agitation by vortex, which enables the penetration of the conidia cells into the paraffin droplets.
