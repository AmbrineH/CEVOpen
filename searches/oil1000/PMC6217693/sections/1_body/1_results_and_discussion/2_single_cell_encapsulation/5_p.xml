 </sup> They have shown that the particles in the o/w interface undergo transformations between the droplets upon introducing shear forces, leaving temporary voids at the interface. This phenomenon explains the successful encapsulation of the conidia cells in the paraffin droplets through gentle agitation that is apparently generating proper shear forces. Furthermore, the implementation of NPs with a relatively low diameter (∼40 nm) for the preparation of the Pickering emulsions might also decrease their ability to form a barrier (at the interface) against the penetration of the conidia cells that are 2 orders of magnitude larger (∼4 μm in length) than the NPs.
