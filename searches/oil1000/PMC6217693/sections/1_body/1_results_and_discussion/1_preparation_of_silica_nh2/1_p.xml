 </sup> Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions based on amine-functionalized silica NPs were prepared. Different contents of amine-functionalized silica (wt %) and oil/water (vol %) ratios were implemented to determine the proper conditions for a stable Pickering emulsion system that would meet the demands of single cell encapsulation. The silica contents were varied (0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt %) at oil/water ratios of 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, and 30:70, respectively. A major objective of the current study is to develop an efficient formulation for biopesticides that will maintain the conidia nongerminated. Therefore, the encapsulation of the conidia cells in the oil phase is mandatory.
