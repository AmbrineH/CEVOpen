<p class="p">The stability of the Pickering emulsions was characterized by visual observation over time. Most of the prepared emulsions were stable for 6â€“7 months (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other" class="xref">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other" class="xref">1</xref>
 </xref>). The highest stability was observed at a silica content of 5 wt % at oil/water ratios of 20:80 and 30:70, which were stable for more than a year. However, no emulsification was obtained at a silica content of 0.1 wt %. For highly stable systems, we used confocal microscopy to observe changes in the droplet diameter as a result of droplet coalescence and creaming (data not shown).
