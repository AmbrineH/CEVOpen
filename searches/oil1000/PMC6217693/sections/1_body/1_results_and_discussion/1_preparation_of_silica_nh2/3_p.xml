 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs at four different paraffin/water ratios. It is observed that the higher the silica content, the smaller is the droplet diameter at any studied volume fractions of paraffin oil. This phenomenon is explained by the increase of the total surface area of the o/w interface.

 </sup> The tuning of the emulsion composition enabled us to fine-tune the resulting droplet size, which is essential for single cell encapsulation. The relatively high stability of the Pickering emulsion is derived from the low coalescence rate of the droplets due to the presence of the NPs at the interface.
