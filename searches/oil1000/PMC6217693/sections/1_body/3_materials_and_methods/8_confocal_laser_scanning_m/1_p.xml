<p class="p">The samples were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus, FluoView 500) using argon laser 488 nm excitation. Fluorescence emission of GFP was recorded at 500–520 nm. For 3D images, acquisition used a Leica SP8 laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a solid state laser with 488 nm light, HC PL APO CS 20×/0.75 objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and Leica Application Suite X software (LAS X, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Imaging of the GFP signal was done using the argon laser, and the emission was detected in a range of 500–525 nm. Autofluorescence of the chloroplasts was detected in a range of 650–700 nm. For 
 <italic class="italic">Metarhizium</italic> conidia counting, image stacks were first projected using a Z projection (as maximum intensity) to find all the fluorescent conidia, then counted by a cell counter using Fiji software.

 </sup> The droplet average diameter was measured for every sample by the particles analysis tool of Fiji software based on confocal microscopy images. 12 droplets were sampled from each image and plotted as a 3D graph with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).
