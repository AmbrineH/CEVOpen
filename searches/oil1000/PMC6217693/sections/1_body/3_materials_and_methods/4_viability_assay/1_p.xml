<p class="p">Conidia viability in different suspensions was determined by germination assay. Aliquots of conidial suspension were applied over SDA plates and incubated for 18 h at 28 Â°C. Conidia viability in the emulsion was measured at different time points using confocal microscopy. Conidial fluorescence was the indication for viability as described previously.

 </sup> Viability was satisfactory if rates were above 95% for germination and fluorescent conidia.
