<p class="p">For the leaf spray assays, three conidia samples of 
 <italic class="italic">M. brunneum</italic>
 <italic class="italic">Ma7</italic>-GFP were prepared: silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsion, 0.01% Triton X-100, and distilled water. Conidia (10 mg) were added to 10 mL of each sample, mixed well, and then sprayed on 
 <italic class="italic">R. communis</italic> leaves using a 50 mL hand sprayer (∼100 μL liquid per spray) for full coverage. The plant tissues were left to dry at room temperature. To characterize the distribution of conidia on plant tissues, leaf discs from each treatment were analyzed by confocal microscopy.
