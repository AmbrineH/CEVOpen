<p class="p">SEM measurements were performed using a MIRA3 field-emission SEM microscope (TESCAN, Brno/Czech Republic) with an acceleration voltage of 1.0 kV and a secondary electron detector. Pickering emulsion samples were drop-cast on a conductive double stick carbon tape and dried under ambient conditions. Prior to imaging, a thin layer of carbon was evaporated onto them to render them electrically conductive and to avoid surface charging by the electron beam.</p>
