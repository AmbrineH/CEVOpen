<p class="p">Pickering emulsions were prepared from amine-functionalized silica in water and paraffin oil (Sigma-Aldrich, analytical grade). First, silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs were dispersed in distilled water by sonication for 5 min (Sonics Vibra-Cell 750 W, 25% amplitude) with increasing silica content: 0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt %. Then, paraffin oil was added at the o/w ratios of 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, and 30:70 vol %,respectively. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min for emulsification.
