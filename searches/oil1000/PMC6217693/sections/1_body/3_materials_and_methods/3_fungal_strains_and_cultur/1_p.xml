 </sup> were cultured on SDA (Difco, Becton–Dickinson, MD) for 2 weeks at 28 °C until sporulation. Conidial suspensions were prepared by harvesting conidia by scraping the fungal colony, suspending the collected material in sterile distilled water containing 0.01% Triton X-100, followed by vortexing. The suspension was filtered through three layers of gauze, and conidial concentrations were determined using a hemocytometer.
