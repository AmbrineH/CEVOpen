<p class="p">To test the functionality of the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Pickering emulsion as a biopesticide formulation, a bioassay was conducted to assess the LT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the different samples. 
 <italic class="italic">R. communis</italic> leaves were sprayed with Pickering emulsions and controls with and without conidia (see 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other" class="xref">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other" class="xref">2</xref>
 </xref>). Both sides of the 
 <italic class="italic">R. communis</italic> leaves were treated using a 50 mL hand sprayer (∼100 μL liquid per spray). The suspension contained 10 mL of 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> conidia/mL. After spraying, the leaves were dried for 30 min in the hood. The dried treated leaves were hand cut and inserted into a 55 mm Petri dish lined with filter paper impregnated with 500 μL distilled water to maintain high humidity and a single 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> third-instar larva. For each sample, 20 larvae were used. The plates were sealed and incubated at 25 °C under a 12:12 L/D photoperiod. The larvae were examined at days 3, 4, and 7 for mortality. Food was supplied during examination. Dead larvae were removed from the Petri dishes and incubated in a moist chamber until sporulation occurred. The experiment was repeated three times.
