<p class="p">Silica (1 g) (AEROSIL OX 50, with an estimated primary particle size of 40 nm, obtained from Evonik, Germany) was added to 40 mL of methanol and stirred for complete dispersion. Then, APTES (99% Sigma-Aldrich) was added slowly to the solution for a final concentration of 0.5 M. The reaction was carried out at ambient temperature for 45 min. After silanization, the particles were collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 10 min) and rinsed four times with methanol. Afterward, the silica-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs were dried at 35 Â°C under vacuum for ca. 3 h.
