<p class="p">AChE activity was measured using a 96-well microplate reader based on Ellman et al. [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In the 96-well plates, 25 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of tissue homogenate, followed by 125 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of 3 mM DTNB and 25 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of buffer, was added. The resultant mixture was incubated at 30°C for 15 min. Finally, 25 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of 15 mM substrate solution was added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for 2 mins using a Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Absorbance was plotted against time and the enzyme activity was calculated.
