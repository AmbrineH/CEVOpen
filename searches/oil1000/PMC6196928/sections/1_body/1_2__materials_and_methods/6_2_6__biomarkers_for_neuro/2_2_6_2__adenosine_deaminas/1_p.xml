 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of tissue homogenate, followed by 50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of 21 mM of adenosine, pH 6.5, was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Absorbance was measured at 630 nm using a Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Enzyme activity was calculated in units per liter (U/L).
