<p class="p">The samples were analyzed for volatile compounds using 7820A gas chromatograph coupled to 5975C inert mass spectrometer (with triple axis detector) with electron-impact source (Agilent Technologies). The stationary phase of separation of the compounds was HP-5 capillary column coated with 5% Phenyl Methyl Siloxane (30 m length x 0.32 mm diameter x 0.25

 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>L of the samples was injected in split less mode at an injection temperature of 260°C. Purge flow was 21.5 mL/min at 0.50 min with a total flow of 25.8 mL/min; gas saver mode was switched on. Oven was initially programmed at 60°C (1 min) and then ramped at 4°C/min to 110°C (3 min), then 8°C/min to 260°C (5 min), and 10°C/min to 300°C (12 min). Run time was 56.25 min with a 3 min solvent delay. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron-impact ionization mode at 70 eV with ion source temperature of 230°C, quadrupole temperature of 150°C, and transfer line temperature of 280°C.
