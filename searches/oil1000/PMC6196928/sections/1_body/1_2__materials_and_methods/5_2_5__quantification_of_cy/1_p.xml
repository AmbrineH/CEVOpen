 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-10) levels were determined by ELISA using Quantikine Immunoassay kits (R&amp;D systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 96-well microplates were sensitized with primary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the tissue sample was added and incubated for another 30 min and wash. After washing, secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase was added and incubated. Thereafter, the cytokine concentration was measured using an ELISA plate reader.
