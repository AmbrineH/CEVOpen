<p class="p">It is interesting to note that both acetylcholine (ACh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are co-released from the same motor nerve endings in the CNS and have been recognised as an important neurotransmitters involved in the process of neuroimmunomodulation [

In the present study, adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity (an important enzyme involves in the regulation of adenosine level) was increased in hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex of Cd-treated rats when compared to control. However, treatment with essential oil from ginger and turmeric rhizome respectively prevents an increase in ADA activity when compared with Cd treated group (
