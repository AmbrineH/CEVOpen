<p class="p">Acetylcholine (ACh) is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in neural synapses [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Considering the anti-inflammatory effect of ACh, it is possible to suggest that AChE activity is an intrinsic regulator of inflammation. In the present study, treatment with essential oils from both ginger and turmeric rhizomes inhibited hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex AChE activity when compared with Cd exposed group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). This result highlights the pivotal role of acetylcholine in inflammation and provides efficacy of the essential oil from ginger and turmeric as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of AD associated with inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that peritoneal injection of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors reduces serum proinflammatory cytokine levels in brain and blood and decreases serum acetylcholinesterase activity in mice [
