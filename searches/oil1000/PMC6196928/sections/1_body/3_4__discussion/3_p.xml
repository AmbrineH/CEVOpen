<p class="p">It is well established that the brain interacts dynamically with the immune system to modulate inflammation through a neural pathway otherwise called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This pathway consists of the vagus nerve, acetylcholine (ACh) and the 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that ACh, a neurotransmitter, attenuates the production of TNF, IL-6, and IL-18 by human macrophages at the posttranscriptional stage and alter IL-10 release, which indicates a direct inhibitory effect of ACh on proinflammatory cytokine production [
