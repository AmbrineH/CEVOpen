<p class="p">Cadmium (Cd) is well known for its neurotoxic potential and constitutes a serious global environmental health challenge [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Human is exposed to Cd via different sources such as primary metal industries, production of certain batteries, intake of contaminated food or water, and inhalation of tobacco smoke or polluted air [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that Cd can easily cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure composed of astrocytes and endothelial cells, inducing neuroinflammatory processes [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It has been reported by Ashok et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] that Cd build up in the human body can induced neurotoxicity due to its high blood-brain barrier permeability. Neurological disorders such as memory impairments and hyperactivity in children may occur during Cd exposure [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Disturbances in neuroinflammatory processes have been noticed by Ashok et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] after exposure to Cd. According to Wang and Du [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], the probable mechanism by which Cd induces neurological damage is via oxidative stress; however, the toxic effects of Cd are rather complex and still debated. Other mechanisms such as alterations in inflammatory processes and protein damage in neuronal cells have been proposed [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Hence, current research focuses on anti-inflammatory agents from either synthetic or food sources that can help alleviate heavy metal induced neurodegeneration.
