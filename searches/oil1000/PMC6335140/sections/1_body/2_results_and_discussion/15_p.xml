<p class="p">Foods containing unsaturated fatty acids at high concentration are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation. The lipid oxidation causes major changes on quality characteristics of foods such as color, taste, aroma and texture and also leads to the formation of toxic compounds. In generally, to determine the level of lipid oxidation, TBARS analysis is used (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Demirkaya, 2013</xref>). The TBARS values of samples varied from 0.10â€“0.26 mg MA/kg BBP and our results remained under threshold value (2.5 mg MA/kg BBP). In this study, from mon 0 to mon 1, sample 1 has showed highest TBARS value (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). At mon 0 and 1, the TBARS value of the sample 2 and 3 were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) although sample 1 were statistically different from the other samples (p&lt;0.05). At mon 2 and 3; the sample 3 has the highest TBARS value and sample 1 and 2 were not statistically different (p&gt;0.05) and also sample 3 was significantly different from the other samples (p&lt;0.05). At the end of the storage, sample 3 has highest the TBARS value. Except sample 1, the TBARS values of the other samples were gradually increased compared to the initial values throughout storage.

(2005)</xref> reported that two different encapsulating methods with MD (spray and freeze drying) of safou oil significantly inhibit lipid oxidation effectively compared to non-encapsulated safou oil during storage in terms of TBARS values.
