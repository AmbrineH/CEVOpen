 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the moisture content of the samples was ranged from 6.73% to 7.69% (wet basis) and the results were significantly different (p&lt;0.05). To the best of our knowledge, the production of the BBP has not been previously reported thus, other powdered products tried to cite in this study. In our study, the moisture content of the BBPs exceed upon 5% and the main reason why it is considered that caused by the dry matter concentration of the feed solution (25%) and the inlet dryer temperature (185â„ƒ).
