<p class="p">After the particles are wetted and have sunk, they would immediately start to disperse uniformly as individual particles. To obtain the best reconstitution properties powders need to have good dispersibility, wettability, and optimal agglomeration. Sample 1 and 3 were not statistically different (p&gt;0.05) and the dispersibility value of sample 2 has lower than other samples. These results indicated that sample 1 has the best reconstitution properties among the others.</p>
