<p class="p">The water activity (a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub>) of the BBPs has ranged from 0.16 to 0.20 and treatments are seen to be statistically different (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). WPI added powders have higher water activity values than MD added powders. The powdered foods with low water activity value (below 0.25) were accepted as stable for physical, chemical and microbiological changes (
