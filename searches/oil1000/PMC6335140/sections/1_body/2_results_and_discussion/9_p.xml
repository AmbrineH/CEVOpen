<p class="p">The wettability, dispersibility and SI of the BBP was given in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. For powdered foods, the wettability can be defined as the ability of a powder bulk to be penetrated by a liquid due to capillary forces. Some physical properties like particle size, porosity, contact angle and chemical composition which depends on fat, protein and sugar content influences the wettability of powders (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fang et al., 2008</xref>). Short wettability times indicate good reconstitution properties and this parameter can vary from product to product. The wettability values of the BBPs ranged from 44.67 to 72.7 s and results were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Uses of the MD which is a carbohydrate origin carrier agent reduced the wettability values in sample 1 whereas uses of the WPI, that is a protein origin carrier agent, increased the wettability values in sample 2 and these results showed that sample 1 indicate the best reconstitution properties among the BBPs.
