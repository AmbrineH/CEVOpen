<p class="p">The CIE a* values of the samples ranged from –0.96 to –2.16 during storage (

Although the sample 1 and 3 did not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) at mon 0 and 1, they were statistically different the other experimental mon (p&lt;0.05). Till the end of mon 1, the greenness values of BBP’s were remain relatively low however and then it is rapidly increased. At mon 2, the CIE a* values of all samples were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) and the highest greenness were observed in MD added BBP. At end of the storage, though the sample 1 and 2 were found similar (p&gt;0.05), the sample 3 was found higher from the others (p&lt;0.05). During storage, the CIE a* values of all samples statistically different (p&lt;0.05) and gradually decreased. It is observed that the CIE a* values of the all samples decreased up to 3 mon owing to the brownish/greenish color of the bone broth. It’s well known that, with Maillard reactions generally brownish colored Maillard products can be formed in spray dried products and these pigments induced to oxidation reactions enzymatically. Accordingly, the color of powdered products changed substantially during the storage (
