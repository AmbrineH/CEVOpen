<p class="p">The morphological characteristics of spray-dried the BBPs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. A large number of irregular particles were observed, which is characteristic of powders that are produced by spray drying. The uses of different carrier agents influenced on microparticles morphology of the powdered product. The sample 1 particles which is belong to images showed smooth with no obvious dents particle with shriveled structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), with no apparent cracks or fissures, which is an advantage, this images showed that capsules have lower permeability to gases, increasing protection and retention of the active material. Similar behaviors were verified for Î²-caroten (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carneiro et al., 2013</xref>) powders produced by spray drying. The sample 2 particle which is belonging to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref> images showed spherical and smooth and also some shriveled and cracked particles. Similar particle morphology was observed in sample 3. Generally, the spray drying conditions affected the final surface characteristics of droplets such as inlet and outlet temperature, atomization pressure and some emulsion properties like dissolved gases from the emulsion during drying and residual moisture content (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rosenberg et al. (1985)</xref> indicated that the presence of dents had an adverse effect on the flow properties of the powders. Surface imperfections, such as wrinkles, cracks, or collapses, occur when a film slowly forms during atomization according to 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Re (1998)</xref>. In encapsulated ingredients smooth spheres are desirable for the stability and solubility of droplets (
