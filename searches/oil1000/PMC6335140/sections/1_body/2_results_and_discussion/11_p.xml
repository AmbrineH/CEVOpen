<p class="p">SI is used as indicator in powder product such as egg, milk, rosehip powders and is considered as important a key in determination of the reconstitution quality in food industry (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fang et al., 2008</xref>). The SI of the BBPs has observed varied between 71% and 81.6% and the results were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The sample 1 has the highest SI and these results showed that the sample 1 has the best reconstitution properties as it other parameters (wettability and dispersibility).
