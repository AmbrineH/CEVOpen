<p class="p">The ash content of all samples were statistically found different (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The reason for the differences between the results might be owing to the different carrier agents used in this study. The highest ash content was determined in sample 2 (1.66%) and the lowest ash content was observed in sample 1 (0.37%).
