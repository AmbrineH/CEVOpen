<p class="p">The pH, TBARS and BI of the BBPs were given in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> during storage. At mon 0 and 2, the uses of different carrier agents were showed significant differences on pH values of the samples (p&lt;0.05), though at mon 1 the pH values of sample 2 and 3 were found slightly higher than sample 1 and at mon 3 sample 2 showed the highest pH value. During storage, the pH values of the all samples were gradually increased until the end of mon 1 and a decrement were observed during mon 2 and again the pH values increased rapidly after the second mon (p&lt;0.05).
