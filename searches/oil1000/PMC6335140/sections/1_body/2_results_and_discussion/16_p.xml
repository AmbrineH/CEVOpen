<p class="p">The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars. It occurs in three major stages and it is depend on factors such as pH, time, temperature, concentration of reactants etc. (

Moreover, the outlet temperature is the most important factor for Maillard reactions in the spray drying process. It is reported that the Maillard reaction slows down with the reduction of the moisture content of the powders and it stops a

At the beginning of the storage, although the BI of the sample 2 and 3 were not statistically different (p&gt;0.05), the sample 1 was significantly lower than the others (p&lt;0.05) (

At mon 2, the sample 3 were showed higher BI values compared to others and also sample 1 and 2 were found similar (p&gt;0.05). At the end of the storage, the highest BI values were observed in sample 2. After 3 mon storage; the BI values of the spray-dried powders increased approximately 6 times in sample 1, 5 times in sample 2 and 4 times in sample 3 greater than the initial value. At the end of storage, the increment in the BI value is thought that cause decrement in the L* (lightness) value of the powder products (
