<p class="p">The CIE b* values of the BBPs ranged from 2.45 to 7.61 (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The sample 2 has highest CIE b* values at all experimental periods. The CIE b* values of the samples were statistically different on all storage mon (p&lt;0.05). However, the CIE b* values of the sample 1 showed fluctuating curve throughout storage. From mon 0 to mon 1; although the CIE b* values of the sample 1 increased, from mon 1 to 3, it is decreased. Except sample 1, the CIE b* values of the other samples were significantly different during storage (p&lt;0.05).
