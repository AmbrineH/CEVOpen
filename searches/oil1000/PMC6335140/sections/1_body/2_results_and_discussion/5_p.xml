It is consider that the fat which found in the structure of the bone broth is adhere to the hot glass surface of spray-dryer and it is liquefied and desired final powder product cannot be obtained under this condition. Accordingly, it is seem to be the use of carrier agents is essential in the production of the BBP. By the use of carrier agents, the final fat content of the BBPs were found significantly different in this study (p&lt;0.05) (
