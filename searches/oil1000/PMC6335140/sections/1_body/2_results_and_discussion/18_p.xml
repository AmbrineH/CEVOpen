<p class="p">The CIE L* values of the BBPs ranged from 72.44 to 77.42 (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Except mon 3, the sample 1 has the highest CIE L* values each of experimental mon and significantly different from other samples (p&lt;0.05). At mon 1 and 2, though the sample 1 and 3 were found similar (p&gt;0.05), the sample 2 was different from the others. At the end of the storage; although the sample 2 and 3 were found similar (p&gt;0.05), the sample 1 was statistically different from the other samples (p&lt;0.05). Throughout storage, lightness of all samples decreased gradually, and it is considered to realize the formation of secondary oxidation products. As a result of the oxidation analysis; the increase in the TBA value of the sample 1 supports the decrease in CIE L* value up to 3 mon (
