 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jinapong et al. (2008)</xref> reported that the wettability values of the soy milk powder vary from 57.4 to 308 s and the dispersibility values of the soy milk powder has ranged from 62.3% to 94%. 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Erbay (2013)</xref> stated that the wettability values of the WPI have ranged from 44.4 to 67.9 s and the dispersibility values of the WPI has varied from 62.76% to 63.45%. However, the dispersibility values of the BBP have ranged from 47.91% to 58.43% in our study. It is considered that the low dispersibility values of the BBP samples ascribed to higher fat content compared to other foods used in the studies. 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Erbay (2013)</xref> determined that the SI of the WPI has varied from 76.95% to 83.06%.
