<p class="p">The bone broth was prepared according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anonymous (2001)</xref>. The bones were cut in appropriate size (20–25 cm) with a bone saw. The bones were kept at 30℃–40℃ water for 0.5–1 h to remove any scum that has risen to the top and then scummy water discarded. Subsequently, the bones treated with clean water (1:1, w/v, bone: water) and were boiled again to obtain a high yielded extract for 5–6 h in a pressure cooker. After the boiling process, the bones were discarded and resulting broth was used for further preparation of the bone broth emulsions. The bone broth was left to cool down to 4℃ and excessive fat which is deposited on the surface were removed manually.
