<p class="p">TBARS analysis was performed with slight modifications according to 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Witte et al. (1970)</xref>, to detect final products of lipid oxidation. Five g of the BBP was homogenized with an ultraturrax in 50 mL 20% trichloroacetic acid and followed by filtration using Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Then, 5 mL filtrate was taken in a screw cap tube followed by the addition of thiobarbituric acid (5 mL, 0.02 M). The tubes were left to develop a yellow color in boiling water bath (70â„ƒ) for 30 min and then were left to cool down. At the end of the period, yellow color formation was observed in the test tubes, so the readings were performed at 450 nm (Carry 50 Scan UV, USA). 1, 1, 3, 3, tetraethoxypropane was used as the standard for TBARS assay. TBARS numbers were calculated as mg of malonaldehyde per kilogram of BBP (mg MA/kg BBP).
