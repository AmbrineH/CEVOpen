<p class="p">For the wettability analyses, 0.075 g of powder is weighed and then was passed through from wire mesh screen at a certain height. Afterwards, the powder spattered into 100 mL of distilled water at 35â„ƒ. The moment of wetting of the samples is observed and the wetting time by recording the wettability is determined as seconds. Finally, the time was recorded for the powder to become completely wetted (visually assessed as when all the powder particles penetrated the surface of the water).</p>
