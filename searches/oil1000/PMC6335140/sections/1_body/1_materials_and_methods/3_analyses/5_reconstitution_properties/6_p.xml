<p class="p">To measurement of the SI, 1 g of powder was placed into a test tube with 5 mL of 5% sodium chloride solution (m/v). The solution was shaken and mixed with a vortex mixer. The refractive index values (RI) of the dispersed sample and sodium chloride solution were measured by using a refractometer. The SI values were calculated by using Haenni values and SI.</p>
