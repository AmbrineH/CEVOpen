<p class="p">The BI values of the BBP samples were measured by an enzymatic digestion method (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Palombo et al., 1984</xref>). The method was based on pronase proteolysis that releases the brown pigments. The pronase solution used in the analysis is prepared by mixing 10 mg pronase with 1 mL Tris buffer (pH:7). 1 g of the BBP placed into a test tube and then 5 mL of distilled water added to the test tube at 50℃ and the powder were dissolved with a tube vortex. Then, 1.5 mL of the dissolved sample was transferred to a new test tube and 0.4 mL of the pronase solution added to the tube and the solution was stirred manually following and was incubated for 120 min in a water bath at 45℃. After the incubation, the test tubes are quickly cooled with iced water and 150 μL of TCA (100%) is added to the samples. Then the tubes are centrifuged at 1,860×g for 20 min at 4℃ in a centrifuge (Nuve NF 800, Turkey). At the end of the centrifugation, the supernatant is collected, and the absorbance of the samples were read at 420 (A
 <sub class="sub">420</sub>) and 550 (A
 <sub class="sub">550</sub>) nm by using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601, Japan) and the optical density (OD) of the samples were calculated as follows;
