<p class="p">In this study, it was possible to evaluate the performance of three different carrier agents combinations in the bone broth microencapsulation by spray drying. Although authors expected that uses of WPI is an animal origin carrier agent for bone broth production is more suitable than other carrier agents (MD and mixture of them etc.), the results indicated, contrary to expectations. According to results obtained from this study, uses of the MD come into prominence as an appropriate carrier agent for the bone broth production in terms of physicochemical, reconstitution properties (wettability, dispersibility and SI) and scanning electron microscope images. Also, 20% MD added BBP did not show any negative effect in terms of pH, lipid oxidation and browning index throughout the storage. In conclusion, spray drying of the bone broth is fairly an effective method in terms of storage and ease of transport. In industrial scale, the spray drying technique has been successfully used in foods of animal origin such as egg, yogurt and cheese powder so it is consider that the BBP could be produced commercially with spray drying. Consequently, the BBP might be used to enhance palatability of soups, pilaus and pot dishes as a new industrial product in food industry. Exportation of encapsulated BBP could be a prominent income for Turkey because of the bone broth nutritional value.</p>
