<p class="p">Acid-induced gelation occurs by lowering the pH (normally to that corresponding to the pI) and thus changing the net charge of protein molecules as well as the interactions between protein and solvent. When the protein has a zero net charge, repulsive forces are minimized and aggregation occurs. The mechanisms of acid-induced gel formation can be explained by the fractal aggregation theory. Fractal aggregation assumes that spherical particles of the radius can move by Brownian motion and that they can aggregate when they encounter each other. These aggregates formed can then aggregate with each other giving rise to fractal aggregates or clusters, which are considered to be the building block of the gel [

However, acid gelation often requires an initial physical treatment (heating or high pressure) in order to unfold the native structure of the protein molecule, exposing it to further reactions. Andoyo et al. showed the possibility of producing different sizes of microbeads using whey proteins with acid gelation, but at nanoscale these kinds of examples are scarce [
