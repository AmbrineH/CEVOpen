<p class="p">Gelation of proteins usually requires a driving force to unfold the native protein structure, followed by an aggregation process to give a three-dimensional network. Protein–protein interactions, aggregations mechanisms, and types of protein aggregates, as well as processing techniques, determine much of the produced structures. Protein aggregates serve as “building blocks” to the development of food-grade nano- and micro-network gels. Without a heating step, the protein network structures formed, barely remain stable in water [
 <xref rid="B44-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. At denaturation temperature globular proteins start to unfold, and depending on the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions between them, they can remain as individual denatured molecules or form fibrillar or particulate aggregates [
 <xref rid="B44-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. These outcomes are extremely dependent both on the heating method (direct and indirect) and the heating conditions, such as temperature, heating rate, treatment time, and environmental conditions (e.g., pH, ionic strength, and salt addition). However, aggregation mechanisms, as well as types of protein aggregates, are defined by the chemical environment of the aqueous protein solution, namely: pH, ionic strength, and protein concentration. In this sense, physical and chemical methods can be used as a driving force for the development of protein systems, and generally involve the use of heat, pressure, and enzymatic reactions among others. Recently, the use of emergent electroheating technologies (such as ohmic heating) have also been associated with protein structural disturbances that can change their aggregation pathways at the nano-scale [

 <xref rid="B46-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. A comprehensive understanding of all these factors involved in protein denaturation will allow a better design of nanostructures with the intended functionalities.
