<p class="p">A way to control the aggregation/cluster state of proteins that is complementary to heat-induced gelation is the use of certain enzymes that can induce artificial covalent cross-links into food proteins. The best-known enzyme, available for use in the food industry, is microbial transglutaminase (TG: EC 2.3.2.13), that catalyzes the formation of cross-links between lysine and glutamine residues [

 <xref rid="B60-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Depending on the enzyme concentration, the incubation time, and the type and concentration of proteins available, the functional benefits of TG-treatment are the gelation of proteins, the increase of gel strength and elasticity, and the higher water-holding capacity [
 <xref rid="B61-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Other classes of protein cross-linking enzymes are oxidative enzymes such as peroxidase (POD; EC 1.4.3.13) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO; EC 1.14.18.1). Horseradish peroxidase can induce cross-linking of ovalbumin, Î²-lg, and BSA, yielding various oligomers and polymers in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a low molecular weight hydrogen donor. PPO is an enzyme that can be used to cross-link casein in the presence of a low molecular weight phenolic compound such as caffeic acid. Overall, food functional effects of enzymatic protein cross-linking also include improvements of gelation properties and emulsion stability as well as enhanced heat-stability [
