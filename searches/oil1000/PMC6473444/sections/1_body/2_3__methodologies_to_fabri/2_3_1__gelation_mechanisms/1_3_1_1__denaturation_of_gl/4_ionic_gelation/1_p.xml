<p class="p">Increasing the ionic strength in protein solutions through the addition of salt ions can screen or shield the electrostatic charges on the protein molecules or aggregates. As a consequence, electrostatic repulsive forces between the molecules are minimized and gelation occurs. When the pH of the protein solutions is well above the pI of the proteins, divalent ions can act as an intermolecular crosslinking agent by promoting the bridging of the proteins. Ionic-induced gelation is often called cold gelation [
 <xref rid="B56-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. In contrast with heat-induced gelation, cold gelation occurs below denaturation protein temperatures. However, it requires a pre-denaturation step (by heat, pressure or enzymatic treatment) in which proteins are unfolded, losing their native state and giving rise to the appearance of soluble aggregates. This denaturation pre-treatment is then followed by salt addition, which results in the formation of a network mediated via interactions between cationic agents and protein soluble aggregates at environment temperatures [

Cold-set protein hydrogels can be obtained by adding cationic agents such as ferrous, calcium or barium salts to solutions of denatured globular proteins [
