<p class="p">Protein-based structures can be formulated by the self-assembly method with charged polymers, where interactions between the biopolymers occur for example by non-covalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding). Different protein-based particles can be prepared based on this methodology. For example, Yu et al. (2006) prepared nanogels by self-assembly of two proteins with opposite charge (ovalbumin and lysozyme) and by thermally-induced gelation [

The utilization of this methodology using biopolymers of opposite charge, where the size is controlled by polymer concentrations and different environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, and ionic strength), is a strategy for developing nano-hydrogels. Bourbon et al. (2015) applied this technique to develop complex coacervates between lactoferrin and glycomacropeptide and applied thermal gelation on these complexes to obtain stable nanohydrogels [
