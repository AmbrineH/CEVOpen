<p class="p">Protein-based nanostructures can also be produced in combination with other polymers or other biopolymers. These mixtures can be used to improve the stability, or change the hydrophobicity level or density as well as the synergistic interactions between different proteins or between proteins and polysaccharides. Different delivery systems (that combine different biopolymers) have been developed and are presented in
