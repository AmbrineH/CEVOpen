<p class="p">Spray drying is a well-established method commonly used in the pharmaceutical and food industries for the production of a dry powder from a liquid phase. This technique allows the manipulation of various particle properties such as particle size, bulk density, and flow properties by the adaption of the process parameters or spray dryer configuration (e.g., flow rate, drying temperature, and the separation of the dried material from the air). During the spray drying of nanoparticles, a biopolymer solution feedstock is atomized into a spray of fine droplets and then brought into contact with the hot drying air at a sufficient temperature for moisture evaporation to take place. As the moisture evaporates from the droplets, a solid product (powder) is formed and recovered from the drying air [

Recently, a new generation of laboratory scale spray dryers that is able to produce particles at nano scale, has been introduced. The BÃ¼chi Nano Spray Dryer B-90 relies on its vibration mesh spray technology, creating tiny droplets (before evaporation) in a size range of a smaller order of magnitude than classical spray dryers. In this equipment, the electrostatic particle collector allows the efficient separation of the dried particles. Some work has been done to prepare protein particles to encapsulate active compounds (vitamins, antioxidants, metals [
