<p class="p">Water-in-oil (W/O) heterogeneous gelation involves the emulsification step of aqueous droplets of the protein (gelling agent) stably dispersed in a continuous organic phase with the aid of oil-soluble surfactants [
 <xref rid="B73-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This method is used to better control the size of particles. The proteins within the water droplets of the W/O emulsion are then cross-linked using enzymes [

 <xref rid="B77-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. The general methods for W/O heterogeneous gelation include inverse (mini)emulsion, the reverse micellar method, and membrane emulsification, and a brief explanation is presented below [
