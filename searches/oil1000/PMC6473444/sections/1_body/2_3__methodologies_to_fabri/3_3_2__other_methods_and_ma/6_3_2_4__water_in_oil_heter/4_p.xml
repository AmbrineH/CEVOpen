<p class="p">In the membrane emulsification technique, the to-be-dispersed phase is passed through a membrane with controlled pore size. Under controlled conditions, hydrogel particles with specific morphology are formed on the surface of the membrane, these hydrogels being subsequently recovered by a continuous phase that flows across the membrane.</p>
