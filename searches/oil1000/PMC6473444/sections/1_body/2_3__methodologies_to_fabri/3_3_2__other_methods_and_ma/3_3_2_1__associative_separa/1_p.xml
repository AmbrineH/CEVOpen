<p class="p">In a two-phase system a strong attraction occurs between two biopolymers, forming one phase rich in one polyelectrolyte and other phase being depleted in both polyelectrolytes. The phase which contains the biopolymers can be a precipitate or a complex coacervate, depending on the charge of the biopolymer and the strength of the attraction between the biopolymers. </p>
