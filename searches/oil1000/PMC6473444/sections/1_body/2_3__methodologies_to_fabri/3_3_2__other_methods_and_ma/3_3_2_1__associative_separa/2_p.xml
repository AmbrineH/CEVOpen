<p class="p">Complex coacervation occurs when an electrostatic attraction is established between molecules (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides or between proteins and polysaccharides). These systems are extremely sensitive to environmental conditions (pH, temperature, and ionic strength) as well as to the total polyelectrolyte concentration and the protein/polyelectrolyte ratio. Complex coacervation is considered a simple method of creating particles that can be used as a carrier of active compounds. Nevertheless, there are several factors that currently limit their application in the food industry. The coacervate phase has low stability over a relatively narrow range of pH values, and the complex can disintegrate (when the molecules have strong similar charges) or form precipitates (when the molecules have strong opposing charges). These structures, namely particles, are considered unstable when the ionic strength increases, which limits their application in some food products as they tend to coalesce over time, leading to a gradual increase in the mean particle size and eventually to macroscopic phase separation [
