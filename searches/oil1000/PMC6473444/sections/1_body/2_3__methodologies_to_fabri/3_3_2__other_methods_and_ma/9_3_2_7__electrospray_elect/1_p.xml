 <xref rid="B81-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. A high voltage is applied in a biopolymer solution which emits a liquid jet stream through a nozzle, forming controlled liquid droplets. Bioactive compounds can be easily incorporated into the nanostructure with high efficacy using this method. Electrospraying has emerged as a similar technique to electrospinning, which uses an analogous technology for the production of nanostructures. This technique has numerous advantages such as scalable synthesis, reproducibility, no need of heat, and high encapsulation efficiency. Furthermore, the nanoparticles produced by electrospraying/electrospinning are considered stable and without any loss of their bioactivity [
