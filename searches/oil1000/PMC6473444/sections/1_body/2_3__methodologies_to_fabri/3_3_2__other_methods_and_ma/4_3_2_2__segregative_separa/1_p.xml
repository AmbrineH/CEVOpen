<p class="p">In segregative separation there is a repulsion between the two different biopolymers. This type of phase separation is usual when the biopolymers are uncharged or when the two biopolymers have similar charges. At low biopolymer concentration, the two biopolymers are mixed and can form a one-phase system, however, when the biopolymer concentration exceeds a certain level, phase separation occurs and a two-phase solution is formed with each phase being rich in one type of biopolymer and depleted in the other. This mechanism produces microstructures such as “water-in-water” emulsions or “oil-in-water” emulsions. These systems are considered kinetically stable and can result in novel microstructures with new functional and rheological properties for the food industry [
