<p class="p">These methods have been used to prepare biopolymer particles such as nanoparticle gels. In the micromolding method, a biopolymer solution is placed onto a mold and induced to form a gel by controlled factors (e.g., temperature or gelling agents). After this process, particles are removed from the mold and used. The microfluidic method allows for the preparation of various biopolymer-based particles upon the design of various microfluidic channels. These methods allow the preparation of particles with sizes below 1 Î¼m, with different shapes for specific delivery applications. To prepare particles by these methods the development of specific molds, photolithographic molds, and microfluidics devices is necessary. Furthermore, economic challenges have limited large scale production by these techniques [
