<p class="p">A mixture of two biopolymers can form one-phase or two-phase systems, depending on different factors: (1) the type of biopolymer, (2) the ratio between biopolymers in the solution and (3) the environmental conditions. When two biopolymers are distributed throughout the system as soluble complexes or individual molecules, a one-phase system is formed. However, if the solution separates into two distinct phases composed of different concentrations of the biopolymers, a two-phase system is formed instead [

However, in recent years, some new methodologies have appeared as a way to produce different types of protein-based nanostructures (e.g., particles and fibers) such as nanospraydrier and electrospray/electrospinning.
