<p class="p">The increasing number of publications dealing with proteins for the production of nanostructures shows the strong interest of food scientists in this area, and which can open new horizons for interesting applications by the food industry. Their use for the encapsulation and controlled release of bioactive compounds seems to be one of the most interesting applications. One of the challenges to be overcome is finding technological solutions to scale-up their production in a competitive way. Another issue to address is concerned with more comprehensive knowledge on the interaction of the produced structures with the human body, and in this case, toxicological studies should be performed in order to confirm their safety is guaranteed.</p>
