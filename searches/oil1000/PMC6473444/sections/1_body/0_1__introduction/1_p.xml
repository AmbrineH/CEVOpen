They can be designed to facilitate the encapsulation of diverse classes of bioactive compounds showing interesting characteristics and the potential to be used as a carrier system e.g., they can reach specific targets which are not easily accessed by their counterparts at micro- and macroscale; they can provide new textures and functional properties, being good candidates for intracellular delivery of bioactive compounds; they have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio which is important for in vivo applications; they provide a sizable active compound loading capacity, low density and high dispersion stability in aqueous media; they can be used as a carrier of bioactive compounds with different molecular weights and prolong biological activity in aqueous media. Several types of protein-based structures, such as the cases of hydrogels, solid particles, and emulsions, can be developed depending on the final application (the desired drug release profile, the properties of active compounds such as solubility and particle size).
