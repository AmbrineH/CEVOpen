 <xref rid="B13-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Protein structures are one of the most convenient and widely used matrices in food applications, and in particular protein-based nanostructures have recently attracted a great deal of interest in food engineering and delivery applications [

 <xref rid="B15-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In the case of non-solid and semi-solid foods, it is essential to decrease the matrix size to allow its incorporation without affecting food sensory qualities [
 <xref rid="B16-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Furthermore, it is possible to develop new protein vehicles with improved delivery properties by decreasing the structure size from micrometers to nanometers. It is well known that one of the challenges of the food industry is to preserve or increase the bioavailability of bioactive compounds (e.g., vitamins, nutraceuticals and anti-inflammatories) in functional food products aimed at promoting health and well-being. However, the contact with harsh environmental conditions (e.g., gastric fluids, with low pH, high concentrations of salts and ionic strength), and the often low solubility during gastro intestinal digestion results in only a small proportion of bioactive molecules remaining available for oral administration, which limits the activity and potential health benefits of bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B17-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The production of systems which are able to maintain the activity of these molecules until the time of consumption and physiological delivery is being extensively investigated by food technologists. Protein-based delivery systems hold promise in providing such protection to bioactive molecules and complying with the requirement of the use of the compounds; generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), which is mandatory in the food industry [
