<p class="p">Chemical cross-linked gels present higher stability due to the presence of covalent bonds established between different polymer chains. Small molecules (aldehydes) or use of UV light are usually used to cross-link this type of gels. They are stable at different conditions unless the covalent bonds are cleaved [
