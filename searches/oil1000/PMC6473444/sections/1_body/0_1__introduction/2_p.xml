<p class="p">Some of the most interesting materials that have been used as a base for this development are the hydrogels. Their polymer-based architectures can take up large amounts of water or physiological fluids while maintaining their internal network structure [

These properties depend much on inter- and intramolecular interactions (e.g., covalent bonds, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions) that can be established, and thus in the way the hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups as well as ethers, amines and sulfates) are organized within the structure. These aspects contribute decisively to important physical hydrogel features such as softness and elasticity [
 <xref rid="B6-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Hydrogels can be classified in different ways, one of the classifications is based on the type of bonds present in the network chains of the gel structure. Polymeric hydrogels are subdivided into two major categories, the physical and chemical cross-linked gels. In physical gels, a heterogeneous organization is formed by molecular entanglements established by hydrophobic associations, ionic interactions, or hydrogen bonding. These gels are also denominated by “reversible” or “pseudo” gels, once they have a restructuring ability. Physical hydrogels are highly influenced by environmental conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength) which make them sensitive to water (degrade and even disintegrate completely) and temperature (thermo-reversible) [
