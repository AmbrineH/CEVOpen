<p class="p">An interesting strategy to disperse lipophilic compounds into aqueous solution is to prepare oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Proteins are also used as emulsifiers, as many of them are surface-active molecules that are used to produce desirable O/W emulsion properties and improve their stability [
 <xref rid="B9-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Proteins have the ability to adsorb droplets to the oil-water interface, lowering the interfacial tension and retarding droplet coalescence by forming a protective membrane around the droplets [
 <xref rid="B10-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are some limitations such as the high sensitivity to aggregation at certain pH values (close to their isoelectric point, proteins cannot exhibit strong emulsification properties), at high ionic strengths, and at high temperatures [
