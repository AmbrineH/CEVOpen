<p class="p">α-Lactalbumin (α-La) is a globular protein with ellipsoid shape and a molecular weight around 14 kDa. This protein is thermostable, due to the presence of four disulfide bonds. α-La has different bioactive properties such as the ability to bind to calcium and antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B24-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a globular protein having a molecular weight of 66 kDa, 580 amino acid residues and 17 intra-chain disulfide bonds. BSA contains three domains specified for metal-ion binding, lipid binding, and nucleotide binding [

GMP is a C-terminal part of kappa-casein which is released in whey during cheese making by the action of chymosin. GMP is a biologically active component with unique chemical and functional properties such as antibacterial activity, the modulation of immune system responses and the regulation of blood circulation [
 <xref rid="B31-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Some of these bioactive properties of GMP are attributed to its carbohydrate moieties attached to the peptide.
