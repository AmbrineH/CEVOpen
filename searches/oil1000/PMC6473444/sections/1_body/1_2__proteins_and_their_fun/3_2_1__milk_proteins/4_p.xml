 <xref rid="B29-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. It is generally in a dimer form at the isoelectric pH of 5.2 and alkaline pH range. The three-dimensional structure of this protein is greatly affected by temperature. At temperatures above 60 °C it starts to be denaturated also resulting in the appearance of some monomers which are responsible for milk intolerance in humans [
