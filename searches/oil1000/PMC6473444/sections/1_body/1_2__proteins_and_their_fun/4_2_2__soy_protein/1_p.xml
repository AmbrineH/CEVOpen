<p class="p">Soy proteins are abundant, renewable, and biodegradable, thus being attractive for application in food products [

 <xref rid="B36-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Soy proteins can be classified into four categories—i.e., 2S, 7S, 11S, and 15S fractions—according to their sedimentation process. The fractions 7S (conglycinin) and 11S (glycinin) are the major fractions in soy protein structure (35% and 52%, respectively) and are related to the protein functionality. Soy proteins are also used to a great extent to produce food gels, in particular the purified rich fractions of glycinin and β-conglycinin (main proteins in soybeans) and soy protein isolate (mixture of soy proteins). Heat denaturation is a prerequisite for gel formation independently of pH and ionic strength conditions. Soy β-conglycinin gels can be formed at temperatures of about 55–70 °C, while glycinin gels form at about 70–95 °C. For example, tofu, probably the most famous soybean gel, is produced by heating soybean milk followed by addition of salts (e.g., Ca
