<p class="p">The selection of a suitable protein or combination of proteins to produce protein-based systems is based on their properties which depend on both intrinsic (e.g., molecular structure, composition, solubility) and extrinsic factors (e.g., temperature, chemical environment, pH) [
 <xref rid="B20-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The type, number, and particular sequence of amino acids in a protein determine the molecular weight, conformation, electrical charge, hydrophobicity, physical interactions, and other functionalities. Food proteins may serve as an effective carrier of bioactive molecules in formulated foods because of their ligand binding properties and high nutritional value. However, an important handicap of the use of proteins is their allergenicity. There are some proteins such as milk, soy, or egg proteins that may cause an allergic or intolerance reaction in some consumers [
