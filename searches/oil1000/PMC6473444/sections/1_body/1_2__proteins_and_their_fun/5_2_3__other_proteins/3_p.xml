<p class="p">Gelatin is obtained by controlled the hydrolysis of fibrous, insoluble collagen which is widely found as the major component of skin, bones, and connective tissue [
 <xref rid="B35-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Gelatin is considered an interesting biodegradable material, non-toxic and inexpensive and has, therefore, an immense potential to be used for the preparation of colloidal drug delivery systems [
 <xref rid="B36-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This protein is widely used in the food industry as it has the ability to form reversible thermosetting gels (resembling many polysaccharides) with unique rheological properties that melt at 35–37 °C (typical melt-in-the-mouth-texture). Gelatin protein molecules swell in cold or hot water adsorbing up to ten times their weight, and when heated to temperatures above the melting point, give rise to a viscous solution of random-coiled linear polypeptide chains. Upon subsequent cooling to temperatures of 20 °C, a gelatin gel is produced due to the formation of a network of polymeric strands stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions [
