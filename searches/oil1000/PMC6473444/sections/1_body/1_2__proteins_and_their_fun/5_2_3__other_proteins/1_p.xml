<p class="p">Ovalbumin (OVA) is the predominant protein fraction in egg white and is a highly functional food protein that is frequently used in food matrices’ design. It has a molecular weight of 47 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.8 [
 <xref rid="B32-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. OVA has more than 50% hydrophobic amino acids, used to stabilize emulsions or foams. Moreover, this protein has also been used to form gel networks and encapsulate bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B32-gels-05-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Denaturation of OVA determines the optimum temperature for gel formation and contributes to the increase of gel strength when the temperature is raised above 80 °C [
