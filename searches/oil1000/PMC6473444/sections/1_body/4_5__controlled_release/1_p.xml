<p class="p">The controlled release of functional compounds from biopolymer-based structures at the macroscale has been extensively studied. Most of these studies were performed in drug delivery systems. In foods, the main applications of controlled release from biopolymer-based structures are related to the controlled release in the human gastrointestinal environment, where the development of particles to deliver nutrients in the intestine has been explored [

The controlled release of active compounds has numerous advantages in food products such as: prolonging the bioactivity through time (e.g., from vitamins and antioxidants) and protecting sensitive bioactive compounds from enzymatic or acidic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract [

It is extremely important to understand the transport properties of compounds in a matrix and how are they influenced by the size of the system (macro-, micro- or nanoscale), as this provides valuable information regarding their behavior e.g., throughout the food products’ shelf-life. The release of bioactive compounds from bio-polymeric matrices may occur due to different mechanisms, such as Fick’s diffusion, the relaxation of the matrix which is dependent on matrix swelling and erosion. Once the system has come in contact with different environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, ionic strength), a different mechanism may prevail. These mechanisms may be generally classified as belonging to three different types: ideal Fickian diffusion (Brownian transport), Case II transport (polymer relaxation-driven), and anomalous behavior (ranging from Fickian diffusion to Case II transport) [
