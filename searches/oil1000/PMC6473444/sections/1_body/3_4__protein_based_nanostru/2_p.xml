<p class="p">Depending on the nature of the bioactive compounds incorporated in the nanostructure, it is possible to obtain different release mechanisms during the digestion process. Hydrophilic compounds are released from a protein matrix by diffusion, whereas lipophilic compounds are released mainly by enzymatic degradation of the protein matrix in the GI tract [

 <xref rid="gels-05-00009-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> presents some examples of bioactive compounds efficiently incorporated into protein-based nanostructures, with information regarding the encapsulation techniques and their main limitations. The delivery of bioactive compounds at a specific target (e.g., mouth, stomach, small intestine, and colon) with the bioactive properties is still a challenge. The design and manufacture of protein-based systems are extremely important in order to resist severe environmental conditions (e.g., resistant to gastric fluids, when the nanostructure is designed to deliver a bioactive compound in the colon). For instance, nanostructures composed of peptides or proteins have a high level of GI degradation by digestive enzymes [
