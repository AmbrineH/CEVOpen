<p id="Par8" class="p">Genetically identical rooted cuttings of rosemary were planted, one in each of the pots filled with the corresponding soil treatment. Fifty cuttings had been prepared for this purpose from a single parent plant. The cuttings were each approximately 5 cm long and immediately after removal from the parent they were stripped of their lower leaves, dipped into a hormone-containing rooting powder, planted in rooting pots with peat, and maintained in a greenhouse for a period of two months whist rooting took place. After this period, plants of similar length were selected and carefully re-potted in the treatment pots, which were distributed in a randomised complete block design inside a heated greenhouse. The cutting roots were carefully washed with distilled water to remove any particles attached before being planted. All of the pots (n = 36) were maintained for six months at a controlled temperature of 25 °C. Watering of the pots was monitored gravimetrically and maintained at 50% of field capacity throughout the experiment. After six months, the plant foliar tissues were collected, washed with deionised water to remove any attached particles, separated into leaves and stems, and dried in an air-forced oven at 60 °C for 72 h. The dried samples were then ground to a mean size of 0.5 mm for later analyses.</p>
