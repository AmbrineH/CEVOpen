<p id="Par7" class="p">Polyethylene pots were filled with 1 kg of soil mixed thoroughly with composts P or C at two doses (expressed on a fresh mass basis): a) Low dose (L) comprised 11.54 g compost per kg soil (corresponding to a dose of 30 t/ha) and b) high dose (H) comprised 23.08 g of compost per kg soil (equivalent to a dose of 60 t/ha). Positive and negative control treatments were included in the experimental design: The positive treatment (InOrg) being an inorganic fertilisation application of NPK in the proportion of 100:60:73. This was obtained by adding 192 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> soil of the commercial fertiliser Nitrophoska top 20 (NPK = 20:5:10), and 26 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of Monopotasic phosphate (NPK = 0:52:34). The negative control treatment (Control) comprised soil without the addition of fertiliser. The NPK ratios of the amended soils were comparable with soils fertilised with inorganic fertiliser (NPK of 100:60:73). Each treatment was replicated six times.
