 </sup>. Portions of each ground sample (60 mg) were extracted into 500 µL of ethanol at 40 °C in a screw top microcentrifuge tube, into which was also placed a stainless steel pellet. The tubes were, shaken for 5 min in a Retsch ball mill at 30 impacts s

Following the second shaking, the tubes were shaken for a final time after addition of 400 µL of water. The tubes were then subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 13000 g in a benchtop centrifuge to separate the phases. A portion (50 µL) of the upper (aqueous) phase from each sample was transferred to an 11 mm glass GC vial (Chromocol) and the contents dried under a flow of oxygen free nitrogen in a hot block at 40 °C. Samples were derivatised in a two-step procedure: Firstly 30 µL of freshly prepared methoxyamine hydrochloride (MOX) dissolved in pyridine (20 mg/mL) was added to each vial. The vials were crimp capped with Teflon sealed lids, and the sealed vials incubated in a hot block at 90 °C for 15 min. The samples were then removed from the block and after cooling they were uncapped. To each vial 20 µL of N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) was added, the vials resealed using new caps, and then incubated for a further 15 min at 90 °C.
