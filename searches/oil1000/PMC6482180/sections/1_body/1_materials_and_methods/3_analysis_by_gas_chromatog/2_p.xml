<p id="Par10" class="p">The derivatised samples were analysed on a GC 6890 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) coupled to a 5973 N mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The GC was operated under electronic pressure control at a flow rate of 1 ml/min He carrier gas and 1 µL injections of each sample were made onto the column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx-5Sil MS with an integrated guard column and a 0.25 mm film (Restek GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) via a split/splitless capillary inlet in the split mode set to a 5:1 split ratio. Inlet temperature was maintained at 280 °C.</p>
