<p id="Par11" class="p">The temperature of the oven on injection was 80 °C. This temperature was held for 2 mins and then ramped to 300 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, held for 2 mins and then finally raised to 330 °C at a rate of 50 °C/min and held for 5 mins to purge the column. The temperatures of the transfer line, the ion source and the quadrupole were 330 °C, 230 °C and 150 °C respectively. Mass spectra were monitored by quadrupole scanning over a range of 50 m/z to 550 m/z. Tuning and all other settings of the mass spectrometer were according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
