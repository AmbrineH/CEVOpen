 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> using an Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker UK Ltd., Coventry, UK) fitted with a Golden Gate attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory (Specac Ltd., Slough, UK). Spectra were averaged over 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and corrected for background absorbance by subtraction of the spectrum of the empty ATR crystal. Spectra of soluble metabolites were also collected by analysis of the ethanolic extracts obtained in section 2.3. Small volumes (10 µl) of the extracts were spotted onto 96 well patters silicon plates (Bruker UK Ltd.) and allowed to dry at 40 °C. Spectra from the dried extract spots were measured on the HTS plate-reader accessory (Bruker UK Ltd.) of the Equinox 55 spectrophotometer as described using Opus Lab software (Bruker UK Ltd.), with position A1 of the plate being kept as a reference blank position.
