<p id="Par6" class="p">The composts used in this study comprised of solid fractions from the anaerobic digestion of cattle and pig slurry (75% by dry mass of digested cattle slurry (compost C), or digested pig slurry (compost P) respectively) mixed with 25% by dry mass of vine shoot prunings. The anaerobic cattle and pig digestates used were obtained after a continuous, mesophilic anaerobic digestion of 4.3% cattle manure and 11.6% maize oat silage (fresh mass basis) and of pig slurry, respectively. Compost C was prepared at semi-industrial scale (1800 kg) by the Rutgers static pile composting system, while compost P was prepared in a thermo-composter (150 kg) by the turning composting system. During composting, both mixtures reached temperature values higher than 55 °C, which guarantees the sanitization of the composts. The complete description of the composting process is detailed elsewhere

 </sup>. Chemical analysis indicated that both composts were very suitable for their agricultural use (Table

 </sup> and the contents of N, P and K were similar to those found in composts derived from livestock manure. In addition, in both composts the cation exchange capacity (CEC) (&gt;60 meq/100 g organic matter) and the germination index (GI) (&gt;60%) fulfilled the limits established for mature composts
