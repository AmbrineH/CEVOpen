<p id="Par5" class="p">The soil used in this study was obtained from the surface layer (0–20 cm) of a semiarid agricultural area, abandoned for a period of ten years in Montelibretti, a town in the Metropolitan City of Rome, in Lazio (Italy). Before being abandoned, the area had been under intensive agriculture for more than 20 years. The soil was air dried before being passed through a 2 mm sieve. The soil from this site is a highly calcareous loam soil, that is slightly alkaline (pH = 7.6), and has low salinity (0.10 dS/m) and poor total organic C content (0.75% C).</p>
