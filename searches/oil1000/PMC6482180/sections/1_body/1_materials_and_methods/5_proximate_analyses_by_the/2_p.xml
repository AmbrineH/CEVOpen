<p id="Par16" class="p">Proximate analysis was performed on the TGA data to calculate the relative proportions (wt. %) of moisture, volatiles, and char (ash + fixed carbon) for each sample. The moisture content was calculated from the mass loss which occurred between 40 and 105 °C, the volatiles from the mass loss between 105 and 550 °C, and the char from 550 to 900 °C. Data from TGA were converted to text files using Pyris software (Perkin Elmer) and imported into Excel (Microsoft), where the data were processed using a custom spreadsheet to calculate the proportions of moisture, volatile carbon and char.</p>
