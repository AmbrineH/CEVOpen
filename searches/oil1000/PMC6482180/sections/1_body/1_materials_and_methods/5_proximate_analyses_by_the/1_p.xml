<p id="Par15" class="p">Thermo-gravimetric experiments (TGA) were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA analyser. The samples of leaves and stems of the rosemary plants were heated in nitrogen at a flow rate of 50 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> using the following 2-step temperature program. The first step consisted of the thermogravimetic analysis: (i) Heat from 40 to 105 °C at 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; (ii) hold at 105 °C for 10 min; (iii) heat from 105 to 905 °C at 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; (iv) hold at 905 °C for 15 min; and (v) cool from 905 to 105 °C at 25 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The second part of the analysis was to measure the proportion of ash in the samples. This took place once the TGA section had concluded and consisted of the sample being heated to 580 °C, at a rate of 100 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the presence of air, and holding that temperature for 40 minutes. During this period the fixed carbon is lost as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and what is left is the mass of the ash.
