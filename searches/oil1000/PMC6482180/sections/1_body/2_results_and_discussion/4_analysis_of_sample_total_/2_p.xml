<p id="Par29" class="p">PCA was repeated on the mean TIC data after separation into stem and leaf datasets using protocols for cross-validation and pre-processing identical to the PCA of the entire TIC data set. PCA of the leaf TICs resulted in a 6-component model that explained 83.88% of total variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 3.96 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> and 5.65 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>, respectively). Plotting the scores for PC1 (46.5% variance) vs PC2 (14.15% variance) showed partial grouping with the rosemary plant samples from the treatment with composted pig slurry digestate samples (PH and PL), generally having negative scores in contrast to samples from the control and InOrg treatments, which generally had positive scores on PC1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>). The samples treated with composted cattle manure separated along PC axis 1 with the high dose group generally having negative scores, and the low dose group positive scores along PC1. These results showed treatment with pig slurry digestate compost had a consistently major effect on leaf composition, compared to the control treatments, and also that there was an effect of the dose in the treatment with composted cattle manure digestate, with the low dose samples grouping with the control and the inorganic treatments.
