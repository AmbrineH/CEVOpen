<p id="Par30" class="p">However, PCA of the stems sample data showed less evidence of treatment effect. A 5-component PCA model explained 90.39% of total variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 4.29 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> and 8.81 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> respectively). The scores plot for PC1 (63.81% variance) vs PC2 (10.78% variance) failed to separate the samples into groups according to treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C</xref>) and both axes largely explained within group variation. Attempts to improve stem sample score grouping by sample removal or alternative data pre-treatment steps e.g. external parameter orthogonalisation (EPO) to diminish within group variance, failed to improve clustering of the stem samples by experimental treatment (data not shown). Loadings plots for PC1 for both stem and leaf TIC data are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B,D</xref>, and are highly complex.
