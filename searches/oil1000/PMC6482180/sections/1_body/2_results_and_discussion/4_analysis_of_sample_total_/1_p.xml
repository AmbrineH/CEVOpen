<p id="Par28" class="p">Visual analysis of the mean total ion chromatograms (TIC) of MOX-TMS derivatised ethanolic extracts of the leaf and stem samples (n = 54) showed many of the major metabolite peaks were common to samples from both tissues, and substantive differences between them were not apparent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4A,B</xref>). PCA of these data, using a pre-processing regime of Log10 transformation (to scale for the great differences observed in peak height), automatic Whittaker filter baseline correction, normalisation to unit area (1-norm), and mean centring; and cross validation by venetian blinds protocol (7 data splits), revealed difference between sample type to be a major source of variance along PC axis 2, and the loadings for this model were highly complex (Fig.
