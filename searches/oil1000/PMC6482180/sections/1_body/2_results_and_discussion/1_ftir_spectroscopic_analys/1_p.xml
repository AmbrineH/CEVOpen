 </sup>. A preliminary analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra (n = 54, see Supplementary Material Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1A</xref>) from the leaf and stem samples by principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out after pre-processing of the spectra by multiplicative scatter correction, smoothing (1st order polynomial with a 15 point window) and mean centring. Model over-fitting was minimised by using a venetian blind cross validation protocol (20 PCs with 6 data splits) to indicate the optimal number of components to include in the model. Cross validation indicated a 3-component model that explained 97.43% of variance best fitted the data (root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and correlation (RMSEC) of 0.00134 and 0.00107 respectively). This preliminary model of the leaf and stem samples showed clear separation of the samples by tissue type along principal component axis 1 (86.13% variance, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1B</xref>), which can be attributed to the different composition associated to the type of plant tissue. The higher scores of the stem sample spectra were due primarily to larger absorbance at 1032 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, possibly indicating discriminatingly greater cellulose content in the stem samples, whilst the leaf samples had higher absorbance at 2924, 2851, 1680, 1541, 1441, 1391, 1281 and 1177 cm
