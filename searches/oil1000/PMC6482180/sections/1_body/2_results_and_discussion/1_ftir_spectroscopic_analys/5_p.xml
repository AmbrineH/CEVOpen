<p id="Par23" class="p">The mid-IR spectra of the stem samples (n = 18) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>. PCA using identical pre-processing and cross validation parameters to those used for the leaf model, PCA resulted in a 4 component model (RMSEC = 0.00058, RMSECV = 0.00107) that explained 92.14% of the experimental variance. Plotting the scores of the first component (67.52% variance) against the second (12.45% variance) allowed partial separation of sample scores according to experimental treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>), although separation was less well resolved compared to the PCA model of the leaf samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). Strong outlier samples were not detected along either principal component axes. The loadings for PC1 appear to be a combination of the PC1 and PC2 loadings from the leaf sample PCA model, with positive loadings for PC1 at 2922, 2849, 1626, 1549, 1383 and 1182 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and negative loadings at 3327 and 1030 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>). Loadings for PC2 were more complex (positive loading peaks at 3292, 2926, 2866, 1728, 1666, 1383, and 990 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, negative loading peaks at 2145, 1585, 1501, 1256 and 1057 cm

Generally, the stem samples of rosemary plants grown in the compost-derived treatment with high dose samples had more positive scores in PC1 than the low dose samples, and the non-organic fertiliser treated samples (control and InOrg) had negative scores along PC axis 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). This result also indicates that the control and inorganic treatments had similar effects on rosemary stem sample chemical composition, and quite different from the effect observed by PCA, of treatment with organic amendments for rosemary leaves. These results are in concordance with those of Cala
