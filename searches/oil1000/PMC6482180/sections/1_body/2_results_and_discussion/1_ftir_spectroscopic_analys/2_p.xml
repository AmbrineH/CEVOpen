<p id="Par20" class="p">Further PCA exploration was made after separation of the spectra into tissue specific data sets to better explore the variance within samples from each tissue. A 2-component PCA model of the 36 leaf sample spectra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>), (RMSECV and RMSEC of 0.00125 and 0.00101 respectively) explained 93.1% of the variance, with the sample scores showing some grouping according to experimental treatment along the second principal component axis (31.83% of variance). In contrast, PC1 (61.27% variance) largely explained within group variation, particularly for the control sample group of which 2 samples were obvious outliers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). The loadings underlying PC axis 2 are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>. The major loadings of this component lie predominantly in the finger print region, with peaks at 1620 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1539 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (greater contributions in both high dose composts, and the low dosage pig compost) and 993 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (greater contributions in both low dosage cow compost, and both control groups) suggesting separation between groups may be occurring on the basis of differing concentrations of possibly cellulose and lignin.
