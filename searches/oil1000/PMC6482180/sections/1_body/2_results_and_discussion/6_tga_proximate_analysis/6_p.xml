A smaller increase in Tmax (~2 °C) was detected as significant for the pig manure treated samples whilst the effect of cow manure application on Tmax was not detected as significant compared to the control treatment. A similar increase in temperature was detected for the minor thermal decomposition event at approximately 289 °C, which most likely corresponds to hemicellulose decomposition

 </sup>. Treatment with inorganic fertiliser increased the peak temperature of this event (Tmax 289 °C) by nearly 2 °C. Furthermore, samples from pig manure treated plants were increased by approximately 4 °C higher compared with control. In contrast, the samples treated with cattle manure were not detected as being different from the control samples.
