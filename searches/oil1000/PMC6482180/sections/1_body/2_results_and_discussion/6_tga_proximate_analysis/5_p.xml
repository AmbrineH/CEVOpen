 </sup>, was increased significantly by application of inorganic fertiliser or manure relative to the control samples, with pig manure at high dose having the greatest effect. Treatment with inorganic fertiliser or manure generally reduced fixed carbon content significantly. On the other hand, the volatile fraction generally increased after application of fertilizer but it is difficult to conclude from these data whether there are substantial differences in volatile content as a result of fertilizer treatment.
