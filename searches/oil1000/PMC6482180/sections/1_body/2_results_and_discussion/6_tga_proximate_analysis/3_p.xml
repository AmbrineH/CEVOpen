<p id="Par39" class="p">The mass loss event due to loss of moisture from the samples detected at approximately 110 °C was very similar for samples of both tissue types indicating both types of sample had dried comparably. After correcting the mass loss data for moisture content (DM), analysis of variance (Anova) detected significant differences between leaf and stem sample means for volatile content (DM Vol; means of 79.68% and 74.16% for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 0.227); content of fixed carbon (DM FC, means of 13.36% and 20.55% for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 0.145); ash content (DM Ash, means of 6.96% and 5.28% for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 0.184); and Tmax (means of 346 °C and 355 °C for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 11.80). Significant differences were also detected by ANOVA between means of volatile and fixed carbon content of leaf and stem samples after correcting the data for ash content (DMAF Vol; means of 85.64% and 78.30% for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 0.183) and DMAF FC (means of 14.36% and 21.70% for leaf and stem samples respectively; P &lt; 0.001; s.e.d. 0.183).</p>
