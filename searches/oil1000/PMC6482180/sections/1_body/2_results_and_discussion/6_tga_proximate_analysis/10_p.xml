<p id="Par46" class="p">PCA of just the leaf sample TGA data after autoscaling and using venetian blinds cross validation resulted in 4 component model that explained 86.39% of variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.006 and 0.001 respectively) and a scores plot of PC1 against PC2 (42.21% and 24.33% of variance respectively) showed that, with one exception, the samples from both pig manure treatments have in higher scores along principal component axis 1 compared with those from the cattle manure treatments. The InOrg samples also had to the main higher scores along this axis compared with the control samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5C</xref>). These positive scores correlated with differences primarily at 364 °C and to a lesser effect at 454 °C and 512 °C, whilst negative scores along this axis corresponded with differences at 236 °C, 271 °C and 336 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5D</xref>). Principal component axis 2 largely served to separate InOrg and control from manure treatment samples, with positive scores being associated with variance at 298 °C and 353 °C, and negative scores, which were predominantly shown by both control groups, with variance at 227 °C, 429 °C and 445 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5D</xref>). Modelling just the stem TGA data by PCA using identical pre-processing and cross validation protocols resulted in a 1 component model that explained 78.73% of variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). Analysis of the sample scores for the stem samples showed very little grouping by experimental treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5E</xref>) with the difference in variance occurring at 372 °C (positive) and 347 °C (negative), see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5F</xref>. These results suggest changes in plant thermal stability, which may have implications for crop processing are dependent on cultivation practice, and which need further investigation.
