<p id="Par38" class="p">Proximate analysis of the samples revealed differences in thermal decomposition between the two tissues in the region corresponding to loss of volatiles. The rate of mass loss for the leaf samples was less than that observed for the stem samples, although ultimately more mass was lost from the leaf samples during analysis, indicating greater volatile content in the leaf samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref>). Differential plots of these data (DTG curves) showed the leaf samples had a more complex thermal decomposition compared to the stem samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5B</xref>), probably due to the presence of a greater amounts of thermally labile metabolites and storage polymers. Whilst the leaf and stem samples displayed maximal mass loss (Tmax) at very similar temperatures (355 °C and 346 °C for stem and leaf samples respectively), the leaf samples showed additional mass loss events at 289 °C and 435 °C that were less evident in derivative plots of the stem samples. These differences imply a direct impact on thermal decomposition characteristics by the specific distribution of organic and inorganic constituents among plant parts and agree with the findings of Damartzis
