<p id="Par43" class="p">The observed differences in maximum temperature of mass loss can be associated to differences in the composition between leaves from plants grown in the six treated soils. Increased Tmax at 289 °C and 346 °C may be due to lower hemicellulose and cellulose content, which caused them to react more slowly

 </sup>. Another explanation could be that the hemicellulose and cellulose in these samples displayed greater thermal stability

 </sup> perhaps due to changes in hemicellulose branching, cellulose packing or crystallinity, or the presence of increased amounts of storage or structural proteins.
