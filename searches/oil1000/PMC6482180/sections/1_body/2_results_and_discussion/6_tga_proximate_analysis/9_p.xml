<p id="Par45" class="p">PCA of the leaf and stem TGA data with venetian blinds cross validation and data autoscaling gave a 3 component model that explained 95.91% of variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.2003 and 0.5176 respectively) and allowed complete separation of the leaf and stem sample scores along PC 1 and PC2 component axes (76.57% and 14.07% variance respectively). The separation of the two tissue types by this model (not shown) was associated with scores on PC axis 1 correlating to the region extending between 354 °C and 445 °C where the two tissues displayed differential mass loss. Modelling of the data after differentiation (
 <italic class="italic">da/dt</italic>) also indicated that the temperatures associated with peak thermal decomposition were important discriminators between leaf and stem samples. PCA gave a 4 component model that explained 83.43% of variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.4015 and 0.7578 respectively) and a scores plot for PC 1 and PC2 component axes (57.82% and 11.51% variance respectively) allowed complete separation of the leaf and stem sample scores (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>). In this case, leaf samples were associated with positive scores and stem with negative scores along PC axis 1, which displayed discriminatory negative loadings at 2 broad peaks. The first of these was a doublet at 302–384 °C, corresponding with the thermal transitions detected at 289 °C and 346 °C, and in addition the stem samples were associated with a second broad peak between 573–664 °C which had not been detected as discriminatory in the model of the undifferentiated TGA data (Fig.
