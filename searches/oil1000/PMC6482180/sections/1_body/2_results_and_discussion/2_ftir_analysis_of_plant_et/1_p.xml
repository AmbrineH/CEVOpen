<p id="Par24" class="p">Preliminary analysis of the mid IR transmission spectra (n = 54) of soluble metabolites, collected from the ethanolic extracts from the leaf and stem samples dried onto silica plate, showed one of the stem samples to be unusual, probably a consequence of sample preparation, and this sample was removed from the spectral data set (data not shown). PCA modelling of the remaining 53 spectra (data not shown) using pre-processing and cross validation protocols identical to those described earlier for analysis of the ground samples resulted in a 4 component model that explained 96.17% of variance (RMSECV and RMSEC of 0.00447 and respectively 0.00297), which did not allow separation of the spectra according to tissue. PCA using a restricted data set extending from 1122–1598 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> gave a 3-component model and explained 94.17% variance in the data (RMSECV and RMSEC of 0.00555 and 0.00377 respectively). However, this model again did not indicate strong grouping according to experimental treatment (data not show).
