<p id="Par26" class="p">The grouping of the samples into treatment groups by PCA of spectra data from both ground and ethanol extracted samples indicate a stronger effect of treatment by both type and application rate (in the treatment with composted pig slurry digestate), and a clear differentiation between organic and inorganic fertilising treatments. Some authors have reported that the sensitivity of ATR-FTIR to detect differences in sample chemistry is lower when is used directly on plant tissues, as compared with analysis of sample extracts, or indeed when compared with chromatographic analytical methods such as HPLC and/or GC/MS

 </sup>. Our results indicate that both approaches have merit and indeed allow analysis of different aspects of sample chemistry.
