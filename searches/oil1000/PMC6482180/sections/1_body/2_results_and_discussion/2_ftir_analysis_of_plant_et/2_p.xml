<p id="Par25" class="p">PCA models were developed separately on stem (n = 17) and leaf spectral data sets (n = 36). A 4-component PCA model explained 95.86% of sample variance in the leaf sample spectra (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.002027 and 0.003175 respectively, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), whilst a 6-component model explained 99.51% of variance in the stem sample data (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.0012 and 0.0047 respectively, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). In both models samples separated only partially according to treatment along PC1 (74.77% and 87.72% of variance in the leaf and stem samples respectively), and in both models treatment with high rate of pig slurry digestate compost (PH) resulted in samples having more positive scores on PC1 compared with treatment of the same compost at low dose (PL), or treatment with either composted cattle manure digestate (CH and CL). In contrast, the InOrg and control samples had negative scores on Principal Component axis 1 (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3B</xref>), and furthermore, the loading for PC1 were highly similar for both models (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3C</xref>), and also to the loading observed for the PCA model of the entire spectral data. It would therefore appear that in broad terms, there is considerable similarity between the ethanol extractable metabolome from stems and leaves with these samples.
