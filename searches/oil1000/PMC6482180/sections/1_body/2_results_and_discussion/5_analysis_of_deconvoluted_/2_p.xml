<p id="Par32" class="p">Batch processing of the chromatographic/mass spectral data for the stem and leaf samples (n = 54) in AMDIS using the rosemary target library resulted in a compound table for each sample, with the concentration of each library metabolite detected in the sample being expressed as a percentage of the normalised total ion current. The compounds identified in the sample TICs represented more than half of the ion current (mean area = 51.68%, standard deviation (SD) = 5.37%) with the remaining current being a mix of baseline noise and metabolites present in the samples at very low concentrations. The individual compounds ranged in mean abundance from 7.08% of total ion current (a methoxytrimethylsilanamine derivitisation artefact with a retention time (RT) of 3.46 min) to 0.007% for trace amounts of a compound tentatively identified as sulphuric acid at 5.39 min.</p>
