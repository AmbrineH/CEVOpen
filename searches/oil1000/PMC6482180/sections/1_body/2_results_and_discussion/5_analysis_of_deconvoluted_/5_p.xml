<p id="Par35" class="p">PCA of the leaf sample metabolite data using identical pre-processing and cross validation protocols resulted in a 2-component model explaining 39.91% variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.1573 and 0.2765 respectively). Leaf samples treated with composted pig slurry digestate at both high and low dosage had negative scores in PC1 (24.33% variance) correlating with high levels of metabolites tentatively identified as glucose, glycerol, cellobiose, maltose, malic acid and 2-oxoglutaric acid (metabolite IDs of 77, 160, 148, 73 and 30 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The remaining leaf sample groups had positive scores along this axis correlating with metabolites tentatively identified as saccharic acid, sucrose, maltose, O-Glycerol-beta-D-galactopyranoside and 1-trans-caffeoylquinic acid (metabolite IDs of 132, 37, 121, 33 and 68 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The scores of the leaf samples along PC2 (15.58% variance) also correlated with treatment group. The scores of the leaf samples from the high dose of both compost had negative values on component axis 2 compared with leaf samples corresponding to treatment with low dose of composted cattle manure digestate or the control, which were relatively neutral in PC2, inferring greater amounts of xylobiose, hydrocaffeic acid, galactose, 1-methyl galactopyranoside and an unknown mass tag (metabolite IDs of 147, 145, 21, 40 and 80 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In contrast, the leaf sample groups from the low dose pig slurry compost (PL) and with the inorganic (InOrg) treatment had positive scores in PC2 correlating with relatively greater concentrations of 2-oxoglutaric acid, saccharic acid, maltose, glucose and 2-O-Glycerol-beta-D-galactopyranoside (metabolite IDs of 139, 132, 121, 77 and 33 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>).
