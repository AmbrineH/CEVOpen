<p id="Par31" class="p">Given the complexity of the TIC data and loading resulting from PCA it was decided to re-analyse the data at the level of individual chemical components to investigate if by this approach it would be possible to detect changes in sample chemistry that correlated with fertiliser treatment. The GC/MS TIC data were deconvoluted using AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectrometry Deconvolution and Identification System, NIST). This process amounts to an algorithmic separation of co-eluting components by identification of co-eluting masses and allows a clean, if not pure mass spectrum to be obtained for components in a complex mixture

 </sup>. Deconvolution greatly facilitates the accuracy of subsequent mass spectral library matching, and has the additional benefit of reducing data dimensionality by converting the many data points of the original TIC data into chemically more meaningful variables

 </sup>. A rosemary mass spectral target compound library was constructed in AMDIS that represented the chemistry of the leaf and stem samples. The library was obtained by deconvolution and subsequent library matching of GC/MS data from 3 randomly selected leaf and 3 stem samples, using settings of low sensitivity, and medium resolution and peak shape requirement

 </sup>. The resulting library contained spectra of 160 deconvoluted chromatographic peaks, which were identified tentatively by library match and visual comparison using MS Search 2.0 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The majority of the peaks identified in the TICs were either known soluble plant metabolites or unknown mass tags that had been reported in the literature previously. Some peaks were recognised as derivitisation artefacts; these were not excluded from the library as it was important to test for differences in derivitisation efficiency between the sample groups.
