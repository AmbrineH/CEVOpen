<p id="Par34" class="p">PCA modelling of the leaf and stem metabolite data sets independently with a pre-processing protocol involving log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> transformation, general least squares (GLS) weighting (weighted to treatment class, alpha = 1.00) to help reduce within class variance, followed by mean centring allowed better sample grouping to experimental treatment. PCA of the stem sample data resulted in a 2-component model that explained 52.81% of the variance in the data (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.1412 and 0.3690 respectively). A scores plot of PC1 vs PC2 resolved completely the samples according to experimental treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>). The relatively low amount of variance explained by PC1 is due to the GLS filtering algorithm by which variance associated with within group variance is excluded from the model. The stem samples treated with composted pig slurry digestate (PH and PL) and samples treated with the high rate of composted cattle manure digestate (CH) had positive scores along PC axis 1 (32.04% variance), correlating with high levels of compounds tentatively identified as quinic acid, D-glucopyranoside or D fructofuranosyl, sorbitol and two unknown mass tags (metabolite IDs 112, 1, 58, 110 and 92 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In contrast, the stem samples corresponding to the low dose of cattle manure digestate compost (CL) and more so, samples from the control and inorganic treatments had negative scores on this axis, correlating with levels of sucrose, salicylic acid, xylose, threonic acid and an unknown mass tag (metabolites IDs of 37, 135, 70, 36 and 101 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Furthermore, the low dose of composted pig slurry digestate (PL) treated stem samples and the control stem samples had positive scores along PC axis 2 (20.77% variance), correlating with higher concentrations of metabolites tentatively identified as sucrose, D-glucopyranoside or D-fructofuranosyl, quinic acid, maltose and sorbitol (metabolite IDs of 37, 1, 112, 73 and 58 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), whilst the other stem sample groups had negative scores in PC2 correlating with greater concentrations of galactinol, sucrose, glucose, anhydroglucose and an unknown mass tag (metabolite IDs of 23, 120, 118, 48 and 104 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>).
