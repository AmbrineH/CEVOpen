<p id="Par33" class="p">PCA of these data following log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> transformation and mean centring resulted in a 2 component model that explained 44.65% of data variance (RMSEC and RMSECV of 0.3624 and 0.4060 respectively). PCA cross-validation was made using a venetian blinds protocol with 10 data splits. A bar chart of the metabolite abundancy data used for modelling is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5A</xref>, and there are obvious similarities with the mean TIC data plot shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4A,B</xref> as the compounds in the rosemary library correspond with the main peaks present in the TIC data. Scores on PC1 (26.17% variance) clearly resolved the leaf and stem samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5B</xref>) but some grouping according to experimental treatment was evident along PC axis 2, which explained 18.49% of variance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5C</xref>). Removing variables corresponding to likely derivitisation artefacts or to unknown mass tags failed to improve model fit (RMSEC and RMMSECV of 0.3716 and 0.4169 respectively) or grouping according to experimental treatment (data not shown). Analysis of the loading for PC1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5D</xref>) suggested that metabolites tentatively identified as ribose, glucose, salicylic acid glucoside, glutaric acid and galactinol (metabolite IDs of 10, 77, 27, 139 and 23 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) were greater in the leaf samples whilst levels of sucrose, coniferyl alcohol, 4-trans-caffeoylquinic acid, trimethyl-silanol phosphate, and an unknown mass tag MST 3814.8 correlated with the stem samples (metabolite IDs of 37, 59, 67, 157 and 111 respectively in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>).
