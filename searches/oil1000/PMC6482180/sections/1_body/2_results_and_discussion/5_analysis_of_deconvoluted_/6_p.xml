<p id="Par36" class="p">In summary, the concentrations of sucrose, glucose and maltose and other metabolites in the rosemary samples displayed highly complex relationships to fertiliser treatment, with no clear pattern being discernable. A similar observation was reported by Fernie and Urbanczyk-Wochniak

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>, in a study of tobacco plants under different nitrogen regimes. In this case, levels of fructose, galactose, raffinose and sucrose were not clearly related to nitrate nutrition. Furthermore, the changes in carbohydrate abundance depending on the N availability (saturation or deficiency) seemed to be tissue-specific and dependent on the carbohydrate species, since the behaviour observed was different for each carbohydrate. This fact was also reported in the leaves and roots of tomato under plants grown under nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium-deficient condition

 </sup>. The concentration of other types of compounds, phenolic compounds (eg caffeoylquinic acid, galactopyranoside, hydrocaffeic acid) also presented different responses to the different soil treatments and that might be partly due to the various nitrogen contents of these composted digestates. At this regard, Neugart 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2018) have recently concluded that nitrogen might not be the only factor influencing the leaf concentration of monoacylated kaempferol glycoside in plants grown on soils amended with three different composts. Several studies, for example, have reported 2-oxoglutaric acid (synonyms Î±-ketoglutarate, 2-ketoglutaric acid, or 2-oxoglutarate) to have an important role as a key regulator at the intersection between the carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup> observed large decreases in 2-oxoglutaric acid in tobacco plants grown on limited nitrogen supply. On the other hand, Sung 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2015) related the low levels of 2-oxoglutaric acid found in leaves of tomato plants to P deficiency. In our experiment, higher levels of this metabolite appeared associated to the low dose of composted pig slurry digestate and the inorganic treatment, which can be ascribable to the higher availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in these treatments, especially in the inorganic treatment. 2-oxoglutaric acid and glutamate are key regulators of amino acid biosynthesis

 </sup>, and our observation of increased concentrations of 2-oxoglutaric acid on high-nitrogen treatments is in agreement with other studies that reported this component to be increased, together with a wide group of amino acids, under conditions of nitrogen saturation
