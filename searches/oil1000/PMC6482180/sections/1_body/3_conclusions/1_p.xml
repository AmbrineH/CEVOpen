<p id="Par47" class="p">The results obtained with FTIR and GC/MS revealed a clear differentiation between organic and inorganic fertilising treatments on the metabolite content of rosemary plants (
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), and these differences are tissue dependant. GC/MS has shown that the leaves of the rosemary plants of the treatment with the compost derived from pig slurry digestate (P) differed in metabolite composition compared to the rest of treatments. In addition, a clear effect of the dose in the treatment with composted cattle manure digestate was observed, with the low dose being more similar in effect to the control and the inorganic treatments. Changes in metabolite composition are most likely brought about by N availability, and whilst the differences detected were tissue and metabolite specific, no clear trends relating concentration and fertiliser regime were apparent. Higher concentrations of 2-oxoglutaric acid were associated with the low dose of composted pig slurry digestate and the inorganic treatment, probably due to the higher availability of nitrogen in these treatments, especially in the inorganic treatment. Proximate analysis of the leaf and stem samples revealed differences between the two tissues in the thermal decomposition of the volatile fraction. Moreover, TGA data from the leaf showed that fixed carbon was decreased in samples treated with either inorganic fertiliser or composted pig slurry digestate). Lastly, differences in volatile fraction thermal stability were detected between leaf samples treated with either inorganic or composted pig slurry digestate compared with control and composted cattle manure digestate treated leaves.
