 <p> ( A, B) Show the scores and loadings plots for PCA models based on TICs of MOX-TMS derivatised ethanolic extracts of ground rosemary leaf samples after analysis by GCMS whilst ( C, D) show the scores and loadings plots for a PCA model based on the stem data ( A, C - red diamonds = CH; green square = CL; dark blue triangle PH; light blue inverted triangle = PL; pink star = control; yellow circle = InOrg; dotted line = 95% confidence level; ( C, D) - loading plot for PC1 = blue line and PC2 = brown line). CH: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 60 t/ha; CL: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 30 t/ha; PH: compost from anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 60t/ha; PL: compost derived anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 30t/ha; InOrg: inorganic fertiliser. </p>
