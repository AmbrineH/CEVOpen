 <p> ( A, B) Show the scores plot for PCA models based on extracted metabolite abundances in the stem samples respectively. Data were log 10 transformed, GLS weighted according to experimental class and mean centred (red diamonds = CH; green square = CL; dark blue triangle PH; light blue inverted triangle = PL; pink star = control; yellow circle = InOrg; dotted line = 95% confidence level). CH: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 60 t/ha; CL: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 30 t/ha; PH: compost from anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 60t/ha; PL: compost derived anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 30t/ha; InOrg: inorganic fertiliser. </p>
