 <p> Mean percentage mass loss ( A) or derivative mass loss ( B) plotted against temperature during thermogravimetric analysis of leaf (red) and stem samples (green) respectively. ( C) PCA scores plot of leaf TGA data (red diamonds = CH; green square = CL; dark blue triangle PH; light blue inverted triangle = PL; pink star = control; yellow circle = InOrg; dotted line = 95% confidence level). ( D) Leaf sample PCA loadings for PC1 (blue) and PC2 (brown). ( E) PCA scores plot of stem TGA data (red diamonds = CH; green square = CL; dark blue triangle PH; light blue inverted triangle = PL; pink star = control; yellow circle = InOrg; dotted line = 95% confidence level). ( F) Stem sample PCA loadings for PC1 (blue) and PC2 (brown). CH: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 60 t/ha; CL: compost from anaerobic digested cattle slurry at dose 30 t/ha; PH: compost from anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 60t/ha; PL: compost derived anaerobic digested pig slurry at dose 30t/ha; InOrg: inorganic fertiliser. </p>
