<p id="Par3" class="p">BS are further categorized based upon their molecular structure e.g., glycolipids, lipopeptides, phospholipids, lipoprotein, fatty acids and polymeric BS. They also have a range of different properties such as, surface tension reduction, emulsification, foaming and wetting (Banat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>; Marchant and Banat 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2012a</xref>). With over 5.73 million tonnes of oil spills in the oceans worldwide between 1970 and 2016 (ITOPF 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>), there is an urgent demand for novel bioactive compounds for bioremediation. BS naturally play a major role in bioremediation following oil spills and act as efficient dispersing agents facilitating microbial biodegradation (De Almeida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>; Franzetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2010</xref>). Despite their versatile properties, a higher production cost compared to chemical surfactants and the pathogenicity of some BS producing strains, remain a major obstacles for their large-scale production (Irorere et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2018</xref>) and the search for non-pathogenic strains remain an important research area (Elshikh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2017</xref>; Funston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, an important question to address before they can achieve widespread application is “can we develop a cost-effective and ecologically benign process for BS production?”
