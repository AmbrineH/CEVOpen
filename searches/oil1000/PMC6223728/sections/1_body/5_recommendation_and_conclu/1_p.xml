<p id="Par32" class="p">Due to their interesting biological properties, BS from extremophiles have great potentials with a broad range of applications for industrial and consumer products. Considering their properties such as, emulsifiers, thickeners, anti-oxidants, extreme tolerance to pH or temperature as well as antifungal and antimicrobial activities we look forward to potentially new products with marine-derived BS as their surface-active ingredients. Although highly desirable they also have their disadvantages such as the production of relatively low yield of BS and high production costs. In some studies, either the product yield is very low or have not been quantified. Additionally, in some studies, the taxonomic identification of strains has not been carried out using reliable methods. As suggested by Irorere et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>) criteria should be followed before claims for a BS producing strain and the identity of the product are made. In comparison to BS produced from mesophilic microorganisms, not much work has been done on marine BS. Fermentation optimisation by varying physiochemical factors including, temperature, pH, aeration and agitation speed and nitrogen would be beneficial to increase the product yield. In order to develop robust BS producing strains it is important to identify the genes involved in SACs biosynthesis and to investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in BS synthesis by targeting those regulatory genes.
