<p id="Par34" class="p">The final point we can take from data in the tables is the lack of consistency and reliability of the methods used to identify the products. In some instances, no real attempts have been made to specifically identify the products and in others general analytical methods have been used which only provide indicative information concerning the structures. In many of the applications under considered for BS, particularly by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, specific knowledge of the compounds being produced is imperative. In many cases microbial BS are typically a mixture of different congeners and where bioactivity is being investigated it is critical that pure samples of individual congeners are used in order to be able to assign a specific bioactivity to a molecule. Mixtures of different molecules may have competing activities which may cancel each other out.</p>
