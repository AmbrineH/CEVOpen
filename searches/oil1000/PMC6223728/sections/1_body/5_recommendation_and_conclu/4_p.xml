<p id="Par35" class="p">Some studies have been done on potential rhamnolipid producing strains including 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia</italic> species to enhance rhamnolipid production. One such approach is cloning the rhamnolipid biosynthesis genes 
 <italic class="italic">rhlA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rhlB</italic> into non-rhamnolipid producing strains, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 
 <italic class="italic">Î”rhlA</italic>. However, the BS yield from the recombinant strains was too low in comparison to the wild type strains (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2007</xref>). Another approach to increase the BS yield is to silence the genes competing with the BS production pathway. For example, Funston et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2017</xref>) knocked-out the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) pathway synthesis genes for enhanced rhamnolipid production. The halophile 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> species are ubiquitous in marine environments and produces BE which effectively emulsifies hydrocarbons and other petroleum contaminants. These species are known BS producers as well as PHA producers. However, the effect of PHA deficient mutation on the yield of its SACs is not known. It might be interesting to follow a similar strategy in 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> species to reduce the carbon flux towards other metabolic pathways and increase the BS production.
