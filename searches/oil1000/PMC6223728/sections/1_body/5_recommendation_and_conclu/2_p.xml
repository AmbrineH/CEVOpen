<p id="Par33" class="p">Close examination of the information presented in TablesÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> reveals the deficiencies in the data currently available from the published literature. Although many of the organisms have been reliably identified using 16S rRNA sequence data, other identifications have relied on morphological, physiological and biochemical tests. This lack of specific taxonomic data makes extrapolations from one study to another significantly more difficult. The other glaring lack of information concerns the yield of BS produced either as a crude yield or as a purified material. As we have already pointed out one important issue dictating whether BS will become a common constituent of consumer products or will be used in bulk bioremediations is cost. We can see from the few yield figures given that in general they are exceptionally low, of the order of mg/l, rather than g/l. In the case of one microbial biosurfactant that has reached industrial use, the sophorolipid from 
 <italic class="italic">Starmerella bombicola</italic>, yields are of the order of hundreds of g/l. Until the production from marine organisms can be increased, either through the manipulation of the growth conditions or through genetic manipulation, there is little prospect of major commercial interest.
