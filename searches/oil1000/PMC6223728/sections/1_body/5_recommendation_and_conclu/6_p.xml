<p id="Par37" class="p">Marine-derived BS effectively emulsify hydrocarbons therefore, are suitable for marine-based bioremediation. The improved biodegradation levels obtained with marine-derived BS indicate that they represent the most efficient accelerators for hydrocarbon biodegradation through increasing the bioavailability of oil. Use of extremophiles such as,

 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter</italic> which effectively produce BS and participate in marine bioremediation should be preferred over mesophilic microorganisms for remediation of oil spills. Psychrophilic bacteria are capable of degrading crude oil efficiently at low temperatures. Therefore, BS produced from psychrophilic bacteria are suitable for bioremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated sites in cold environments. For bioremediation purposes, the impurities within the BS mixture act as a co-substrate and enhance the degradation of pollutants (Mata-Sandoval et al.
