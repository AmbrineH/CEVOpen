<p id="Par36" class="p">The chemical composition and toxicity must be known before commercialisation of the SACs. The developed techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) can be used to analyse BS congeners (Rudden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2015</xref>). The analysis and purification of a particular BS fraction displaying bioactivity is a prerequisite for subsequent biomedical applications. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) has recently been used to fractionate and purify glycolipid and lipopeptide compounds (Sivapathasekaran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2009</xref>). The separation and purification of BS can enhance the level of bioactivity of BS isoforms. The antimicrobial activity of the lipopeptide was reported to increase further after purification (Mukherjee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2009</xref>). While, the toxicity of BS can be tested in eukaryotic models such as, 
 <italic class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia</italic> sp. The toxicity of the BS producing strain can be tested in the 
 <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> model. The Galleria model was used to test the pathogenicity in rhamnolipid BS producing strains and it was found that 
 <italic class="italic">B. thailandensis</italic> was significantly less pathogenic than 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (Irorere et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2018</xref>) and that a marine Pseudomonad was also non-pathogenic (Twigg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2018</xref>).
