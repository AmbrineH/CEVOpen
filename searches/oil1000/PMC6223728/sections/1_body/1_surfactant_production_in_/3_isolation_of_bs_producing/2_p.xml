<p id="Par7" class="p">The populations of marine bacteria can be increased by the addition of inorganic nutrients which allows them to use hydrocarbons as a carbon and energy source. 
 <italic class="italic">A. borkumensis</italic> is found in low numbers in unpolluted environments but becomes the dominant microbe in hydrocarbon polluted ocean and coastal waters. The growth and multiplication of 
 <italic class="italic">Alcanivorax</italic> in oil treated sea water increased up to 91% within 1–2 weeks of nutrient supplementation (Syutsubo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2001</xref>). It was observed that addition of inorganic nutrients improved the dynamics of the bacterial community (Roling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2002</xref>). Providing suitable conditions for the hydrocarbon utilization can be an efficient method to achieve growth and multiplication of these organisms. In microcosm and field biodegradation experiments, bacteria with 16S rRNA sequences related to 
 <italic class="italic">A. borkumensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> increased when supplemented with oil and inorganic nutrients (Roling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2004</xref>).
