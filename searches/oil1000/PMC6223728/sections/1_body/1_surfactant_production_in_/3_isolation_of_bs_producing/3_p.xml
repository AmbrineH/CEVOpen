 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2002</xref>), metagenomic-based approaches can be applied for the discovery of novel marine microbial derived BS (Kennedy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2011</xref>). Metagenomic analyses involve both sequence-based and function-based strategies. Function-based strategies are used to screen metagenomics libraries constructed from marine ecosystems which typically involves using

Sequence-based analyses, involves the identification of genes based upon homology with well characterized genes that are found in sequence databases (e.g., BLAST, MEGAN, KEGG). However, the major bottleneck for identifying genes from metagenomic sources is the identification of coding regions that do not have homology in the sequence databases. Additionally, the metagenomic approach requires a deeper knowledge of the diversity of BS molecules produced and the underlying genetic systems than we have at present.
