<p id="Par5" class="p">Some microorganisms specifically produce amphiphilic EPS, particularly BS as a mechanism to increase the bioavailability of hydrophobic substrates such as hydrocarbons, these BS enhance the growth of indigenous bacteria capable of degrading aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. BS produced from marine bacteria can facilitate hydrocarbon dispersion, degradation, emulsification and bioavailability (Das et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2010</xref>; Mapelli and Scoma 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2017</xref>). BS from cold-adapted marine microorganisms or psychrophilic organisms can work efficiently at cold and freezing temperatures, and are therefore suitable in laundry detergent formulations where low temperature washing conditions have become a priority for energy conservation (Perfumo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2018</xref>; Marchant and Banat 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2012b</xref>). The potential uses of BS are further improved by their low-toxicity, meaning they are applicable for large-scale industrial production and subsequent environmental disposal where they can be readily biodegraded (Irorere et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>; Uzoigwe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2015</xref>). Hence marine bacteria offer an excellent opportunity for the discovery of new SAC molecules with distinctive properties. Although highly attractive, the biosynthesis of BS from marine organisms has largely been overlooked. The mechanism of their regulation during synthesis is also not fully understood adding further difficulties to the process for their production. Several approaches are required before the widespread application of marine-derived BS can be achieved: (i) Isolation and identification of novel, non-pathogenic marine BS producing bacteria (ii) Optimization of culture conditions to achieve sufficient yields of BS and (iii) Characterization of genes involved in BS production from marine organisms. These will allow the use of marine strains in large scale BS production processes while improving yield and cost-efficiency of BS production.
