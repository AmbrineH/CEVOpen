<p id="Par9" class="p">The quality and productivity of BS are determined by the bacterial strain and their growth conditions. The optimization of growth conditions is important for the maximum production of BS. The composition and productivity of BS are also influenced by carbon source, pH, temperature, salinity, nitrogen and agitation amongst other factors. Marine microorganisms which require salts for growth are referred to as halophiles. Many marine organisms such as moderate halophiles require 3â€“15% (w/v) NaCl for optimal growth while extreme halophiles grow optimally at 25% (w/v) NaCl (Margesin and Schinner

 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> are known to produce different types of glycolipids and glycoproteins with superior emulsifying activity than commercial emulsifiers. These halophilic bacteria may play a vital role for the production of surfactants and emulsifiers in oil-polluted saline environments. The growth of bacteria is influenced by salt concentration which also affects BS production. The growth of halophilic bacteria at high salt concentration can reduce the contamination risks which can significantly reduce upstream fermentation costs of BS production (Pepi et al.
