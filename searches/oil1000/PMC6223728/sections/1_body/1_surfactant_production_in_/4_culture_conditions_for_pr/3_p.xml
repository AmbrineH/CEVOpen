<p id="Par11" class="p">Nitrogen is vital for microbial growth and BS production. The type and concentration of the nitrogen source plays an essential role in the optimization of BS production (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1999</xref>). Different nitrogen sources could be used for the production of BS including, yeast extract, urea, peptone, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate. Yeast extract was the best nitrogen source for the production of the BS in the marine
