<p id="Par12" class="p">Another important parameter is temperature that greatly influences cell growth and BS production. BS from thermophilic microorganisms are industrially preferred due to their thermostability at temperatures above 40 °C, however BS produced from mesophiles also have high levels of thermo-stability and psychrophilic marine bacteria capable of producing BS have potential applications for bioremediation in cold environments. The hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium,
