 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> species are also known to produce high-molecular weight emulsifiers (Ortega-de la Rosa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2018</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter lwoffii</italic> RAG-1, the genes encoding the biosynthesis of emulsan (a polysaccharide BE) were reported to be clustered within a 27-kbp region termed, wee cluster (Nakar and Gutnick 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2001</xref>). The bioemulsan alasan produced by 
 <italic class="italic">A. radioresistens</italic> is a complex mixture of anionic polysaccharides and protein. The 
 <italic class="italic">alnA</italic> gene which codes for the surface-active protein of alasan was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Significant sequence similarity (21%) between the recombinant emulsifier protein AlnA of 
 <italic class="italic">A. radioresistens</italic> and OmpA of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was seen. However, no emulsifying or hydrocarbon solubilizing activities have been observed with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> OmpA (Toren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2002</xref>). It has also been reported that the marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Alcanivorax borkumensis</italic> synthesizes glycolipids for hydrocarbon degradation (Abraham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1998</xref>; Yakimov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">1998</xref>). The genome sequence of 
 <italic class="italic">A. borkumensis</italic> SK2 revealed its capacity for BS production. The glycosyltransferase (ABO_1783) similar to RhlB from 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and glycosyltransferase protein family 9 (ABO_2215) were found to be potentially involved in BS production. The 
 <italic class="italic">A. borkumensis</italic> SK2 genome encodes other proteins involved in emulsifier production namely, OmpA (ABO_0822), OprG/OmpW (ABO_1922) and OmpH (ABO_1152) (Schneiker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2006</xref>). Similarly, genes involved in BS production were reported in the marine bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic> sp. HZ01. The genome of strain HZ01 harbours OmpH (gene_1336) and OmpA (gene_2469) which are both related to emulsifier production (Hong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2017</xref>). Similar genes involved in biosynthesis of BS were found in the genome of 
 <italic class="italic">Cobetia</italic> sp. MM1IDA2H-1 (Ibacache-Quiroga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2017</xref>). A significant problem in using genetic information from one organism to another is the lack of sequence homology between genes which may lead to the production of similar products. The rhamnolipid production genes in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and 
 <italic class="italic">B. thailandensis</italic> have only about 50% sequence homology (Dubeau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2009</xref>). While in a marine 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> species MCTG214(3b1), unrelated to 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, which produces di-rhamnolipids identical in structure to 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa,</italic> the 
 <italic class="italic">rhlA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rhlB</italic> genes have very high sequence homology while it has so far been impossible to find an 
 <italic class="italic">rhlC</italic> homologue which indicates the presence of second novel rhamnosyltransferase (Twigg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2018</xref>). This suggests that it will be necessary to search for specific domains within the genes rather than whole gene sequences when investigating such capabilities.
