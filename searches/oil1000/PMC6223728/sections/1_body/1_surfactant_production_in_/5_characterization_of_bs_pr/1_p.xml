<p id="Par13" class="p">The identification of possible genes involved during BS synthesis is necessary in order to understand BS synthesis and develop robust BS producing strains with high production capacity. The most well-characterized low-molecular weight BS is rhamnolipid, produced by several species of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonads</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia</italic>. The genes 
 <italic class="italic">rhlA</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">rhlB</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rhlC</italic>, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids have been found in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> as well as non-pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">B. thailandensis</italic>. These three genes are localized within a single gene cluster in 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia</italic> while, the 
 <italic class="italic">rhlC</italic> gene is located at two different, remote position within the 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> genome (Dubeau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2009</xref>; Perfumo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2013</xref>). Recently, homologues to 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> rhamnolipid genes 
 <italic class="italic">rhlA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rhlB</italic> were identified in a non-pathogenic marine 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> species MCTG214(3b1) (Twigg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2018</xref>). Most of the genetic studies of BS production are limited to well-characterised BS molecules, but the expression of genes involved in BS synthesis is not well studied in marine bacteria.
