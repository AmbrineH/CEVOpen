<p id="Par15" class="p">Few reports have been published regarding BS synthesis during hydrocarbon degradation in marine bacteria. It was reported that 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> JP-11 isolated from the marine environment utilized 98.8% ± 2.3% of biphenyl within 72 h from contaminated sites. Although 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> cannot be considered a true marine bacterium, it is a common organism isolated from the marine environment. The production of BS was confirmed by the expression of the rhamnolipid synthesizing genes 
 <italic class="italic">rhlAB</italic> (Chakraborty and Das 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2016</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> species are known to produce BS such as lichenysin, surfactin, fengycin, pumilacidin, iturin and bacillomycin (Vater et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2002</xref>). BS production was seen during anthracene degradation by a marine alkaliphile 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> (MTCC 5514). The strain degraded &gt; 95% of 300 ppm anthracene and showed tolerance up to 500 ppm of anthracene concentration. The gene involved in the BS lichenysin production was 
 <italic class="italic">licA3</italic>, followed by degradation through the catabolic degradative enzyme, catechol 2,3 dioxygenase(C23O) (Swaathy et al.
