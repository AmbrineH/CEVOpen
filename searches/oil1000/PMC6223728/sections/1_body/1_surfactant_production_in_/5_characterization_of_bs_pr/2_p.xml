<p id="Par14" class="p">The genes and regulatory pathways are not necessarily identical in different BS producers. Different species can produce a BS with totally different chemical structure and even small variations in the congener composition of a surfactant can greatly affect its functional property. To fully understand how SAC synthesis is regulated in these marine strains, it is important to characterise the chemical structure and necessary genes required for BS synthesis. The chemical composition of the SAC molecules can be determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS), high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques (Smyth et al.
