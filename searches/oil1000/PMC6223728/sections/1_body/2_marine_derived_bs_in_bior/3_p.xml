<p id="Par19" class="p">Ornithine lipids, another type of BE produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Myroides</italic> sp. SM1 have strong emulsification ability for crude oil and stability in a wide range of temperatures and pH. It was reported to show better surface activity than synthetic detergents and surfactin (Maneerat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2006</xref>). Emulsan, the most powerful emulsion stabilizer produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic> RAG-1 was reported to have potential applications in microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) and cleaning oil spills (Belsky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">1979</xref>; Rosenberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">1979</xref>). Other biosurfactants have also been reported to enhance oil/hydrocarbon bioremediation activity (Banat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2000</xref>; Franzetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2011</xref>) The bioemulsifier produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Alteromonas</italic> sp. 17 (now known as 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter</italic>) could also be used for the efficient degradation of hydrocarbons (Al-Mallah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1990</xref>). In another report, a 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter</italic> species produced a phospholipopeptide class of BS capable of emulsification. The emulsions showed low ecotoxicity and were able to disperse crude oil in artificial marine water suggesting their application for bioremediation purposes (Raddadi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2017</xref>). The glycolipid BS produced from 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus</italic> strain SdK644 showed twofold greater solubilisation of crude oil than tween 80 hence showing potential in marine based bioremediation (Zenati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">2018</xref>). Another emulsifier “Yansan” produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, an aerobic yeast showed high emulsification activity and stability over a pH range of 3–9 and potential applications in the formulation of perfluorocarbon (PFC) based emulsions and degradation of hydrocarbons (Amaral et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2006</xref>). Biosurfactants produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida lipolytica</italic> yeast strain was also used formulating a commercial related product for oil bioremediation (Santos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2017</xref>).
