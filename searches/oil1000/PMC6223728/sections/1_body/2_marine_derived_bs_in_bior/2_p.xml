<p id="Par18" class="p">Marine microorganisms such as 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Myroides</italic> as well as the tropical marine yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> can play an important role in the ultimate removal of hydrocarbon compounds from contaminated sites by the production of BE. Due to their diverse structural and functional property, these BE have potential applications in bioremediation processes (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> sp. participate in the removal of spilled oil by synthesizing surface-active emulsifiers. Glycolipid molecules produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> sp. on their cell surface enhance the solubility of hydrocarbon, and thus increase their bioavailability for degradation. The emulsifying BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> sp. could be used for enhanced oil recovery processes in extreme environments (Dhasayan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>), since the emulsifier produced by this bacterium at low temperature could enhance the bioavailability of hydrocarbons in cold environments (Pepi et al.
