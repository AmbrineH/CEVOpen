<p id="Par17" class="p">The release of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environments due to oil spill and chronic pollution is a serious major concern. Chemical dispersants are effectively utilized worldwide to minimize oil spill damage. Dispersants are mixtures of one or more surfactants and solvents that enhance dispersion of oil into droplets leading to increased mobility and bioavailability of hydrocarbons. The dispersed oils are solubilized in water and degraded by microorganisms. However, chemical dispersants are toxic to aquatic species and replacing them with biological non-toxic alternatives would be very advantageous and highly sought after. Various marine Î³-proteobacteria are known to secrete cell surface amphiphilic substances (BS or BE) that allow the solubilization of aromatic hydrocarbons. During growth on hydrocarbons, microbial cells attach to oil droplets by secreting BS to increase the bioavailability of hydrocarbons. BS production by these bacteria increases dispersion of hydrocarbons thereby enhancing their degradation by non-BS-producing microorganisms (McGenity et al.
