 <italic class="italic">P. fluorescens</italic> BD5 was compared with normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF). PFII induced apoptosis of melanoma skin cancer cells while NHDF were less affected under same conditions. The mechanism of melanoma cell death may be due to increased plasma membrane permeability by BS micelles. The activity of PFII was most effective above CMC (130–140 µM) (Janek et al.
