<p id="Par24" class="p">Due to increased use of stabilizing and thickening agents in food products, these industries are looking for ingredients which can improve food quality and properties. Gum arabic, xanthan gum and lecithin are widely used hydrocolloid emulsifiers which efficiently emulsify and stabilize oil-in-water emulsions. In Quorn products (quorn.co.uk), dried fungus culture from 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium venenatum</italic> is used together with egg albumen as a binder. While, in vegan food products, potato protein is added in place of egg albumen. However, climate change and weather fluctuations such as drought will produce defoliation and affect the production of plant based gums. In order, to reduce the dependency on synthetic emulsifiers and plant based emulsifiers there is increased interest in finding new ingredients. Contrary to chemical surfactants, marine derived BS are non-toxic and/or less toxic with high stability at extreme temperature, pH and salinity.
