<p id="Par28" class="p">CMC is the minimum concentration of BS required to lower the ST of water. At the CMC surfactant molecules form micelles to reduce surface tension and interfacial tension. The surface-active properties of a BS are determined by its side chain length, unsaturated bonds and the size of hydrophilic group. With increasing hydrophobicity, the CMC of BS molecules tends to decrease. That means, a lower concentration of BS is required for micelle formation. It is reported,
