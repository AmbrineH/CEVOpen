<p id="Par27" class="p">Chemicals used in cosmetic formulations often cause skin irritations and allergies. There is significant interest in natural cosmetic products among consumers. Replacement of SACs in these products with BS can reduce such harmful effects. The surface-active properties are essential to determine the type and amount of BS in detergents, cosmetic, pharmaceuticals and various other industries. The type of BS compound to be incorporated in the formulations can be selected based on their emulsifying ability and/or surface-activity such as, hydrophilicâ€“lipophilic balance (HLB) and critical micelle concentration (CMC), respectively. The HLB defines the polarity of the BS, which gives an indication of its solubility in different systems. BS with a high HLB value indicates that it is highly hydrophilic while, a low HLB value shows a high lipophilic character. Based on the HLB values, a BS will be an emulsifier, antifoaming agent and wetting agent which are desirable properties in cosmetic products.</p>
