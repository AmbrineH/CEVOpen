<p id="Par30" class="p">Before introducing BS in industrial formulations, it is necessary to determine the toxicity of these SACs on cells or animal models. For example, the toxicity of glycolipid BS (BS-SLSZ2) produced by a marine epizootic bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus lentus</italic> towards eukaryotic model organism was determined. The glycolipid BS-SLSZ2 efficiently inhibited biofilm formation in 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio harveyi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa.</italic> In vivo experiments showed that BS-SLSZ2 was non-toxic towards 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia salina</italic> and was effective in protecting 
 <italic class="italic">A. salina</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">V. harveyi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> infections (Hamza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2017</xref>). In another report, marine 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> sp. MK90e8 and MK91CC8 was reported to produce massetolide A, novel cyclic depsipeptide and viscosin, repsectively. Massetolide A and viscosin exhibited in vitro antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium avium</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">intracellulare.</italic> The effect of massetolide A was found to be non-toxic to mice at a dose of 10Â mg/kg thus showing potential in treating infections against 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium</italic> (Gerard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">1997</xref>).
