<p id="Par25" class="p">Not many studies on the applications of marine-derived BS in food and cosmetic formulations have been reported so far. The only commercialized microbial emulsifier is Emulsan produced from 
 <italic class="italic">A. calcoaceticus</italic>. BS, which due to its emulsion stabilizing property, can improve consistency, texture and solubilisation of fat globules, and aroma in food products. Incorporation of BE has been found to improve the rheology of dough, increasing the volume and emulsification of fat and thus finds useful applications in the bakery and meat processing industries. For example, a glycoprotein emulsion stabilizer produced by marine 
 <italic class="italic">Antarctobacter</italic> sp. TG22 can produce stable oil-in-water emulsions with commercial food-grade oils (Gutierrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2007a</xref>). Similarly two other glycoprotein emulsifiers from marine 
 <italic class="italic">Halomonas</italic> species TG39 and TG67 show superior emulsifying properties when compared to commercial emulsifiers with stable activity under acidic conditions and high temperatures (Gutierrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2007b</xref>).
