<p id="Par26" class="p">The lipopeptide MSA31 from a marine 
 <italic class="italic">Nesterenkonia</italic> species is an effective emulsifier, with good antioxidant activity and its addition to muffins improved softness and retained food quality. The lipopeptide MSA31 effectively reduced 90% of biofilm formed by 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and was non-toxic to the brine shrimp nauplii (up to 200 µg/ml) (Kiran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2017</xref>). Another bioemulsifier produced by a marine bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacter cloacae</italic> was reported to promote the viscosity of acidic food products (Iyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2006</xref>). In the food industry, there is wide scope for marine derived-BS as emulsifiers, stabilizing agents, antimicrobial and antiadhesives/antibiofilm agents (Table
