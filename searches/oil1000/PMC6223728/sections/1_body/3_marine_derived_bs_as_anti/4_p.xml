<p id="Par23" class="p">These properties suggest that marine-derived BS can serve as a source of new biomolecules for the discovery of novel drugs. Other possible applications of BS can be the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles using marine-derived surfactants. Metallic nanoparticles are receiving great interest in the field of biomedicine for example, tissue engineering, drug delivery, detection of pathogens, detection of tumours, biological markers etc. (Salata
