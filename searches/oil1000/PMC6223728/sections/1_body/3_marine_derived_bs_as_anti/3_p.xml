<p id="Par22" class="p">The molecular structure of a particular lipopeptide variant defines its biological activity. For example, the length of carbon-chain affects the antifungal activity in iturinic lipopeptides. Due to their hydrophobic nature the longer fatty acid chain interact effectively with the cell membrane. As reported, among three different lipopeptides isolated from marine derived 
 <italic class="italic">B. mojavensis</italic>, the antifungal activity of fengycins (C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">17</sub>) were stronger than mojavensin A (C

 <sub class="sub">17</sub> (Sivapathasekaran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2009</xref>). The longer fatty acid chain of BS may offer advantages in increasing the surface-activity of these molecules.
