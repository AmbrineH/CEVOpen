<p id="Par20" class="p">The indiscriminate use of antibiotics leading to drug resistance among pathogenic organisms is responsible for the rise of many life threatening diseases. Marine bacteria produce BS under fluctuating oceanic conditions such as oil-contaminated waters as well as secondary metabolites for their defence and survival against other micro-organisms. BS derived from the marine environment have been reported to inhibit cell adhesion and biofilm formation (Das et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2009a</xref>; Kiran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010a</xref>). They effectively show antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and biofilm disrupting activities against pathogenic micro-organisms. In addition, some have been found to display anti-tumour/anti-cancer activity and, as a result can be a potential source for future drugs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Marine derived glycolipid BS show potential for the development of novel antibiofilm drugs. For instance, the marine actinobacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Brevibacterium casei</italic> MSA19 produces glycolipid BS which significantly disrupts the biofilm formation in both mixed culture and individual strains at 30 μg glycolipid/ml (Kiran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010a</xref>). Another glycolipid BS from a marine 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic> SBPS 15 showed antimicrobial activity against different human pathogenic clinical isolates. The BS was stable at a broad range of pH (3–9) and temperature (up to 80 °C) (Mani et al.
