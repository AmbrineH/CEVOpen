 <xref rid="fsn31019-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> showed that glycine (4.426 g/ 100 g), alanine (4.181 g /100 g), serine (5.264 g/ 100 g), proline (3.051 g /100 g), aspartate (6.265 g /100 g), glutamate (17.556 g/ 100 g), tyrosine (2.352 g/ 100 g), and cytosine (2.029 g/ 100 g) were more quantifiable in the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic>. However, some nonessential amino acids, threonine (3.649 g/ 100 g), methionine (6.927 g/ 100 g), and histidine (1.949), were relatively more abundant in the fruits than the leaves.
