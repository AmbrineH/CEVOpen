Vitamin D guards against infections by strengthening the immune system (Anonymous,

Phylloquinone is the major circulating form of vitamin K. Since “there is no evidence of even sub‐clinical deficiencies of hemostatic function, a daily intake of 1 µg/kg may still be used as the basis for the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for vitamin K.” However, in this study, the vitamin K found to be contained in both leaves and fruits of
