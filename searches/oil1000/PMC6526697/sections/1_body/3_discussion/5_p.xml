<p class="p">Anti‐nutritional plant chemicals like phytates and oxalates though inherently toxic and noncurative in nature have been found to be to play significant roles in the nutritional quality of food (Lewis &amp; Fenwick,

The phytic acid which is the principal store of phosphate is a natural plant oxidant that has shown protective action in carcinogenesis. This action can be explained by its mineral chelating potential. Phytic acid may have health benefits for patients with diabetes as it reduces blood glucose response, by lowering the rate of starch breakdown. Phytic acid also releases inositol during digestion, which might reduce depression. It also reduces inflammation (Idu &amp; Igeleke,

 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Phytates are indigestible to humans or nonruminant animals, but may be a source of either inositol or phosphate if eaten directly (Idu, Ovuakporie‐Uvo, &amp; Nwaokolo, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Moreover, they chelate, thus making nonabsorbable certain important minor minerals such as zinc and iron and, to a lesser extent, also macrominerals such as calcium and magnesium (Greiner, Konietzny, &amp; Jany,
