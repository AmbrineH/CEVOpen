<p class="p">According to Okogun (
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>), “diets containing an abundance of fruits and vegetables are protective against a variety of diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases.” In this study, the leaves and fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> were found to be principally rich in carbohydrate and fiber content (Figures

 <xref rid="fsn31019-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Foods with high crude fiber values have been implicated in aiding bowel movement because of the cellulose that absorbs water and provides bulk for better functioning of the alimentary system (Wardlaw &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Fiber may also be functional in food enrichment. Ample intake of dietary fiber had been reported by Ishida, Suzuno, Sugiyama, Innami, and Todokoro (

Fruit fiber is considered to be of better quality than plant fiber. This is maybe due to higher total and soluble fiber content, water and oil holding capacity, and colonic fermentability, as well as lower phytic acid content and caloric value (Anonymous, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Figuerola, Hurtado, Estevez, Chiffelle, &amp; Asenjo, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). This suggests that the high fiber content in 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> leaves and fruits may potentiate positive effects in preventing the risk of some colorectal cancers.
