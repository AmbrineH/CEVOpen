<p class="p">Essential amino acids also referred to as “indispensable amino acid” are the most important for normal human body physiology and must be supplied to the body through diet. Essential amino acids are nine in total, namely histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, valine, methionine, and threonine (Banipal, Kaur, Kaur, Gupta, &amp; Banipal, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The synthesis of other amino acids and proteins also requires essential amino acids (Banipal, Kaur, Kaur, Komal, &amp; Banipal, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Essential amino acids are also used to prevent fatigue and improve concentration. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are imperative for the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, protein output, and gene expression (Banipal et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Peyrollier, Hajduch, Blair, Hyde, and Hundal (
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) reported the key role of leucine as signaling molecule during synthesis of muscle proteins. Additionally, the role of leucine in reversible phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase has also been reported for the upregulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle (Anthony, Anthony, &amp; Kimball, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The amino acid profile of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> leaves (5.387 g/100 g) and fruits (4.181 g/100 g) revealed a significant concentration of leucine suggesting that adequate consumption of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> can help upregulate the protein syntheses of the consumer (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Valine serves as a “central building block of various enzymes and is vital for supplying energy aiding to muscle cell repair and tissue recovery.” It is also useful in process of beverage fermentation (Anthony et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The valine content of the leaves (3.170 g/100 g) and fruits (2.581 g/100 g) of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> was found to be higher to 
 <italic class="italic">D. guineense</italic> (Ayessou et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kumari, Catherina, Katherine, Chew, &amp; Kah‐Guan, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Nonessential amino acids are said to be dispensable because the body can synthesize them readily. According to Sumalantha, Saravana, and Mohama (
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), arginine which was found present in the leaves (8.154 g/100 g) and fruits (1.822 g/100 g) of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> has been suggested to potentiate aphrodisiac activities. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> may be aphrodisiac at certain concentrations. Arginine improves the circulation, strengthens the immune system, and has a positive influence on male libido (Williams, Abumrad, &amp; Barbul, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Research suggests that the amino acid speeds up the rate of the healing of wounds (Lavie, Hafetz, Luboshitzky, &amp; Lavie, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), improves the burning of excess fat (Merimee, Lillicrap, &amp; Rabinowitz, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>), and can be used in weight‐reducing diets. Its role in decreasing cholesterol levels can be ascribed to its function as a biological precursor of nitric oxide (NO). Arginine helps to stimulate and improve hair growth, and arginine helps to reduce insulin resistance and increases glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes 
 <italic class="italic">mellitus</italic> (Piatti et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Wu, Meininger, Knabe, Baze, &amp; Rhoads, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The substantial concentration of arginine in 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> may suggest that it may be useful in cholesterol‐lowering activities in man. Glutamate or glutamic acid is in the same amino acid family group as glutamine. Glutamate is a major component of most natural protein foods such as meat, fish, milk, and some vegetables that play an essential role in human metabolism (Filer &amp; Stegink, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Fernstrom, 
 <xref rid="fsn31019-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). It helps transmit messages around the brain and also reduce chest pain commonly associated with coronary heart disease (Niswender &amp; Conn,
