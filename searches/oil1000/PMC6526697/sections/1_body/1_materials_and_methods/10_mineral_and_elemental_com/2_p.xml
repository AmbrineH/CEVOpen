<p class="p">Freshly prepared aqua regia solution was used in the analysis of the samples. For this, distilled water (1.2 L) was poured into a 2‐L volumetric flask. Then, 400 ml concentrated HCl was carefully added, followed with 133 ml of 70% nitric acid. The solution was made up to the mark with distilled water. Two (2) g of dry powder of 
 <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> was placed in a crucible and ashed in a muffle furnace at 500°C for 2 hr after which it was allowed to cool in an oven, then removed and stored in a desiccator. The ashed material was transferred into a 50‐ml centrifuge tube by rinsing the crucible with 5 ml of distilled water. The crucible was further rinsed with 5 ml of the aqua regia about three times and poured into the tube to make a total of 20 ml. The sample was then vortexed for 10 min at 3,000 rpm which the supernatant was decanted into clean vials for macronutrients and micronutrients determination using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The minerals analyzed included calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and iron.
