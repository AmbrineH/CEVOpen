 <p class="p">Several plants species have served as food for man because of their nutritional values. However, there is a lack of data on the nutritional benefits of 
  <italic class="italic">Desplatsia dewevrei</italic>. Hence, this study was aimed at investigating the nutrients and chemical composition of 
  <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> leaves and fruits. Vitamins, amino acid profile, and mineral composition of 
  <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> were investigated. Minerals found present include copper, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. Vitamins B, C, and K up to the daily standard required intake levels according to World Health Organization standards were discovered in 
  <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic>. The protein score from the amino acid composition was 100%. Phytate and oxalate, which are non‐nutritional components, were found present in 
  <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei;</italic> however, in values far below the daily intake required limit by the WHO standard. In conclusion, 
  <italic class="italic">D. dewevrei</italic> from this research finding has convincing qualities of a reliable nutraceutical raw material, which can be properly finished and incorporated into the human diet to harness its vitality.
