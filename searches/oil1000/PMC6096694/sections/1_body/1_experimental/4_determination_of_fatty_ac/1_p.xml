<p id="Par9" class="p">Fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) after derivatization to fatty acid methyl esters with 2 M methanolic solution of potassium hydroxide according to ISO 12966-2 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2011</xref>). A Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a BPX capillary column (30 m × 0.22 mm × 0.25 µm film thickness) was used. The analysis was performed using nitrogen (1 mL min

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and from 170 to 230 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The temperature was kept at 230 °C for another 15 min. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 225 and 250 °C, respectively. Individual fatty acids were identified by comparing their retention times with a certified fatty acids methyl ester reference standard mixture (Supelco 37-Component Fame Mix, CRM47885, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and quantified as a percentage of the total fatty acids.
