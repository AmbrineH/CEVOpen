<p id="Par17" class="p">This observation may be due to the fact that sunflower oil contained higher amount of unsaturated fatty acids, and hence, it was more prone to oxidation process. The addition of herbal plant extracts and synthetic antioxidant to the both oils reduced the oxidation by lengthening

However, this observation revealed that the addition of herbal plant extracts to sunflower oil may influence on the improvement of its oxidative stability.
