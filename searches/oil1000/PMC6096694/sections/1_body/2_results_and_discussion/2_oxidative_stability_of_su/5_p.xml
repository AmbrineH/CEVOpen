<p id="Par19" class="p">Herbal plant extracts used in the present study belong to the Lamiaceae family, that is well known for their antioxidant activity due to the content of phenolic compounds. Among phenolics identified by HPLC method in our previously studies, rosmarinic and caffeic acids were the most predominant phenolic compounds (Kozłowska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kozlowska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>). Phenolic antioxidants present in herbal plant extracts have good free radical scavenging and chelating properties. When they are incorporated to edible oils help to improve their thermal stability and extend their frying life (Bensmira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kozlowska and Zawada 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2015</xref>). Combinations of different herbal plant extracts and synthetic antioxidants may also have synergistic effects in preventing hydroperoxides formation compared to samples containing only herbal plant extracts or only synthetic antioxidant (Rižner Hraš et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2000</xref>). In a research carried out by Ramalho and Jorge (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2008</xref>), it was also noticed that rosemary extract added to soybean oil showed a positive effect on its oxidative and thermal stability. However, Abdalla and Roozen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1999</xref>) showed that thyme and lemon balm extracts inhibited formation of both primary and secondary oxidation products in sunflower oil and oil-in-water emulsion. Oregano extract was more active in oil than in emulsion.
