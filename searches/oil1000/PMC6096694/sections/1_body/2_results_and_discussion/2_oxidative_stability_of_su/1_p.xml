 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of heating rate for SFO enriched with BHA and herbal plant extracts are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The same profile was also observed for DSC exotherms describing the non-isothermal oxidation of SBO samples. There are usually two peaks present indicating that during oxidation at least two processes take place. The onset point and first maximum peak are connected with initiation and formation of primary auto-oxidation products, and the second maximum peak informs about further oxidation and decomposition of oxidation products (Litwinienko et al.
