<p id="Par20" class="p">In the present study, the extrapolated onset temperatures at different heating rates were used to evaluate the thermal-oxidative stability of SFO and SBO enriched with herbal plant extracts. The Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method and the Arrhenius equation were applied for calculation of kinetic parameters of this process. The activation energy (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) as well as pre-exponential factor (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>) and reaction constant (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>) can be used for comparison of the oxidative stability of studied pure oils and oils enriched with antioxidants for evaluating of antioxidant activity of added antioxidants. In all cases, the addition of herbal plant extracts and BHA to oils caused an increase in the values of activation energy (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>, respectively). At low concentration of herbal plant extracts (0.01%), they were lower than at higher concentration (0.07%). Activation energy values were 64.86 for SFO and 87.40 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for SBO, respectively. For SFO enriched with herbal plant extracts, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> values were in the range of 66.40–101.34 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In the case of SBO containing marjoram, thyme, oregano extracts, and BHA, the range of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> values were 88.47–107.30 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The highest values of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> were calculated for SBO samples enriched with thyme extract and the mixture of thyme extract and BHA. In regarding to SFO samples, activation energy reached maximal value of 101.34 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> when SFO was enriched with oregano extract at concentration of 0.07%. Taking into account the induction time (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>) calculated at 160 °C, it can be seen that higher values were reported for oil samples with the addition of herbal plant extracts than for their counterparts without additives. The efficiencies of natural and synthetic antioxidants used for protection of SFO oil samples from thermoxidation increased in the following order: control (SFO) &lt; marjoram 0.01% &lt; thyme 0.01% &lt; oregano + thyme &lt; oregano 0.01% &lt; marjoram 0.03% &lt; oregano + BHA &lt; thyme 0.03% &lt; oregano 0.03% &lt; thyme 0.07% &lt; BHA &lt; marjoram 0.07% &lt; thyme + BHA &lt; oregano 0.07%. For SBO, the rank was in the following sequence: control (SBO) &lt; marjoram 0.01% &lt; oregano + BHA &lt; thyme + BHA &lt; BHA &lt; thyme 0.01% &lt; oregano 0.01% &lt; thyme 0.03% &lt; oregano 0.03% &lt; marjoram 0.03% &lt; oregano 0.07% &lt; marjoram 0.07% &lt; thyme 0.07% &lt; oregano + thyme.
