<p id="Par13" class="p">Vegetable oils are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, especially monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. They can make oils susceptible to oxidation (Mannekote and Kailas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2012</xref>; Sarkar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2015</xref>). It is known that the presence of two double bonds in the fatty acids structure may cause 10–40 times faster oxidation than the in presence of one double bond (Szterk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, the fatty acid composition of sunflower and soybean oils, expressed as saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated, is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The percentage content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in sunflower oil amounted to 10.7%, while the value obtained for soybean oil was slightly higher (15.5%). It can also be noted that the content of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids in soybean oil was slightly lower (25.9 and 58.6%, respectively) in comparison with their content in sunflower oil (28.0 and 61.3%, respectively).
