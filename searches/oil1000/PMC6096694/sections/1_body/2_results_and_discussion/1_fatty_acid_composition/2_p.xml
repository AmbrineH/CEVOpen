<p id="Par14" class="p">These values were in agreement with Veronezi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>) studies. However, Chowdhury et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2007</xref>) studies showed that the total content of MUFA and PUFA in SBO was similar to our results, but the percentage of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in sunflower oil were different. They reported higher content of MUFA and lower percentage of PUFA in sunflower oil if compared with our studies. Although the content of saturated fatty acids in vegetable oils is desirable to improve their oxidative stability, but taking into account nutritional properties of oils, their presence is undesirable, because they can contribute to increasing the concentration of low-density lipoproteins and the plasmatic cholesterol (Wilke and Clandinin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2005</xref>). The major saturated fatty acids that were found in edible oils studied were palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0). SBO contained higher levels of these fatty acids in comparison with SFO (11.1 and 6.7% of palmitic acid, and 4.1 and 3.9% of stearic acid, respectively). Among MUFA, oleic acid (C18:1) was the main representative and its content ranged from 25.4% in SBO to 27.7% in SFO. However, linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids were the dominant fatty acids among PUFA. Linoleic acid amount in SFO was higher than that of 53.1% which was determined in SBO, but linolenic acid was found in smaller amount in SFO. Regarding SBO our results were similar to those reported by other authors (Thurgood et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sarkar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2015</xref>). On contrary, linoleic acid content in SFO studies by Cordeiro et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>) and Asnaashari et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2015</xref>) was lower than that obtained in the present study. Zambiazi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2007</xref>) studying sunflower oils found smaller amounts of oleic acid (15.26 and 16.86%) and higher contents of linoleic acid (71.17 and 70.69%) compared to the results demonstrated in our research. Sunil et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>) also demonstrated the lower level of oleic acid and higher amount of linoleic acid in SFO (23.0 and 66.2% for oleic and linoleic acids, respectively) as compared to the present work. Differences in fatty acid composition of SFO and SBO are mostly determined by plant genotype and environmental conditions, particularly temperature, water supply, and more generally agro-climatic conditions (Castro and Leite 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2018</xref>; Reena Rani and Sharma 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2017</xref>; Clemente and Cahoon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2009</xref>). The higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in SFO than SBO, especially linoleic acid, makes it more susceptible to oxidation process. Therefore, the addition of antioxidants may be one of the way to inhibit oil autoxidation.
