<p id="Par3" class="p">The lipid oxidation may be inhibited by different ways including inactivation of enzymes catalyzing oxidation, addition of chelating agents or the use of suitable packaging. Another method is the addition of antioxidants, especially natural, because the prolonged usage of synthetic antioxidants has often been questioned due to potential toxicological concerns (Nieva-Echevarría et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>). Antioxidants added to edible oils should protect unsaturated fatty acids to increase their stability to thermal degradation as well as they should demonstrate good thermal stability. Extracts from herbal plants such as thyme, rosemary, sage, marjoram, and oregano are a rich source of natural antioxidants (Oliveira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2018</xref>; Chrpová et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2010</xref>; Generalić Mekinić et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014</xref>). Their properties are determined by the presence of phenolic compounds which extend the shelf-life of food, protect fats against autoxidation, and also exhibit antimicrobial activity (Kozlowska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>). Phenolic compounds may act as antioxidants by scavenging of free radicals. They are active when are used at an optimal range of concentrations. The use of their in excessive amounts may result in pro-oxidant effect. Moreover, herbal plant extracts contain many compounds that may interfere with one another and minor lipid components and also can influence on the autoxidation process.
