<p id="Par2" class="p">Sunflower and soybean oils belong to the popular vegetable oils used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries (Rabasco Alvarez and González Rodríguez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2000</xref>). They are a good source of the essential fatty acids and liposoluble vitamins which are important components in human diet. The predominant fatty acids present in both oils are unsaturated ones such as oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. The presence of double bound in these fatty acids can offer several possibilities to carrying out of the chemical modification of the structure to improve some of their properties (Naeli et al.

On the other hand, they are prone to oxidative processes both when vegetable oils are stored at low temperature as well as when they are used in the kitchen for frying and cooking at high temperature. Autoxidation of edible oils and fats can also be catalyzed by other factors such as exposure to light, heat, and transitional metals. This process is a free radical chain reaction, leading to increase in reactive radicals, which initiate further reactions (Choe and Min

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2015</xref>). They cause a sequence of unfavorable changes, mainly deterioration in the sensory properties, decrease in nutritional value, and give rise to chemical compounds that are harmful to the human health (McClements and Decker
