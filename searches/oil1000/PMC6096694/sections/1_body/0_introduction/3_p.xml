<p id="Par4" class="p">To determine of the oxidative stability of oils, as well as the antioxidant effectiveness of spices and herbs many methods and techniques were adopted. The most popular methods are peroxide value and conjugated diene determinations, gas chromatography, chemiluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, or Rancimat test (Farhoosh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2007</xref>; Carmona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2014</xref>). Among them, also differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the most used analytical instrument for studies of physical properties and thermo-oxidative decomposition of native and inhibited fats and their blends (Thurgood et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>; Tengku-Rozaina and Birch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2016</xref>). Both isothermal (constant temperature) and non-isothermal (linear increase in temperature) DSC techniques may be applied to obtain kinetic parameters of lipid oxidation in vegetable oils including activation energy (

 <sub class="sub">a</sub>), the Arrhenius rate constant (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>), pre-exponential factor (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>), and also induction time (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>). They are calculated using the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method (OFW) after determination from DSC curves of the onset temperatures (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ON</sub>) which are taken as a parameter characterizing the oxidative susceptibility of oils. Spice and herbs added to vegetable oils act as antioxidants mainly by increasing the onset temperatures. The correct use of the OFW method in DSC studies is based on the comparison of systems at the same degree of conversion (

 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = Δ
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">τ</sub>/Δ
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">total</sub>, where Δ
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">τ</sub> is the heat evolved at a specific time 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> and Δ
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">total</sub> is the heat evolved during the process. It may be assumed that the degree of conversion at the beginning of the oxidation process is low but constant (Guimarães-Inácio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2018</xref>). The approach proposed by Ozawa, Flynn, and Wall is often used during the evaluation of the stability of edible oils and researchers agree that the determination of a single activation energy at the start of the oil degradation is sufficient to compare different samples that were subjected to the same experimental conditions (same heating rates, oxidizing atmosphere) (Thurgood et al.
