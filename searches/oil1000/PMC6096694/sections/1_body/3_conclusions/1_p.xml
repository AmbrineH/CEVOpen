<p id="Par22" class="p">With the use of DSC method, the assessment of oxidative stability of sunflower and soybean oils, and also efficiencies of used herbal plant extracts were performed. SFO containing a slightly higher level of unsaturated fatty acids compared to SBO appeared to be less stable.

 <sub class="sub">ON</sub> values were higher for soybean oil samples without the addition of herbal plant extracts and also when they were enriched with marjoram, thyme, and oregano extracts in comparison with sunflower oil samples. The calculated activation energy values for the oxidation reaction of tested oil samples showed that the effectiveness of used herbal plant extracts varied with the type of herbal plant extract added to oil samples and with their concentration. Oregano extract at concentration of 0.07% was effective for protection of SFO against oxidation and thyme extract at concentration of 0.07% improved the oxidative stability of SBO. Therefore, these herbal plant extracts can be recommended as a potent source of natural antioxidants replacing synthetic antioxidants for protection of edible oils against oxidation.
