 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 1.56 mg/mL was higher than the effective concentrations reported by us against 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic> (8–64 μg/mL) and cell lines (22.3–250 μg/mL), but in the same range as those found active against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains (8–24 mg/mL). In this case, the putative topical administration of the hemp EO to combat 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> wound infections guarantees a discrete safety index with respect to the parental administration in
