<p class="p">Larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> are widely used as an invertebrate wax moth larva model to evaluate the virulence of microbial pathogens, measure the efficacy/safety of biologically active antimicrobial agents, and produce results comparable to those that can be obtained using mammals [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. As a consequence, no ethical approval was required for this study because there was no use of mammal or animal models. In this work, the viability of 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> larvae, to measure the relative toxicity of different concentrations of hemp EO, was evaluated over the study period of five days. As reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03266-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, no evident effects on survival were registered with 0.78 mg/mL hemp EO up to five days after treatment. The lethal dose (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of Hemp EO was 1.56 mg/mL in the first 48 h of treatment, probably due to the lipophilic nature of the EO with respect to the larval biological fluids and the invasive administration procedure (
