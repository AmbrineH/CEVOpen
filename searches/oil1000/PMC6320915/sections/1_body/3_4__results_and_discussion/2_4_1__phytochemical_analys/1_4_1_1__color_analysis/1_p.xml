<p class="p">The tristimulus colorimetry was not yet reported in the literature to evaluate the color properties of hemp EO and its aromatic water. The EO, obtained from the fresh inflorescences via steam distillation and separated by water, mainly contains a mixture of monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Our analyses, as subsequently described, account for twelve components belonging to this class, in which (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide represent the principal impact compounds. As a counterpart in the aromatic water, a polyphenolic fraction mainly represented by catechins and phenolic acids was found. The color of the EO, which could vary between pale yellow and light green was found to show a significant yellow parameter (b*) along with a weak green value (a*), which, together with the quite bright L* value, account for the light yellow-green nuance characterizing our sample. The aromatic water showed a very clear yellow color associated with a relatively high L* value and particularly low a* and b* parameters. If this is related to the catechin content, the more intense yellow-green color of the separated oil could be maybe attributed to other pigments, weakly represented but intensely colored, such as chlorophylls, carotenoids, or others [
