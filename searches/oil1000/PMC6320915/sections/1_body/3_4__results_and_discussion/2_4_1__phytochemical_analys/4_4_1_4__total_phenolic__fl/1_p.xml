<p class="p">The amounts of total bioactive compounds in the aromatic water were detected by colorimetric methods, and the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03266-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> (hemp EO was not soluble in the assay reagents). Total phenolics, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were found to be 28.04 mg GAE/g, 4.04 mg RE/g, and 1.76 mg CE/g extract, respectively. Apparently, the total amount of flavonoids and phenolic acids was approximately 20% of total phenolics. Several researchers reported different levels of total bioactive compounds in
