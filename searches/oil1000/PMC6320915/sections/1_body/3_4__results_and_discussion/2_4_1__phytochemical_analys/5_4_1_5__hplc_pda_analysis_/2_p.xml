<p class="p">Naringenin (706 µg/mL) and its glycosylated derivative naringin (83 µg/mL) emerged, among the ones studied, as the two most important metabolites which could further characterize this EO, along with the presence of catechin (60 µg/mL) and epicatechin (56 µg/mL) (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-03266" class="xref">Supplementary Materials</xref> for the chromatogram of a real sample). Considering the mean concentration of naringenin, hemp EO seems to be relevant as a source of this important flavanone for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. Moreover, naringenin was shown to act as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity agent [

Other compounds such as benzoic acid, 2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid, and syringic acid were also detected in discrete quantities. Conversely, the number and the relative amounts of these phytochemicals were scarcely found in the aromatic water (rich in catechin), despite the unique presence of a small percentage of rutin (0.18 µg/mL). Chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde,
