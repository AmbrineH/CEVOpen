<p class="p">The antimicrobial potency of hemp EO and its main component naringenin was also explored against 14 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic> clinical isolates and the reference strain ATCC 43629, using the microdilution method at pH 7.5 [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03266-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, the activity of the two test samples was not related to the different antibiotic susceptibility of the strains; the EO showed an MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 32 µg/mL and an MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> of 64 µg/mL, whereas naringenin showed an MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 16 µg/mL and an MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> of 32 µg/mL. By considering the strains resistant to the traditional antibiotics (MNZ and CLR), hemp EO was 2–4-fold more active than MNZ, and 4–16-fold more active than CLR. The potency of naringenin was 2–8- and 4–16-fold higher than MNZ and CLR, respectively. MBC values were 64 µg/mL for hemp EO and 32 µg/mL for naringenin. The MIC and MBC concentrations of all strains were the same for both compounds, except for the strains E34, 68, and F40/442, which had MBC values corresponding to two times the MIC. Because a drug is defined “bactericidal” when the MBC concentration does not exceed four-fold MIC value [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], we can conclude that hemp EO and naringenin have very good bactericidal effects (1 &lt; MBC/MIC &lt; 2).
