<p class="p">Nariman and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] reported a study about the anti-
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic> effect of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> and other 19 plants extracts, collected from Iran areas. Of the 10 strains tested, six were defined susceptible by disc diffusion method. The MIC values of the 10 most effective extracts (
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> not included) against 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic> ranged from 31.25 to 500 Âµg/mL. Following these studies and the threshold values reported by Kuete (2010) [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], our results demonstrate that hemp EO and naringenin have very good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori.</italic> Furthermore, it was reported that cannabidiol prevents intestinal inflammation damage induced by an alteration of cytokine levels [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Because the pathogenic effect of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic> infection is supposed to also be mediated by cytokine production of inflammatory cells present in the infected gastric mucosa [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> extracts demonstrated in this study, associated with their anti-inflammatory effect, could represent a very interesting approach against 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection.
