<p class="p">Antioxidative effects of natural products could be considered as a first insight in detecting their ethnopharmacological relevance and potential. To this end, a certain antioxidant profile could be provided by comparing different chemical assays representative of alternative mechanisms. For this reason, the antioxidant ability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> samples was evaluated using six complementary in vitro tests: free-radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating assays. The results are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03266-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The aromatic water exhibited stronger free-radical scavenging and ferric reducing potential when compared to the EO. In addition, the EO was not active on ABTS radicals. However, the best activity in phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating assays was obtained by the EO. These findings may be linked to the presence of a large amount of naringenin and catechin, which act as good chelators [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Also, the phosphomolybdenum assay is known as a total antioxidant test, and different phytochemicals, including vitamin C, tocopherol, or carotenoids, may be active in this assay. CUPRAC and FRAP tests showed good results with these products, which, along with metal chelating activity, could account for the potential of hemp EO in limiting the generation and the accumulation of harmful free radicals via the Fenton reaction. Similarly, some researchers [
