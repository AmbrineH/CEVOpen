<p class="p">The antifungal activity of hemp EO against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp. was calculated as MIC value &gt;12,460 µg/mL with no differences observed among 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp. Hemp EO was not active against yeasts following the defined threshold activity values for plant extracts proposed as follows: MIC below 100 μg/mL (significant activity), 100 ≤ MIC ≤ 625 μg/mL (moderate activity), and MIC &gt; 625 μg/mL (low activity) [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. These results reinforced the selective antibacterial activity of hemp EO.
