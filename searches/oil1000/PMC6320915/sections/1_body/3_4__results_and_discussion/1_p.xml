<p class="p">The hemp crop produced approximatively 10,000–12,000 kg/ha of fresh biomass. The hydro-distillation of flowering aerial parts gave 0.28% essential oil yield (mL/kg fresh weight), expressed as the mean value of separate distillations from 2 kg of fresh weight each. Minimum and maximum ranges of EO were 0.19% and 0.31%, respectively. The highest yield value was obtained in the early-September distillation, while the lowest was from the late-September/early-October collection (full blooming plants) (

The trend of yield variation was also evident upon analyzing data grouped by decades, confirming the early collection as the preferable practice for optimal yield (0.29 ± 0.004%, 0.25 ± 0.005%, and 0.21 ± 0.003% mean yield ± SEM; 1–11 September, 12–22 September, and 23 September–2 October, respectively (ANOVA,

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The quantitative production of hemp EO was monitored for one month. Fresh plant material was collected daily, manually selecting plants only in full bloom, and three or four separated distillations were immediately performed. Experimental data confirm that plant harvest is preferable at the early flowering stage due to the evident reduction in EO content in proximity to fruiting. From the weekly data analysis, the reduction (−30%) of EO production was evident in late flowering stages, while all yield data within the same week were more homogenous. At the end of the production process, all collected hemp EO samples were pooled to provide a single batch available for the market and for the successive analyses. The aromatic water, separated from the EO but enriched by fragrant molecules, was further investigated for its chemical composition, antioxidant activity, color characteristics, and enzyme inhibitory activity with the aim of giving value to this important by-product.
