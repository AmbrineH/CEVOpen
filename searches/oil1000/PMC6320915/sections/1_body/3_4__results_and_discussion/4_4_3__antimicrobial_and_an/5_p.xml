<p class="p">Due to the high amount of naringenin in this EO, we aimed to evaluate the impact of this secondary metabolite on the antimicrobial activity. We also studied the MIC, MBC, and MBEC of naringenin against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 105. The data indicated an MIC of 512 μg/mL and an MBEC corresponding to 2048 μg/mL. The results demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of naringenin contained in the hemp EO versus 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. These results also confirmed the data of Yue et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] who reported the effect of naringenin on the formation of the biofilm of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>. The authors demonstrated that the MIC of naringenin was between 100 and 200 μg/mL, and that 200 μg/mL naringenin was capable of inhibiting the biofilm formation after 4 and 24 h of incubation. Conversely, in the present study, we focalized the attention on the capability of naringenin to eradicate a mature biofilm developed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> after 24 h of incubation to evaluate an application of hemp EO in the treatment of pre-formed biofilms.
