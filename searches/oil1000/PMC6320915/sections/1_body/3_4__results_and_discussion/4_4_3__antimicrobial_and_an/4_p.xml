<p class="p">Furthermore, the hemp EO showed its capability to eradicate a mature biofilm developed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>; specifically, the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined using the AB assay, CV staining, CFU counting, and live/dead staining, followed by fluorescent microscopy analysis. The Hemp EO displayed an MBEC value of 24 mg/mL toward all strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> except for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 105, which showed an MBEC value corresponding to 16 mg/mL (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> mature biofilms treated with 24 mg/mL hemp EO did not show a reduction in biofilm biomass, as confirmed by the CV staining (data not shown); however, the biofilms treated with hemp EO were characterized by a multitude of dead cells as indicated by the red fluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03266-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>D(b)). As mentioned above, the CV staining did not display any differences between the biomasses of treated and untreated biofilms (data not shown).
