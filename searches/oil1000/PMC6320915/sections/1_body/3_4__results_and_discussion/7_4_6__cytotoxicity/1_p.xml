<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, the cytotoxicity of hemp EO in cancer cells is yet to be investigated. Under our experimental conditions, the hemp EO induced a statistically significant and concentration-dependent reduction of cancer cell viability, reaching almost a 75% inhibition of cell proliferation at the highest concentration of 250 µg/mL (

A different anti-proliferative potency was found in the tested cell models, with Caco-2 and Mz-ChA-1 cells as the most sensitive biological systems. In fact, after 24 h of treatment with 50 µg/mL hemp EO, the cell viability was inhibited by about 66% in both cell lines (
