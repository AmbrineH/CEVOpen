<p class="p">Next, hemp EO significantly inhibited the growth of both breast cancer cell lines characterized by different biological features and heterogeneous susceptibility to anticancer agents, with more potency against MDA-MB-468 cells. In particular, the treatment with 50 and 75 µg/mL produced an inhibition of cell viability of 25% and 32% in MCF7 cells, and of 37% and 92% in MDA-MB-468 cells; 90% proliferation inhibition was reached only at 100 µg/mL in MCF7 cells. As expected, the resulting IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of the Hemp EO in MCF7 cells was about 1.6-fold higher than that obtained for MDA-MB-468 cells, and almost threefold higher than that calculated for Caco-2 and Mz-ChA-1 cells. In contrast, slight cytotoxicity was produced in the nonmalignant cholangiocytes (H69), reaching a maximum of 44% inhibition of cell proliferation at the highest concentration of 250 µg/mL; as a consequence, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was not evaluable. On the basis of these results, the cytotoxicity of hemp EO appeared to be selective for cancer cells, particularly cholangiocarcinoma and coloncarcinoma, with a higher tolerability in normal cells. The cytotoxicity was similar to that of the positive control doxorubicin in Caco-2 and Mz-ChA-1 cells, while about 10-fold lower in breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells (
