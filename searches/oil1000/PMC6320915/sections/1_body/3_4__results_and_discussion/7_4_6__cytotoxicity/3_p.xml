<p class="p">Upon phytochemical analysis, several terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, along with flavonoids and tannins, were identified in this phytocomplex. Interestingly, α-pinene and β-caryophyllene exhibited high anti-proliferative activity on human erythroleukemic K562 cells [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]; moreover, β-caryophyllene and linalool exhibited interesting anti-proliferative activity on human amelanotic melanoma C32 cells and on renal cell adenocarcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. β-Caryophyllene was also reported to possess chemopreventive properties and to interfere with liver cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], whereas β-caryophyllene oxide was found to possess anti-proliferative activity, although at high concentrations, and chemosensitizing properties, thus restoring the sensitivity of resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. β-Myrcene was reported to possess anti-invasive properties in metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity [

 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Limonene is widely known to possess chemopreventive and antitumor properties; in a previous study, it induced tumor regression and cancer cell apoptosis, and inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress [
