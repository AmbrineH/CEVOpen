<p class="p">Enzyme inhibitory effects of the tested 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> samples were investigated toward a panel of important enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-amylase, α-glucosidase, tyrosinase, and lipase. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03266-t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>. Generally, from the enzymatic standpoint, the highest values were observed in the EO, except for the lack of inhibitory effect on AChE and α-amylase. These variations observed can be explained by the different phytochemical compositions of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> samples. For example, the EO is richer in terms of volatile components, such as (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and humulene, which are known as anti-tyrosinase agents [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. In particular, lipase inhibition was the most promising effect after treatment with hemp EO.
