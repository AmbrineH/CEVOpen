<p class="p">A previous study compared the composition and the antimicrobial activities of EOs obtained from three varieties of industrial hemp (Carmagnola, Fibranova, and Futura). Futura cultivar gave the highest essential oil yield and resulted in the most promising for application as an antimicrobial agent with a broad spectrum of activity [

Another comparative study was conducted on five hemp cultivars (Felina 34, Fedrina 74, SwissMix, Kompolti, and Secuemi) for chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The most abundant compounds were found to be α-pinene, myrcene,
