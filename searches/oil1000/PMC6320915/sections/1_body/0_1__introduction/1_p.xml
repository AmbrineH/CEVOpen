<p class="p">Hemp (
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> L.) is often indicated as the oldest known, cultivated, and used plant by humanity. Its wide development was facilitated by broad soil and climate adaptation, allowing a large geographical distribution, as well as by crop flexibility, giving textile, fiber, food, feed, and biosolvents as final products or intermediates for manufacturing industries. A parallel history involves relative plants with secondary metabolism producing cannabinoids, and particularly tetrahydrocannabinoids (THCs), which characterize crops for medicinal or illegal recreational use due to psychotropic effects and addiction. As a consequence of the longtime debate on the correct taxonomic level of distinction between THC-producing or non-THC-producing plants, for most of the 20th century, a general prohibition of hemp cultivation existed. Currently, the non-THC-producing species of 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic>, or at least those producing a concentration lower than 0.2%, are usually referred to as fiber hemp, industrial hemp, and seed-oil hemp. Formerly, the maximum THC limit was imposed on plant cultivation in the open field and was not fixed by law with regards to final products such as food or nutraceuticals. The Italian Government promoted industrial hemp cultivation as a strategy to implement environmentally friendly crops and to contrast the loss of agricultural lands and green belts, as well as the desertification and the decrement of biodiversity [
