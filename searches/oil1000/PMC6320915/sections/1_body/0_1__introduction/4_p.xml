<p class="p">More recently, the EO obtained from inflorescences or leaves of hemp cv. Futura 75 was proposed as a potential source of botanical insecticides against larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and against adults of 
 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The essential oil was also tested in a field trial to control the rosy apple aphid pest and was determined as an ecological alternative to the acetamiprid [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. An aqueous emulsion of the essential oil (0.02–0.1%), mainly characterized by (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (35%), β-myrcene (18%), and α-pinene (9%), induced high mortality rate when tested on the foxglove aphid (
 <italic class="italic">Aulacorthum solani</italic> Kalt.) and the two-spotted spider mite (
 <italic class="italic">Tetranychus urticae</italic> Koch) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Hemp EO was also shown to fight the human-biting Asian tiger mosquito (

 <italic class="italic">Physella acuta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Increasing interest for the essential oil is confirmed by the increasing literature data, which could be related to its limited toxicity for mammals [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], as well as its low ecological impact on the environment [
