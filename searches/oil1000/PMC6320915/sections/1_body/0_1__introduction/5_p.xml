<p class="p">Due to the increasing attention in the valorization of locally produced plants to support their use in the pharmaceutic, cosmetic, and food industry and to valorize the cultivation by-products, the EO obtained via hydro-distillation of aerial parts from 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> cv. Futura 75, cultivated in Italy, and its aromatic water were studied herein. Phytochemical investigation was performed on the terpenoid fraction (GC/MS), and the phenolic and flavonoid fingerprint (spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods), in addition to color analysis (CIELAB parameters; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-molecules-23-03266" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref>). The potential applications of the EO were investigated in a wide multidisciplinary approach for different biological activities, such as antioxidant and antiradical, enzyme inhibition, antimicrobial activities on bacteria and fungi, and a comparative cytotoxic activity on tumor and non-tumor cell lines. A preliminary in vivo evaluation of the toxicity was also carried out on 
 <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae. The broad-spectrum investigation provided a general characterization of the EO of THC-free 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> and could be used to support its use and application in innovative and multi-target ingredients for medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, agronomic, or food use.
