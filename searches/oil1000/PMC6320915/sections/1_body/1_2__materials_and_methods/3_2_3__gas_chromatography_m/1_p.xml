<p class="p">The volatile component analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6850 gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with an Agilent Technologies 5975 mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl 95% methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.25 µm; Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). GC parameters were adjusted as follows: injector temperature, 250 °C; flow rate of the helium carrier gas (99.995% purity), 1.0 mL/min. The oven temperature was set at 40 °C (5 min), then raised to 200 °C at 5 °C/min, and maintained at this temperature for 60 min. MS parameters were set as follows: energy of electron ionization, 70 eV; solvent delay, 6 min; source temperature, 230 °C; quadrupole temperature, 150 °C; and mass scan was carried out over the 50–350
