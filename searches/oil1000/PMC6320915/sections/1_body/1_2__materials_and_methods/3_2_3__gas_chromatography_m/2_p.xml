<p class="p">The eluted compounds were identified by matching the relative mass spectra with those available from both a commercial database (FFNSC 3, Chromaleont srl, Messina, Italy) and online libraries (NIST 11, Flavor2, Scientific Instrument Services, Ringoes, NJ, USA) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Kovats index (KI) was used as a second parameter to confirm the analyte identification. KIs were measured using a mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C8â€“C24) in the same analytic conditions, and then compared with values reported in the literature and in the FFNSC 3 database. The identity of several compounds was confirmed through injection of standard samples available from commercial sources. The relative abundance of oil components was obtained by integrating the GC/MS peak areas without any further correction.
