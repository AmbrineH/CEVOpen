<p class="p">Fresh aerial parts consisting of leaves, inflorescences, and thinner residues of stem were roughly cropped to uniform size and accurately distributed inside the distillation chamber. The distillatory was a stainless-steel 12-L Clevenger-type apparatus (Albrigiluigi S.r.l., Stallavena, Italy). The distillation started within 5 h of plant collection in the field and was performed for no longer than 3 h. Straightaway, the collected EOs were passed through septa with anhydrous sodium sulfate in order to remove water residues, before being transferred to a sealed blue glass bottle and stored in the dark at 4 °C until used for phytochemical and biological assays. The EO yields (%,

Moreover, as a by-product, the aromatic water was also characterized in our experiments to assess its potential economic value in the framework of a lower-waste agri-food chain. In agreement with “circular economy” principles, our approach could further provide innovative results for reducing waste load.
