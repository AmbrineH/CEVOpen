<p class="p">Two experimental fields were selected in the surroundings of Chieti, Italy (42°21′46.5′′ N 14°05′49.2′′ E, 100 m above sea level) in the old alluvial plain of the Pescara River Valley. The climate is Mediterranean, with an average yearly temperature around 15 °C and mean yearly rainfall around 750 mm. Summer can be variably dry. Total extension of the experimental crops comprises 15,000 square meters on level ground (slope 0–5%). During the two years preceding, the farm field was uncultured and mowed to obtain hay. The sowings were scheduled on the last week of March 2016 and were planned to favor the plant development during a long photoperiod and to stimulate full blooming in late summer.</p>
