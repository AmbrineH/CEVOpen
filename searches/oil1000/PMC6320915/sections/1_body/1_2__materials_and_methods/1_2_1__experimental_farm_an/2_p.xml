<p class="p">The selection of Futura 75 was done considering the local climatic and soil characteristics in relation to the evidence of the high adaptive capabilities of this variety which are useful for multi-purpose cultivation. Selected seeds were purchased from South Hemp Tecno (Taranto, Italy) and certified by SOC France (Service officiel de contrôle et de certification des semences et plants) according to the plant variety database of the European Commission in the agricultural species list (position A-85, FR 8194). Soil tillage consisted of superficial ploughing followed by disc harrowing and final milling to prepare the sowing bed. Sowing was performed using a mechanic seeder for wheat, settled to obtain a final density of 50 kg of seeds/ha. The sowing was in line every 30 cm with 10 cm between lines. No fertilizer was used and, during growth, three irrigation cycles were programmed (automatic irrigation system, each cycle 24–36 h, depending on soil water availability). Plants development was monitored weekly until the beginning of flowering, when manual collection of aerial parts from flowering plants was done. The collection was carried out every three days, starting on the first week of September up to October 2016. Immediately after harvest, the plant material was transferred to the laboratory for extraction (about 100 m away). Random samples were tested for macroscopic characteristics in order to confirm their botanical identity (done by Prof. L. Menghini).</p>
