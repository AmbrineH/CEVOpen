<p class="p">The study of traditional crops could explain their ethnobotanical relevance by means of a deep analysis of the quali-quantitative phytochemical profile. We devoted our attention to the EO of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> var. Futura 75 cultivated in Italy, due to an increment in this cropâ€™s cultivation. After the evaluation of tetrahydrocannabinol content, volatile fraction, phenolic and flavonoid pattern, and color parameters, we tested the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> aerial parts and its aromatic water against several targets of pharmaceutical interest (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp., enzymes, and cancer cell lines), along with the preliminary evaluation of its safety toward a non-cancer cell line and 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> larvae in vivo. In addition, due to the high content of naringenin, we further explored the inhibitory effects of this secondary metabolite against 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> to correlate the biological activity with the chemical composition. In particular, the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of hemp EO suggested it could be a possible candidate for the treatment of infections related to those abovementioned microorganisms. Currently, reinvigorating the antimicrobial drug pipeline is mandatory, as increasingly resistant species continue to emerge or organize themselves in accessible communities. Secondary metabolites display drug-like and metabolite-like properties, acting synergistically with validated drugs, and possessing new mechanisms of action; nevertheless, the evaluation of their safety/tolerability is strongly requested.
