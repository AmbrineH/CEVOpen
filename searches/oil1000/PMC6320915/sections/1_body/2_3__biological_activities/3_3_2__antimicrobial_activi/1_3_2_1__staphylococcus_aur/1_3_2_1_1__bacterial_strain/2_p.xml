 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains were stored at −80 °C before being thawed at room temperature and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA; Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK). Bacteria were then grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB; Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK) for 24 h at 37 °C under shaking conditions at 125 rpm (Innova 4300, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA). The overnight broth cultures were resuspended in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB, Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK) to an optical density at 550 nm (OD
