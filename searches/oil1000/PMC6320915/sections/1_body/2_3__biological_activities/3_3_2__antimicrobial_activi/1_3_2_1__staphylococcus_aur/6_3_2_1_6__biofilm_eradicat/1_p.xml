<p class="p">The treated and non-treated biofilms were washed with PBS and then dried. Biofilms were stained with 200 μL of 0.5% Gram’s crystal violet and then rinsed with PBS and dried. The biofilm biomass was quantified by destaining the biofilms for 10 min with 33% acetic acid (by volume) and by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> biofilms were grown and treated as previously described. The biofilms, treated with 24 mg/mL hemp EO or 2048 μg/mL of naringenin, and the corresponding non-treated controls were rinsed with PBS and stained with a BacLight kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The analysis was performed using a Leica DMR Fluorescent Microscope (Leica microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany). Three experiments were performed in duplicate.
