 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (AB) cell viability reagent was added to the treated and untreated broth cultures to assess the viability of bacterial cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1–4 h. The absorbance was then read at 570 nm (A
 <sub class="sub">570</sub>) and 600 nm (A
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>) on a plate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The percentage reduction of AB in the treated and non-treated samples was calculated using the formula indicated by the manufacturer. Controls consisting of (i) MHB with the test sample at different concentrations, (ii) MHB plus 10% ethanol, and (iii) just MHB were also inserted in the experiments. The AB MIC was defined as the lowest sample concentration resulting in ≤ 50% reduction of AB and a purplish/blue well 1 h after the addition of the AB as reported by Pettit et al. (2005) [
