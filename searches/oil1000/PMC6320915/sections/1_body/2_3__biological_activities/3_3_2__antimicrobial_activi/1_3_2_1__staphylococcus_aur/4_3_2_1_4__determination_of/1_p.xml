<p class="p">The antibiofilm effect of each sample was determined by the evaluation of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The MBEC was defined as the lowest concentration which completely eradicated bacterial biofilm developed in 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates. Briefly, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was grown in TSB overnight at 37 °C by shaking at 125 rpm. The overnight broth cultures were diluted to 1.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL in TSB supplemented with 1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glucose. Two hundred microliters of the diluted broth cultures were inoculated into 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under static conditions. At the end of incubation, the biofilms were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the test sample was added to the pre-formed biofilms at concentrations corresponding to 2 × MIC, 3 × MIC, and 4 × MIC of each test sample. Controls consisting of (i) 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> biofilms without the addition of the sample, (ii) TSB plus 1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glucose with the sample, (iii) TSB plus 1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glucose plus 10% ethanol, and (iv) just TSB plus 1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glucose were inserted in the experiments. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under static conditions. The inhibitory effect was measured using AB assay, crystal violet (CV) staining, and CFU counts. Three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate.
