<p class="p">The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration without visible growth. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration that induced a reduction in CFU corresponding to 99.9% compared to the initial inoculum, and was determined by spreading on MHA with 100 Î¼L of sample taken by the wells corresponding to the MIC. Controls consisting of (i) 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> broth cultures in MHB without the addition of the sample, (ii) MHB with the test sample at different concentrations, (iii) MHB plus 10% ethanol, and (iv) just MHB were also inserted in the experiments. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.
