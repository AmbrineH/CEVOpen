<p class="p">Colony-forming unit (CFU) enumeration was performed to evaluate bacterial cell viability in the biofilm and planktonic phases. One hundred microliters of sample solutions taken from the MIC and MBEC wells, as well as from the two wells before and after the MIC and MBEC wells, were used for CFU counts. Serial dilutions of the stock were performed in PBS (pH 7.2) and plated on MHA at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The same evaluation was performed in the case of the AB assay because of its non-toxic nature.</p>
