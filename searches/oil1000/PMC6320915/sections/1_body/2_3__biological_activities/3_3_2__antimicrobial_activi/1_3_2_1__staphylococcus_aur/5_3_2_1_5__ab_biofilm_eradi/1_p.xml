<p class="p">After the treatment with the test sample, the biofilms were rinsed with PBS, and AB was added following the manufacturer’s instructions. The plates were incubated for 1–4 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was read and the percentage reduction of AB in the treated and non-treated samples was calculated using the formula indicated by the manufacturer. The AB MBEC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test sample resulting in ≤ 50% reduction of AB and a purplish/blue well 1 h after the addition of the AB. Three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate.</p>
