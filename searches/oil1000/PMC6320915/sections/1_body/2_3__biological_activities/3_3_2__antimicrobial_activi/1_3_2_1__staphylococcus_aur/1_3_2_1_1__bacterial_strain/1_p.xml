<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity was evaluated on one reference strain (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 29213) and three clinical strains (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 101 TV, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 104, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 105), isolated from different sources and characterized by a different antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The samples were cultured on Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA, Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK) and on mannitol salt agar (MSA, Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK). The identification of clinical isolates was carried out on the basis of colony morphology, Gram stain, and API
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> systems (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was determined using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The antibiotic discs (erythromycin 15 μg, tetracycline 30 μg, netilimicin 30 μg, levofloxacin 5 μg, cefoxitin 30 μg, linezolid 10 μg, rifampicin 30 μg, and gentamicin 10 μg) used for susceptibility tests were supplied by Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK.
