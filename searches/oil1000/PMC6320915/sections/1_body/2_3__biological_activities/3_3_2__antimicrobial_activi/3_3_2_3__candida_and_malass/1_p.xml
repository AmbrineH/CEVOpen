<p class="p">Hemp EO was tested against four clinical isolates of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. (
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> CO23, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> DSY 562, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> 45709, and C. 
 <italic class="italic">tropicalis</italic> 47829) and four clinical isolates of 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp. including 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic> 188 and 180, 
 <italic class="italic">M. globosa</italic> 130, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. sympodialis</italic> 855. 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 30–37 °C with aeration for 24 h. 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> isolates were sub-cultured at 32 ± 2 °C for 72 h on liquid Leeming–Notman medium modified (1% peptone, 0.5% glucose, 0.01% yeast extract, 0.4% ox-bile, 0.2% glycerol, 1% whole cow’s milk, and 0.05% Tween 20). MIC was determined using the microbroth dilution method according to the NCCLS [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains and modified to support growth of lipid-dependent yeasts [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] for 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> strains. Solutions of hemp EO (100 mg/mL) were prepared in RPMI-1640 supplemented with Tween 80 (final concentration of 0.001% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Briefly, to determine the MIC of EO for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains, RPMI-1640 supplemented with 3-(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) at pH 7 was used. For 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp., the RPMI-1640 medium was supplemented with glucose (1.8%), peptone (1%), ox-bile (0.5%), malt extract (0.5%), Tween 20 (0.5%), Tween 80 (0.05%), and glycerol (1%). The dilution, ranging from 12 to 12480 µg/mL of EO, was prepared in 96-well plates. The inoculum size was about 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/mL. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h or at 32 °C for 72 h for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp., respectively.
