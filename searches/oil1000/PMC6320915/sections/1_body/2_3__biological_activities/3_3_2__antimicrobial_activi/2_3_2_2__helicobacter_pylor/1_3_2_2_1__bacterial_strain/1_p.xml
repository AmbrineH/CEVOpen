<p class="p">Fourteen clinical strains of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic>, with different antibiotic susceptibility patterns, isolated from patients with duodenal ulcer or gastritis, were used for this study. In particular, three strains highly resistant to metronidazole (MNZ; MIC &gt; 8 µg/mL), four resistant to clarithromycin (CLR; MIC &gt; 0.5 µg/mL), four resistant to both MNZ and CLR, and three susceptible to CLR, MNZ, and amoxicillin (AMX) (MIC ≤ 0.125 µg/mL), on the basis of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints were classified. A reference strain of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori</italic> (ATCC 43629) was used as the control. The strains were maintained at −80 °C in Wilkins–Chalgren broth (Difco, BD, San Jose, CA, USA) with 10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) horse serum (Seromed, Biocrhom, Germany) and 20% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glycerol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) until required for experiments. Before being used, the strains were subcultured twice on Columbia agar base (Difco, BD, San Jose, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 0.25% bacto yeast extract (Difco, BD, San Jose, CA, USA). Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO
