<p class="p">MICs for Hemp EO and naringenin were determined using a modified broth dilution method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of the test samples were prepared in a 96-well microtiter plate containing 100 µL of MegaCell™ Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI-1640) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, ST Louis, MO, USA) with 3% fetal calf serum (FCS). An inoculum equivalent to one McFarland standard was prepared in Wilkins–Chalgren broth and diluted in MegaCell™ RPMI-1640 medium with 3% FCS. Each well was inoculated with

 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under microaerophilic conditions (10% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a gas incubator) and examined after 72 h of incubation. For the MBC, aliquots (10 µL) of suspensions without visible growth were spotted on Columbia agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 3–5 days under microaerophilic conditions.
