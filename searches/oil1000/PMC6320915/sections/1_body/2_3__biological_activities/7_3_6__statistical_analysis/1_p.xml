<p class="p">The statistical significance of difference between controls and experimental groups for the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test. Results of the anti-proliferative activity were expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism™ (Version 5.00) software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test, was used to verify the significance level of a response with respect to the vehicle control. A
