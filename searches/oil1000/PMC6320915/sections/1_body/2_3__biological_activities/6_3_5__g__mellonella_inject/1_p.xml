<p class="p">Ten larvae (250–320 mg each) of 
 <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> were selected at random for each step in the procedure. Different concentrations from 0.78 to 6.25 mg/mL hemp EO in PBS buffer added with 0.01% Tween 20 were injected into the hemocoel through the last left proleg (Hamilton syringe 701N; volume, 10 μL; needle size, 26 s; cone tip; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) [

After injection, larvae were incubated in petri dishes at 37 °C in standard aerobic conditions and survival was recorded at 24-h intervals for five days. Larvae were considered dead when they displayed no movement in response to gentle prodding with a pipette tip. Studies included one group that did not receive injection and one group that was injected with PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20 as a control. Each experiment was repeated three times.
