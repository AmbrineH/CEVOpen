<p class="p">Test solution (50 µL) was mixed with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; 125 µL) and enzyme solution (AChE or BChE) solution (25 µL) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was then initiated with the addition of the corresponding substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) or butyrylthiocholine chloride (BTCl), 25 µL). Similarly, a blank was prepared without the enzyme (AChE or BChE) solution. The absorbances of sample and blank were noted at 405 nm after 10-min incubation at 25 °C. Results are expressed as milligrams of galantamine equivalent per gram of extract (GALAE/g extract) [
