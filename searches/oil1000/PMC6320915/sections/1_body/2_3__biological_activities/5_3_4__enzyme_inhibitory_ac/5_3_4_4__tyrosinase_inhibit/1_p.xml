<p class="p">Test solution (25 µL) was mixed with tyrosinase solution (40 µL) and phosphate buffer (100 µL, pH 6.8) in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was then initiated with 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-DOPA; 40 µL). Similarly, a blank was prepared (without the enzyme solution). The absorbances of sample and blank were recorded at 492 nm after 10-min incubation at the room temperature. Results are expressed as milligrams of kojic acid equivalent per gram of extract (KAE/g extract) [
