<p class="p">Porcine pancreatic lipase (type-II) activity was performed using 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-NPB) as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-03266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The enzyme solution (1 mg/mL) was prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). An aliquot of 25 µL was mixed with a lipase solution (50 µL) in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-NPB (5 mM, 50 µL). Similarly, a blank sample (prepared in the same manner but without the extract) was prepared and analyzed according to this procedure. Results are expressed as milligrams of orlistat equivalent per gram of extract (OE/g extract).
