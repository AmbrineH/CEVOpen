 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucuronide (PNPG; 50 µL) in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Similarly, a blank was prepared without the enzyme solution. The reaction was stopped with sodium carbonate (50 µL, 0.2 M) and the absorbances of sample and blank were noted at 400 nm. Results are expressed as millimoles of acarbose equivalent per gram of extract (ACAE/g extract) [
