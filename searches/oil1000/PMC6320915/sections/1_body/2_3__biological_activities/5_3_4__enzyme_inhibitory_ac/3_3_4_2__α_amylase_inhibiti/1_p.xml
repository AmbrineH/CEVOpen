<p class="p">An aliquot of the test solution (25 µL) was mixed with α-amylase solution (50 µL) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.9 with 6 mM sodium chloride) in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was then initiated with the addition of starch solution (50 µL, 0.05%). Similarly, a blank was prepared without the enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated 10 min at 37 °C, stopped with the addition of HCl (25 µL, 1 M), and then the iodine/potassium iodide solution was added (100 µL). The absorbances of sample and blank were calculated at 630 nm. The absorbance of the blank was subtracted from that of the sample. Results are expressed as millimoles of acarbose equivalent per gram of extract (ACAE/g extract) [
