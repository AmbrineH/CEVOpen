<p class="p">The human estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines were kindly provided by Prof. Eufemi (Dept. of Biochemical Science Rossi Fanelli, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy), while colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA). Furthermore, the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line (Mz-ChA-1) from human gallbladder along with nonmalignant, immortalized cholangiocytes (H69) were kindly gifted by Prof. G. Alpini (Texas A&amp;M University, Temple, TX, USA). MCF7, MDA-MB-468, and Caco-2 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator in Connaught Medical Research Laboratories 1066 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin, gentamycin, and streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. At last, the nonmalignant cholangiocytes H69 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (3:1), supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin, plus the following: 1.8 × 10
