<p class="p">Each test solution (2 mL) was added to FeCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution (0.05 mL, 2 mM). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mM ferrozine (0.2 mL). Similarly, a blank was prepared using test solution (2 mL), FeCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution (0.05 mL, 2 mM), and water (0.2 mL). Then, the absorbances of sample and blank were noted at 562 nm after 10-min incubation at room temperature. Results are expressed as milligrams of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) equivalent per gram of extract (EDTAE/g extract) [
