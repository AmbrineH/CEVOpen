<p class="p">The 2,2-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) radical cation was produced in situ by reacting 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate and allowing the mixture to stand for 12–16 h in the dark at the room temperature. Firstly, ABTS solution was diluted with methanol to an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. Each test solution (1 mL) was mixed with ABTS solution (2 mL). The sample absorbance was noted at 734 nm after 30-min incubation at room temperature. Results are expressed as milligrams of trolox equivalent per gram of extract (TE/g extract) [
