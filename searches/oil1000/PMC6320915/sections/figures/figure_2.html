 <p> The evaluation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the hemp EO versus Staphylococcus aureus determined using the alamarBlue ® (AB) assay. ( A) Representative image of colorimetric MIC determination using AB at 24 h of incubation. The white rectangle indicates the MICs at 8 mg/mL S. aureus 101. ( B) The plot shows the percentage reduction of AB in the S. aureus broth cultures at different hemp EO concentrations compared to the corresponding untreated samples (0) evaluated as indicated in the experimental section of this manuscript. MHB: Mueller–Hinton broth; EtOH: ethanol. Data are presented as the mean of three replicates of three independent experiments. </p>
