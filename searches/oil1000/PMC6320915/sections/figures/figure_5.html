 <p> Survival curves of Galleria mellonella larvae after hemp EO treatment. Each data point represents the percent survival of G. mellonella larvae ( N = 10/group, repeated on three different occasions), following injection with test samples and incubation at 37 Â°C. Control larvae were not injected or injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus Tween 20 to simulate the trauma associated with the administration. Larvae were monitored for 24 h up to five days. </p>
