 <p> The evaluation of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of the hemp EO versus Staphylococcus aureus biofilm determined using the AB assay, live/dead staining, and fluorescent microscopy analysis and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. ( A) Representative image of colorimetric MBEC determination using AB. The white rectangles indicate the MBECs at 24 mg/mL S. aureus 105. ( B) The plot shows the percent reduction of AB in the S. aureus broth cultures at different hemp EO concentrations compared to the corresponding untreated samples (0) evaluated as indicated in Section 2. ( C) CFU count of treated and untreated S. aureus biofilms. ( D) Representative image of S. aureus ( a) untreated and ( b) treated biofilms with 24 mg/mL hemp EO. The biofilms were stained with a live/dead kit and visualized using fluorescent microscopy. The green fluorescence indicates live cells, whereas the red fluorescence indicates dead cells or cells with a compromised cell wall. TSB: tryptic soy broth; GLU: glucose. Data are presented as the mean of three replicates of three independent experiments; * p Ë‚ 0.05 vs. the controls (0). </p>
