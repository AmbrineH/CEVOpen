  <p class="p">Survival curves of 
   <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae after hemp EO treatment. Each data point represents the percent survival of 
   <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> larvae (
   <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10/group, repeated on three different occasions), following injection with test samples and incubation at 37 Â°C. Control larvae were not injected or injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus Tween 20 to simulate the trauma associated with the administration. Larvae were monitored for 24 h up to five days.
