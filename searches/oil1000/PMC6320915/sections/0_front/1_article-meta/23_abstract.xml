 <p class="p">Due to renewed interest in the cultivation and production of Italian 
  <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> L., we proposed a multi-methodological approach to explore chemically and biologically both the essential oil and the aromatic water of this plant. We reported the chemical composition in terms of cannabinoid content, volatile component, phenolic and flavonoid pattern, and color characteristics. Then, we demonstrated the ethnopharmacological relevance of this plant cultivated in Italy as a source of antioxidant compounds toward a large panel of enzymes (pancreatic lipase, α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and cholinesterases) and selected clinically relevant, multidrug-sensible, and multidrug-resistant microbial strains (
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> spp.), evaluating the cytotoxic effects against normal and malignant cell lines. Preliminary in vivo cytotoxicity was also performed on 
  <italic class="italic">Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae. The results corroborate the use of this natural product as a rich source of important biologically active molecules with particular emphasis on the role exerted by naringenin, one of the most important secondary metabolites.
