<p class="p">Chiral gas chromatography has been used as an analytical technique to detect outliers from authenticated oils and the possible adulteration of commercially important essential oils [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Since 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> has the potential for commercial utilization, this study serves to establish the enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in authentic unadulterated 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> essential oils. In addition, this work provides a comparison between 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> and other members of the Burseraceae (
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> spp.).
