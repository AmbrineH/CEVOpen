<p class="p">A previous examination of 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> oils from aerial parts and flowering tops collected in Makkah, Saudi Arabia showed a complete absence of monoterpene hydrocarbons, but there were high concentrations of terpinen-4-ol (8.5% and 9.8%), and of sesquiterpenoids: δ-cadinene (5.0% and 4.8%), α-calacorene (9.4% and 3.8%), viridiflorol (4.6% and 4.4%), τ-muurolol (4.5% and 3.5%), and cadalene (4.3% and 5.4%) [

 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> oil from leaves and fruits from Ein Gedi, Israel showed high concentrations of α-pinene (7.2%) and sabinene (21.1%), and richness in sesquiterpenes (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (20.1%) and germacrene D (19.6%) [
 <xref rid="B18-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The high concentrations of sesquiterpenes in these earlier studies are in marked contrast to the 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> oils examined in the present study, suggesting a wide variation of essential oil compositions within the population of this plant species.
