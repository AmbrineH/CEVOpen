 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> were analyzed by GC-MS using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV) with a scan range of 40–400 amu and a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s, and GC-MS solution software. The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), 30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter, with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm. The carrier gas was helium, with a column head pressure of 552 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. Injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature program was set for an initial temperature of 50 °C and increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 5%
