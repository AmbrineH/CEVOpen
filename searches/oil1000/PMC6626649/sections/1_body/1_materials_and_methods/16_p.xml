 <bold class="bold">Microbiological analyses. </bold>To conduct microbial tests, 10 g of fish samples (from each treatment) were sampled with scalpel in sterile conditions, transferred to a 90-millimeter pepton water (Merck Millipore) 0.10% and homogenized in a stomacher (Seward, Sussex, UK) at 250 rpm for 2 min.

 </sup> Then, the next dilutions were prepared in pipettes containing 0.10 percent peptone water. For microbial enumeration, different dilutions of the samples were prepared and then 100 microlitres of each dilution were spread on the desired agar medium. Counting of mesophilic bacteria and enterobacteriaceae was performed using plate count agar (Merck Millipore) and viollet red bile agar (Merck Millipore), respectively. After inoculation, the plates were incubated at 37 ˚C for 48 hr.

 </sup> King agar and citramide agar (Merck Millipore) culture media were used for enumeration of total psychrotrophic bacteria (TPC) and Pseudomonas bacteria, respectively. Then, plates were incubated at 21 ˚C for 48 hr for psychrotrophic bacteria count and at 37 ˚C for 48 hr for pseudomonas bacteria count.
