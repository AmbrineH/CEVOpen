 <bold class="bold">Determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). </bold>The TBARS test was performed according to Wrolstad 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> method.
 <sup class="sup">17</sup> Briefly, 10 g of fish samples were homogenized with 1.00 mL butylated hydroxytoluene (0.10%; Merck Millipore) and 20 mL trichloroacetic acid (5.00%; Merck Millipore) at 13500 rpm for 1 min. Then, the solution was filtered with No. 42 filter (Whatman, Pleasanton, USA) and its volume was minimized with 50 mL of trichloroacetic acid (Merck Millipore). Five-mL samples were mixed with 5 mL of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reagent (0.02M; Merck Millipore), vortexed and placed at 100 ËšC for 1 hr and the optical absorbance was measured at 532 nm with a spectrophotometer (S2100; Unico Dayton, USA,) after cooling. The TBARS values were expressed as mg malondialdehyde (MDA) per kg of fish.
