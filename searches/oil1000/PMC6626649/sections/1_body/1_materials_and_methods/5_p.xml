<p class="p">Randomly selected fish samples were immersed in prepared solutions for 2 min and dried. Finally, fish specimens were stored in a refrigerator after packaging in plastic bags (4.00 ± 0.50 ˚C). Fish samples were prepared in 6 treatments as follows: 1) uncoated fish without vacuum (C); 2) uncoated fish and vacuum (CV); 3) fish covered with zein and no vacuum (ZV); 4) zein coating with 2.00% extract (g extract per g zein solution; ZEX); 5) zein coating with 1.00% EO (g EO per g zein solution; ZEO) and 6) treated samples with zein coating containing 1.00% EO and 1.00% extract (ZEXO). Samples were evaluated for chemical, microbial and sensorial quality parameters after 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. </p>
