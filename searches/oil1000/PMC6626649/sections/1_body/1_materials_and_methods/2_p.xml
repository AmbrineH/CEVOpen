<p class="p">For plant extract preparation, the stems and leaves of the plant were dried in shade at ambient temperature, pulverized by the mill and passed through a 60-mesh sieve. Two hundred gram of powder was dissolved in 1 L of ethanol (Merck Millipore, Burlington, USA) and water (70 to 30 V/V) and placed in a shaker (KS 4000i control; IKA Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) with a round of 150 rpm for 24 hr. Afterwards, the solution was passed through a filter paper and then placed in a rotary machine (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) to remove at least 90.00% of the solvent. Finally, it was placed in an oven (D-645, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) at 45 ˚C for final condensation and stored in a refrigerator at 4 ˚C.
