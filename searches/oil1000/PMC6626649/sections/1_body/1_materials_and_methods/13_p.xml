 </sup> First, 0.20 g of the fat extracted from samples was mixed with 9.80 mL of chloroform-methanol (Merck Millipore; 7 to 3 ratio). Then, 0.05 mL of ammonium thiocyanate solution (Merck Millipore; 10 mM) was added and the sample was vortexed for 2-4 sec. After that, 0.05 mL of iron chloride solution II (Merck Millipore) was added to the sample. The mixture was then kept at room temperature for 5 min and absorbance was read at 500 nm using the spectro-photometer (Unico). After drawing the standard curve and using the following formula for calculation, POV was expressed as mg of peroxide per kg of fat:
