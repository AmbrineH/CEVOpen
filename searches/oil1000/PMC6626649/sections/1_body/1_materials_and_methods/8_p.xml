 <bold class="bold">Measurement of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). </bold>Total volatile basic nitrogen was determined according to a modified micro-Kjeldahl distillation technique. Ten gram of fish sample was homogeneously mixed with 300 mL distilled water and 2 g of MgO (Merck Millipore). First, the distillation was carried out in a flask containing boric acid (2.00%; Merck Millipore) and a few drops of methyl red as an indicator. Finally, the contents of the flask were titrated with a 0.01 M sulfuric acid solution (Merck Millipore). The amount of TVB-N was according to the consumed amount of sulfuric acid and expressed as mg of nitrogen per 100 g of fish.
