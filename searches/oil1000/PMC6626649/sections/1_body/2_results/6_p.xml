 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref> shows the amount of FFAs during storage. The FFAs production was increased from an initial level of 1.97 to a final value of 6.34. According to the results, FFAs in the control sample were significantly higher than other groups. The results showed that EO or extract and combination treatments had a significant difference with control group, vacuum and zein in most storage days. There was also a significant difference between the zein-containing EO and extracts.
