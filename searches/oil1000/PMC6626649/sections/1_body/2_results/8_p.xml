 <bold class="bold">Microbiological analyses results. </bold>The changes in microbial count in trout samples during storage at 4 ËšC are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The control group had the highest total psychrophilic bacteria counts (TPC), so that the total viable counts in the control group were significantly higher in all days than the other groups. On the last day of the storage, the amount of pseudomonads counts from the highest to the lowest was respectively as follows: control, CV, ZV, ZEX, ZEO and ZEXO. In zein coating treatments containing EO, extract and the combination, the microbial growth process was not completely regular. Although the inhibitory effect of the combined treatment was better than the other treatments until the 9
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day, on the last day of the storage, the treatment of zein coating containing EO had a greater inhibitory effect.
