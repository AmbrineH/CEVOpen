<p class="p">In relation to the entero-bacteriaceae count results, similar to other microbial tests, the control treatment had significantly more bacteria than other treatments. There was a significant difference among treated treatments in the last day and ZEX, ZEO and ZEXO had significantly lower total viable counts than controls, vacuum and zein coating treatment. According to the psychrotrophic bacteria results, the control samples were reached to maximum limit before the day 6, while the amounts of these bacteria in the treated samples were below the proposed limit at the end of the storage period being significantly lower than the control sample. Comparison of psychrotrophic bacteria levels among control and other treatments showed that the control sample had more bacteria in all studied periods. </p>
