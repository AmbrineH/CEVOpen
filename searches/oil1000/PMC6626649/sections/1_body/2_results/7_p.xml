 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> indicating the changes in TBA, at the beginning of the experiment, the TBA of rainbow trout meat was about 0.02-0.03 in all treatments. According to the results, at the end of the storage period, the highest TBA was related to the control sample and the lowest TBA was observed in the fish containing EO and extract.
