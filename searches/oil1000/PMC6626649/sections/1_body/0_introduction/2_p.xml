 </sup> Corn proteins are unique in comparison with many of the plant proteins used for coatings and films. Zein is a prolamine protein extracted from corn gluten. This compound has a high percentage of non-polar amino acids and a small amount of acidic and basic amino acids. As a result, it is insoluble in water and is dissolving only in organic solvents. Since zein acts as a barrier against oxygen and moisture penetration, it is used as a coating for candy, dry fruits and meat.
