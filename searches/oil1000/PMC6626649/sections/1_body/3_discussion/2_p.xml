<p class="p">One of the most varied factors during the fish storage period is pH, which can be considered as an indicator of the fish freshness being low in its early storage, but it has been shown to increase in fish muscle during storage due to the development of nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, trimethylamine or other nitrogen compounds through the act of internal or microbial enzymes.

 </sup> After death, the pH changes in the range of 5.40 to 7.20 depending on the fish species.

 </sup> The difference among the control sample and other samples on day 9 and day 12 was significant. On the other hand, the difference among these treatments was not significant throughout the storage period. In relation with pH, it has been reported that the increasing trend of pH is inhibited in trout coated with chitosan-containing thyme EO.

 </sup> Also, the use of clove EO has been able to keep the cod fish fillet pH below 7.00.
