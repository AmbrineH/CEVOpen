<p class="p">Another indicator widely used to examine the degree of lipids oxidation is TBARS using to measure MDA. The MDA is formed by hydroperoxides, which are the primary product of the reaction of USFAs with oxygen.

 </sup> The TBA content of the samples gradually increased during storage. The increase in this index during storage may be due to a partial dehydration of the fish and an increase in the USFAs oxidation.

 </sup> There was no significant difference among groups until the third day and significant changes in control treatment and other treatments started from day 6. It has been shown that the antioxidant activity of EO and extracts is related to the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds through mechanisms such as radical chains formation prevention, attaching to the intermediate metal ion catalysts, peroxides decomposition and reacting with free radicals.
