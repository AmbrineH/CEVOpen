<p class="p">Enterobacteriaceae were also another group of bacteria involved in rainbow trout spoilage during refrigerated storage. The results showed that storage time has been effective in the bacterial population, therefore, the amount of bacteria in the treatments increased compared to the day 0, but this increase was irregular. In a previous study on the combined effect of salting, oregano EO and vacuum packaging on the storage time of salmon stored in the refrigerator, bacteria were reduced in salt-based treatments and vacuum-packaging containing oregano EO.
