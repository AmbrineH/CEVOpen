<p class="p">Sensory evaluation is a simple method that can provide information about the fish freshness and quality in a short term. The sensory properties of the fish are clearly visible to the customer and play an important role in obtaining customer consent.

 </sup> In general, during this period, the control group received less privilege than other treatments. Meanwhile, treatments covered with zein containing EO and extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. affinis</italic> were accepted by panelists until the 12
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day and this confirms the results of microbial and chemical factors, because in all chemical and microbiological experiments, the EO and extract treatments quality was significantly less decreased compared to the control group. Coating of fish fillets using biopolymer and incorporation active plant intercepts quality loss signs including off-flavor and odor developments and sensory defects.
