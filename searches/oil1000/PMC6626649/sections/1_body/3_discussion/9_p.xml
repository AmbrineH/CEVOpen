<p class="p">The most important fish spoilage microorganisms are Gram-negative bacteria, which are initially pseudomonas species that anaerobic condition inhibits their growth. However, Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Photobacteriumn phosphoreum </italic>are known to be responsible for fish spoilage in anaerobic conditions.

 </sup> Pseudomonads count was higher in the control group than other groups. As is known, the levels of Pseudomonas bacteria in the samples treated with EO or extract were significantly lower than other treatments and the inhibitory effects of EO and extracts on bacteria were visible. This was probably due to the combined effects of EO and extract. The results of this study are similar to the results of researches investigating the effect of EO and plant extracts on fish meat spoilage.

 </sup> Difference was not significant among ZEX, ZEO and ZEXO treatments until day 9, but in the final days of the storage, combined treatment had greater inhibitory effect.
