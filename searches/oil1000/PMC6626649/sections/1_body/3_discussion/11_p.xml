<p class="p">Psychrotrophic bacteria as Gram-negative bacteria are the most important group of aerobic microorganisms responsible for spoilage of fresh fish stored in cold temperatures.
 <sup class="sup">1</sup> Psychrotrophic bacteria are so important because they are the major factors causing changes in odor, texture and flavor as a result of various metabolic compounds such as ketones, aldehydes and amines biogenic volatile sulfides.

 </sup> The maximum limit proposed for psychrotrophic bacteria is seven logs in rainbow trout. Also, by comparing the results, it can be concluded that in treatment with zein coating with EO, the psychrotrophic bacteria had a slower growth than other treatments. At the end of the storage period, the zein coating containing EO had the least amount of bacteria. This is due to the antimicrobial effects of the EO. The major antimicrobial compounds of plants are phenolic compounds having phenolic groups.
