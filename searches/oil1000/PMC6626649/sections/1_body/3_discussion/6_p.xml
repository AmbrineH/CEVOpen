<p class="p">Free fatty acids are produced during storage due to the enzymatic hydrolysis of lipid esters. After further oxidative changes, FFAs turn into compounds with a low molecular weight having an unpleasant smell and taste in fish. In addition, FFAs are smaller than triglyceride and phospholipid and their oxidation rate is higher. Additionally, FFAs have a great influence on protein denaturation and tissue degradation through the interaction with proteins.
