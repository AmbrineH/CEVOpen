<p class="p">Microorganisms are the main reasons of food spoilage. As regards, it is accepted that the initial microbial load of freshwater fish depends on the water and temperature conditions. Several reports have indicated the initial count of total viable counts for different species of freshwater fish (including rainbow trout and silver perch) within the range of 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">6 </sup>log CFU g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>.

 </sup> There are different reports about the time to reach the acceptable level of fish microbial load. It has been reported that the total bacterial load of salmon fillet reaches 7 log CFU g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> during the four days of storage in the refrigerator.

 </sup> It has also been reported that the total microbial count in the salmon fillet reaches more than 7 logs after 12 days.

 <sup class="sup">33</sup> In the present study, the total viable counts in the control sample were 7 logs after 6 days of storage, which is in agreement with previous findings.
