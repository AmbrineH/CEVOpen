<p class="p">This study showed that the use of biodegradable zein coatings containing EO and extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P.</italic>
 <italic class="italic">affinis</italic> had a significant inhibitory effect on microbial growth and decreased undesirable changes of sensory and chemical qualities. It maintained the sensory properties of fish and extended the shelf life of fish in at least 6 days compared to control group. Further studies are necessary and useful to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of EO and plant extracts in fish and marine products. These compounds can be aÂ good alternative to synthetic materials to preserve fish meat.
