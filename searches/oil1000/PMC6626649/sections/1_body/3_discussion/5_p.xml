<p class="p">Fatty fish are more susceptible to lipid oxidation due to unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs). Lipid oxidation is a major cause of fish rancidity and flavor deterioration. In this regard, the POV is used to determine hydro peroxides as the primary products of fat oxidation in fish.

 </sup> The POV was increased during storage for all treatments. This increase was more intense in the control treatment, which is consistent with other researchers’ findings in this regard.

 </sup> The EO and extract coatings have the ability to reduce the amount of fish oxidation, which could be due to the antioxidant properties of the extract and EO and their antimicrobial effects on bacterial enzymatic reactions related to fish fat oxidation. In addition, the amount of peroxide in combination treatment was significantly less than EO and extracts treatment. It has been reported that the amount of peroxide in the fish covered with nisin and rosemary extract is significantly lower than the control treatment. These findings are in agreement with the current research results.
