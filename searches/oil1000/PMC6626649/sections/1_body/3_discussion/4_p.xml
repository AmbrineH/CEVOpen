 </sup> At the end of the storage time, the zein coating containing EO and extract and combination of them was significantly different from other treatments, but this difference was not seen between treatments containing EO or extract. In a previous study on the effect of grape seed enriched with oregano and thyme EO on the survival time of salmon at refrigerator temperatures, the treatments significantly reduced the volatile nitrogen bases production at the time of storage.

 </sup> The amount of 35 mg N per 100 g is considered as the highest acceptable level for the fresh fish by the European Commission. It has been suggested that the amount of 25 mg nitrogen per 100 g would be the beginning of corruption for the rainbow trout fillet.

 </sup> In the present study, the level did not exceed in the treatments containing EO, extract and the combination of them. In our study, the TVB-N for coated treatments was less than acceptable level (35 mg N per 100 g), while it was unacceptable for control and vacuum treatment from day 6.
