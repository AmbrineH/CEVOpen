<p class="p">Bioassays were conducted using field-collected samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic> from Peoria, IL. 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> egg rafts were collected using ovitraps baited with grass infusion prepared by fermenting approximately 500 g of fresh grass clippings in 160 liters of tap water for 5 d (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reiter 1986</xref>). Egg rafts from multiple locations were hatched individually in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water held in tripour beakers and supplemented with 0.1 g of Tetramin fish food (Spectrum Brands Inc., Blacksburg, VA). The containers were maintained at 26Â°C, 70% relative humidity, and 10:14 light: dark cycle. At first instar stage, a single larva from each container was identified either as 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic> based on the presence of a clear scale anterior to the sclerotized egg-breaker which is lacking in 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> but present in 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crabtree et al. 1995</xref>). The species identity was further confirmed at the third instar stage based on the arrangement and morphology of setae on the siphon. For each species, late third instar larvae from all locations were pooled for use in bioassays.
