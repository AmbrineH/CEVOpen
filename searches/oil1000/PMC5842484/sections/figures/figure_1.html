 <p> Effects of CUS and intraperitoneal treatment with saline, oregano essential oil (0.2 mL/kg), diazepam (3 mg/kg), and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) on the immobility time in (A), forced swimming test and (B), sucrose preference test. Each point represents mean Â± SEM ( n = 7). *, **, and *** indicate significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) from baseline values; # and ## indicate significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) from CUS day 10 in both experiments. (Base), baseline values; (CUS), chronic unpredictable stress; (CUS d10), measurements at the time point 10 days after beginning of stress exposure; (Saline), saline; (OEO): oregano essential oil; (FLX), fluoxetine; (DZ), diazepam. </p>
