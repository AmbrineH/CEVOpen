<p class="p">Based on our results, 24 days chronic unpredictable stress exposure up regulates TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA expression levels both at the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the male rats. Although there is some positive correlation between mRNA and protein expression, a combination of genomic and proteomic experiments leads to definite results. There is increasing attention to TLRS due to their potential role in neuropsychiatric disease.</p>
