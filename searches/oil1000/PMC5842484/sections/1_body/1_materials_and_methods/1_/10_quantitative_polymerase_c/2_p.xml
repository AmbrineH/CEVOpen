<p class="p">The 2× universal master mix (Takara, Japane) was used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. The amplification program was as follows: a denaturation step of 30 s at 95 °C and 35 cycles for real-time PCR including 5 s at 95 °C (denaturation), 30 s at 62 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (polymerase elongation). A final melting curve of fluorescence

To confirm the amplification specificity of the PCR, products from each primer pairs, in addition to melting curve analysis, were subjected to subsequent agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis.
