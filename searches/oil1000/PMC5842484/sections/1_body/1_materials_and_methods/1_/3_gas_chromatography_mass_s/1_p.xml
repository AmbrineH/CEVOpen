<p class="p">Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5973 connected with a mass detector HP 6890 fitted with a HP-1 column (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). Helium (at a flow rate 1 mL/min) was used as a carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was programmed 40 °C and then raised at a rate of 3 °C/min to 250 °C; injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization at 70 eV. The identification of the components of the essential oil was accomplished by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra with those of authentic samples also with NIST mass spectral library or those reported in the literature data (
