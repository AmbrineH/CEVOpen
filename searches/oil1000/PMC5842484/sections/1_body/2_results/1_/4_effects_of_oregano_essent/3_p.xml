 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> showed the effects of the CUS and injection of OEO on expression of TLR4 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4 A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">B</xref>, CUS increased the expression of TLR4 mRNA in the prefrontal and hippocampus (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to control group. These increases were not reversed by chronic administration of OEO. Thus, a significant difference was observed between CUS + OEO compared to control group (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
