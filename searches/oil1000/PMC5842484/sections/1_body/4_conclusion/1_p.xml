<p class="p">In conclusion, our study shows that the exposure of rats to chronic unpredictable stress results in the development of depressive-like behavior and high expression of TLR2/4 mRNA levels in the brain. In spite of the antidepressant-like activity, stress-induced TLR-2/4 upregulation is not prevented by the OEO treatments. It seems that further research is required to clarify the effect of OEO on neuroinflammations.</p>
