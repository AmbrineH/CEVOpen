<p class="p">When designing different formulations to improve the bioavailability of an oral vitamin, it is essential that the carrier stabilizes the vitamin and improves its transport into circulation. This review summarized recent advances in the use of vitamin-loaded lipid-based nanocarriers that were designed to enhance oral bioavailability. The selection of the carrier is important, and it should ideally provide maximal activity and minimal side effects. The use of lipid nanoparticles has numerous advantages over conventional formulations for dosing of vitamins, because they are more stable, they can provide sustained release, they can target different tissues, and they provide increased bioavailability. Some important limitations of conventional formulations, such as low solubility and poor epithelium permeation, can also be resolved by the use of lipid nanocarriers. Self-assembled lipid nanoparticles are frequently utilized to improve the oral delivery of vitamins. The type of emulsifier, particle size, interfacial composition, and vitamin concentration are the major factors that impact oral absorption. The comparison of different lipid-based nanoparticles used for enhancing oral vitamin delivery is summarized in

Our introduction and description of the lipid-based nanocarriers that are used for vitamin delivery provide an overview for investigators who are attempting to design feasible and efficient delivery systems for vitamins and other bioactive agents. In the near future, it may be possible to extend the use of lipid nanoparticles by using them as vehicles for other functional nutrients.
