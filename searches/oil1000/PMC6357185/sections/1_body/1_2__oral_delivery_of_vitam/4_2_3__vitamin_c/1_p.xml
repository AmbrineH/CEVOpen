<p class="p">Vitamin C is the only water-soluble vitamin not in the vitamin B group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00068-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>C). It is one of the most essential vitamins and it has roles in many physiological processes, including immune response and iron absorption [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Vitamin C is abundant in many fruits and vegetables, such as mango, kiwi fruit, papaya, lettuce, tomato, and strawberry. Vitamin C is also a strong antioxidant that can reduce oxidative stress. Vitamin C may improve physiological function by increasing baroreflex sensitivity, ameliorating vascular conductance, decreasing systemic inflammation, reducing cancer cell-specific toxicity, and augmenting the inotropic response to Î²-adrenergic stimulation [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Oral administration is always less effective than intravenous administration because of the low bioavailability of this vitamin [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters 1 and 2 are important for intestinal vitamin C absorption and renal reabsorption. Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 also promotes the entry of vitamin C into the most metabolically active tissues and cells [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Thus, the rate of intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption and excretion greatly impact the bioavailability of vitamin C.
