<p class="p">Molecules in the vitamin E group, which function as antioxidants and free radical scavengers, include four tocopherols (α, β, γ, and δ) and four corresponding unsaturated tocotrienols (

 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In general, α-tocopherol has greater bioactivity than β- and γ-tocopherol (15 to 30% of α-tocopherol activity), and δ-tocopherol has very little bioactivity. Among the tocotrienols, only the α and β forms appear to have significant activity [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Oral absorption of vitamin E is considered to occur by passive transport across the enterocyte apical membrane [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], predominantly in the distal region of the small intestine (distal jejunum and ileum). The three vitamin D transporters (SR-BI, NPC1L1, and CD36) also function in vitamin E absorption. Vitamin E is also absorbed through the lymphatic system, where it diffuses as lipoprotein complex [
 <xref rid="B45-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In particular, the lipoprotein complex that is formed by mixing vitamin E, bile salt micelles, and chylomicron is too large to pass across blood capillary, and it is only transported via the lymphatic system.
