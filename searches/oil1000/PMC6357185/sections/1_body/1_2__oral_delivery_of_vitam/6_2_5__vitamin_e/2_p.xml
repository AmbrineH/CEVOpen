<p class="p">In United States, the RDA for vitamin E is 15 mg, but more than 90% of the population does not consume this amount [

 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. An increasing number of investigations have attempted to increase vitamin E bioavailability by the use of nanoparticles. Encapsulation of vitamin E within nanoparticles can impede its interactions with other fat-soluble vitamins, which would otherwise inhibit vitamin E absorption.
