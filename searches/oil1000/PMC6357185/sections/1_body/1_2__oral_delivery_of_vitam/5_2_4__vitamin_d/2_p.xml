<p class="p">Oral vitamin D absorption requires scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), N-terminal Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), like intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1L1), and cluster of differentiation (CD36) [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. These three trans-membrane proteins primarily function as cholesterol transporters in the intestine. Although use of oral vitamin D supplements is a low-cost and practical method to treat deficiency, clinical advancements of vitamin D administration are limited by its lipophilic character, low solubility in GI fluid, and low bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, the facile degradation of vitamin D by light, air, and heat limits the practicability of oral vitamin D. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new formulations of vitamin D.
