<p class="p">Vitamins B and C are water-soluble molecules that function as cofactors for many enzymes. The vitamin B group consists of B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, and related derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00068-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B). Among these, B1, B2, B3, B6, and B12 play important roles in disease prevention. For example, vitamin B1 is a cofactor of dehydrogenase and transketolase; polyneuritis, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and colon cancer are linked to B1 deficiency [

Vitamin B2 is a precursor to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are cofactors for flavoenzymes, a large group of oxidoreductases. B2 deficiency can cause mucosal disorders, skin disorders, and anemia. Vitamin B3 is the precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and B3 deficiency is associated with pellagra, depression, and dementia. Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for enzymes that function in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids [

Vitamin B12 has a complex structure, with a corrin ring and an embedded cobalt ion. This vitamin is important for erythrocyte formation, nerve cell maintenance, and DNA synthesis. B12 deficiency may lead to megaloblastic anemia. Dairy products are the major dietary sources of vitamin B12, although this vitamin has bioavailability of 8 to 12% from milk preparations [
