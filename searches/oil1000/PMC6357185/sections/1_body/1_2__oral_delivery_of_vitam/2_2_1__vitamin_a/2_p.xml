<p class="p">The current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is 600 μg retinol activity equivalents (RAE) per day for adult females and 800 μg for adult males [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The dose, absorption efficiency, and percentage of bioconversion of provitamin A into vitamin A impact the circulation level after intake [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, total oral intake should consist of approximately 65% vitamin A and about 35% carotenoids. The use of vitamin A and carotenoids in the food industry is limited, due to their low oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and chemical instability. It is believed that vitamin A transfers from foods or oral doses into lipid droplets (dietary fat emulsions) that are present in the GI lumen during ingestion. About 70% of vitamin A is stored in the liver, and the liver uptakes vitamin A chylomicron remnants through cell surface receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. It is likely that chylomicron-remnant retinyl esters and β-carotene are released from hepatocytes during chylomicron remnant metabolism. Several human genetic variations can modulate vitamin A and provitamin A bioavailability and metabolism.
