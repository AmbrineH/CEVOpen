<p class="p">Oral administration is often the best route for bioactive agents that have therapeutic or preventive effects in which patient compliance is important. However, oral bioactive agents experience the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which can reduce their solubility, stability, and absorption [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In particular, chemical and enzymatic degradation reduces the amount that is available for absorption, the GI membrane prevents permeation into the systemic circulation, and molecules with low water solubility do not readily dissolve in the GI tract. All of these factors contribute to the low bioavailability and bioactivity of oral drugs [
