<p class="p">Lipid nanoparticles can improve the bioavailability of orally administered bioactive agents via various mechanisms. First, lipid nanoparticles have enhanced solubilization and rapid dissolution because of lipid inclusion within lipid nanoparticles. The administration of lipids can activate biliary and pancreatic secretion, and these assist in lipid digestion [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The adhesiveness of lipid nanosystems prolongs the presence of bioactive molecules in the GI tract, and this increases their absorption. For example, Peyerâ€™s patches target gut-associated lymphoid tissue and absorption by M cells, allowing lipid nanoparticle delivery. Lipids that have high solubility in triglycerides undergo lymphatic transport, leading to increased bioavailability because they are not subjected to first-pass metabolism [

The ability of lipids and surfactants to open tight junctions in the intestine contributes to their enhanced permeability; their ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux from the intestinal epithelium also increases intestinal permeability [

The transport of lipid nanoparticles into epithelium cells can involve in various pathways, including lipid raft-dependent endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis [
