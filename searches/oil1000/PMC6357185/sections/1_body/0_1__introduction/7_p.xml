<p class="p">Inclusion of bioactive agents using lipid nanocarriers is a major technique that is used for oral delivery of nutrient-grade ingredients, such as vitamins, antioxidants, and fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Vitamins are essential organic micronutrients, many of which function as enzyme cofactors. Many people worldwide take dietary supplements with vitamins to prevent obesity, cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, skin aging, and various cancers. Vitamins can be classified as water-soluble or lipid-soluble. The water soluble vitamins are B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxal), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid), and B12 (cyanocobalamin), and C. The fat-soluble vitamins are A (retinol, retinal, and retinyl esters), D2 (ergocalciferol), D3 (cholecalciferol), E (tocopherol), K1 (phylloquinone), and K2 (menaquinone). In addition, these vitamins have many derivatives or analogs that have different bioactivities. The oral bioavailability of most vitamins is relatively low because of their low bioaccessibility, chemical instability, and poor GI absorption [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In addition to their low bioavailability, oral vitamins may have erratic absorption profiles, high intra- and inter-subject variations, and absorption that is not dose-dependent, all of which complicate oral administration. However, research in nanomedicine has led to the development of lipid nanocarriers that may improve the bioavailability of oral vitamins.
