<p class="p">Use of lipid-based nanocarriers for the oral administration of bioactive agents with poor water solubility can overcome the problems of low bioavailability. The excipients in the lipid nanoparticles, such as emulsifiers or surfactants, can also improve bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Lipid-based nanodelivery systems, such as self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs), nanoemulsions, microemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), encapsulate bioactive compounds and increase their solubility and bioavailability when administered by the oral route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00068-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Lipid nanoparticles have the characteristics of nanosized particles and lipid solubility, leading to improved pharmacokinetic parameters and biocompatibility, reduced toxicity, and facilitating scale-up for industrial production [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The human body also easily takes up lipid-based nanocarriers. Their digestion involves the dispersion of fat globules into an emulsion with high surface area, enzymatic hydrolysis of the triglyceride lipid at the lipid-water interface, and the dispersion of the bioactive product into the absorbed form [
