<p class="p">Lipid-based nanoformulations typically consist of lipids, emulsifiers/coemulsifiers, and hydrophilic solvents. Water is the most common hydrophilic solvent. The chemical properties of the individual ingredients and their proportions affect molecular entrapment, solubilization, stability, and oral absorption. Thus, different types of lipids can be formulated into lipid nanocarriers from long, medium, and short triglycerides (LCTs, MCTs, and SCTs) [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. LCTs are digested more slowly than MCTs and SCTs, suggesting that lipase activity declines with chain length. In addition, bioactive agents are generally better maintained in a solubilized state in LCTs and MCTs than in SCTs. Due to their reduced solvent capacity, SCTs may allow the precipitation of bioactive agents. However, MCTs have increased portal vein absorption through the liver, whereas LCTs have increased lymphatic absorption and they are not subject to the first-pass effect [

 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Thus, nonionic and ionic surfactants are used to coat the oil-water interface of lipid nanoparticles. Cremophors and Pluronics are the most common emulsifiers used in lipid-based nanoparticles. The addition of cationic or anionic surfactants into lipid nanoparticles can increase the charge of the particulate surface and prevent electrostatic aggregation. The storage stability of lipid nanoparticles must also be considered, and the induction of GI irritation is an important safety issue when administering ionic surfactants. The coating of the emulsifiers with high surface charge or steric structure can avoid the aggregation between the nanoparticles. It is generally recognized that the zeta potential of &gt;30 mV or &lt;âˆ’30 mV is preferred to maintain a long-term stability for nanoparticles. The decoration of polyethylene glycol on lipid nanoparticle surface is well known to demonstrate the repulsion between particles via steric hindrance. The GI tract with harsh environment also causes the instability of nanocarriers. The strategies of increasing surface charge and steric repulsion are also useful to increase the stability in the GI environment. In particular, some surfactants increase the viscosity of the nanosystem, leading to increased bioadhesiveness and prolonging residence time in the GI tract [
