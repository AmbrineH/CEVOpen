<p class="p">The objective of this review is to outline the pharmacokinetics of oral vitamins that are formulated using lipid-based nanoparticles. We focus on studies that used different lipid nanocarriers to encapsulate vitamins, such as SEDDSs, nanoemulsions, microemulsions, SLNs, and NLCs. Most of the lipid nanocarriers that we discuss are nanosystems based on oil-in-water (

We do not consider liposomes and niosomes, because these molecules are nanovesicles with aqueous cores and lipid shells, rather than nanoparticles with a lipid matrix. We conclude with a discussion of the emerging applications of vitamin-loaded lipid nanoparticles.
