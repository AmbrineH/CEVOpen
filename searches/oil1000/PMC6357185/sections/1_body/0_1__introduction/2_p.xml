<p class="p">Bioavailability, which is a major pharmacokinetic parameter, is defined as the extent and rate to which an active compound is absorbed from a product and becomes available at the target site. An individual must have adequate uptake of bioactive compounds, such as vitamins and nutrients, for these agents to provide beneficial effects. Thus, previous researchers have developed structurally sophisticated formulations to improve physical stability, protect the active ingredients from degradation, and provide controlled release during digestion to improve absorption and bioavailability [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Colloidal delivery systems, consisting of microsized or nanosized encapsulation formulations, can also improve the absorption and bioavailability of oral bioactive agents. In particular, drug formulations in the nanometer range have better pharmacokinetics than those in the micrometer range [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], because smaller carriers have a greater effective surface area. This greater surface area increases the dissolution rate and bioavailability of the active agents.
