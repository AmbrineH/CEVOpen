<p class="p">Nanoformulations can also facilitate enterocyte uptake, and thereby increase absorption. There is evidence that nanocarriers form a protective shield that maintains their stability in the GI tract [
 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], so that the dose can be reduced. The surface properties of nanoparticles modulate and control the release and absorption rate. Furthermore, nanocarriers can function as vehicles for delivery of a variety of chemicals, such as small-molecule drugs, antioxidants, nutrients, vitamins, peptides, proteins, antibodies, and RNAs [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Some nanocarriers were designed to increase oral bioavailability, such as nanocrystals, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, silica nanoparticles, nanotubes, liposomes, and lipid-based nanoparticles.
