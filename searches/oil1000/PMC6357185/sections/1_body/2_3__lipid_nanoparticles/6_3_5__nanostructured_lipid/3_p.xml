<p class="p">A number of preparation platforms are suitable for the production of NLCs. These include high pressure homogenization, solvent evaporation, emulsification-solvent diffusion, solvent injection, phase inversion, microemulsion, multiple emulsion, sonication, and membrane extrusion [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. High pressure homogenization is preferred over other methods because this method has matured over many years of use in the pharmaceutical industry, and because it does not require a solvent.
