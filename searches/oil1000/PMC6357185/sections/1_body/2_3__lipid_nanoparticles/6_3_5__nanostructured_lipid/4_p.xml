<p class="p">NLCs are especially useful for enhancing GI absorption by lymphatic uptake via M cells and because first-pass effects can be disregarded. NLCs increase carrier transport through the stagnant layer (between the intestinal bulk fluid and brush border of enterocytes) and thereby promote absorption [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Surfactants on the shells of NLCs also inhibit P-gp efflux. Certain lipophilic drugs can be loaded into NLCs to improve GI transport. Research has shown that NLCs improve the bioavailability of etoposide by 3.5-fold, iloperidone by 8.3-fold, silymarin by 2.5-fold, and tamoxifen by 2.7-fold, relative to control suspensions or commercial products [
