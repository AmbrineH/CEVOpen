<p class="p">Despite the advantages of SLNs for oral delivery of bioactive agents, several drawbacks must be resolved before their application. Due to the densely packed solid lipid matrix, there is only a small loading space for the bioactive agent. Moreover, particulate aggregation and gelation may occur during storage, and this can lead to the expulsion of the drug or bioactive agent from the nanoparticle. The “burst escape” of drugs for some oral SLNs can increase their toxicity. Thus, further research is required to improve the formulations used for SLNs. The incorporation of a liquid lipid into the crystalline matrix can increase imperfection (lattice defects) in the core, thereby increasing entrapment of the active ingredients [
