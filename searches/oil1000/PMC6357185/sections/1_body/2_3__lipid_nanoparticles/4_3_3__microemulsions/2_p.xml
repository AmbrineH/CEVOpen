<p class="p">Microemulsions are generally optically transparent and they can be spherical, ellipsoidal, or worm-like in shape, depending on the molecular geometry of the surfactants. The different domains of microemulsions can be characterized by ternary-phase diagrams. Three basic components—two immiscible liquids and a surfactant—are needed to produce micoemulsions. Most microemulsions use oil and water as immiscible liquid pairs. The relative amounts of these three components can be represented in a ternary phase diagram. Stable and transparent microemulsions only form in a specific region of the ternary phase diagram. Relative to nanoemulsions, a large amount of emulsifiers is necessary to prepare stable microemulsions.</p>
