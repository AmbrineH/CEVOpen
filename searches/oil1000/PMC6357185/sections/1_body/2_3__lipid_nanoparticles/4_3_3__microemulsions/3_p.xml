<p class="p">The physicochemical characteristics and thermodynamic stability of microemulsions allow for spontaneous formation by low energy emulsification, known as the titration method. The benefits of orally applied microemulsions for drug and nutrient delivery are improved solubilization, protection from degradation, and increased GI transport [
