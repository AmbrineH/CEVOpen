<p class="p">Conventional emulsions are optically opaque or turbid because the coarse droplets have diameters that are similar to the wavelength of light (hundreds of nanometers), so they scatter light strongly. Nanoemulsions can be regarded as conventional emulsions with droplets of 10 to 100 nm in diameter. Conventional (coarse) emulsions and nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable, because the separated oil and aqueous phases have a lower total free energy than the emulsified oil and water [
