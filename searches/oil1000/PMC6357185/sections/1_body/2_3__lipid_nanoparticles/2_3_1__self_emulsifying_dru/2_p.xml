<p class="p">The two types of SEDDs are self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs) and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDSs). SNEDDSs are generally opaque or translucent, and the droplet diameter is below 100 nm; SMEDDSs form transparent microemulsions of thermodynamically stable systems after oral ingestion [

The ingredients, droplet diameter, digestibility of the lipids, and lipophilicity of the bioactive agents all affect the bioavailability of an agent from SEDDSs. The selection of suitable excipients is vital for SEDDS preparation and for increasing bioavailability. SEDDSs are generally designed using the lipids and surfactants that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The methods that are employed for fabrication of SEDDSs include low-energy emulsification, the phase inversion temperature method, the phase inversion composition method, and solvent displacement [
