<p class="p">Large volumes of conventional emulsions must be consumed to assure the therapeutic absorption of the bioactive agents because of the need for water in these emulsions. This large amount of water may increase hydrolysis and precipitation during long-term storage, thus reducing stability and oral absorption. SEDDSs are delivery systems of emulsion preconcentrates, and no water is used in their formulation. The concerns regarding conventional emulsions can be resolved with good patient compliance. When SEDDSs are used for oral dosage, the advantages are improved physicochemical stability, a possibility of filling capsules with the vehicle, and increased patient acceptability [

The process of self-assembly requires no input of free energy (ΔGº) for the creation of nanoemulsions, so their development is thermodynamically spontaneous. In particular, the liquid crystalline phase formed between the oil and water phases swells, allowing for the spontaneous formation of an interface between the oil droplets and external phase [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Ingestion of SEDDSs increases the total amount of lipids in the GI tract, and these lipids can induce secretion of bile into the lumen. The increased bile salts, phospholipids, and cholesterol in the presence of lipids and emulsifiers provide a lipid-rich environment that favors the production of emulsion droplets. Thus, poorly soluble drugs or bioactive compounds that are initially dissolved in SEDDSs partition into the micelles. Micelle formation is an important step for increasing solubilization and absorption.
