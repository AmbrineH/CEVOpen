<p class="p">When considering oral administration, SEDDSs increase bioavailability by increasing the stability of bioactive agents in the GI environment because first-pass effects are minimal, they have increased lymphatic transport, and they inhibit P-gp-mediated efflux [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Some additional advantages of SEDDSs are that they can be easily delivered by the oral route, intersubject variability and effects of food are reduced, there is a fast onset of action, lower doses can be used, and they are easy to manufacture [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. However, a disadvantage of SEDDSs is that they must be delivered through soft or hard gelatin capsules. The material in the capsule shell might be incompatible with the excipients, leading to precipitation of the active ingredients, the need for storage at low temperatures, and the use of specific preparation methods [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. This problem can be resolved by transforming liquid SEDDSs into the solid state. Thus, techniques, such as freeze drying, spray drying, granulation, and adsorption to carriers, can be used to produce more stable and convenient forms for handling and delivery.
