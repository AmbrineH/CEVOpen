<p class="p">Nanoemulsions are heterogeneous mixtures of oil droplets in an aqueous medium that are stabilized by an emulsifier system. The emulsified mixture is isotropic and translucent and it is kinetically stable, in that there is no flocculation or coalescence during long-term storage. In contrast to SEDDSs, nanoemulsions are produced by directed assembly rather than self-assembly. Drugs can be loaded inside the oil cores of nanoemulsions before administration to improve absorption when administered orally. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved some nanoemulsions of poorly soluble drugs, such as Estrasorb

In addition to drugs, nanoemulsions can also encapsulate nutrients and vitamins, and they have several advantages over food systems; these advantages include the ability to incorporate lipophilic entities, high physical stability, easy modulation of product texture, and rapid GI digestibility [
