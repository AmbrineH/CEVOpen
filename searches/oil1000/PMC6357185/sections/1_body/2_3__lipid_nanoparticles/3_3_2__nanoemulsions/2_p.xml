<p class="p">Generally, nanoemulsions are prepared from components that are GRAS or natural products. To reduce toxicity and increase stability, surfactants or cosurfactants are used in nanoemulsions, such as peptides (peptide surfactant AM1), proteins (caseinate and whey protein isolate), polysaccharides (Arabic gum and modified starch), phospholipids (egg lecithin and soybean lecithin), and small molecule nonionic surfactants (Span and Tween) [

 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. High pressure homogenization is the major technique that is used to produce nanoemulsions. The use of rapidly diffusing, electrostatically stabilized, and low molecular weight emulsifiers can provide complete dispersivity. The other techniques used to fabricate the stable nanoemulsions are the use of a microfluidizer, a sonicator, and low energy approaches [

Due to their tiny droplet size and large surface area, they easily interact with the biological components of the GI tract, and are therefore efficient carriers for bioactive compounds because they provide better oral absorption than conventional emulsions. Nanoemulsions reportedly increase bioavailability because they increase solubilization, prolong gastric residence time, stimulate lymphatic absorption, reduce the effects of efflux transporters, and inhibit metabolism [
