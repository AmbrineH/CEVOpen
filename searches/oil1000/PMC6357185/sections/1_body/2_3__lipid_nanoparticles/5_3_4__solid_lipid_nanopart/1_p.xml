<p class="p">The pharmaceutical and food industries are devoting increasing attention to SLNs, because they are not subject to many of the deficiencies of microcapsules and conventional colloidal carrier systems [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. SLNs are composed of melt-emulsified lipids that are solid at room temperature and in the body. Thus, they are colloidal nanosystems consisting of crystalline lipids. Because of the unique features of their particulate structure, SLNs have the advantages of controlled release, increased bioavailability, improved stability, and suitability for industrial-scale production [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The avoidance of organic solvents and the use of biocompatible and biodegradable solid lipids in their preparation increase their applicability and safety. Natural and synthetic solid lipids are added into SLNs to form stable nanosystems, including triglycerides, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl palmitostearate, wax, fatty acids, and cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. SLNs can be manufactured using melt homogenization, cold homogenization, or melt microemulsification [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Hot homogenization is the most-used method, because the solid lipids must be melted to the liquid phase to facilitate mixing with other components in the production of small particles. Cold homogenization may be used for drugs or bioactive agents that are sensitive to heat.
