<p class="p">Digestion of oral SLNs starts in the stomach with the action of gastric lipases. The mechanical mixing of gastric fluid with SLNs leads to a crude emulsion [
 <xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Intestinal fluids then further digest SLNs. The small size of SLN particles allows them to adhere to GI mucus and enter the intervillar space. The emulsifiers that coat the surface of SLNs allow increased absorption, because they reduce membrane fluidity. The solid state of the lipid nanoparticle matrix protects chemically labile bioactive agents and prolongs release of the drug or vitamin. It is also possible to load SLNs into capsules or pellets for more convenient application [
