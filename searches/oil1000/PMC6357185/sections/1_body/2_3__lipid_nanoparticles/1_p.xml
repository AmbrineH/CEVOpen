<p class="p">Lipid-based nanodelivery systems, such as SEDDSs, nanoemulsions, microemulsions, SLNs, and NLCs, have great promise as oral vehicles for the delivery of bioactive agents because they can increase the solubility and improve bioavailability. Thus, many researchers have examined the effect of lipid nanocarriers on pharmacological or bioactive efficacy, adverse effects that are associated with conventional formulations, and compliance by patients and consumers. Orally administered lipid nanoparticles can be absorbed by several different mechanisms (
