<p class="p">Vitamin deficiencies can adversely affect human health and even cause certain diseases. Despite significant efforts during the past few decades, the prevention and treatment of vitamin deficiency remains far from satisfactory. Conventional formulations of oral vitamins usually have insufficient bioavailability and often have adverse effects. Lipid nanocarriers can resolve many of these problems for vitamins that are administered by the oral route. In particular, lipid nanocarriers allow for modulation of the size, surface charge, ingredients, and targeting of specific ligands, and they also have greater solubility, stability, and bioactivity.</p>
