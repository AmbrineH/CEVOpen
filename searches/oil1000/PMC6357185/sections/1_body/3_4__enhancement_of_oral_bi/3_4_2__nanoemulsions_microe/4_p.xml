 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] evaluated the impact of nanoemulsion droplet size on the in vitro vitamin D2 bioaccessibility and in vivo absorption in humans. The nanoemulsions had mean droplet diameters of 112, 530, and 14,500 nm. The in vitro lipid digestion experiments indicated the complete digestion of the small- and medium-sized nanoemulsions, but not the large ones (83%). However, in vivo oral absorption was greatest for the largest emulsions. Differences between the simulated GI tract and the actual GI tract may partly explain the poor correlation of the in vitro and in vivo results.
