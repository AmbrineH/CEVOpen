 <italic class="italic">R. nasutus</italic> to prepare microemulsions with enhanced oral bioavailability in rats. The microemulsions were prepared using Capryol 90, Transcutol, and Tween 80, and the mean size was 10.4 nm. A carotenoid suspension or microemulsions were fed to rats at a dose of 20 mg/kg. The absolute bioavailability of carotenoids was 0.11% for the aqueous dispersion and 0.45% for the microemulsions.
