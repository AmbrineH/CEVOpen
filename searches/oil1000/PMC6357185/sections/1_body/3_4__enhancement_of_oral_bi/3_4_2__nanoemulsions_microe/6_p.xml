<p class="p">As with SEDDSs, vitamin E derivatives may be used in nanoemulsions to improve oral drug absorption. Thus, previous researchers used nanoemulsions containing TPGS1000 with paclitaxel to enhance oral absorption in rats [
 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. These nanoemulsions had a diameter of 21.6 nm and a PDI of 0.13. Upon oral administration, the commercial product (Taxol) had plasma below 300 ng/mL and a bioavailability of 10.6%. Paclitaxel from nanoemulsions was rapidly absorbed, and it had a C
