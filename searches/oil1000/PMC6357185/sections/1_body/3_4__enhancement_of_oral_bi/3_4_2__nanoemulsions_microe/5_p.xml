 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] examined the impact of droplet size on vitamin E absorption by preparing nanoemulsions (diameter: 277 nm) with conventional emulsions (diameter: 1285 nm). The saponin-coated nanoemulsions had greater stability when subjected to heating, long-term storage, and mechanical stress. They also administered the vitamin E to rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The nanoemulsions had a greater C

 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Fabrication of vitamin E-loaded nanoemulsions led to an average diameter of 88 nm, and the AUC of vitamin E in nanoemulsions was 1.6-fold greater than commercial soft capsules in rats. The nanoemulsions were also stronger antioxidants than soft capsules in rats with oxidative damage due to d-Galactosamine.
