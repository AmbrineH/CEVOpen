 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>] tried to develop nanoemulsions to enhance oral acetylpuerarin delivery and to improve its therapeutic potential. Their nanoemulsions had an average diameter of 150 nm and were stabilized by TPGS1000 with acetylpuerarin encapsulation. The AUC of oral acetylpuerarin nanoemulsions in rats was 5.76 μg∙h mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; this value was 2.6-fold greater than the suspension and 1.7-fold greater than the oil solution. They also used the chylomicron flow-blocking rat model to examine the role of lymphatic transport. The results showed a lower AUC in the blocking model than the control model, indicating the importance of lymphatic absorption for oral nanoemulsions.
