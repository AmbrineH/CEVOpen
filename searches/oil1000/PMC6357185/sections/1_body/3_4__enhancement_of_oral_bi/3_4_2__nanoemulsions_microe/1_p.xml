 <xref rid="B115-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. The group of Dr. McClements (University of Massachusetts) performed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of different nanoemulsion formulations on the GI bioaccessibility of β-carotene (a provitamin A). More specifically, they examined the influence of the oil matrix of nanoemulsions on the GI diffusion of β-carotene [
 <xref rid="B116-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. They created nanoemulsions consisting of Tween 20 as an emulsifier, with LCTs, MCTs, or orange oil as the carrier oils, and then measured bioaccessibility across a GI membrane using an in vitro model to simulate the gastric and intestinal phases. The bioaccessibility significantly depended on the type of oil in the nanoemulsion. Thus, the bioaccessibility of β-carotene was near 0 in orange oil (due to an inability to form mixed micelles that solubilize β-carotene). However, the bioaccessibility was relatively high for LCTs (66%), but it was low for MCTs (2%), indicating that the mixed micelles with MCTs were too small to solubilize β-carotene.
