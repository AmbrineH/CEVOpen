<p class="p">Cefpodoxime is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Previous research attempted to improve its solubility, GI permeation, and oral bioavailability by use of SEDDSs, with TPGS and Tween 80 as surfactants and Capmul as the oil phase (average diameter: 55 to 60 nm) [
 <xref rid="B110-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. An in vitro permeability test, performed in a Franz diffusion cell using goat intestine as the diffusion barrier, indicated that the drug flux was much greater for the SEDDSs than the free control (0.985 vs. 0.104 Î¼g/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/min). Administration of oral formulations to rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg indicated the SEDDSs provided a 5.4-fold increased AUC relative to the plain cefpodoxime.
