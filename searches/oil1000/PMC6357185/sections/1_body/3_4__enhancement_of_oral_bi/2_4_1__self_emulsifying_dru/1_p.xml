<p class="p">SEDDSs are the most widely used lipid nanoparticles used to improve the oral absorption of vitamins. The self-assembly of nanosystems makes them attractive for the engineering of nanomedicines with distinct physicochemical properties, and greatly simplifies the optimization of formulations. Previous research examined the use of SEDDSs for oral delivery of five nutraceuticals with poor water solubility (vitamin A, vitamin K2, coenzyme Q10, resveratrol, and quercetin) [

A dispersion test indicated that all formulations containing nutrients dispersed spontaneously to form microemulsions, with droplet diameter of 25 to 200 nm. For example, vitamin K2-loaded nanocarriers had an average diameter of about 40 nm. Thus, the development of such formulations is a feasible approach to improve the oral absorption of nutraceuticals with low solubility.
