<p class="p">Docetaxel is a second-generation of taxoid with greater anticancer potency than paclitaxel. Valicherla et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>] developed docetaxel-loaded SEDDSs containing TPGS1000 (droplet diameter: 160 to 180 nm), and evaluated oral absorption and therapeutic activity. The SEDDSs had a 25-fold increased cytotoxicity against breast cancer (MCF-7) cells relative to the free drug. The absolute bioavailability of SEDDSs in rats (22%) was higher than that of Taxotere
