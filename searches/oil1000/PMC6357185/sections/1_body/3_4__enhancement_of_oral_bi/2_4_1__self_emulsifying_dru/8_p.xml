 <sup class="sup">®</sup>). The nanocarriers had a mean diameter of 211 nm and a mean PDI of 0.5. Measurement of cellular uptake by human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells indicated that the SEDDSs provided three-fold greater tocotrienol permeability than the commercial product (control). Moreover, SEDDSs significantly increased the bioavailability of the γ and δ forms in rats. Relative to the capsules, the AUC of δ-tocotrienol-SEDDS was seven-fold greater for 0.5 mg/kg doses and three-fold greater for 2.5 mg/kg doses. Nevertheless, this effect was self-limiting, because a corresponding increase in the free surfactant level negatively impacted tocotrienol transport via NPC1L1. Alqahtani et al. [

 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, a soft gelatin capsule formulation that is used to enhance tocotrienol absorption. The nanocarriers had a diameter of 117 nm and a PDI of 0.5. Analysis of in vitro lipolysis indicated the SEDDS provided a two-fold increased γ-tocotrienol solubilization. They also determined the plasma γ-tocotrienol level following oral administration to rats. The SEDDSs had a two-fold greater bioavailability at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg doses.
