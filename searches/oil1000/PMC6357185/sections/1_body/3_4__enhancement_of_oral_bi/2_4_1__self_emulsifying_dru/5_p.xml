<p class="p">Vitamin E can be absorbed via lymph, where it is transported as a lipoprotein complex, and SEDDSs are ideal carriers for vitamin E because they enhance lymphatic absorption. Thus, a pharmacokinetic study in eight healthy humans compared vitamin E-loaded SEDDSs (400 IU of α-tocopherol) with commercial capsules (Natopherol

The SEDDSs also had a lag time of 2.1 h, shorter than that of capsules (5.0 h). These results indicated that SEDDSs provided more rapid delivery of α-tocopherol.
