<p class="p">Lutein is a naturally occurring carotenoid that can prevent cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, but it has poor water solubility. The reported oral bioavailability of lutein is only 5%, and there are large inter-individual variations [

 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] developed solid SEDDSs with lutein (droplet diameter: 337 nm) to increase its transport into the lymphatic system. They conducted thoracic lymph cannulation in rats to measure lymphatic lutein concentrations. The lutein concentration for the control powder was about 100 ng/mL at 9 h, but it was 250 ng/mL for the SEDDSs. This indicates that SEDDSs increased lutein diffusion from the intestine into the lymph stream. Shanmugan et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] prepared SEDDSs containing phosphatidylcholine as the oil phase to promote oral lutein absorption by spray-drying liquid SEDDSs to form a solid powder. These SEDDSs had a droplet diameter of 92 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.208. The lutein dissolution from SEDDSs was 79% within 30 min. Analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters following oral administration to rabbits at a lutein dose of 5 mg/kg indicated that the SEDDSs had C
