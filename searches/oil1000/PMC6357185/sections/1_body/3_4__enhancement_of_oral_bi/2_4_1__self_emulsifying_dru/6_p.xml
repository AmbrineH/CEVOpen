<p class="p">Tocotrienols, compounds in the vitamin E family that have a chroman head and a 16-C phytyl chain, have some bioactivities that are not present in the tocopherols, including lowering of cholesterol, suppression of tumors, and neuroprotection [
 <xref rid="B92-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. However, the oral bioavailability of tocotrienols is low due to their poor GI absorption. In addition, the biological half-life (t

 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] produced two different tocotrienol-loaded SEDDSs that were easily lipolyzed under in vitro conditions, and they had a finer dispersion with negligible lipolysis. A single dose bioavailability test in six healthy subjects indicated that the area-under-curve (AUC) of each SEDDS was two to three times greater than a soybean oil solution. The two nanosystems also had comparable absorption and faster onset of GI absorption.
