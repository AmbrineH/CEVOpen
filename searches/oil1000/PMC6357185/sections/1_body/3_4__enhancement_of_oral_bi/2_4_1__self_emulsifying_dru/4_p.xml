<p class="p">Based on the literature [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], MCTs are preferred over LCTs for SEDDSs because they have higher fluidity, better solubilization, and the ability to self-emulsify. Grove et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] compared the pharmacokinetics of two SEDDSs, one containing MCT and the other containing LCT, for oral delivery of seocalcitol (a vitamin D analog) by giving rats 47 Î¼g/kg of oral 
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>H-seocalcitol. The bioavailability was 45% for the MCT-SEDDSs and 18% for the LCT-SEDDSs, thus confirming the superiority of MCTs for use in the oil phase.
