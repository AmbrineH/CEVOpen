<p class="p">Other researchers encapsulated vitamin K1 into SEDDSs to develop lyophilized tables for and examined oral delivery [
 <xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. They prepared these SEDDSs using Labrasol and Transcutol as the excipients. The droplet diameters size of a series of SEDDSs was 92 to 263 nm, depending on the mixture. An in vitro release study indicated that the commercial tablets released 28% of vitamin K1 after 1 h; the optimized SEDDSs tablets released 99% of vitamin K, which is due to the smallest droplet size of 82 nm. Analysis of the pharmacokinetics of vitamin K1 from SEDDSs and commercial tablets in human volunteers indicated that SEDDSs increased vitamin K1 absorption, with a bioavailability that was 170% of that provided by the commercial products. The AUC of these oral SEDDSs was similar to that obtained from intramuscular injection.
