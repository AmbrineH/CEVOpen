<p class="p">Other researchers developed a polyethylene glycol conjugate of an α-tocopherol isomer (TPGS) that was water-soluble to be used for treating low birth weight infants and cholestasis [

Another study examined the oral absorption of TPGS-SEDDSs with molecular weights of 350 Da (diameter: 10.8 nm) and 1000 Da (diameter: 61.6 nm) in rats [
