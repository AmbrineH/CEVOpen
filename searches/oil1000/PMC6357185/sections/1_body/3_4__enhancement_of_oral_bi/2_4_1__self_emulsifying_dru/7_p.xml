 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] prepared tocotrienol-loaded SEDDSs and conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study to evaluate arterial compliance and vitamin E blood level. They assessed arterial compliance using carotid femoral pulse wave velocity and the augmentation index. The results indicated a linear dose response with circulatory tocotrienol concentration for oral doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg. In addition, the SEDDSs provided greater plasma tocotrienol level than the placebo. The SEDDSs also had improved arterial compliance within two months of treatment.
