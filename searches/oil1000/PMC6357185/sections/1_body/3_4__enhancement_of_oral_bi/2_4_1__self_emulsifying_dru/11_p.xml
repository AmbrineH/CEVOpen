<p class="p">Vitamin E and its derivatives can also function as additives, rather than the active ingredient, in lipid nanocarriers, because vitamin E is a strong antioxidant that can stabilize oxygen-sensitive drugs or bioactive agents in lipid nanosystems [

 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. TPGS is a non-ionic surfactant that can prevent drug precipitation and promote supersauration in lipid nanosystems [
 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]; it can also interact with drugs by hydrogen bonding, thereby accelerating drug dissolution [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Previous research reported that TPGS could inhibit presystemic drug metabolism and intestinal efflux mediated by P-pg, and increase oral drug bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B62-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel (an anti-cancer agent) in SEDDSs with TPGS1000 as a P-gp inhibitor. Because of the high affinity for P-gp and the first-pass effect by cytochrome P450 enzymes, oral administration of paclitaxel is not very effective [
 <xref rid="B104-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. An aqueous dilution of paclitaxel-loaded SEDDSs led to droplet diameters of only 2 nm. Oral administration of these SEDDSs to rats at 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg indicated that the SEDDSs increased the bioavailability by 29% to 53% (depending on the dose) relative to commercial Taxol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. This result suggests that TPGS have great potential for increasing drug absorption. Other research examined paclitaxel-loaded SEDDSs in patients with advanced cancers to determine the oral efficiency [
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. The results indicated that TPGS1000 increased paclitaxel solubility. In these experiments, all of the patients received 160 mg on days 1, 8, and 15. The AUC was similar for oral SEDDSs (2.06 μg∙h mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and Taxol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (1.97 μg∙h mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). However, oral SEDDSs had a shorter t
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (2 h) than Taxol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (4 h), suggesting that TPGS increased the absorption rate of paclitaxel.
