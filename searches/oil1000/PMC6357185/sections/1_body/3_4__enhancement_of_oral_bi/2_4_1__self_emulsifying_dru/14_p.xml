<p class="p">Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a triene macrolide with potent immunosuppressive effects due to its inhibition of T-cell activation. However, the poor water solubility and low stability of this drug limit its use as an oral agent. Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] designed solid SEDDSs (mean droplet diameter: 108 nm) for sirolimus to improve its dissolution, stability, and GI absorption. Based on surfactant screening, TPGS1000 was a more effective stabilizer in simulated gastric fluid than Poloxamer, Gelucire, and Sucroester. The addition of TPGS1000 also increased the t
