<p class="p">SEDDSs are the preferred formulation for incorporation into capsules or tablets for oral ingestion. There is also interest in transforming liquid SEDDSs into solid forms. Thus, previous research fabricated vitamin A SEDDSs, consisting of soybean oil, Cremophor EL, and Capmul MCM-C8, and mixed them with microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel
