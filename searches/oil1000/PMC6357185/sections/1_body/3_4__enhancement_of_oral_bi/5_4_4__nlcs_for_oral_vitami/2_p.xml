<p class="p">Dacarbazine is a highly lipophilic and light-sensitive anticancer drug with very low oral absorption [

 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>] fabricated NLCs that were coated with TPGS to improve dacarbazine absorption. These NLCs encapsulated about 99% of this drug and the diameter of the nanoformulations was 155 nm. The in vitro release of the drug was biphasic, with 50% released during the first 2 h and sustained release for up to 30 h. Other researchers used TPGS-coated NLCs to encapsulate sulforaphane, a natural anti-cancer agent derived from broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, to improve oral bioavalaibility [
