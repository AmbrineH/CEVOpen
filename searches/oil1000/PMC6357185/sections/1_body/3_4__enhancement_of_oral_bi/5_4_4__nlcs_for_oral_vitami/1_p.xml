 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. These NLCs were stable and had a mean diameter of 133 nm. The diameter remained unchanged in simulated gastric fluid, but it increased to 216 nm in simulated intestinal fluid. An in vitro digestion test demonstrated that NLCs provided controlled release of vitamin D3, in that they were not degraded in simulated stomach fluid, but they released more than 90% of the vitamin D3 into intestinal fluid.
