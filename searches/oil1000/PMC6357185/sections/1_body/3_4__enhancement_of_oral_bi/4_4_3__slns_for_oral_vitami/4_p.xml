<p class="p">Other researchers used TPGS 1000-coated SLNs with curcumin to increase its GI absorption [

 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>], but its clinical use is limited due to its low aqueous solubility, instability in GI fluid, and rapid elimination [
 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. Thus, the application of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-trimethyl chitosan to the SLN surface formed an acid-resistant shell, which increased the stability. An oral curcumin suspension (50 mg/kg) had a C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of 0.24 μg/mL and an AUC of 0.27 μg∙h mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; however, oral SLNs with curcumin had a C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of 1.21 μg/mL and an AUC of 6.23 μg∙h mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. SLNs also improved curcumin targeting in the rat brain. Ji et al. [
 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>] formulated curcumin into SLNs coated with TPGS and Brij
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 78. The optimized SLNs had an average diameter of 135 nm with 91% curcumin encapsulation. These SLNs exhibited no “burst release”, suggesting homogeneous curcumin distribution in the lipid core. An in situ GI absorption test, in which a curcumin suspension and SLNs were dosed at 50 mg/kg, found that SLN loading increased curcumin permeability across jejunum from 0.81 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> to 1.56 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> cm/s. The AUC of SLNs was 12.3-fold higher than the suspension.
