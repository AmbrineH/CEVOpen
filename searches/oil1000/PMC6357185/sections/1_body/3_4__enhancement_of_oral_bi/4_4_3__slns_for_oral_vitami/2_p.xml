<p class="p">The saturable process of intestinal γ-tocotrienol absorption (mediated by NPC1L1) leads to an oral bioavailability of only 9% [
 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. Thus, researchers have also examined the use of SLNs to increase γ-tocotrienol permeation and bioavailability in human liver (HepG2) cells [
 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. The results indicated that the SLN provided a two-fold increased uptake relative to mixed micelles. In addition, an in situ perfusion study, in which rats were given oral γ-tocotrienol (10 mg/kg) as SLNs or as mixed micelles, demonstrated that SLNs provided a 10-fold greater permeability. The AUC for SLNs was 12.1 μg∙h mL
