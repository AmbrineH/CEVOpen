<p class="p">Other researchers, in an attempt to increase the bioavailability of docetaxel (an anticancer agent), compared TPGS 1000-coated docetaxel-loaded SLNs (diameter: 189 nm) with Tween 80-coated docetaxel-loaded SLNs (diameter: 215 nm) [
 <xref rid="B133-nutrients-11-00068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. The SLNs provided a more sustained release of docetaxel than the marketed product Taxotere
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. In particular, after oral delivery, the AUC was 12.9 μg∙min/mL for TPGS-coated SLNs 7.0 μg∙min/mL for Tween 80-coated LNs, but only 3.9 μg∙min/mL for Taxotere
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. This result confirmed that TPGS inhibited docetaxel efflux.
