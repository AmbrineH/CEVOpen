<p class="p">Some investigations have examined the use of SLNs as oral delivery systems for vitamins and their analogs because they are biocompatible with the lipid matrix (consisting of triglycerides, fatty acids, or glycerol esters) and are readily degraded in vivo. Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring carotenoid that is abundant in salmon, shellfish, and shrimp, which has activity against several cancers and cardiovascular disorders, with greater potency than vitamin E and Î²-carotene [

However, its poor water solubility, light sensitivity, and decomposition in the presence of oxygen have limited its use in oral formulations. Thus, researchers have entrapped astaxanthin into SLNs composed of glycerol esters and Tween 20 [
