<p id="p0080" class="p">During the experimental period (weeks 4 to 12 of age), the general health status and welfare of the rabbits was good. No signs of diarrhea and sickness or deaths were observed across treatment groups, indicating that the health status of the rabbits was not compromised by heat stress or experimental treatments. Improvements were observed (

The weakest performance including BW, BW gain, and FCR was recorded for the CON group compared with POS and thyme oil groups. Considering the whole growing period, feed intake in the supplemented groups was similar, but the CON rabbits showed lower feed intake and poorer growth performance (
