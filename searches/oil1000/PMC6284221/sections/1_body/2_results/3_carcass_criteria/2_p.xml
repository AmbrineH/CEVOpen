 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The incorporation of olive oil and thyme essential oil improved (

On the contrary, percentage of head, liver, heart, lungs and kidneys of the chilled carcass did not differ among the different experimental groups. Likewise, the percentage of fore, mid and hind parts did not differ among the groups (
