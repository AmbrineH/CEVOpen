<p id="p0120" class="p">At the point of purchase of meat at market, the consumer takes into consideration meat quality, color, safety, price and nutritional quality. Concerning effects of thyme oil on rabbit meat quality criteria under hot environmental conditions, rabbits fed rations containing thyme oil had improved WHC, pigments and oxidative stability in carcass meat. This marked increase in WHC was probably related to the positive effect of thyme oil antioxidants on the integrity of muscle fibres, thereby enhancing their capability to retain water (

In this study muscle pH values were highest for the rabbits fed the ration with the lowest thyme essential oil supplementation level for which no explanation is obvious. Furthermore, many studies were conducted on the effects of essential oils to protect meat and meat products against oxidative processes.
