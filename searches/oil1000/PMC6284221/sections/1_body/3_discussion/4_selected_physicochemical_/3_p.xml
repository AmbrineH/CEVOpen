<p id="p0125" class="p">In the current study, OMb increased and MetMb decreased with dietary thyme oil supplementation compared to CON samples from different parts of the rabbit carcass (fore, mid and hind). These observations support the effectiveness of thyme essential oil components in retarding the conversion of reduced myoglobin and OMb to MetMb, which is in line with improvements observed on Japanese quails for meat oxidative stability and quality (

Another possible explanation could be related to thyme essential oil components that entered the circulatory system, were distributed and retained in tissues, and thus, were responsible for the exhibited antioxidant properties and improved the color stability of myoglobin by donating electrons or by other unknown mechanisms (
