<p id="p0115" class="p">Overall, carcass weight, yields, dissectible fat, and results on organ percentages were similar to previous results in various environments (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dalle Zotte et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, the incorporation of thyme oil with olive oil linearly decreased fat depots when compared with CON, thus confirming previous data on reduced abdominal fat content in Japanese quails at inclusion levels of 60 or 200 mg/kg thyme essential oil (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dalle Zotte et al. (2014a)</xref> reported that supplementation of thyme at 30 g/kg decreased scapular fat content of growing rabbits which is in accordance with our results. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dalle Zotte et al. (2016)</xref> recently reviewed the potential biological effects of different combinations of phytochemicals on growth performance, carcass criteria, antioxidant and antibacterial activities in rabbits and stated that these are not fully investigated. It appears that lack of quantitative data of active components also limit progress relative to carcass characteristics.
