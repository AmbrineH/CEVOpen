<p id="p0100" class="p">The present study aimed to explore effects of incremental inclusion levels of thyme oil in a rabbit ration on growth performance, carcass criteria, antioxidant properties and meat quality under hot environmental conditions. Due to scarcity of available data on effect of thyme oil on growing rabbits, comparison was done with studies that used thyme powder or other herbs of the Lamiaceae family, either in rabbits or other farm animals.</p>
