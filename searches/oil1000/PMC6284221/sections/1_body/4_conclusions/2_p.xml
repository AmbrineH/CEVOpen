<p id="p0130" class="p">Based on results of this study, thyme essential oil included up to 100 mg/kg ration with 1.50 g/kg olive oil as carrier as an supplement in the ration of growing rabbits can be used as an effective feed additive to improve performance under hot environmental conditions. These additives may improve the dietary value in a dose-dependent manner and foster the production of rabbit meat, decrease the perirenal and scapular fat content and improve oxidative stability of rabbit meat. Further investigations are needed to evaluate meat quality and oxidative stability of the stored rabbit meat caused by thyme and olive oil supplementation.</p>
