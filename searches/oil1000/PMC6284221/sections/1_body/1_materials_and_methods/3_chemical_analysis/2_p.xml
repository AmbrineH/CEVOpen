<p id="p0050" class="p">Chemical analysis of the CON ration was carried out at the Institute of Animal Science, University of Bonn, Germany. The ration was ground to pass a 1-mm screen using a centrifugal mill (KG type ZM1, Retsch, Haan, Germany) and analysed according to the methods of VDLUFA (2012; method numbers in parentheses). Dry matter was determined by oven-drying at 100 °C for 24 h (3.1). Total nitrogen (N) was estimated by combustion assay (4.1.2; Rapid N cube, Elementar Analysen systeme, Hanau, Germany) and crude protein was expressed as N × 6.25. The contents of neutral detergent fibre (assayed with a heat stable amylase and without sodium sulphite, aNDFom; 6.5.1) and acid detergent fibre (ADFom; 6.5.2), were analysed using Ankom
 <sup class="sup">2000</sup> Fiber Analyzer (ANKOM Technology, Macedon, NY, USA) and were both expressed exclusive of residual ash. The content of ether extract was assayed with the Soxhlet method after HCl digestion (5.1.1). The gross energy contents of the ration and faeces were measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (model C 200; IKA, Staufen, Germany). Additionally, contents of ash (8.1), sugar (7.1.2) and starch (7.2.1) were quantified in the ration. Calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry and phosphorus was analysed using a colorimetric method (10.6.1). Lysine and, after performic acid oxidation, methionine in the ration were analysed using an amino acid analyser (4.11.1).
