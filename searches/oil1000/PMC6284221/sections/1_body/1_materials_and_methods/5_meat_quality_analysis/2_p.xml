<p id="p0060" class="p">The pH values were measured at 24 h post mortem with a Knick digital pH meter after homogenization of raw muscles (1 g) with iodoacetate (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Korkeala et al., 1984</xref>). The water holding capacity (WHC) of muscle tissue was estimated by centrifuging 1 g of muscle, placed on tissue paper inside a tube, at 1,500 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 4 min (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nakamura and Katoh, 1985</xref>). The water remaining after centrifugation was quantified by drying the samples at 70 °C overnight. The WHC was calculated as follows: WHC (%) = 100 × (Weight after centrifugation - Weight after drying)/Initial weight. Lipid oxidation was measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) method described by 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee et al. (1998)</xref>. The meat samples (0.5 g) were mixed with 2.5 mL of stock solution (0.37% thiobarbituric acid – 15% trichloroacetic acid − 0.25 nmol/L HCl) and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min to develop a pink color. These samples were then cooled and centrifuged (4,500 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 25 min). Absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (U-2450, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The TBARS were calculated from a standard curve (8 to 50 nmol/L) of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the results were expressed as mg MDA/kg sample. Metmyoglobin (MetMb), and Oxymyoglobin (OMb) analysis was done as follows: raw meat samples (5 g) were homogenized in 25 mL ice-cold 40 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 6.8) for 10 s using an Ultra-Turrax T25 tissue macerator at 16,300 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> (IKA, Staufen, Germany). The homogenate was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 4,500 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through Whatman # 1 filter paper, and the absorbance was read at 572, 565, 545 and 525 nm spectrophotometrically. The PBS (pH 6.8) served as a blank, and the contents of MetMb and OMb were calculated as described by
