<p id="p0035" class="p">After weaning at the age of 4 weeks, a total of 75 male Californian rabbits (average BW 523 ± 14 g) were randomly assigned to 5 dietary treatment groups of 15 rabbits each. Treatments consisted of an unsupplemented standard ration, negative control (CON); standard ration supplemented with 1.50 g/kg olive oil as carrier, positive control (POS); POS + 50 mg/kg thyme essential oil (TO1); POS + 100 mg/kg thyme essential oil (TO2); and POS + 150 mg/kg thyme essential oils (TO3) in the ration. The POS and TO rations were prepared individually by supplementing the exact dosage of olive oil and thyme essential oil to 3-kg batches of the CON ration. The experiment lasted for 56 days. Ingredients, chemical composition and the energy value of the pelleted CON ration are presented in
