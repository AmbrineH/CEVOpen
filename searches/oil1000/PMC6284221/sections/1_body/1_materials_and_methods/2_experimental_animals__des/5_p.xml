<p id="p0045" class="p">Rabbits were individually reared in cages (measuring width × length × height: 44 cm × 50 cm × 35 cm) of galvanized wire net, equipped with an automatic drinker and a manual feeder. The rabbits were reared in an open house system (naturally ventilated room by windows and ceiling fans) with average temperature of 38.8 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity ranging from 26% to 35% during the whole experimental period with a 16 h light and 8 h dark regime. Fresh tap water was available for 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> consumption via stainless steel nipples located inside each cage. Individual feed intake was recorded daily at 08:00. Each rabbit was weighed weekly on the same day at 07:00. The FCR was calculated by dividing daily feed consumption by average daily BW gain. Signs of diarrhoea were documented daily and mortality was recorded as it occurred.
