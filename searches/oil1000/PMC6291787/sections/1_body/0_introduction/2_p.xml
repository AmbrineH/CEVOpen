 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus suis</italic> is a major gram‐positive swine pathogen associated with a wide variety of pig diseases, such as meningitis, arthritis, bronchopneumonia, endocarditis, polyserositis, and septicemia. In addition, it is a zoonotic agent that causes severe infections in people in close contact with infected pigs or pork‐derived products. According to the capsular polysaccharide, 33 serotypes of

The control of the disease is nowadays based on the antibiotic therapy; however, relatively high levels of resistance (up to 85%) to some antimicrobials commonly used in swine, including lincosamides, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, has been worldwide documented (Varela et al.,
