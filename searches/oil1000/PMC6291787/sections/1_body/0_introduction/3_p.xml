<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are extracts of plants prepared by steam distillation and are generally composed of a combination of substances like terpenes, phenolics, aldehydes, or alcohols, the most of which are volatile (Laird &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). EOs can affect bacterial permeability and survival, either by direct contact or by contact with their vapor (Martinez &amp; Baquero,

 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The volatile nature of essential oils could also have a direct application in food preservation and surface disinfection (Laird &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The complex composition and different mechanisms of action of EOs may be an advantage over other antimicrobials to prevent the development of resistance of pathogenic bacteria (Knezevic etÂ al.,
