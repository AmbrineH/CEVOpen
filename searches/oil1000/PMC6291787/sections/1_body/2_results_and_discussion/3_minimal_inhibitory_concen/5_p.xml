<p class="p">The absence of bacterial resistance described against EOs is considered to be the main advantage of these products in comparison with other antimicrobial agents (Knezevic et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Nevertheless, EOs studies in cell cultures show a dose‐dependent cytotoxic effect, described as an increased apoptosis and cellular necrosis (Dusan, Marian, Katarina, &amp; Dobroslava, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The nontoxic concentration described by Fabio et al. (
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) for thyme is near to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> and MBC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>) obtained in our study. However, the nontoxic concentration of cinnamon that they publish was lower than our values. Several studies have shown synergistic effect between the essential oils tested in this work and some traditional antimicrobials, with a notable decrease in the effective concentration (Solarte et al.,
