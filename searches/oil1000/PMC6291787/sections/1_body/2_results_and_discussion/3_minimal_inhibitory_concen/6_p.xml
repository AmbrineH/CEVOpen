<p class="p">In vivo studies in pigs with oregano, thyme, and cinnamon generally describe a significant increase in growth performance without altering the quality of the carcass (Namkung et al.,

 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, in some studies, the potential of these EOs was lower than that of the antimicrobial agents (Neill et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). A notable difference has been shown in the productive effect of EOs according to the type and origin of the essential oil, the quantity added to feed and some intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including age group, gastric pH, the nutritional status, the diet, or the environmental conditions of the trial (Lan, Li, &amp; Kim,
