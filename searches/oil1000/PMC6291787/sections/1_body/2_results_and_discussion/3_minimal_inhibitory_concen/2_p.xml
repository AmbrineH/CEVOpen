<p class="p">Different studies highlight the usefulness of disk diffusion method as a screening test (Lopez, Sanchez, Batlle, &amp; Nerin, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). It may present a weak correlation with the quantitative microdilution technique because of heterogeneity of some oils when diffusing through the agar or their different volatility, depending on the chemical composition or external temperature (Hernandez et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). The dilution method could be more reliable than the disk method with regards to reproducibility and clinical relevance (Inouye et al.,
