 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), red thyme, common thyme, and oregano would have a strong activity (inhibition zone ≥20 mm) and cinnamon, a moderate one (inhibition zone between 12 and 20 mm). These EOs have also shown a good antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of microbial pathogens involved in different clinical processes of both humans and animals, including other
