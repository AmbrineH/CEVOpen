 <xref rid="mbo3613-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). The oils with a significantly higher inhibitory activity were red thyme and common thyme (Ø mean of inhibition zone 34.2 and 33.2 mm, respectively), followed by oregano (Ø mean of inhibition zone 29.4 mm). Cinnamon, peppermint, and clove (Ø mean 16.5, 16.4, and 15.8‐mm, respectively) showed a similar antimicrobial potential, although it was significantly lower than the previous ones. A weak or nonexistent activity of basil and rosemary was observed. It has been possible to establish five homogeneous groups of EOs, according to the results obtained in the disk diffusion test (Tables 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>).
