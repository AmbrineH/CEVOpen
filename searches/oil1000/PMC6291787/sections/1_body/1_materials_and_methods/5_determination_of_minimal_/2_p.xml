<p class="p">The essential oils with the major antimicrobial activity in the paper disk diffusion assay were selected to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), using the broth dilution method for bacteria isolated from animals (CLSI VET01‐A4, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). To facilitate the dilution of the oils and the reading of the results, Brain‐Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 0.15% agar was used (Oxoid Ltd, ES) (Mann &amp; Markham, 
 <xref rid="mbo3613-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). The microdilution broth technique was performed as follows: double serial dilutions of selected EOs were prepared ranging from 5,000 to 39.0625 μg·ml
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; in a 96 well microtiter plate, 100 μl of each EO dilution was mixed with 100 μl of bacterial suspension (10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU·ml
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Then, the plate was incubated at 35°C for 20–24 hr under aerobic conditions. Every assay was carried out in triplicate. Positive (oil‐free broth with bacterial inoculum) and negative (oil‐free broth without bacterial inoculum) controls were included (Bajpai, Baek, &amp; Kang,
