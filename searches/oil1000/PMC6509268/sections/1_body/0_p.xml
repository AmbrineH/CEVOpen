 <bold class="bold">Core tip:</bold> Celiac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten. Its frequency has been increasing, and several factors have been analyzed as possible triggers; among them also food additives should be taken into account. Several nanoparticles are used as food additives or preservatives, and they can interact with the intestine or the immune system, increasing, in theory, the immune response towards gluten. The scope of this review is to analyze the data present in the literature with respect to the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of CeD.
