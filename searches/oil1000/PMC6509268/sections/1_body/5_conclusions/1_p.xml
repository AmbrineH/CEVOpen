<p class="p">Food additives could play an important role in the pathogenesis of CeD, either altering gliadin peptides properties or interacting with the intestinal environment, at the barrier level or with the immune system. Moreover, the increasing use of prepared food and, in turn, the augmented ingestion of NPs, could be an additional factor in triggering the development of CeD in genetically predisposed individuals. For this reason, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies to evaluate these possible interactions are needed.
