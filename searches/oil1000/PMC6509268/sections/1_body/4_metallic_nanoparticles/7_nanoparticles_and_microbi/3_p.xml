<p class="p">As already mentioned, silver nanoparticles are employed as antibacterial agents, and thus it should be expected that they can alter the microbiota composition. In fact, in mice exposed to increasing doses of AgNP for 28 d, a disturbed bacterial evenness (αdiversity) and populations (β-diversity) was detected by Next Generation Sequencing. This effect was also dose-dependent. Ag NP increased the ratio between Firmicutes (F) and Bacteroidetes (B) phyla, results similar to those observed in presence of inflammation[
