<p class="p">Although the daily consumption of metallic NPs is usually thought to be trivial, this is not the case, in particular if TiO2 is taken into account. Early studies suggested that average daily human consumption of TiO2 was 5.4 mg per person[

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] and 5 mg/person[
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. More recent papers, however, estimated a daily intake of 1–2 mg TiO2/kg b.w. for United States children under 10 years of age, and 0.2-0.7mg TiO2/kg b.w. for other United States consumers[
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], whereas EFSA data reported a range between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg b.w. in infants and the elderly, and 5.5-10.4 mg/kg b.w. in children, depending on the exposure[

Although these data should be corrected for the percentage on TiO2 NPs present in the E171, it must be noted that these quantities are not far from the estimates for the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 5 mg/kg body weight/d derived for nano‐ TiO2 by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety[
