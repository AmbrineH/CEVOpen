<p class="p">Nowadays several nanoparticles (NPs) are intentionally added to food, beverages and their packages[
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], mainly to preserve aliments[
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] or to improve their organoleptic properties (such as taste, consistency and appearance). Consequently, in recent years, an increase of toxicological studies on food nanoparticles has been registered. Although NP can enter the body through several routes, according to the Nanotechnology Consumer Product Inventory (CPI) enlisted in 2014, one of the major NP points of entry is the gastrointestinal system[

They also reported that nanomaterials are particularly present in commercial food or food-related products under the form of metallic nanoparticles (mNP), of which Ag (E174), TiO2 (E171), ZnO, Au (E175) and SiO2 (E551) NPs are the most popular. Briefly, AgNPs are particularly used as antimicrobial agent in aliments/beverages, their packages and in agriculture[
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]; ZnONPs are also used as strong antibacterial agents, but they can also be used as a dietary supplement; E171 is used as a whitening agent in pharmaceutical, dairy and pastry products; AuNP is mostly present as a contaminant from dental restoration material or agriculture-derived products (such as seeds)[
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]; SiO2NP is employed to improve the organoleptic properties of food and its nutritional values.
