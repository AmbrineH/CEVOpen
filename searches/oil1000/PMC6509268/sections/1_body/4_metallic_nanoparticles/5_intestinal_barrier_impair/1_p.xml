<p class="p">The first layer of the small intestinal barrier is a very thin (approximately 20 micron) layer of mucus, composed of mucin glycoproteins and antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA. The second layer is a continuous and tight epithelium, composed of several specialized cells: at the bottom of the crypts reside stem and Paneth cells, whereas enterocytes, goblet and enteroendocrine cells are mainly in the villi. What makes the epithelium a selective barrier is the presence of highly dynamic intercellular junctions, adherent junctions (AJ) and TJ being the most representative. AJ are composed of transmembrane proteins cadherine, which are connected between them extracellularly, and with the catenin proteins in the cells. Catenins are in turn linked to the acti-myosin complex. TJ are formed by occludins, claudins and JAM-A proteins that interact with zonula occludens proteins and catenins in the intracellular space. Therefore AJ, TJ and actin cytoskeleton form a complex that can regulate the permeability (paracellular route) of the intestinal barrier, following intracellular or extracellular signals.</p>
