<p class="p">However, even if the studied mNP does not induce permeability alteration, it has to be considered that the mNPs may absorb the protein itself on its surface and therefore behave as a “Trojan horse”, increasing the amount of immunogenic molecules that arrive into the submucosa[

Thus, in the case of CeD, food NPs could bind gliadin peptides and help them to cross the intestinal barrier, probably using the endocytotic pathway. Several studies are needed to test this hypothesis, since no data are currently available on this topic. Moreover, it will be necessary to take into account the interaction with other food components[

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], and with the intestinal mucus[
