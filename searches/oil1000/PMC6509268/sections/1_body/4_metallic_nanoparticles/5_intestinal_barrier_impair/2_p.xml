<p class="p">A growing number of diseases have recently been associated with intestinal barrier alterations, particularly related to TJ dysfunction. This finding can be easily explained: gastrointestinal barrier permeability alterations can increase the cut-off of molecules passing into the submucosa. In physiological conditions, only small molecules with a molecular weight of about 600da can pass the barrier, but these alterations result in the passage of immunogenic molecules, the activation of the immune system and the establishment of an inflammatory state. Since inflammatory mediators are also known to affect the intestinal barrier, a mild inflammatory status could eventually lead to a stronger disruption of the barrier itself[

Therefore, any factors which are able to alter the intestinal barrier permeability, allowing an higher passage of these peptides into the submucosa, may increase the number of predisposed subjects developing the disease.
