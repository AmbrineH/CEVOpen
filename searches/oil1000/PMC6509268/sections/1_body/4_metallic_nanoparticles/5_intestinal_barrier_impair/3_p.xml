<p class="p">In 2015 Lerner and Matthias[
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] observed that the increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases (considering also CeD among others) paralleled with the growing use of food additive in the industry. They therefore postulated that the permeability alterations induced by food additives could be associated with the increment in incidence of autoimmune diseases. Although the author did not refer directly to the mNP, several studies have been performed on their impact on the GI barrier. Results showed that mNP can alter the intestinal permeability both directly, by altering the TJ or inducing epithelial cell death[

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>-
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], or indirectly, by inducing inflammation or oxidative stress that in turn can impair TJ and permeability[
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. In this context, the work of Ruiz et al[
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] is interesting. It looked at the impact of TiO2NP both 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> (mice with DSS-induced ulcerative colitis) and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> (intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages). TiO2NP oral administration worsened the already established colitis through inflammasome activation. Also, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> stimulations induced IL-1Î² and IL18 increment, as well as higher epithelial permeability driven by the activation of the inflammasome pathway. These results clearly associate the consumption of mNP with an increase of the intestinal permeability, but only when there is a pre-existent tendency to develop it.
