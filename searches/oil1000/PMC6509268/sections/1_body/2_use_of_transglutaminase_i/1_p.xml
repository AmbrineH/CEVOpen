<p class="p">The use of transglutaminase in food processing belongs to the various techniques that industries in the field currently use to modify the proteins present in aliments. Microbial transglutaminases (mTGs), like human ones, catalyzes acyl transfer, deamidation and crosslinking between glutamine (acyl donor) and lysine (acceptor). These reactions can profoundly modify a large amount of proteins constituting food matrices and this, in turn, can improve several food properties such as texture and stability; more interestingly, these changes can take place without affecting other food characteristics like taste or nutritional value. For these reasons, the possible ingestion of microbial tranglutaminases, due to its use in food processing, has been recognized as safe by Food and Drug Administration[
