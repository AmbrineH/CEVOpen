<p class="p">On the contrary, in theory, the use of mTGs could also be useful to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten, but in order to do so the enzyme has to be used in association with acyl-acceptor molecules such as lysine[

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], but there are still some issues that need to be clarified, due to the affinity of mTGs for the aminoacids usually targeted by TG2 and to the possibility that TG2 overcomes the modification induced by mTGs.
