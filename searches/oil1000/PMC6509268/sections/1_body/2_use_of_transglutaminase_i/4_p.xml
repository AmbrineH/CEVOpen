<p class="p">Few papers have tried to assess the possible correlation between the use of bacterial transglutaminase and CeD, but most of them are only based on peptide-patientsâ€™ antibody interaction. An initial investigation performed using sera from nine celiac patients suggested that treatment of wheat with mTGs increases the IgA-based reactivity, and to a lesser degree when mTGs were used to treat gluten-free bread[

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] evaluated the presence of antibodies directed against either human or bacterial transglutaminase (alone or bound to gluten peptides) in pediatric patients with or without CeD. In the serum of CeD patients, they could detect antibodies against mTGs, although prevalently IgG rather than IgA (as commonly observed against TG2), whereas they were not present in controls. The authors also found a correlation between serum levels of antibodies against mTG-peptides and TG2-peptides, as well as between these serum titer and intestinal damage, and they suggested a causal role of this food supplement in the development of CeD. Different results were observed by Ruh et al[
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], who extracted gliadin from pasta treated or untreated with mTGs and employed it to assess possible reactivity with circulating antibodies present in CeD patients. The authors detected a huge variation among patients, but no difference in reactivity between the two types of gliadin. These results were also confirmed by Heil et al[
