<p class="p">Due to the pivotal role of transglutaminase in the pathogenesis of CeD, its use in food preparation has raised some concern. Transglutaminases can act on gluten peptides, making them more immunogenic, but it must also be remembered that TG2 is itself an autoantigen, and the ingestion of mTGs could also generate an autoimmune response through a molecular mimicry mechanism. The comparison of the primary and tertiary structure of a commonly used mTGs with TG2 reveals little homology, although both are able to bind gluten peptides using similar aminoacids[
