<p class="p">Although the genetic background is essential for the development of CeD, research has started to focus on the possible environmental factors (apart from gluten) that could trigger the disorder. This could be quite important, since several data suggest that the prevalence of CeD is increasing, and cases are now reported even in populations that were thought to have a negligible prevalence of this disease. A study performed in United Kingdom showed a four-fold increase in CeD incidence rate over a period of 22 years, but regional differences were present[

Even if this increased rate could be explained by a different awareness of the problem by physicians, or by the use of an easier serological diagnosis and a casefinding approach, there is still some evidence which suggests that this raise in the prevalence/incidence of the disease is a real phenomenon. Evaluation in a Scottish pediatric population revealed that, in two decades, the incidence of children with nonclassical CeD had increased dramatically (attributable to better diagnosis), but also the number of patients with classical manifestations had quadrupled (thus suggesting a real variation in CeD frequency)[
