<p class="p">Once gluten peptides have crossed the intestinal barrier, they are further processed in the submucosa; due to their high content in glutamine, proline and hydrophobic amino acid residues, these peptides are excellent substrates for transglutaminase 2 (TG2) which deamidates them. This processing increases negative charges, allowing the gluten peptides to bind more strongly to HLA-DQ2 (or HLA-DQ8). Better antigen presentation results in CD4+ Th1 T-cell activation that, in turn, will cause activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, crypt hyperplasia and villus atrophy, as well as B cell stimulation and the production of auto-antibodies directed against deamidated gliadin peptides and TG2 (Figure
