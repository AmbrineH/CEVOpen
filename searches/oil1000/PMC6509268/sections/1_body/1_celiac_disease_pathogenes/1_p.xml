<p class="p">Celiac disease (CeD) is a multifactorial disorder, characterized by the presence of an autoimmune response that mainly involves the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, barley, and rye in genetically predisposed individuals. CeD genetic background is quite complex, and partially still unknown. About 40% of the genetic predisposition relies on genes localized in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, mainly on those encoding for specific class II HLA molecules, namely DQ2.5 and DQ8 heterodimers. The combination of the HLA alleles DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 generates the HLA-DQ2.5 heterodimer, which is detected in more than 90% of Caucasian CeD patients (either in cis or in trans), whereas the remaining patients carry the HLA-DQ8 heterodimer, encoded by DQA1*03 (α chain) and DQB1*0302 (β chain). However, the presence of the DQ2 heterodimer is not sufficient for the development of CeD. In fact, the HLA-DQ2 haplotype is present in 30%-35% of the Caucasian population (in which CeD has a high prevalence), but only 2%-5% of gene carriers develop CeD[
