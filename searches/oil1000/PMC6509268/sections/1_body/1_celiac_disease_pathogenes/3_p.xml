<p class="p">To identify the possible additional environmental causes it is necessary to dissect the various steps involved in CeD pathogenesis. The ingested gluten undergoes digestion, which generates several small peptides, including the 33 mer peptide (residues 57 to 89 of α-gliadin), a celiac “superantigen” able to stimulate T cells[
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], or the 31-43 peptide (from residues 31 to 43 of α-gliadin), which can have a toxic effect on intestinal mucosa[
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, in order to trigger the autoimmune response these peptides need to cross the gastrointestinal barrier and reach the lamina propria. This passage can take place using two different routes, namely the transcellular and the paracellular one. The first is a vesicle-mediated passage which involves endocytosis on the luminal side of enterocytes, followed by transcytosis and release on the basolateral side. Thus, in theory, substances which are able to make the gluten peptides more prone to be captured on the apical side and transported could play a role in the pathogenesis of CeD. Conversely, paracellular transport depends on tight junctions (TJ) and the correct expression/interaction of the proteins that maintain junction functionality. Therefore, agents able to induce inflammation and/or cytokine release could cause the rearrangement of proteins such as ZO-1 or occludin, causing a loss of function of TJ and, in turn, an increased paracellular passage of lumen substances, such as gluten peptides.
