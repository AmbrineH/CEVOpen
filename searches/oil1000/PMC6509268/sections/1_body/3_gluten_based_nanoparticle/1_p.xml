<p class="p">Gluten-based nanoparticles have been mainly developed as a tool for drug delivery, and have been tested in particular for hydrophobic drugs[

 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>., the development of coating matrices for paper and cardboard used for food packaging. Plant-derived proteins have good film-forming properties, are biodegradable, and can be produced with moderate costs, facts that make them suitable for coating food containers. Some authors have also combined gluten with nanocellulose and titanium dioxide in order to obtain nanocomposites able to increase the resistance of paper. These na-nocomposites also have an antibacterial activity, a quality that might be very attractive for food-preserving packages[
