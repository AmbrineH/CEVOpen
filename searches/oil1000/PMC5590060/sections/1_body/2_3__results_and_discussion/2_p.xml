<p class="p">The comparison of our findings with volatile oils of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> from other regions reveal some similarities and differences which may attributed to a number of factors such as clime, plant maturity and variety, processing and methods of analysis. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-Dodecenal, the major component (28.43%) of the leaf oil in our Nigerian sample was reported predominant in volatile oils from Vietnam (45.5%) [
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], Malaysia (59.7%) [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], S. Tome (15.7 &amp; 37.5%) [
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and Bangladesh (37.4%) [
 <xref rid="B10-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]; but detected in small amount in the leaf oils of Cuba (5.7%) [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Similarly, 2,4.5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (lauraldehyde) (10.77%) in the leaf oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was presented as a major component (20.5%) in the Cuban oil [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], Venezuelan Andes (27.7%) [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and Bangladesh (5.1%) [
 <xref rid="B10-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. On the other hand, its positional isomer, the 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde was not detected in the Nigerian oils, but was present as a dominant component (23.7%) in the S. Tome [
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and Malaysian (9.6%) [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] leaf sample. The 13-tetradecenal (27.45%) in the leaf oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was not identified in S. Tome leaf oil, however the isomer, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-tetradecenal (18.7 &amp; 25.3%) was reported as a major constituent [
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (37.55%) and 2-formyl-1,1,5-trimethylcyclohexa-2,4-diene-6-ol (19.82%) reported in the Malaysian root essential oil [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] was not identified in Nigerian root oil. Literature has revealed that the stem essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> is reported for the first time, however the Cuban seed oil is reported to contain carotol (19.3%) and hexadecanoic acid (12.0%) among other constituents [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Eyres et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] showed that the prominent “character-impact” factor of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> essential oil are (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal and (Z)-2-dodecenal.
