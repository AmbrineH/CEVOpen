<p class="p">The yields of the leaf, stem and root essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> were 0.2%, 0.16% and 0.17% respectively. The characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> oils are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Thirty four (34) constituents were identified in the volatile oils accounting for 99.99%, 96.63% and 92.27% respectively. The analyzed oils were qualitatively and quantitatively different, characterized by high amount of aromatic, linear unsaturated and saturated aldehydes. The leaf volatile oil contained a high proportion of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-Dodecenal (28.43%), 13-tetradecenal (27.45%), dodecanal (14.59%) and 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (10.77%); the stem oil comprised of dodecanal (20.21%), 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (18.43%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal (8.27%), while 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (56.08%), 13-tetradecenal (9.26%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal (7.65%) were the most dominant in the root oil. The major aldehyde compounds occurred in all the samples, except 13-tetradecenal detected in both leaf and root oils. Monoterpene hydrocarbons occurred in the range 5.49%â€“28.11%, while the oxygenated monoterpene (3.49%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (0.44%) were detected in small quantities in the leaf part only.
