<p class="p">The selection of lipolytic filamentous fungi isolated from senescent plant material in Cerrado streams showed that, even under conditions not suitable for the induction of lipases, it is possible to find microorganisms with the potential for enzymatic production. The vegetation present in this natural habitat is inductive of a potential energy source for microbe's growth and enzyme production. The potential of the numerous wild strains reported here to produce lipases using unconventional oils is evidenced in this work. The basal composition of the culture medium was essential to increase lipase production, and its supplementation with tryptone (2.0% w/v) and degummed cottonseed oil (1.0% w/v) increased the production 13.3-fold (8.14 U/mL). The growth curve of the fungus showed that the highest production of lipases was observed after 72 hours of incubation (10.68 U/mL). Under these conditions, there was a 17.22-fold increase in enzyme production. The enzyme produced by
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani</italic> F61 showed potential to be used in hydrolysis and transesterification processes in organic media to produce fatty acid esters. An in-depth study into their production and activity through optimization processes is suggested, as it would provide a better understanding of this valuable enzyme.
