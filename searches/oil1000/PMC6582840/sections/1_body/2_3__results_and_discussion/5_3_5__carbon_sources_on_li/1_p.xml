<p class="p">Several vegetable oils from what is considered “Legal Amazonian” were used as carbon sources as a substitute for olive oil. Media were prepared using tryptone and ammonium chloride at 2.0% (w/v) as nitrogen source (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Cotton oil was used as a carbon source by
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani </italic>F61 and presented the highest lipase production value (8.14 U/mL) followed by soybean oil (6.17 U/mL) using tryptone as nitrogen source. Cotton oil is composed of palmitic acid (C16, 17-29%), stearic acid (C18, 1-5%), oleic acid (C18:1, 14-44%), and linoleic acid (C18:2, 33-58%), while soybean oil is composed of palmitic acid (C16, 2-13%), stearic acid (C18, 2-6%), oleic acid (C18:1, 18-31%), linoleic acid (C18:2, 49-57%), and linolenic acid (C18:3, 2-10%) [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The production of lipases in cotton and soybean oils may be related to oleic acid, as it is known to be an inducer of lipase production and is present in these oils in greater quantity than the other oils used. Furthermore, it may be responsible for higher enzymatic production, in addition to having been cited in literature as a good inducer of lipase production [

On the other hand, the usage of Amazonian oil with ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source presented the lowest value for lipase production (0.12 – 0.88 U/mL); however, the highest esterification activities were observed with copaiba oil (0.43 U/mL), babassu oil (0.41 U/mL), and castor oil (0.40 U/mL). Biomass production by
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani </italic>F61 was also higher when the organic nitrogen (tryptone) with different Amazonian oils was used (8.9 - 14.5 g/L), while for the inorganic nitrogen source (ammonium chloride) the lowest biomass production was observed (1.7 – 8.6 g/L). Although copaiba oil has a large amount of oleic acid, the enzymatic production of lipase, as well as its biomass production, was not high, showing that high amounts of oleic acid concentrations may also inhibit lipase production [
