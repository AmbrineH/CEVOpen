<p class="p">Biomass produced by filamentous fungi indicates that each isolated strain could grow on liquid medium supplemented with olive oil, and no correlation was found to exist between lipase and biomass production (

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Maximal biomass production was observed for F24 strain (10.76 g/L). The F61 strain produced higher lipase activity (0.62 U/mL) and intermediary biomass (5.12 g/L) compared to the other fungal isolates. Messias et al. (2011) also observed no correlation between lipase and biomass production of
 <italic class="italic"> Botryosphaeria</italic> isolates with different oils and glycerol carbon sources. The authors observed that
 <italic class="italic"> Botryosphaeria ribis</italic> EC-01 grown in glycerol presented high lipase activity and less biomass when compared to the other vegetable oils evaluated.
