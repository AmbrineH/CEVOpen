<p class="p">Among the fungal strains that produced hydrolytic activities, the esterification activity was observed in 36.0% of the total number of isolates. The highest esterification activity (0.11 U/mL) was observed with F36 strain, followed by F307 (0.10 U/mL), F5 and F61 (0.09 U/mL), and F37 (0.08 U/mL) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Lipases in organic synthesis are very prominent and the screening of lipases that work adequately in organic medium for ester synthesis, converting triglycerides to alkyl esters and triacylglycerol interesterification, has tremendous application particularly in the food industry [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Cardenas et al. (2001) selected fungal lipase that worked well in organic media for the synthesis of heptyl oleate. They observed that
 <italic class="italic"> Monascus mucoroides, Fusarium poae, Fusarium solani</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum</italic> showed a higher esterification activity, respectively. In this study, it was observed that lipases from
 <italic class="italic"> F. poae</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani</italic>, which had showed a low hydrolytic activity, were very productive in the synthesis of heptyl oleate.
