<p class="p">Thirty-eight filamentous fungi isolated from decomposition leaves were evaluated for lipolytic enzymes in agar plates by enzymatic activity formed by Rhodamine B and calcium precipitation halos with Tween 20 (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Potential enzymes production by filamentous fungal strains also was evaluated in submerged cultivation and biomass. Hydrolytic activity and esterification activities were also evaluated (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Among fungal strains evaluated, 66.0% presented positive enzymatic activity in agar plates using olive oil or Tween 20 as carbon sources. Solid agar plate was indicated as a direct method to identify fungal growth as well as the ability to produce extracellular enzymes. Furthermore, it is a useful rapid method to evaluate individual fungi of genetic variants for either presence or absence of enzymes such as lipases [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Smitha et al. (2014) screened 181 marine fungi for their ability to secrete hydrolytic enzymes using nutrient agar supplemented with tributyrin as substrate. The authors observed that 60.2% of total fungi isolates presented lipolytic activity. The sensitivity of the agar plate method to identify active and true lipase is dependent on several factors, e.g., the microorganism's growth, production and diffusion of the enzymes, activity and specificity of the enzyme to substrate, and enzyme concentration. Other factors can also influence halo formation, such as medium composition, growth temperature, and chemical and biological environment [

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the halo formation does not represent the volumetric enzyme production, and the additional experiment, such as submerged cultivation, is needed to identify the promising microorganisms for bioprocess steps (Colen, 2006). Winayanuwattikun et al. (2011) used the agar plate method to screen fungal lipase with activity on long-chain triacylglycerides. In this work, the authors selected 39.2% strains with fluorescence halos on palm oil hydrolysate, indicating the lipase production with specificity for long-chain fatty acids.
