<p class="p">A second step was carried out under submerged cultivation to evaluate the lipase production by filamentous fungi that presented positive enzymatic activities on agar plates with olive oil as sole carbon source. Furthermore, the cultivation that presented hydrolytic activity on
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-nitrophenyl palmitate was also evaluated for esterification activity and biomass production (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Twenty-five strains that presented enzymatic activity on agar plate also presented hydrolytic activity under submerged cultivation. The highest enzyme activity was observed with strain F61 (0.62 U/mL). Intermediary enzyme activity was observed with eight filamentous fungi (0.12 – 0.25 U/mL) and lowest enzyme activity (0.01 – 0.08 U/mL) was observed for sixteen filamentous fungal strains. Goldbeck et al. (2013) observed that, from 372 strains evaluated, 207 showed a hydrolysis halo around the colonies, representing 55.6% of the total. Almeida et al. (2013) evaluated the lipolytic enzyme production for 11 filamentous fungi and 8 yeast strains on agar plates, where 21% of the microorganisms presented potential to enzyme production. Among them, 63.0% presented lipase activity on
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-NPP substrate when cultured in submerged conditions. Griebeler et al. (2011) observed that, among the 203 isolated strains, the filamentous fungi presented a higher potential for lipase production on agar plate and in solid-state cultivation; however, some microorganisms that presented with hydrolysis halos on agar plate with tributyrin as carbon source did not show hydrolytic activity when cultivated under solid-state conditions with soybean bran.
