<p class="p">The medium composition strongly affected the lipase production of
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani </italic>F61. The results observed for lipase production are directly related to the presence and concentration of each salt used in the media formulation. In this sense, the presence of calcium (CaCl

 <italic class="italic"> T. harzianum </italic>F307 (0.19 U/mL) using medium 5 (M5). Filamentous fungal strains presented different behaviors against the media composition indicating that the improved conditions for lipase production need to be optimized for each fungal strain in order to determine the ideal nutrient requirements of the cultures. In this regard, Sharma et al. (2001) reported that trace elements assist with structural components and are stabilizers of enzymes, whereas ions such as Mg
