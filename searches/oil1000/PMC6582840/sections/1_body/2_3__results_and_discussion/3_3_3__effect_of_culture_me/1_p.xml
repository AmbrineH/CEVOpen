<p class="p">In this study, minerals composition of the culture media was evaluated to verify the effect on cell wall permeability or buffering the medium and enzyme production. It is also known that the quantity and quality of nutrients available and the ability to assimilate successfully are the major determinants of microbial nature and its metabolic activity. The effects of minerals composition on lipolytic enzyme production by

 <italic class="italic"> F. solani</italic> F61 demonstrated hydrolytic activity of 2.37 U/mL and esterification activity of 0.07 U/mL. Yield fermentation (

A sample under the same conditions, with no enzymatic extract present, was used as a control for each experiment. Pera et al. (2006) also developed this culture medium to produce lipases from
