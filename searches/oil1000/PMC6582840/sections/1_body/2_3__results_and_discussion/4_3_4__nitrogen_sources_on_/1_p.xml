 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The concentrations of organic and inorganic nitrogen sources in the culture medium promoted an increased in lipase production; however maximum enzyme production was observed with 2.0% (w/v) tryptone (3.48 U/mL), followed by yeast extract at 1.0% and 2.0% (3.22 U/mL and 3.14 U/mL, respectively). Under these conditions, the highest biomass values (10.48 â€“ 15.19 g/L) were also observed. Corn steep liquor and peptone provided intermediary values for lipase production, while urea, ammonium chloride, and ammonium sulfate provided the lowest values of enzyme production. It was observed that enzyme production was not associated with biomass formation, indicating that the nitrogen sources can modulate lipase secretion into the extracellular medium [

 </sub>) with tryptone was 278.40 U/g; esterification activity was the highest with ammonium chloride (0.23 U/mL), followed by ammonium sulfate (0.17 U/mL) at 2.0% (w/v). Nitrogen sources, including organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen sources, play an important role in the synthesis of enzymes. As inorganic nitrogen sources can be used up quickly, organic nitrogen sources can supply many cell growth factors and amino acids, which are needed for cell metabolism and enzyme synthesis; therefore, both organic sources and inorganic sources are used in lipase fermentation [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Additionally, in the industrialization of fermentation processes, the nutrient cost of the medium is one of the most important factors, and supplementation of nitrogen source is too costly for commercial production of enzymes and biofuels, as it could amount to 50% of the overall medium cost [
