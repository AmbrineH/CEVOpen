 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> F61 was cultured for 240 hours to verify the time-course for lipase production using tryptone 2.0% (w/v) and cotton oil 1.0% (w/v), 28Â°C and 180 rpm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In the first 24 hours of cultivation, lipase production was observed at 0.80 U/mL, with continuous increase up to 72 hours of incubation (10.68 U/mL), and the yield of fermentation was 1,158.00 U/g of substrate. After this period, the enzyme production decreased continuously up to 240 hours. Winaynuwattikun et al. (2011) evaluated the time-course for lipase production of an
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani</italic> strain, and the maximum enzyme production was observed after 72 hours (1.26 U/mL) during the initial stationary phase. Salihu et al. (2011) evaluated the lipase production of several microorganisms isolated from palm oil factory effluents. In that study,
 <italic class="italic"> C. cylindracea </italic>was observed to demonstrate maximum enzyme activity after 144 h (2.1 U/mL). The decrease in enzyme production is associated the extended cultivation period, nutrient depletion, or protease activity. Mahanta et al. (2008) observed these conditions during the solid-state cultivation of
 <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in that the decrease in enzyme activity was associated with nutrient depletion or denaturation of the enzyme caused by interaction with other components in the environment or alteration in the pH of the medium. Long et al. (2007) reported that several factors are known to influence the expression of lipase activity, one of them being component of the medium, such as carbon sources, nitrogen, as well as inducers in the form of oils, fatty acids, and esters. These factors are known to influence the production of lipases.
