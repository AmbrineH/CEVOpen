<p class="p">The filamentous fungi that presented potential to produce lipase with hydrolytic and esterification activities in the initial stage of work were identified using morphological characteristics, based on shape of fructification body (F5 and F36) and molecular technique (F61, F3, F21, F37, F104, F116, F120, F125, F130, and F307), using ribosomal targets ITS-1 and ITS-4 (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used in this study for the molecular identification of the filamentous fungi, as it is generally accepted as the universal DNA barcode marker for fungi [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and has often been used for the molecular identification of various species of fungi [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Molecular identification of the ITS region showed high similarity (99%) with five genera (
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Penicillium</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> Trichoderma</italic>), grouped into nine species, which are
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus calidoustus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus flavus</italic> (n = 2 isolated),
 <italic class="italic"> Chaetomium aureum, Fusarium solani, Penicillium citrinum,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Trichoderma harzianum </italic>(n = 2 isolated). One isolate showed high sequence similarity with an isolate identified only as
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus </italic>sp. The genus
 <italic class="italic"> Fusarium</italic> has been widely recognized as lipase producer in several studies [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], with the species
 <italic class="italic"> Fusarium solani</italic> being among the well-known lipase producers. A BLAST search on the NCBI database (

 <italic class="italic"> T. harzianum</italic> for F37 and 307 strains and
 <italic class="italic"> F. solani</italic> for F61. The strains F5 and F36 were identified as
 <italic class="italic"> Trichoderma </italic>sp. F5 and
 <italic class="italic"> Penicillium </italic>sp. F36, respectively, based on the morphological characteristics (colony appearance, color, and type of mycelium).
