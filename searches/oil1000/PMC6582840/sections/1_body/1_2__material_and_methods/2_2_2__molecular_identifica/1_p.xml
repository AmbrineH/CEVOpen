<p class="p">Total DNA from the filamentous fungal strains were extracted from cultures grown on PDA media using the IllustraTM Nucleon PhytoPure, plant and fungal DNA extraction kits (GE Healthcare, Amersham, England). The amplified products were purified and the samples were then sent to the Laboratory of Polar Microbiology and Tropical Connections of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and to the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Parasitology (LCPM), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FioCruz) Institute/René Rachou. The sequencing products of both DNA strands were contiguously grouped, aligned, and corrected using the Geneious 6.1.8 software [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. A comparative identity search of the nucleotide sequences obtained from the isolates was performed using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search) tool [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] on NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Identity ≥ 99% confirmed the identity of the species.
