<p class="p">Lipase activity was assayed with 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>-nitrophenyl-palmitate (p
 <italic class="italic">-</italic>NPP) as substrate [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. p
 <italic class="italic">-</italic>NPP was firstly solubilized in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to final concentration at 50 mM with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, containing 0.5 % Triton X-100. Lipase activity was determined by following the hydrolysis of
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-NPP at 37°C. The reaction was stopped at different intervals by heat shock (90°C, 1min), followed by the addition of 1 mL saturated sodium tetraborate solution. The calibration curve was prepared using pNP as standard. The
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-nitrophenol formed was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The molar extinction coefficient for 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>-nitrophenol (p-NP) at 405 nm is 1.8 x 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> M/cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Controls were prepared without enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol of p-NP per min. Results were presented as total units or specific activity in units by milligram of protein.
