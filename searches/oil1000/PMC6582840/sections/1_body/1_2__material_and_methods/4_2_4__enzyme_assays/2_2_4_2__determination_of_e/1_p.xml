<p class="p">The esterification activity (EA) catalyzed by the crude enzymatic extracts was followed by modified titrimetric assays [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The esterification activity of crude enzymatic extracts was measured by the consumption of acid in the esterification reaction with ethanol and oleic acid (1:1 equimolar ratio). Experiments were carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks (125 mL) containing 5 mL of reaction medium. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mL of the enzymatic extract. Experimentally, a control assay (blank) was consistently performed. After incubation in shaker for 120 min at 40°C and 180 rpm, the content of fatty acids remaining in the aliquot was extracted by the addition of 15 mL of an acetone/ethanol solution (1:1, v/v). The amount of oleic acid was then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH up to pH 11. One unit of lipase activity was defined as the amount of dry enzyme preparation necessary for the consumption of 1
