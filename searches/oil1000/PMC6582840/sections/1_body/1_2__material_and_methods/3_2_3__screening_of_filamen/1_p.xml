 <italic class="italic">Initial screening for lipolytic enzyme production </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">qualitative method</italic>): Lipase-producing filamentous fungal strains were screened on PDA plates supplemented with 1.0% (w/w) olive oil and Rhodamine B (0.01%, ww). Lipolytic activity was detected by the appearance of orange fluorescence halos around the colonies, under UV light at 350 nm [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 0.1, agar, 20, supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) Tween 20. The final pH was adjusted to 7.4 and the medium was autoclaved at 121°C, for 20 min. The lipolytic activity was indicated by appearance of opaque halos around the colonies due to calcium salts precipitation. Cultures were incubated at 28°C and examined daily for 7 days. The enzymatic activity was determined using an enzymatic index (IE), where the relation of the mean diameter of the degradation halo and the mean diameter of the colony is evaluated [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In this work, due to the use of two applied techniques in the initial selection, it was not possible to calculate the enzymatic index by measuring the fluorescence halo or opaque area around the colony. Therefore, each strain was assigned a positive (+) or negative (-) for the presence/absence of activity, respectively, expressed under various conditions using different media. This assigned signal was used as our enzymatic activity.
