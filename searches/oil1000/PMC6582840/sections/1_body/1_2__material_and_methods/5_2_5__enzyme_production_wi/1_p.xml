<p class="p">Cultures were grown in triplicate in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 25 mL of respective medium described in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) olive oil and 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract. Media were autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. Inocula were prepared using 5-day-old cultures. Medium was inoculated with 1 mL conidia suspension (10
