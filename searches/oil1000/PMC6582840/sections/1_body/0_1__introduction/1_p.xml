<p class="p">Lipases (triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase, E.C. 3.1.1.3) have emerged as key enzymes in swiftly growing biotechnology, owing to their multifaceted properties, which find usage in a wide array of industrial applications, such as food technology, detergent, chemical industry, and biomedical sciences [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. These enzymes are able to catalyze many reactions on ester bonds with preference on water-insoluble substrates being activated when absorbed to an oil-water interface to generate free fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and glycerol [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Lipases are organic solvent-tolerant which open up an infinity number of application for the chemical industry, as esterification reactions are used to produce food flavor, fragrance, cosmetic and pharmaceutical, as well as transesterification to produce biodiesel [
