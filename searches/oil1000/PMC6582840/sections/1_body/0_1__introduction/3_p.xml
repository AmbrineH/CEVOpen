<p class="p">There are several methods of selection of lipase-producing organisms, lipolysis being observed directly by changes in the appearance of the substrate [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], where lipase production is indicated by the formation of light halos around cultured colonies on agar plates containing tributyrin, triolein, and tweens [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The lipolytic activity in solid media can also be determined using dyes such as Rhodamine B [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and Vitoria B blue [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], in which a drop in pH occurs due to the fatty acids released by the hydrolysis of the substrate, resulting in the formation of fluorescent halos around the colony [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The combination with Rhodamine B proved to be an efficient method in which this compound binds fatty acids and mono- and diglycerides and develops fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light. Thus, this technique is very convenient since Rhodamine B is quite selective and used for the selection of microorganisms producing lipase [
