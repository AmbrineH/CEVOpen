<p class="p">Lipases are inducible enzymes, i.e., produced by microorganisms in the presence of an inducer, which may be the substrate itself or the product of its hydrolysis. The inducer can be added to the culture medium to stimulate production [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], requiring sources of lipid carbon in the form of oils for higher enzyme yield [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The mechanisms that regulate lipase biosynthesis vary significantly among the different producing microorganisms. In some cases, lipase production appears to be constitutive and independent of the addition of lipid substrates in the culture medium [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, their presence may increase the level of lipolytic activity. There are several reports of the use of tested vegetable oils to evaluate their induction power in the production of lipases by filamentous fungi, such as palm oil [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], canola oil, corn oil, sunflower oil [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], castor oil [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and cotton oil [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>].
