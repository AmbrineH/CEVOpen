<p class="p">Dietary modulation of fatty acids can influence plasma oxylipin levels. Therefore, dietary fatty acid content has to be carefully considered since the oxylipins derived by specific dietary PUFAs can have a detrimental effect and lead to cardiovascular disease. For example, dietary LA leads to an increased production of 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) which has been shown to be increased in oxidized LDL, leading to its accumulation in macrophages, and ultimately to atherosclerosis [
