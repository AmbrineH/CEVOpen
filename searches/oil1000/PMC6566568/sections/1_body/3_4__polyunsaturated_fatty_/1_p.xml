<p class="p">Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by lipid deposition and inflammation and hardening of the arteries. An atherosclerotic plaque can be asymptomatic or, as it progresses, it can become unstable, or it can rupture leading to myocardial infarction. Fatty acids are involved in plaque formation and stabilization. Dietary fatty acids can affect atherosclerosis in both a negative or a positive way depending on their structure. In a study conducted in 111 patients with CAD, fatty acid profiles established by gas chromatography showed significant correlation between trans fatty acids: elaidic acid (C18:1trans 9), trans isomers of linoleic acid (trans C18:2 isomers) and trans 11 eicosanoic acid (C20:1 trans 11) and biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters (hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF–α) as well as vascular severity [

The first trial known as the “Seven Countries Study” had more than 12.000 participants within the seven countries: United States, Finland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Japan, and the Netherlands. It showed that saturated fatty acids are the most powerful lifestyle predictor of CVD [
