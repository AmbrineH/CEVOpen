<p class="p">Taking this into consideration as well as the omega-6 rich and omega-3 poor western diet [
 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], there is a risk of cardiovascular disease in western societies [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The omega-6 derived arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a precursor for the formation of oxylipins via cyclooxygenase (COX) [
 <xref rid="B68-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Oxylipins have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. The best-characterized oxylipins are the ones derived from AA, and so far, the levels of AA-derived oxylipins in plasma have shown detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. Oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid promote inflammation [
