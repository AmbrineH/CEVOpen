<p class="p">Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are unsaturated fatty acids in which the double bond is in the trans configuration. Artificial TFAs are produced during industrial hydrogenation of vegetable oils leading to solidification and an increase in the half-life for the purpose of prolonged storage in the food industry. Natural TFAs are produced in the rumen of ruminants as a product of bacterial transformation and are found in small amounts in dairy and meat products [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The most common industrial TFA is elaidic acid (18:1, omega-9), while vaccenic acid (18:1, omega-7) represents the major ruminant TFA [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. According to the current guidelines of the European Food Safety Authority, TFA intake should be &lt;1% of the total caloric intake. North Americans consume between 5–10 g/day of industrial TFAs daily which constitutes approximately 2–5% of total energy within our diets [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, some studies suggest that some individuals consume up to 20 g/day of industrial TFAs [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. A 2% increase in TFA consumption leads to a 23% increase in the risk of CHD [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. TFAs have been associated with an increased risk of CVD by altering serum lipid composition. They increase the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol which is an important predictor of CVD [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In addition, they increase the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduce the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], triglyceride levels [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], and increase Lp(a) levels [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Increased dietary TFA intake induces inflammation in women as confirmed by increased levels of interleukin-6 and C- reactive protein [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Therefore, the effect on CVD can be indirect, since inflammation is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that increased TFA intake leads to endothelial dysfunction by increasing the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Apart from playing a role in the development of atherosclerosis, TFA can have an influence on atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. The type of atheromatous plaque with a thin &lt;65 µm fibrous cap which is infiltrated by macrophages [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] is most prone to rupture [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study of the association between TFAs and a thin fibrous cap atheroma as assessed by optical computed tomography, an association was identified between serum levels of elaidic acid and the presence of a thin fibrous cap atheroma in patients with CHD [
