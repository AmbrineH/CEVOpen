 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9 fatty acids are primarily found in foods such as olive oil, rapeseed oil, mustard seeds/oil, and wallflower seeds. Omega-9 fatty acids are usually found in two forms, oleic acid (18:1

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9). Both of these fatty acids have important biological functions. For example, oleic acid, found in olive oil, has been shown to decrease inflammation [
