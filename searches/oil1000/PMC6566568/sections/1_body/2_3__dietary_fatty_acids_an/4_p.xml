<p class="p">Dietary fat recommendations for cardiovascular health have focused on limiting the intake of saturated fatty acids. Studies of the association between saturated fatty acid intake and cardiovascular disease has generated conflicting data, with some dietary guidelines recommending to limit SFA intake and other studies showing no connection between SFA and CVD. A meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies showed no association between SFA consumption and an increased risk of CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) [

An analysis of 11 cohort studies showed that the replacement of 5% energy intake of SFAs with PUFAs was associated with decreased risk of coronary events and mortality [
