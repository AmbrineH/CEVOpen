<p class="p">There has been a great deal of interest in two distinct categories of PUFAs on cardiovascular disease, the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The position of the double bond, either in the 3rd or 6th position from the methyl end group will distinguish an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 fatty acid from an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acid. Within the cell, these ‘essential’ fatty acids are metabolized and converted into physiologically recognized compounds [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Long-chain 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids like ALA can be converted into two longer chain derivatives (DHA-docosahexaenoic acid and EPA-eicosatetraenoic acid), primarily by the 5- and 6-desaturase enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01179-f0A1" class="xref">Figure A1</xref>). DHA is derived from EPA by 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-oxidation. 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA) are converted into AA using the 5- and 6-desaturases similar to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids. A higher ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 intake in the diet will shift the desaturase action to favor the production of AA [
