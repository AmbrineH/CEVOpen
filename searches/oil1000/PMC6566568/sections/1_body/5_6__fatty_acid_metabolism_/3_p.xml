<p class="p">A diseased condition can either cause changes in fatty acid uptake or its oxidation, or, conversely, the disease can be caused by a dysfunction of the fatty acid uptake/oxidation processes. Understanding the role of proteins and pathways involved in fatty acid uptake and the role that changes in metabolism may play is particularly important in diseases of the heart. Since substrate utilization changes during stressful situations, analyzing fatty acid uptake and oxidation patterns are critical to a better understanding of the progression of cardiac diseases.</p>
