<p class="p">For example, insulin resistance in the heart and skeletal muscle is associated with a reduced response to increased circulating free fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B114-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. This is a common occurrence in insulin-resistant conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [
 <xref rid="B114-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. When the uptake of fatty acids exceeds the rate of beta-oxidation, intramuscular lipids can accumulate leading to lipotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. CD36, therefore, plays an important role in increasing long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake into the heart and increasing lipid accumulation when beta oxidation rates do not meet the energy needs of the heart [

CD36 also plays a role in atherosclerosis since CD36 is a class B scavenger protein and associated with macrophage infiltration. CD36 inhibition also leads to complications in the heart, such as development of hypertrophy [
 <xref rid="B115-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggest a clear role of CD36 in the progression of CVD. However, while CD36 knock-out may play a beneficial role in limiting disease progression (such as type 2 diabetes), it is still important for basal metabolic function. Long term use of agents such as SSO that inhibit FA uptake through the blocking of CD36 increase the risk of cardiac hypertrophy in rats [

 <xref rid="B117-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>] which, despite the early association with ventricular dysfunction, can have beneficial effects. Increased intramyocardial TG as well as elevated levels of serum PUFAs were protective in the failing heart [
