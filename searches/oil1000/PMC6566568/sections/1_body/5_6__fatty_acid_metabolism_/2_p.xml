<p class="p">The effects of dietary 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFAs may be less controversial. Rat and mice work suggests that maternal intake of LA predisposes the fetus to AA, the metabolic bi-product of LA. Increased exposure of the fetus to AA has been associated with increased adipocyte production suggesting increased maternal LA intake may predispose an individual to increased adipocyte production [

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFAs have differential effects on obesity. However, more study is necessary to fully understand this phenomenon.
