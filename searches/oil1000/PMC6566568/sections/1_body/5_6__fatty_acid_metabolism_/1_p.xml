<p class="p">Although there is a clear association between fat intake and obesity [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], it is important to recognize that the type of fat ingested may influence obesity risk. This is particularly important with respect to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids may have a protective effect on cardiovascular diseases. However, epidemiological studies remain unclear whether 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA intake decreases weight gain and abdominal fat. Although some studies have indicated a decrease in body fat with up to 6 g/day EPA and DHA consumption [
 <xref rid="B110-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>], other large prospective health studies such as the Nursesâ€™ Health Study observed an increased prevalence of obesity with high fish intake and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA intake [
 <xref rid="B111-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. Taken together, these results cannot define a clear role of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids in the prevalence of obesity, however, published data tens to indicate a decrease in obesity risk with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acid consumption. As well, most studies are limited by solely analyzing the effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA on weight gain.
