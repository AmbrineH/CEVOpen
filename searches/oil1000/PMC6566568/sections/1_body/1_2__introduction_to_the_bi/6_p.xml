<p class="p">Oxylipins represent a class of fatty acid metabolites present in all tissues in the body and produced by oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by three different enzymes. The tissue oxylipin profile depends on many different factors. Since oxylipins are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, the amount of dietary PUFAs influences oxylipin production. Moreover, the presence of different enzymes, as well as enzyme preferences for certain PUFAs, will influence the tissue oxylipin profile. The major, but not the only source of oxylipins, are fatty acids released from membrane phospholipids by the cytosolic PLA
