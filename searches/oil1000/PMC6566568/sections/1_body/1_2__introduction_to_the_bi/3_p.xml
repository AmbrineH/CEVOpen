<p class="p">Once fatty acids are taken up by the cell through transport proteins and/or passive diffusion, they can then be converted into energy. This process is known as beta oxidation. Once the fatty acid is taken up within the cell, a CoA group is added to the fatty acid using the enzyme fatty acid CoA synthase (FACS). This forms long-chain acyl-CoA. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) converts long-chain acyl-CoA to long-chain acylcarnitine. This allows the fatty acid moiety to be transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane via carnitine translocase. The inner membrane protein CPT2 then converts long-chain acylcarnitine back to long-chain acyl-CoA inside the mitochondria. The long-chain acyl-CoA then enters the beta oxidation pathway. Fatty acid beta oxidation consists of breaking down the long-chain acyl-CoA molecule into acetyl-CoA. Four main enzymes are used in the process to convert acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. The number of acetyl-CoA molecules is dependent upon the carbon chain length in the fatty acid. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain to yield ATP [
