<p class="p">Fatty acid metabolism plays a particularly important role in the heart. The continuous pumping action of the heart exhibits a high energy demand. ATP is the ultimate source of this energy. In order to generate ATP at a high enough rate to sustain cardiac contractility, almost all ATP (âˆ’95%) is derived from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [

Beta oxidation within the heart is under complex control. The factors which affect the cycle include the supply of fatty acid, the presence of competing substrates, the energy demand of the heart and the supply of oxygen to the heart [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Fatty acids can be recognized by the heart as free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerol (TAG), or very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). In the case of VLDL, the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can hydrolyze TAG and VLDL within cardiomyocytes. Regulation of LPL plays a significant role in fatty acid metabolism within the heart. Increased LPL translocation to the plasma membrane has been correlated with increased beta oxidation [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Mitochondrial uptake of fatty acids is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1). The enzyme CPT1 catalyzes and converts long-chain acyl-CoA into long-chain acyl-carnitine. This facilitates uptake into the mitochondria and will have distinct effects on rates of beta oxidation. Changes in fatty acid metabolism within the heart have been implicated in a variety of complex cardiovascular diseases.
