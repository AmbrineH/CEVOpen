<p class="p">Other than beta oxidation, fatty acids can also be used in other key processes within the cell. Of note, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are integrated into phospholipids within the cell membrane. Structurally, phospholipids (or glycerophospholipids) consist of a glycerol backbone, two fatty acids and a phosphate containing a polar head group. PUFAs are preferentially incorporated into the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Incorporation of omega-3 PUFAs into membrane phospholipids can lead to changes in membrane properties and alter the function of membrane proteins [
