<p class="p">Phospholipids play an important role in ischemic reperfusion injury in the heart. Due to the presence of double bond PUFAs on the sn-2 position, phospholipids are highly susceptible to oxidation. This ultimately leads to the production of oxidized phospholipid species [

 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Using mass spectrometric analyses, a significant increase in oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPC) species was found following in vitro ischemia/reperfusion injury [
