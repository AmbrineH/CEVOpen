<p class="p">Apart from a pharmacological approach for improving heart function and reducing the extent of ischemia/reperfusion injury, there is evidence that dietary intervention might be beneficial as well. A case-control study including 125 patients showed that ALA intake leads to a decreased risk of fatal ischemic heart disease [
