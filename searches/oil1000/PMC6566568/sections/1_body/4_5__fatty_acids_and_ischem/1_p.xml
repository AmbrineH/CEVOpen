<p class="p">Fatty acid metabolism is altered in patients post myocardial infarction. In the healthy heart, 95% of the energy is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria with the rest coming from glycolysis [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. During myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, metabolism in the heart is significantly altered. During ischemia, the oxygen supply/demand ratio increases leading to a diminished mitochondrial oxygen phosphorylation in proportion to the decreased blood flow [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Under these conditions, glycolysis becomes the primary generator of ATP while glucose oxidation is inhibited [

 <xref rid="B103-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. This suggests that the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation can be beneficial during reperfusion. The only clinically available drug that can suppress fatty acid oxidation is trimetazidine. It inhibits 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase [
