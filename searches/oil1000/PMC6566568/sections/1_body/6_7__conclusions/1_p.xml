<p class="p">Fatty acids represent a class of molecules with a large structural and functional diversity. They have a detrimental role in the heart functioning as a primary energy source in controlled conditions. The main point of this review was to highlight the metabolism of fatty acids in the heart in health and disease as well as to draw the attention to the importance of dietary fats. Dietary fatty acid intake can have both detrimental as well as beneficial effects on heart fatty acid metabolism. However, due to their bitter taste, fatty acid ingestion could be reduced. Here, we summarized the studies describing different methods that could be used to reduce the bitterness of fatty acids in order to improve their ingestion and the beneficial effects these ingested fatty acids, particularly PUFAs may have on our cardiovascular health.</p>
