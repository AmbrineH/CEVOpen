<p class="p">Dietary intake of fatty acids is important for human and animal health. Indeed, this is particularly clear with essential fatty acids which are not found in the body and must be ingested to be present. Essential fatty acids like alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, and linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid, are necessary for human health. However, despite the requirement for these fatty acids in human health, the acceptability of oils that contain fatty acids in the diet is a significant challenge due to their taste characteristics. This can be compounded by limited shelf stability of oils that may compromise taste and aroma further through unwanted oxidation of the fatty acids found in the oil. </p>
