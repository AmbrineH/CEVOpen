<p class="p">Olive oil and flaxseed oil (also known as linseed oil) are two commonly used culinary oils. Both oils exhibit a bitter and pungent taste [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. This can limit their acceptance in the general population and restrict their use in both regular diets and in experimental research studies as well [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Different agricultural practices, new processing technologies, and educational campaigns to emphasize the benefits of an association of a bitter taste with health have all been suggested as strategies to improve the acceptance of these oils in the general population [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, the acceptance of the bitterness in oil is influenced by the country of origin of the consumer. Spanish consumers were more tolerant of the pungent and bitter taste characteristics of olive oil than were their American counterparts [
 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The bitter taste originates from the unique polar polyphenol-rich composition of the oils [

 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The primary one responsible for the bitter taste of flaxseed oil has been identified as cyclic octapeptide cyclo (PLFIM OLVF) [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], also referred to as cyclolinopeptide E [
