<p class="p">Analytical methods used for studying the compounds that cause bitterness in food include chromatography and mass spectrometry, but also sensory evaluation. The so-called “electronic tongue” is a simple device used to analyze the compounds in food using chemical sensors in a similar way as the human tongue analyses taste. Busch et al. validated the efficacy of the electronic tongue in detecting bitterness in virgin olive oils by conducting a study in which they compared the enzyme-based biosensors and a standard HPLC method for the analyses of the total content of phenolics in virgin olive oils [
