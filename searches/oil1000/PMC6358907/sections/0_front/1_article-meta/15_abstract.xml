 <p class="p">Because Eplerenone (EPL) is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class-II drug and is prone to extensive liver degradation, it suffers from poor bioavailability after oral administration. This work aimed to prepare liquisolids loaded with EPL-nanoemulsions (EPL-NEs) that have a higher drug release rate and improved bioavailability by the oral route. Based on solubility studies, mixtures of Triacetin (oil) and Kolliphor EL/PEG 400 surfactant/co-surfactant (S
  <sub class="sub">mix</sub>) in different ratios were used to prepare EPL-NE systems, which were characterized and optimized for droplet size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), and drug content. Systems were then loaded onto liquisolid formulations and fully evaluated. A liquisolid formulation with better drug release and tableting properties was selected and compared to EPL-NEs and conventional EPL oral tablets in solid-state characterization studies and bioavailability studies in rabbits. Only five NEs prepared at 1:3, 1:2, and 3:1 S
  <sub class="sub">mix</sub> met the specified optimization criteria. The drug release rate from liquisolids was significantly increased (90% within 45 minutes). EPL-NE also showed significantly improved drug release but with a sustained pattern for four hours. Liquisolid bioavailability reached 2.1 and 1.2 relative to conventional tablets and EPL-NE. This suggests that the EPL-NE liquisolid is a promising oral delivery system with a higher drug release rate, enhanced absorption, decreased liver degradation, and improved bioavailability.
