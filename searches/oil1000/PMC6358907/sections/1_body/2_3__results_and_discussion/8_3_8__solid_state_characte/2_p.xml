<p class="p">DSC is a reliable and simple tool to test for material purity, formulation mixture compatibility, and describing drug crystalline properties in a specific blend, which is affected by drug solubility and/or distribution state within the mixture. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a shows the DSC thermogram of unformulated EPL with a sharp endothermic melting peak at 231.13°C in accordance with previously published data [

The drug melting peak was retained in the thermogram of the physical mixture without the appearance of any new peaks or other thermal events, indicating compatibility between formulation mixture components. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b shows the IR spectrum of unformulated EPL with the main characteristic functional groups at 2988.65 cm
