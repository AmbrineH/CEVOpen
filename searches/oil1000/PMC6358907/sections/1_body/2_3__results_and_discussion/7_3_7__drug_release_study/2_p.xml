<p class="p">EPL release data from the EPL-NEs and EPL-NE liquisolids was fitted to different kinetic models and then the best fit was selected based on the calculated correlation coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) value for each model. The Weibull model showed the best fit with an R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value that exceeded 0.9994 for the EPL-NE. For EPL-NE liquisolids, drug release followed the Korsemeyer-Peppas model with R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> values greater than 0.9986. These results indicate uniformity of drug solubility and distribution within the lipid phase, with a subsequent complex mixed dissolution-diffusion release pattern that is predictable in NE systems and typically described by the Weibull model. For the Korsemeyer-Peppas model, a number of synchronized steps usually occur that are expected for modified tablets dosage forms including diffusion of water, tablet swelling with subsequent drug diffusion, and dissolution. These results clearly demonstrate the effect of liquisolid loading on drug release from EPL-NE formulations [
