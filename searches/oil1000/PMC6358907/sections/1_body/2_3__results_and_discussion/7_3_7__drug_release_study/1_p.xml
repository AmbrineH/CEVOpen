 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the dissolution profiles of EPL from different prepared EPL-NE liquisolid tablet formulations in comparison to EPL-NEs and unformulated EPL in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2). The percent drug release showed a remarkable increase from all liquisolid formulations, in which approximately 90% of the drug was released after 45 minutes and drug release was complete within one hour, as compared to 39.6% and 47.3% for the unformulated drug after 45 and 60 minutes, respectively. For EPL-NE, a significant improvement of drug release was observed but with a sustained pattern, in which nearly complete drug release (greater than 97%) occurred within four hours. Further investigation of the release data indicated that the drug release profiles of both prepared EPL-NEs and EPL-NE liquisolids showed a biphasic release pattern, with rapid initial drug release in which 60â€“70% of the drug dose was released within one hour and 15 minutes for EPL-NEs and EPL-NE liquisolids, respectively. This could be explained by the higher wettability of the drug in contact with water due to the SAA effect that is favored in liquisolids by the presence of the finely-sized particle component of liquisolid (nano-silica) that acts as a distributing agent via the adsorption effect on a larger surface area and rapid drug partitioning into diluted dissolution medium, mainly from small droplets. A slower drug release pattern in the second phase could be correlated with the decline in oil/water drug partitioning from larger droplets under the effect of increasing media drug concentration according to the Noyes-Whitney equation [

Our results are in agreement with many studies that concluded that conventional NE formulations usually result in enhancement of hydrophobic drug dissolution but with a sustained release pattern under the effect of oil and interfacial film barriers [

However, in this work, it was clearly seen that the loading of the NE formulation onto a liquisolid mixture resulted in significant enhancement of both the amount released and the rate. This could be correlated to the fact that even though the drug prepared in a solid dosage form, it is detained within the formulation powder blend in solution or in an almost molecularly dispersed form, which causes a significant increase in surface area that is available for dissolution and the degree of subdivision of the drug loaded oil droplets with improved wetting characteristics [

This effect on the drug release profile is highly advantageous since it allows faster drug absorption to therapeutic levels in addition to the overall increase in drug absorption, which mainly occurs in gastric and upper duodenal segments [
