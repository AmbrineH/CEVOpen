<p class="p">Bioavailability is generally defined as the rate and extent of drug absorption. In bioavailability calculations of plasma data, the extent of absorption is usually quantified and described by both area under plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and the drug maximum plasma concentration (C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) while time elapsed to reach maximum plasma concentration (T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) is the parameter that describes absorption rate [

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and AUC
 <sub class="sub">0–α</sub> were increased and reached 1986.76 ng/mL and 11,328.11 ng.hr/mL, respectively, as compared to 1505.51 ng/mL and 9292.19 ng.hr/mL for the EPL-NE formulation, while lower plasma concentrations were observed for conventional oral tablets, with C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and AUC
 <sub class="sub">0–α</sub> values of 946.34 ng/mL and 5383.56 ng·hr/mL, respectively. The results also showed a shortened T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of 0.95 hours and 1.04 hours for liquisolid and NE formulations, respectively, as compared to 1.38 hours for conventional tablet formulation. As dissolution is the rate determining step in the absorption process of BCS class II drugs, these results correlate with the significant increase in drug dissolution from liquisolid formulations, the positive effect of NE on permeation through the GIT lumen, and para-cellular absorption that allows the drug to escape liver metabolism, with subsequent higher plasma levels.
