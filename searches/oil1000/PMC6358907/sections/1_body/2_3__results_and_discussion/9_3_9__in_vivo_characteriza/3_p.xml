 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, with 95% confidence intervals. According to these results, a significant difference was observed at the selected probability level. Additional data analysis was performed using the post-hoc tukey model to pinpoint the exact position of the observed difference, which indicated a significant difference in both the rate and extent of drug absorption for EPL-NE liquisolid as compared to conventional tablets but the only significant difference in the extent of absorption that was observed was in comparison with the EPL-NE formulation. A significant difference in both the rate and extent of drug absorption between conventional tablets and EPL-NE formulation was observed. The 95% confidence intervals had narrow ranges and excluded zero, which indicates data accuracy, the strength of the results, and confirmed the rejection of the null hypothesis.
