<p class="p">All prepared EP-NEs formulations had acceptable droplet sizes, ranging from 32.81 nm to 48.41 nm, with a narrow PDI, in the range of 0.160 to 0.240 (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). PDI correlates the standard deviation of the droplet size with the calculated mean size, which is a criterion for the uniformity of size distribution within the NE formulation [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The small PDI values indicate that the systems are mono-dispersed, have a narrow particle size distribution, and have a higher degree of stability [

Further investigation of the results showed that the oil content had a significant positive effect on droplet size, which could be explained by the increased viscosity of the mixture due to increased drug concentration. Surfactant and/or S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> did not have an effect on droplet size, mainly due to the proximity of the applied SAA concentration in the optimized systems.
