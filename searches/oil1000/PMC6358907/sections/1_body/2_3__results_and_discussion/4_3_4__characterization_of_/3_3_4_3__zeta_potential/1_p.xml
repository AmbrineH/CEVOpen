<p class="p">Zeta potential describes the electro-kinetic potential of colloidal systems and its value reflects the intensity of electric charges at the oil/water interface. Zeta potential is the main parameter that determines the physical stability of the dispersion, where repulsion between similar charges acts against the Oswald ripening and prevents droplet aggregation with subsequent phase separation [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Zeta potential is controlled by the type and concentration of the applied SAA, system composition, drug characteristics, vehicle nature, and presence of electrolytes. Generally, for the specific NE, it was previously claimed that a zeta potential of Â±30 mV indicates sufficient physical stability of a system [
