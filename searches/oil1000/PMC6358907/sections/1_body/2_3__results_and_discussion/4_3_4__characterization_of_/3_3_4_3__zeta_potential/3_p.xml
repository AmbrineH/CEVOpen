<p class="p">The SAA affects zeta potential either directly through neutralization of surface charges or indirectly through its effect on the particle size and surface area of the internal phase droplets [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this study, the applied SAA and co-surfactant are nonionic and had a negligible effect on surface charge; additionally, the proximity of SAA concentration in all optimized formulations downplays its effect on zeta potential. The negative charge of the droplet surface mainly correlated with the fatty acid content of the lipoid phase, with a slight difference between the NE systems according to their lipid content and droplet size [
