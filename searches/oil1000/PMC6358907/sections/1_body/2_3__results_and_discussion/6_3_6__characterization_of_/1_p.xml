<p class="p">Characterization results of the prepared EPL-NE liquisolid tablets are shown in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. All formulations showed a small weight variation and high drug content, ranging from 96.12% to 100.15%, which, according to standardized pharmacopeial limits, correlates with and indicates that the prepared liquisolid formulation mixtures had good flow characteristics. Hardness values above 50 N and friability less than 1% indicate good mechanical properties and adequate breaking strength, which can be correlated with the high compressibility characteristics of the formulation components (Avicel and Pharmaburst). Selection of Pharmaburst-500 SPI for use as a superdisintegrant for liquisolid tablet formulations not only enhanced the mechanical properties but also had a positive effect on disintegration. Pharmaburst is a co-processed mixture of mannitol, starch, crosspovidone, crosscarmellose-Na, and silica [
