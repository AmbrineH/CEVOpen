<p class="p">Selection of appropriate NE formulation components is a significant parameter to obtain a stable system [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. For hydrophobic drugs, lipid solubility is more important than other factors since it directly affects drug loading and hence the formulation volume for the required dosage. In addition, if drug loading is dependent on adding surfactant and/or co-surfactant, the drug will be prone to precipitation when diluted with GIT due to inhibition of the surfactant/co-surfactant solvation effect [

 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Moreover, for oil with low drug solubilizing ability, larger oil amounts may be needed to tolerate the required drug dose. To sequentially attain stable systems, a higher concentration of surfactant is used, which may affect the safety of the NE system [
