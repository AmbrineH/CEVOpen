<p class="p">In order to reduce oil/water interfacial tension significantly and increase interfacial film fluidity, a combination of high HLB surfactants and low HLB co-surfactants is preferable to use of a single SAA. Co-surfactants are usually short or medium chain alcohols (C3â€“C8) that are added thus that the amount of SAA used can be decreased. Co-surfactants are also distributed between SAA molecules at the oil/water interface that lowers the interaction between polar heads with a subsequent increase in interfacial film flexibility, which efficiently protects the oil droplet and increases hydrocarbon tail oil penetration to form a stable film [
