<p class="p">The selection of an appropriate SAA for NE formulation depends mainly on its safety, compatibility, and ability to lower the surface free energy at the water/oil interface to produce physically stable systems [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Non-ionic SAAs show relatively low physiological toxicity as compared to their ionic equivalents. Non-ionic SAAs also exhibit emulsification properties at a lower concentration, as indicated by a relatively lower critical micelle concentration, which is favorable for oral administration, as surfactants in high concentrations result in GIT irritation. In addition, for o/w NE systems, a hydrophilic nonionic SAA with a higher HLB value (&gt;10) shows a higher positive surface excess that results in accumulation at the oil/water interface, with an efficient decrease in surface tension and improved system stability [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In this work, four nonionic SAAs with a high HLB were evaluated for their suitability in the formulation of EPL-NE systems, based on their solubility. Kolliphor EL displayed maximum EPL solubility (6.8 mg/mL) with a high HLB (HLB = 14) (
