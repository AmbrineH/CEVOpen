<p class="p">Based on the constructed pseudo-ternary phase diagram, 20 plain NE formulations were prepared and evaluated for droplet size, zeta potential, and PDI (data not shown). Only five plain NE systems met the specified optimization criteria of droplet size in the range of 25 to 50 nm, zeta potential ranging from −25 to −35 mV, a PDI less than 0.3, and extended transparency for one week at room temperature. The composition of these NE formulations was as follows: At S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 3:1, Triacetin (10%), Kolliphor EL (30%), PEG 400 (7%), and water (53%); and Triacetin (15%), Kolliphor EL (33%), PEG 400 (11%), and water (41%). At S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 2:1; Triacetin (17%), Kolliphor EL (30%), PEG 400 (14%), and water (39%); and Triacetin (24%), Kolliphor EL (30%), PEG 400 (17%), and water (28%). At S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 1:3, Triacetin (5%), Kolliphor EL (12%), PEG 400 (36%), and water (47%). It was noted that higher oil concentrations were obtained for NE systems prepared at S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 2:1, as indicated by maximum emulsification efficacy. The optimized NE systems were selected for drug loading.
