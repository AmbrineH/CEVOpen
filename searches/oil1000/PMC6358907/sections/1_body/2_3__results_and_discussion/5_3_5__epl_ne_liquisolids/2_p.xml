<p class="p">According to the mathematical model, the flowable liquid retention potentials (Ð¤-Value) of Avicel and nano-sized silicone dioxide (R = 20) were used to calculate the liquid load factor (L
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>); the latter was used to calculate the amounts of carrier and coat materials that depended on the weight of the applied dry EPL-NE formulation according to the following equation: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">L
  <sub class="sub">f</sub> = W/Q
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where W is the weight of the dry EPL-NE formulation and Q is the weight of the carrier. The amount of coating material was calculated from the R-value. The composition and flow characterization of the prepared EPL-NE liquisolids are shown in
