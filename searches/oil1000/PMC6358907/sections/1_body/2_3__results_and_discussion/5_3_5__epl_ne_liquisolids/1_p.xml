<p class="p">The liquisolid technique is an advanced approach used mainly for enhancing the water solubility of a drug by mixing it with a suitable water miscible vehicle and loading onto a powder mixture of high absorbent and/or adsorbent properties (carrier and coat) in specified weights calculated according to the proposed mathematical model to achieve complete dryness and ensure good flow and compressibility characteristics [

In other words, liquisolid compacts could be described as liquid medications with an adequate flow that are compressed into a powdered form. In this work, a liquisolid mixture was applied as a carrier for the prepared EPL-NE formulations with good flow characteristics and that was suitable for direct compression using Avicel/nano-sized silicone dioxide as a carrier/coat mixture; thus, no water miscible vehicle was added and the calculations were dependent on the weight of the dry EPL-NE formulation that was loaded as a liquid medication.
