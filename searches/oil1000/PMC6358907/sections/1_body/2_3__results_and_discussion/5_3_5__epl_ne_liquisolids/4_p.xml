<p class="p">Based on the results in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00040-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, all prepared EPL-NE liquisolid mixtures showed very good flow characteristics, with an angle of repose in the range of 27.61° to 32.41°, Carr’s index values less than 20 (in the range of 16.02 to 19.37%), and the Hausner ratio close to unity [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These results designate the precision of the applied calculations of different model parameters and indicate the suitability of selecting a liquisolid technique as a carrier for the prepared EPL-NE formulation for direct compression.
