<p class="p">Using Triacetin as oil and Kolliphor EL and PEG 400 as a surfactant/co-surfactant mixture at different ratios (S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>), pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using the water titration method in order to obtain the concentration range of components necessary for preparing the NE. After equilibrium was achieved, each sample was visually checked to determine if clear NE or an emulsion was present. The obtained pseudo-ternary phase diagrams prepared with a different S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> with a field of existence of NE (non-shaded area) are shown in
