 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and S
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>). Thus, an increasing surfactant amount relative to the co-surfactant resulted in significant improvement of the NE area and the maximum was reached at a S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 2:1, while further SAA increase (S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 3:1) resulted in a narrower NE area. Many studies have shown that the NE area and position are mainly determined by the applied S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio [

 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>. In this study, the maximum NE area at S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> of 2:1 was correlated with the maximum emulsification efficacy that resulted in the reduction of the interfacial tension to the minimal level and optimum surfactant/co-surfactant packing with the formation of a highly flexible coherent film at the oil/water interface [
