<p class="p">NEs are lipid-based colloidal systems that are transparent and thermodynamically stable, with a droplet size in the range of 50â€“200 nm. NEs are stabilized by a surfactant/co-surfactant interfacial film that results in ultra-low interfacial tensions and high kinetic stability that prevents droplet coalescence and phase separation. In addition to high physical stability, other advantages of NEs include high solubilization ability, efficient membrane permeability, superior protection of drugs against oxidation, hydrolytic and physiological enzymatic degradation, controlled release, drug targeting, and increased bioavailability. Ease of preparation with a high cost benefit increases the potential use of NEs in pharmaceutical applications [
