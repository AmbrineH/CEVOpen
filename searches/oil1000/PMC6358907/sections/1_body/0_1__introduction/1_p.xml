<p class="p">Eplerenone (EPL), a member of the spironolactone group, is a new selective steroidal anti-mineralocorticoid receptor blocker. EPL selectively prevents aldosterone receptor binding in both epithelial and non-epithelial tissues that results in the blockage of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), with subsequent inhibition of sodium reabsorption that affects blood pressure and the cardiovascular system [

 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The resultant extended increase of plasma renin and serum aldosterone also inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin release [

 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. EPL is used to treat hypertension, central serous retinopathy, and chronic heart failure either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [

EPL is an aldosterone analogous with efficient renal and cardiac protective abilities, which is why EPL is used by elderly patients taking Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) [
