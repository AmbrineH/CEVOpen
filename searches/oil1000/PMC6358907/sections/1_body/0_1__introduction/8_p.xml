<p class="p">A previous study [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] indicated that solubility enhancement of BCS class II drugs has a positive effect of on bioavailability at the main absorption site. The present study aimed to prepare EPL-NE loaded liquisolid tablet mixtures that combined the advantages of the NE system (i.e., higher drug absorption due to the surfactant effect on GIT permeability [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and protection from liver degradation via para-cellular penetration [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]) with the advantages of liquisolids (i.e., rapid, high drug release at the main absorption site and presentation of NE formulations in a free flowing, highly compressible dry form suitable for oral delivery with enhanced drug bioavailability). Based on drug solubility studies, Triacetin, Kolliphor EL, and PEG 400 as an oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively were selected for preparing NE systems by the titration method. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the area of clarity (NE area) and different plain NE systems were prepared using different S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratios. Based on droplet size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI), NE systems were optimized for drug loading and were incorporated into liquisolid formulation prepared using Avicel/nano-silica as a carrier/coat mixture according to the proposed mathematical model. EPL-NE liquisolids were characterized before and after compression and drug release was compared to that of an unformulated EPL. An EPL-NE liquisolid formulation with higher drug release and better tableting properties was selected and subjected to further solid state characterization and bioavailability studies in comparison to EPL-NEs and conventional EPL oral tablets in rabbits.
