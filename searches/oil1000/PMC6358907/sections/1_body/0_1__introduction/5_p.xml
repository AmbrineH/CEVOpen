<p class="p">Lipid-based drug delivery systems, especially nano-sized systems including nano-lipid carriers (NLCs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs), and nanoemulsions (NEs). Since nano-sized systems can easily mix with GIT fluids to increase drug solubility that results in enhanced absorption and improved bioavailability, they have received extensive consideration for oral delivery of poorly soluble drugs [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Many studies have claimed that lipid formulations escape the dissolution step that is necessary for conventional solid or suspension oral dosage forms and pass through GIT membranes via the lymphatic system, which keeps the drug away from enzymatic degradation that occurs in the hepatic first-pass effect [
