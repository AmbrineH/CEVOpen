<p class="p">The liquisolid mixture has a dry appearance and is a non-adherent and flowable powder mixture containing liquid medication that is suitable for direct compression [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. A liquisolid mixture is prepared by simple blending of a liquid medication with selected powder excipients referred to as the carrier and coating materials. Various grades of cellulose, starch, and lactose may be used as the carrier, while very fine silica powder is usually used as a coating material. The term “liquid medication” refers to drug solutions, drug suspensions, emulsions, or liquid oily drugs. Quantities of carrier and coating materials needed to produce adequately flowing and compressible properties are calculated according to a liquisolid formation mathematical model [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to this model, the carrier and coating materials can retain only certain amounts of liquid (maximum liquid load) while keeping acceptable flow and compression properties, which is called the liquid load factor (L
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>). Depending on the selected excipient ratio (R) and the calculated liquid load factors, the required amounts of carrier and coating materials can be calculated [
