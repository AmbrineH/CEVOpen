<p class="p">These results support the conclusion that the EPL-NE liquisolid mixture is a promising dosage form for oral delivery with good flow and compression characteristics that increase the release rate, enhance drug absorption, and allows the drug to escape liver degradation, with a subsequent significant increase in drug bioavailability. In addition, Nanoemulsion Liquisolids, are expected to be a promising oral delivery system for BCS class II drugs with poor bioavailability especially those liable to extensive liver degradation. Further studies on other drug models in terms of pK, logP, and permeability are required to confirm the suitability of nanoemulsion liquisolids as an oral delivery system to increase drug bioavailability and protect from liver degradation.</p>
