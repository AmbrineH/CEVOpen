<p class="p">NEs are lipid formulations that can easily pass through the GIT membranes and bypass liver degradation due to lymphatic absorption, which significantly enhances the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs, especially those that suffer liver metabolism. In this work, EPL as a BCS class II drug model that normally suffers extensive liver degradation was formulated into an NE using Triacetin (oil) and Kolliphor EL/PEG 400 (S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>) in different ratios. Optimized NE formulations were loaded onto free flowing, highly compressible liquisolid tablet mixtures for oral delivery and the drug bioavailability of these NE formulations were compared to conventional oral tablets and NE formulation. Drug release from optimized EPL-NE liquisolids was significantly increased, with a high rate that exceeded 90% within 45 minutes, while EPL-NE also showed significant drug release but with a sustained pattern over four hours. The rate and extent of drug absorption were significantly increased from liquisolids as compared to NE formulations and conventional tablets, as indicated by the AUC, C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, and T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, in which bioavailability from liquisolids reached 2.1 relative to conventional tablets and 1.21 relative to the NE formulation. The bioavailability of EPL from NE formulation was increased by 1.72 relative to conventional oral tablets.
