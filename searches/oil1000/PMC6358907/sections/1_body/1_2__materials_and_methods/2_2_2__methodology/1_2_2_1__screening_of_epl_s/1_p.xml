<p class="p">The solubility of EPL in different lipids (olive oil, oleic acid, sesame oil, soybean oil, IPM, IPP, Labrafil, and Triacetin), surfactants (Labrasol, Tween 40, Tween 80, and Kolliphor EL), and co-surfactants (PEG 400, ethanol, PG, Transcutol HP, and glycerol) was investigated by separately adding excess amounts of EPL to 1 mL of the tested vehicle in small eppendorf. Mixtures were shaken for 72 hours (Hicon, New Delhi, India) at 25 ± 1.0 °C to reach the equilibrium. Samples were centrifuged (REMI Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant was collected and filtered (0.2 μm membrane), and drug concentration was determined (in triplicate) by a validated HPLC method. Drug solubility was recorded as mg/mL concentrations [
