<p class="p">EPL-NE liquisolids were prepared using Avicel PH 102/nano-sized amorphous silicon dioxide as carrier/coat mixtures with a fixed ratio (R) equals 20 that was recommended to give a satisfactory hardness and enhanced release profiles [

 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-11-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the Î¦-values of the carrier and the coating materials were calculated for each dry EPL-NE formulation and the calculated L

These calculated amounts of the carrier and coating materials were predicted to produce formulation mixtures with good flow and compression properties.
