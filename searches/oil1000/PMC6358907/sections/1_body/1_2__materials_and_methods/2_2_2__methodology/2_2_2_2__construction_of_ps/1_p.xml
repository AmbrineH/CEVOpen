<p class="p">For construction of the pseudo-ternary phase, the titration method (spontaneous emulsification) was applied as follows: The selected surfactant and co-surfactant were combined in different weight ratios (S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>) (coded as: S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (3:1), S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (2:1), S
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (1:1), S
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (1:2), and S
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> (1:3)). The selected oil was added to each S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> in different ratios (oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratios of 0:100, 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10, and 100:0) in screw-capped vials and mixed at room temperature until a clear solution was obtained. Phase diagrams were constructed by titrating these samples with aliquots of double-distilled water with continuous stirring for a sufficient amount of time to reach equilibrium. Samples were visually examined for clarity and subsequently classified as being either a clear NE, an emulsion, or gel (if present). The phase behavior of the systems was mapped on triangle phase diagrams with three apices representing S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>, oil, and water. The area of clear NE was determined.
