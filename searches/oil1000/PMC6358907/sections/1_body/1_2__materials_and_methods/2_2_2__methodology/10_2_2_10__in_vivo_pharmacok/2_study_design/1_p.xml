<p class="p">A single dose bioavailability study with a group of six healthy male albino rabbits (2.5â€“3.0 kg) was conducted in two phases based on a randomized crossover design. The rabbits were kept on the same diet during the study, with overnight fasting prior to drug administration but free access to water. Rabbits were cannulated through the marginal air vein to collect blood samples. Control plasma samples (2 mL) were withdrawn from each rabbit before drug administration.</p>
