<p class="p">Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and were prepared as follows: In 15 mL stoppered test tubes, each plasma sample (1 mL) was added to 50 µL of internal standard solution (10 µg/mL), followed by vortex mixing for one minute. Dichloromethane:diethyl ether [(4:6, v/v), 5 mL] was added and the mixture was shaken for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The organic layer was transferred into a new tube and was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream. Finally, the residue was reconstituted in mobile phase (250 µL) and was injected into a chromatographic apparatus. EPL concentration was calculated based on the data obtained from the constructed calibration curve in plasma. </p>
