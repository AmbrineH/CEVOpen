<p class="p">Drug release properties of the prepared EPL-NE loaded liquisolids were studied using the USP XXIV dissolution testing apparatus II (UDT-804 paddle dissolution apparatus, Logan, UT, USA) in 500 mL of 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) as the dissolution medium at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 50 rpm. At specified time intervals, a 5 mL sample was withdrawn with replacement and the cumulative percentage of drug release was calculated using an HPLC method [

For comparison, the drug release rate from corresponding EPL-NE formulations (using dialysis bags with a 12 kDa molecular weight cutoff) and the dissolution rate of unformulated EPL was also determined. The mean of six determinations was recorded.
