<p class="p">The average droplet diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and the droplet surface charge (zeta potential) of the EPL-NE formulations were investigated using photon correlation spectroscopy (Zetasizer 4, Malvern, UK) at 90 °C and 25 °C after dilution with ultra-purified water to an adequate intensity. Each measurement was performed at least in triplicate. The pH value of the samples was maintained at 6.5 ± 0.5.</p>
