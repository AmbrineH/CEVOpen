<p class="p">After the o/w NE regions in the phase diagrams were identified, 20 plain NE formulations were prepared using different oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>:water ratios within the NE region. Plain systems that had a droplet size in the range of 25 to 50 nm, PDI less than 0.3, zeta potential in the range of 25â€“35 mV, and retained transparency for one week at room temperature were optimized and selected for loading the drug.
