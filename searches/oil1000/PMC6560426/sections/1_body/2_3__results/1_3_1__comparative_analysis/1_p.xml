<p class="p">Ruminant animal performance is dependent on ruminal SCFA production. Amongst the SCFAs analyzed (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the rumen of EO-fed calves (40.25 ± 3.03 mM) compared to calves fed the control diet (31.06 ± 3.14 mM). While numerically greater in animals on the EO-supplemented diet, acetate, valerate, and total SCFA concentrations were not found to be statistically different between the two diets. A numerical difference in the acetate: propionate ratio was observed between the two treatments (EO: 1.24 ± 0.04; control: 1.38 ± 0.06; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.072).
