<p class="p">Overall, main OTUs showed a phylogenetic distribution reflecting their respective treatment, with higher representation of Bacteriodetes-affiliated OTUs in EO-fed calves and higher abundance of Firmicutes OTUs in control calves. Five of the Bacteriodetes affiliated OTUs were found in higher abundance in EO-fed calves compared to control, and were affiliated to the genus Prevotella (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00120-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Of these, only SD_Bt-00966 showed significantly higher relative abundance in calves fed EO (19.51% ± 5.32%) compared to control (2.69 % ± 1.80%). Its closest known relative was identified as 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella ruminicola</italic> (97% sequence identity). Firmicutes included by far the highest number of main OTUs, but none showed statistical differences based on treatment (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00120-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). OTU SD_Bt-00179 was observed in greater abundance in EO samples (13.6×), but these differences were not found to be statistically significant. OTUs SD_Bt-00125, SD_Bt-00732, SD_Bt-00975, SD_Bt-00980, SD_Bt-00983, SD_Bt-00998, and SD_Bt-36860 were found to be between 10× to 75.2× greater in control-fed calves compared to EO-fed calves. While these differences could help explain the higher abundance of Firmicutes in control-fed calves, they were not supported by statistical analysis. Most Proteobacteria were represented by a single OTU (SD_Bt-00978), which was higher (

The most abundant Actinobacteria OTU (SD_Bt-00967) was numerically lower in EO-fed calves, but by only a 2.5× difference with controls. Based on its high sequence identity to its closest valid relative, this OTU may have represented a strain of
