<p class="p">To gain further insights into the community level compositional differences between EO and control ruminal environments, alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted. Diversity of ruminal bacteria was not affected by treatment with EO under these conditions, since no statistical differences were observed for Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon indices (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00120-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, a beta diversity analysis using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-level Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00120-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) supported that the composition of EO and control samples were different from each other, as their respective data points were not evenly distributed between clusters.
