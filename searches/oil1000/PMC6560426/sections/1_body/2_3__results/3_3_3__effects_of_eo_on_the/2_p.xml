<p class="p">From a total of 4154 OTUs that were identified in this study, 31 OTUs were designated as main OTUs, which were defined as having a mean relative abundance of at least 1% for at least one treatment (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-07-00120" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). As a group, main OTUs represented 68.9% and 67.0% of sequence reads in EO and control fed samples, respectively. Only four main OTUs (SD_Bt-00966, SD_Bt-00967, SD_Bt-00986, and SD_Bt-36860) were found to have a sequence identity of 95% or greater to their closest valid relative, indicating that at least 27 main OTUs likely corresponded to uncharacterized ruminal bacterial species.
