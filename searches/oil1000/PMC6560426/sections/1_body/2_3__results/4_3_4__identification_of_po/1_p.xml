<p class="p">To explore potential associations between dairy calf performance parameters and ruminal bacterial OTUs, two approaches were used. First, canonical correspondence analyses were performed using SCFAs levels and growth parameters as explanatory variables, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00120-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Based on the length of the arrows for the SCFA biplot, which is indicative of the respective strength of association of the explanatory variables, the acetate propionate ratio, total SCFAs, as well as the respective levels of propionate, acetate, and iso-butyrate, were found to display, overall, the strongest associations with OTUs. SD_Bt-00179 uniquely showed high correspondence to multiple SCFA attributes (total SCFAs, acetate, and propionate), while other OTUs appeared more strongly associated with individual SCFA conditions, such as observed for the acetateâ€“propionate ratio (SD_Bt-00125, SD_Bt-00975, and SD_Bt-00009). While butyrate did not show as strong an influence as other SCFAs by this analysis, CCA indicated a strong association between butyrate and SD_Bt-00732. When calf growth performance parameters were used as explanatory variables, body length and heart girth showed the strongest correspondence with OTUs. SD_Bt-00009, SD_Bt-30048, and SD_Bt-00070 were found to be more strongly associated with body length, while SD_Bt-00977, SD_Bt-00732, and SD_Bt-00967 were more strongly associated with heart girth.
