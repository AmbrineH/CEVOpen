<p class="p">Based on Pearson correlation coefficient analysis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-07-00120" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), the following positive correlations were identified. Butyrate concentrations, which are critical to the development of ruminal papillae in growing calves, were strongly associated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with OTUs SD_Bt-00995 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.733) and SD_Bt-00732 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.654), and showed a tendency for correlation with SD_Bt-00992 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.622, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.055). Valerate levels were also strongly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with OTU SD_Bt-00995 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.635), and showed a tendency with SD_Bt-00732 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.592, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.072). Finally, for SCFA parameters, a tendency for correlation was found for three OTUs with the acetateâ€“proprionate ratio: SD_Bt-00009 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.596, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.069), SD_Bt-00070 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.575, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.082), and SD_Bt-00718 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.558, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.094). Amongst the calf growth parameters tested, the only statistically supported association by Pearson correlation was a tendency between SD_Bt-00978 and hip width (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.557, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.094).
