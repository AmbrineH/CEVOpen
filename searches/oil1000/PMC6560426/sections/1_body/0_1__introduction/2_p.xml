<p class="p">Since antibiotics act as selection agents that ultimately affect the composition of host microbiomes, a common strategy to identify effective alternatives has been to explore the potency of other types of antimicrobials, which have included essential oils (EO), a group of plant secondary metabolites that can be extracted by distillation. As a group, they are very diverse in chemical structure and biological effects, with terpenoids and phenylpropanoids representing the most commonly found types of EO [
 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Studies carried out in ruminants have provided evidence that EO could be used instead of antibiotics for improving animal productivity [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. While certain reports found no discernable effects of EO supplementation on production or ruminal parameters [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], perhaps as a result of dosage or nature of the active compounds, other studies were successful in uncovering positive responses. Their reported effects on rumen function include inhibition of deamination and methanogenesis, resulting in lower ammonia nitrogen and methane, respectively [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. EO can also reduce ruminal acetate levels, while maintaining total short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production through increased propionate and butyrate production in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Positive effects of EO supplementation for dairy calf performance have also been reported, such as increased starter feed intake and improved feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The benefits of EO on the performance of young ruminants are of particular interest, as they may be the result of changes in the gut microbiome caused by their antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, since the composition of gut microbial communities in neonatal and young animals tends to fluctuate until it becomes stably established later on in life [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], it is more likely to be responsive to manipulation during these early growth stages.
