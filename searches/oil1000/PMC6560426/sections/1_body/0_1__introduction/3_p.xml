To gain further insight, we took advantage of a companion study to investigate the rumen environment of dairy calves fed a commercial blend of EO [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In this context, the main objective of the investigation presented in this report was to determine the effects of EO supplementation on ruminal bacterial communities. Comparative analyses of ruminal SCFA profiles and bacterial community composition performed between the two dietary groups indicated that supplementation of a standard dairy calf diet (i.e., milk replacer and pelleted calf starter) with the EO product resulted in an increase in rumen propionate concentration that was associated with profound differences in bacterial composition, which included the enrichment of specific uncharacterized bacteria.
