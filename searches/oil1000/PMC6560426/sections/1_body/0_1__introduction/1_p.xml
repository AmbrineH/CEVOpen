<p class="p">Antibiotics have traditionally been used in dairy calf production to increase immunity as well as reduce stress and susceptibility to pathogens. They have been shown to improve rumen development, increase growth performance, reduce neonatal diarrhea, and decrease the risk of calf mortality [

However, due to the increased incidence of bacterial resistance and potential risks for food security, antibiotic use in animal production has become a concern, leading to stricter regulation for this practice in the livestock sector. Indeed, policies such as the European Union ban on the use of antibiotics and ionophores in animal production, as well as the phasing out of prophylactic treatments for food animals produced in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have created an urgent need for alternatives. To be viable, these not only have to promote animal welfare, but also optimize animal production, while posing only minimal risks to human health and the environment [
