<p class="p">Microbial DNA was isolated from rumen samples using a repeated bead beating plus column method [
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The V1–V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified using the 27F forward [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and 519R reverse [
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] primer pair. PCR reactions were performed with the Phusion Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) under the following conditions: Hot start (4 min, 98 °C), followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (10 s, 98 °C), annealing (30 s, 50 °C) and extension (30 s, 72 °C), then ending with a final extension period (10 min, 72 °C). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and amplicons of the expected size (~500 bp) were excised for gel purification using the QiaexII Gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For each sample, approximately 400 ng of amplified DNA were submitted to Molecular Research DNA (MRDNA, Shallowater, TX, USA) for sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 platform to generate overlapping paired end reads. Briefly, libraries for 16S rRNA amplicons were prepared using overhanging primers targeting the 27F and 519R recognition sequences; the primer overhangs encoded barcodes for sample indexing as well as adapter sequences. MiSeq 2 × 300 sequencing was performed using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 following the manufacturers specifications.
