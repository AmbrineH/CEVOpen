<p class="p">Following quality screens, sequence reads were aligned, then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a genetic distance cutoff of 5% sequence dissimilarity [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. While 3% is the most commonly used clustering cutoff for 16S rRNA, it was originally recommended for full length sequences, and may not be suitable for the analysis of specific sub-regions, since nucleotide sequence variability is not constant across the entire length of the 16S rRNA gene. In this context, if 3% is a commonly accepted clustering cutoff for V4 or V4–V5 regions, which are the least variable of the hypervariable regions, then a higher cutoff should be used for the V1–V3 region, since V1 is the most variable region of the 16S rRNA gene.
