<p class="p">Rumen samples mixed with metaphosphoric acid were thawed, then centrifuged to remove particulate (16,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 1 min). For each sample, 800 μL of supernatant was mixed with 200 μL of an internal standard (2-ethyl butyric acid, 20 mM). Following injection, SCFAs were separated by gas liquid chromatography (Trace 1310, Thermo Scientific, Bellefonte, PA, USA) on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m capillary column with 0.25 μm film thickness (NukolTM, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). The injector port temperature was 200 °C, with a split ratio of 100:1, and a column flow of He at a rate of 0.8 mL/min. After starting at 140 °C for a duration of 9.5 min, the oven temperature was increased at a rate of 20 °C/min until it reached 200 °C, at which point it was maintained for 1 min. Detection was completed using a flame-ionization detector with a temperature of 250 °C. Data was analyzed by the software Chromeleon 7.2 CDS, with SCFA concentrations measured based on peak height. For calibration, a mixture of standards (Supelco Volatile Free Fatty Acid Mix 46975, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) was first analyzed for identification of SCFAs peaks, with 2-ethylbutyric acid serving as an internal standard. External calibration was performed using three different SCFA concentration levels, each measured twice.
