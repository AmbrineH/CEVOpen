<p class="p">In conclusion, the results of this study support a beneficial effect of EO on the SCFA profile of dairy calves, which may potentially promote increased performance later in life. This report also indicates that at least two ruminal bacterial species belonging to distinct phylogenetic lineages may be upregulated by feeding EO to young calves. Together, these results thus support that EO can effectively be used to modulate the ruminal environment and microbiome of young bovine animals towards potentially improving their nutrition, performance, and health during the productive stages of their life.</p>
