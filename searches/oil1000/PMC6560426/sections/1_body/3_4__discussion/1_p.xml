<p class="p">Development of the ruminal microbiome in neonatal ruminants is a complex and dynamic process involving microbial colonization and succession that ultimately culminates in the establishment of a stable microbial community that can support the host animal by producing SCFAs through fermentation of ingested feed [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This stage may provide a window of opportunity for manipulation, potentially allowing to increase the productivity and health of mature host animals through modulating the composition of their developing rumen microbiome [

 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. While solid feed has so far been found to be the main factor affecting rumen microbiome composition and community structure during pre-ruminal microbial colonization [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], there is growing interest in identifying compounds that could be used as feed additives to improve the rumen function of calves as they mature. Since they exhibit antimicrobial properties, and have shown potential as alternatives to antibiotics, EO have become attractive candidates to serve this purpose [
