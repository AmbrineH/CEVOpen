<p class="p">Ruminal SCFA concentrations and profiles are dependent on the respective composition of the diet and of the hostâ€™s ruminal microbial communities [
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Accordingly, differences in rumen microbial community composition were observed between EO-fed calves and controls. While 16S rRNA-based taxonomic analysis revealed a substantial degree of variation in composition amongst calves in this study, differences between treatments were observed. Notably, the respective abundances of two OTUs, SD_Bt-00966 and SD_Bt-00978, were found to be significantly greater in the rumen of EO-fed calves compared to control calves by a factor of 7.2X and 20.2X. While taking into consideration the level of microbial diversity and functional diversity that exists in the rumen, higher propionate levels in response to EO could involve these OTUs at least in part, perhaps through expression of propionate production pathways [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. While SD_Bt-00978 was phylogenetically too distant from its closest relative to reliably infer function based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence (
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, 84% sequence identity), SD_Bt-00966 presented a close match to 
 <italic class="italic">P. ruminicola</italic> (97% sequence identity). This bacterial species has been defined as a carbohydrate utilizer [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] with the ability to tolerate low pH [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic class="italic">P. ruminicola</italic> was reported to be able to grow in the presence of elevated EO [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and many strains possess the ability to decarboxylate succinic acid to propionic acid [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. While it remains to be determined whether SD_Bt-00966 represented a strain of 
 <italic class="italic">P. ruminicola</italic> or if it corresponded to an uncharacterized species of 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic>, these properties make it an interesting candidate to pursue towards linking increases in ruminal propionate to the addition of EO in a diet.
