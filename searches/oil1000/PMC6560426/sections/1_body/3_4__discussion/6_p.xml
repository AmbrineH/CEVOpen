<p class="p">In addition to EO, the commercial additive used in this study also included arabinogalactans, a type of hemicellulose primarily composed of galactose and arabinose that is intended to enhance immune function [

 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], indicating the existence of a niche for this substrate in the rumen. However, considering that butyrate was more prominent than propionate in human fecal cultures grown with arabinogalactans [
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-07-00120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], these polysaccharides may not be responsible for the increase in ruminal propionate observed in this study. As the effects of arabinogalactans on the ruminal environment and its microbiome remain largely unexplored, future investigations will be necessary to determine if they impact development of the rumen.
