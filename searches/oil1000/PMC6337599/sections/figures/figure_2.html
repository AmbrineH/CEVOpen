 <p> ( A 1 ): Effects of different concentrations of methanol crude extracts from A. annua against F. oxysporum, and the mycelium growth for 5 days. ( B 1 ): Effects of different concentrations of methanol extracts from A. annua on F. solani. ( A 2 ): The colony diameter (mm) of F. oxysporum by treated with different crude extracts. ( B 2 ): The colony diameter (mm) of F. solani by treated with different crude extracts. Note: Different letters represent significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) among different plant parts at the same methanol concentration, while with the same letters mean no significant difference ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>
