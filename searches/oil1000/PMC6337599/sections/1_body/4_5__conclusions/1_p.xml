<p class="p">Our previous field experiments found that covering 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> on the surface of soils could promote the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>, increase the content of chlorophyll, and promote plant height and dry weight of roots. The incidence of the disease was significantly lower than that of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> without covering 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua,</italic> which greatly inhibited the occurrence of yellow rot [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. This observation inspired us to clarify why 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> could reduce the root rot disease of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>. In this study, it was found that 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solani</italic> have strong pathogenicity to 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>. The extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> leaves other than the roots, stems are the most active. Moreover, volatile components from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO were found to be the strongest. GC-MS analysis reveal the chemical profile of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO, and further antifungal tests disclose antifungal potency of camphor, camphene and 
 <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-caryophyllene against 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solani</italic>, equivalent to the MIC values of chemical fungicides. This study also found that 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO could reduce the concentration of hymexazol or hymexazol, two chemical fungicides, indicating their synergistic effects. Finally, an in vivo experiment revealed that the petroleum ether extract (simulating EO) could reduce the incidence of infected 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> plants, in accordance with our previous field experiments. Our efforts resulted in EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> and the main compounds thereof are active agents towards fungal species associated with 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> root-rot disease, which will be beneficial for the pharmaceutical industry of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>.
