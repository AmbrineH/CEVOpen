<p class="p">Previous study showed that 14-hydroxyltajixanthone, which was isolated from the solidsubstrate fermentation culture of 
 <italic class="italic">Emericella</italic> sp. XL029 associated with the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>, exhibited significant activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizoctonia cerealis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Physalospora piricola</italic>, with MIC value of 25 Î¼g/mL [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Even though the MIC results varied among the tested strains, in most cases, the MIC values of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO and the main compounds were equivalent to the MIC values of chemical fungicides. The 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO is a complex mixture of different compounds, so it is difficult to attribute the EO antifungal activity to a single or a particular constituent. In addition to the major components, also minor components may make a significant contribution to the antifungal activity. Following the results above, in order to further understand the antifungal mechanism of EO from 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic>, the extract can be isolated and purified, and the antifungal mechanism with the structure-activity relationship of the active substance could be discussed in more depth in the future. Research showed that the interactions between antifungal substances could be divided into four types: synergistic, additive, irrelevant, and antagonistic [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In our experiment, for the purpose of improving the efficiency of fungi inhibition, the antifungal activity between 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO and the chemical fungicides of hymexazol and flutriafol were studied. The results indicates that when 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO was used in combination with hymexazol or hymexazol, the growth of tested strains could be effectively inhibited at a much lower concentration (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00213-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), and the synergistic or additive effects were exhibited while the antifungal effect was not affected. The existence of synergies could greatly reduce the use of chemical pesticides, which can not only reduce the cost, ensure the safety, but also reduce the fungicide residue in traditional Chinese medicine. Since the difference in quantity and quality between the compound composition of EO and the active compound group of single drug, a new active compound group is formed, which can lead to some new different pharmacodynamics [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of the new ingredients need to be further studied. For further simulating the antifungal effect of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO in vivo, the petroleum ether extract was prepared from 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves to conduct an in vivo experiment. The results revealed that the petroleum ether extract could reduce the incidence of infected 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> plants in a certain concentration range (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00213-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The major inhibitory effect is resulted from the EO components of the petroleum ether extract (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00213" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>). The results of in vitro experiments show that the 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO has certain inhibitory effect on the growth of mycelia and the germination of conidia. Therefore, it is speculated that the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO to the soil may inhibit the pathogenic fungi germination of pathogenic and mycelial growth, which could inhibit the pathogenic fungi from infecting the plants of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic>. Finally, it would reduce the plants incidence and disease index. Nevertheless, the EO effects on the other soil microbial and plants need to be further studied. Some studies have indicated that botanical fungicides, such as matrine and garlicin, are likely to be a panacea for sustainable agricultural development and sustainable stability of the ecological environment survival despite their mild effects [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> is widely distributed in China and has a high yield. Particularly, its EO has a good inhibitory effect on bacteria and fungi. The present findings of antifungal property of EO from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> against root rot pathogenic fungi might lend supports for developing 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> as a natural fungicide especially beneficial for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> root rot disease.
