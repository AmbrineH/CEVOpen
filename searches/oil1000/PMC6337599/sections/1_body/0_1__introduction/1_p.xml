 <italic class="italic">Panax notoginseng</italic> is a perennial herb (Araliaceae). Its dry roots and rhizomes are used as medicinal parts known as San-Qi in Chinese. The main component of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> is saponin. Relevant research showed that notoginseng saponin and heat-transformed ginsenoside have inhibitory activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Epidermophyton floccosum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, serious problems of continuous cropping obstacles (CROs) occur during cropping, resulting in decreased yields and loss of quality of

 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. CROs could be resulted from multiple factors, of which, the root-rot disease caused by a single pathogen or a combination of pathogens could not be ignored. It is the most destructive and could result in yield reduction, no harvest, and a loss of active ingredients [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The pathogen fungi in the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> rhizosphere have been investigated, indicating that

 <italic class="italic">solani</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oxysporum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. destructans</italic> are the main pathogens of

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, efforts targeting these fungal species might be helpful for discovering new agents against 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> root-rot disease. At the present, botanical fungicides have demonstrated their advantages owing to their eco-friendly property. In this regard, essential oils (EOs) of aromatic plants have recently received increased attention due to their low toxicity towards mammalians and high biodegradability [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. China is rich in natural plant resources, which is one of the important ways to obtain new fungicides.
