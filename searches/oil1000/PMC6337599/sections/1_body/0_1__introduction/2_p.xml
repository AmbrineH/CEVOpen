 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The non-volatile components are mainly artemisinin, artemisinic acid, coumarin, and other compounds, which are sesquiterpenoids compound. Some research revealed that Sesquiterpene lactones exhibit a wide range of biological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiulcer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, and insect deterrent [
