<p class="p">Inspired by the wisdom of local people and to tracking antifungal agents of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua,</italic> first, the methanol extracts of different plant parts were prepared and examined for their inhibition on the growth of the fungi. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>,A
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). The extracts of the roots and the stems from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> have no inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oxysporum</italic>, whereas the inhibition rate of the leaves extract (with 50% methanol) on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oxysporum</italic> is 25.37% and is up to 36.94% with the pure methanol extract. With the increase of concentration of methanol extract, the antifungal potency of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves extract also increases. Similar tendency is observed for 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solani</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>,B
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). In contrast, the extracts from the other parts rather than leaves are almost inactive against 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solani.</italic> And the methanol extract from the leaves is found to be the most active toward 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solani</italic>, revealing that antifunfal agents are mainly present in 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves.
