<p class="p">In vivo tests were needed to check whether the in vitro active agents make sense for the living 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic>. To satisfy the requirement of in vivo experiment, the petroleum ether extract from 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves, which simulates the components of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO, was prepared and mixed into the culture medium. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00213-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the petroleum ether extract could reduce the occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> root-rot in a certain concentration. When the concentration of the petroleum ether extract is 0.5 mg/g, the incidence of the plants is 25.00%, which can decrease by 47.22%. Additionally, the disease index of the infected plants is 13.10, which is also significantly lower than that of the negative control.
