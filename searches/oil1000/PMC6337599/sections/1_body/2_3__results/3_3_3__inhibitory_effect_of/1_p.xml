<p class="p">To unveil the active fractions, EO and non-volatile fractions were rationally prepared and examined. As shown in

 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> leaves has the most significant inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth of

Fractions IV and V have relatively weak suppression on the pathogenic fungi, whereas the inhibitory effects of water soluble (III) and chloroform soluble (VI) on two pathogens are almost negligible. Collectively, the pathogens are sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO, disclosing that antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves is mainly resulted from volatile components rather than non-volatile substances.
