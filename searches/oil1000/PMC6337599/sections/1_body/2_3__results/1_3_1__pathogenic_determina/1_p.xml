<p class="p">Two pathogenic fungi were cultured on PDA medium for seven days. 
 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic> grew into a round colony (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 1a) with an average diameter of 70 mm, and the colonies changed from white to pink. The hyphae were villous. Under microscope, small conidia and hyphae could be clearly seen. The small conidia was oval or round (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 1b), and the size was (7.3−18 µm) × (3.3−5.7 µm). The mycelium was abundant and the surface was smooth, and small conidia were produced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 1c). The colony of 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> was round, and the mycelium was white or pale yellow. The mycelium of 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> was flocculent and grew vigorously (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 2a). Small conidia was sickle shaped or long column shaped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 2b), with a size of (10−18 µm) × (3−5 µm). The mycelium was straight, long, and smooth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00213-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 2c). After 
 <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> pathogen infection, the above ground part of the plants was short and the leaves turned yellow. The surface of stem was dry, and the root rot was obvious (
