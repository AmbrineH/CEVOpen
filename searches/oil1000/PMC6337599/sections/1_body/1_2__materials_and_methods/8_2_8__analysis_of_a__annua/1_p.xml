<p class="p">The EO were analysis by GC-MS with an HP-5 MS quartz capillary column (30 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Helium (1.2 mL/min) was used as carrier gas. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C. An initial column oven temperature of 80 °C was elevated to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and held for 50 min. The mass spectrometer (MS) conditions were as follows: transfer line temperature at 250 °C, ion source at 230 °C, acquisition mass range 30–500, and the ionization potential at 70 eV. Then the relative peak area percentages of the different compounds were calculated based on the FID data. The identification of the analyzed compounds were accomplished by comparing their mass spectra with those of authentic compounds available from computerized spectral database (NIST).
