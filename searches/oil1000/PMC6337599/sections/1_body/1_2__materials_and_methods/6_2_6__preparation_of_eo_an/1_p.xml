<p class="p">The sample of 100 g 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> leaves powder was placed in a flask with a round bottom, and 1200 mL distilled water was added. Then the sample was soaked for half an hour. EO was extracted by steam distillation and distilled at 100 °C for 6 h. The steam distillation apparatus consisted mainly three parts, which were steam equipment, condensation equipment and oil collection equipment. After the extraction, the EO was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a brown sample bottle, named as II (EO). After extraction, the residues were filtered and the water part was concentrated, which was named as III (water soluble part). The filtered residues were extracted with methanol by ultrasonic twice, and the mixtures were concentrated and dried, named as IV. An aliquot of sample IV was suspended in water and extracted with equal volume of chloroform thrice, and the chloroform layer was concentrated and dried to obtain V. The water layer was concentrated to be VI. Sample was obtained by direct ultrasonic extraction using methanol, which was VII. All the samples were stored at −20 °C for further analysis.
