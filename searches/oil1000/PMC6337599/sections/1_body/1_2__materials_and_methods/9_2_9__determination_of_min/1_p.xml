<p class="p">The MIC values test was carried out by 96-well plates [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO, main components and two kinds of chemical fungicides (Flutriafol and Hymexazol) were diluted with 20/1000 of DMSO and 1/1000 of Tween 80 solutions by double dilution method. 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> EO had 12 groups of solution with a final concentration range (37.50–0.04 mg/mL), then the chemical fungicides and main compounds (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-camphor; 
 <sc class="sc">dl</sc>-camphor, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene and camphene) with a final concentration range (2.5–0.005 mg/mL) were also prepared. Conidia suspension was prepared with a 1/4 PDB culture. The number of microconidia was measured by blood cell counting board, with final concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cfu/mL. A mixture formed from filter-sterilized EO (50 μL) and suspension of the fungi (150 μL) were added to the wells of 96-cell plate. Then 150 μL suspension and 50 μL solution that included 20/1000 DMSO and 1/1000 of Tween 80 was added to the wells as a negative control. The 96-well plates were kept at a constant temperature of 28 °C for 36 h. After the incubation period, the wells were checked for fungi growth. The absorbance of each well was measured at 595 nm by using a microplate reader (Model: 1510, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
