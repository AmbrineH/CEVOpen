 <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic> seeds were seeded in sterile quartz sand and roseite with a 1:2 mixture in greenhouse. After germination, seedlings were cultivated under 20 °C with a relative humidity of 70% ± 10% and a photoperiod of 14 h day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The seedlings were supplied with full-strength Hoagland nutrient solution. The macronutrient composition of the Hoagland nutrient solution (in mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was 40 N (as NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), 10 P (as KH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), 40 K (as K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and KH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), 57 Ca (as CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and 40 Mg (as MgSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). The basal micronutrient composition (in mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was 2.0 Fe (as Fe-EDTA), 0.2 B (as H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>BO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), 0.5 Mn (as MnCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·4H

 <sub class="sub">24</sub>·4H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O], 0.01 Zn (as ZnSO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), and 0.01 Cu (as CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>·5H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O). Dicyandiamide, a nitrification inhibitor, was added to each nutrient solution to prevent oxidation of ammonium.
