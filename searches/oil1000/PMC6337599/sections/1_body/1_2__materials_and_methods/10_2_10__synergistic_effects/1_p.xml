<p class="p">The checkerboard microdilution assay was used to evaluate the mixed solution effect [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. MIC values were measured according to the above step. Then a two dimensional checkerboard with serial two fold dilutions of each compound was used, and the concentration ranged from 1/16 × MIC to 8 × MIC. Different concentrations of EO and different concentrations of hymexazol or flutriafol (each 25 μL) were combined into the each well. Each well contained a mixture of two drugs with different concentrations, and suspension of the fungi (150 μL) was added to the well. The 150 μL suspension of the fungi and 50 μL solution that included 20/1000 DMSO and 1/1000 of Tween 80 as a negative control. Then the 96-well plates were kept at a constant temperature of 28 °C for 36 h. After the incubation period, the wells were checked for fungi growth. The absorbance of each well was measured at 595 nm by using microplate reader (Model: 1510, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). MIC determination of combined drugs use: the concentration of drugs corresponding to wells growing without fungi was used as the MIC of EO combined with hymexazol or flutriafol.
