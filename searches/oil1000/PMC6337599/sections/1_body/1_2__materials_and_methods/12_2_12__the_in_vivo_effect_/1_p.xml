After 20 days of infection by the pathogenic fungi, the plants were graded for severity of wilt disease as 0 (not showing chlorosis), 1 (the stem soft), 2 (the stem fallen, but the leaf not wilted), and 3 (plant wilting). The wilting rate (%) = the number of wilting plants/total number of plants × 100. Disease index = ∑(rating × number of plants rated)/(total number of plants × highest rating) × 100 [
