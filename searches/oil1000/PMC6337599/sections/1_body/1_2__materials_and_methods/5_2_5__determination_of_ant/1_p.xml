<p class="p">The oxford cup method was adopted to determine the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> crude extract on the growth of pathogens mycelia [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Two pathogens were cultured on PDA medium for five days, then a 5 mm-wide disc of fungi containing agar was excised from the culture margins, which was placed in the middle of the petri dishes. The four oxford cups were placed in the same distance around the fungi discs, which the distance between the oxford cup and the middle of petri dish was 25 mm. Then the crude extract was filtered through 0.22 µm hydrophobic membranes, and the sterile filtrate extract was obtained. The filtrate extract of 200 µL was added to every oxford cup. Different concentrations of methanol were used as the negative control. Each treatment was repeated three times. Then the pathogens were cultured in the incubator at 28 °C for seven days, and the diameter of colony was measured based on the average value of two perpendicular diameters. The inhibitory effect of the crude extract on pathogenic fungi was shown by histogram.
