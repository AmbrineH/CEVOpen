 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> were completely separated and dried under natural conditions, then the samples were crushed into powders with a pulverized machine. The different parts powders (50 g) were put into a triangle bottle, and 450 mL different concentrations of methanol (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) were added. A 600 W, 40 kHz sonicator (Model: 15D793, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnol Co., Ltd., Ningbo, Zhejiang, China) was used for ultrasound-assisted extraction. The samples were ultrasonic for 2 h and static for half an hour at 37 °C. During the extraction process, the sample container was held in a thermostat-controlled water bath. Then the extraction processes were repeated three times. After extraction, the crude extract was filtered and stored at 4 °C for use.
