 <p class="p">Root rot of 
  <italic class="italic">Panax notoginseng</italic> has received great attention due to its threat on the plantation and sustainable utilization of 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">notoginseng</italic>. To suppress the root-rot disease, natural ingredients are of great importance because of their environment friendly properties. In this study, we found that the methanol extract from 
  <italic class="italic">Artemisia annua</italic> leaves has strong antifungal effects on the growth of 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium solani</italic> resulting into root-rot disease. Essential oil (EO) thereof was found to be the most active. GC-MS analysis revealed 58 ingredients and camphor, camphene, 
  <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-caryophyllene, and germacrene D were identified as the major ingredients. Further antifungal assays showed that the main compounds exhibit various degrees of inhibition against all the fungi tested. In addition, synergistic effects between 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">annua</italic> EO and chemical fungicides were examined. Finally, in vivo experiments were conducted and disclosed that 
  <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> root rot could be largely inhibited by the petroleum ether extract from 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">annua</italic>, indicating that 
  <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> could be a good source for controlling 
  <italic class="italic">P. notoginseng</italic> root-rot.
