<p class="p">Trypanosomiasis is transmitted by the bite of insects from the 
 <italic class="italic">Glossina</italic> spp. (Glossinidae) and is fatal in humans, if untreated. While taking a blood meal, infected 
 <italic class="italic">Glossina</italic> flies can spread extracellular protozoans from the species 
 <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma brucei.</italic> There are three morphologically indistinguishable subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic>. The subspecies 
 <italic class="italic">T. b. gambiense</italic> is responsible for a chronic form of the human disease, while 
 <italic class="italic">T. b. rhodesiense</italic> causes an acute form, which more rapidly leads to death. Both subspecies are infective to humans, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">T. b. brucei</italic> is only infective to animals. During the early stage of the disease or the hemolymphatic phase, the parasite is restricted to the blood and lymph, and, after months or years, it invades the central nervous system, resulting in various neurological symptoms, including sleeping disturbance [
