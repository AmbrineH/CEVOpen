<p class="p">E-nose has been used in a wide range of applications including odor analysis, quality control in food products, and biomedical applications. This study illustrates the use of e-nose as a versatile analysis tool and alternative method for measuring volatile compounds in soybean seeds with minimal sample preparation time. This approach can be used in a high-throughput phenotyping system and for screening different soybean lines. This system can be used as a rapid screening tool in breeding programs, in the selection of soybean mutants/varieties with different volatile profiles, and also for mapping the QTLs and loci responsible for these traits. This platform can also be used to link the beany flavor to seed volatile compounds, ultimately developing varieties with reduced off-flavor taste and better acceptance by the consumer. </p>
