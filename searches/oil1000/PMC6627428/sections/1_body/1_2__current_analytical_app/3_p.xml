<p class="p">Sample preparation and scalability of GC-MS and similar instruments resulted in the development of cheaper, faster, and more user-friendly measurement instruments for routine use in analytical applications. Electronic nose (e-nose) devices are developed as versatile and low-cost alternatives to GC-MS instruments that minimize sample preparation and extraction, and offer many potential uses in biomedical and agriculture applications [
 <xref rid="B12-biosensors-09-00066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Volatile compounds can be measured from the sample headspace with minimal sample preparation time. The objective of this study was to use an e-nose instrument in measuring the volatile compounds among five different soybean cultivars and evaluate its potential as an alternative to GC-MS approach, and as a rapid screening tool for aromatic variations in soybean seeds.
