 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal; 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal; 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone; and 2â€²-aminoacetophenone were identified as the key aroma compounds in soy milk for the first time. Generally, it is believed that aroma compounds might be generated from lipids, amino acids, sugars, and ferulic acid present in food.
