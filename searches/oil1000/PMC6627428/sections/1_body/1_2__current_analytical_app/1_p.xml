<p class="p">Numerous analytical approaches have been developed for measuring volatile compounds and gas exchange measurements in seed samples. Stephen et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-biosensors-09-00066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] analyzed the soybean seed volatiles using a solid phase microextraction (SPME) method combined with gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and reported that 30 known volatile compounds were recovered, and that an additional 19 new compounds were identified, or tentatively identified. During early periods of development at maturity stage R6, several volatiles were present at relatively high concentrations, including 3-hexanone, (E)-2-hexenal, 1-hexanol, and 3-octanone. At maturity stage R7 and R8, decreased amounts of 3-hexanone, (E)-2-hexenal, 1-hexanol, and 3-octanone were observed. At maturity stage R8, hexanal, (E)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, ethanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-octen-3-ol were detected at relatively high concentrations.
