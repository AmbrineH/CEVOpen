 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) shows the distinct clusters formed for different soy varieties indicating that the volatile profiles of soy varieties are distinctly different from each other. It also demonstrates the potential use of this system in rapid profiling of volatile compounds in different soybean cultivars. UA5414RR and UA5014C were comparable in their volatile profiles while other samples namely JTN5203, JTN5503, and JTN5110 were distantly diverse different from one another. The different clusters formed for different samples are due to their differential volatile compounds and their composition.
