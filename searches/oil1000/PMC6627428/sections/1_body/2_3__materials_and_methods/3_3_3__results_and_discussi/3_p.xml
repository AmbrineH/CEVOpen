 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> clearly indicates the differences between JTN cultivars in peaks 2, 5, and 17. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, it is clear that esters were the major contributor of the volatiles followed by aldehydes and ketones in JTN5203, JTN5503 and JTN5110. The sulfur containing compounds were a major volatile contributor in JTN5110, and JTN5203 but not in JTN5503. Furans were detected only in JTN5110 and were absent in the other two varieties. In general, acids, furans and pyrazines were low in all the samples.
