<p class="p">More than 90% of the volatile compounds were identified with Kovats index and Arochembase software in UA5014C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The total volatile composition is distributed between acids, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, pyrazines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). However, the major volatile composition was contributed by Ethyl-2-Methyl Butyrate (22.72%), 2-Methyl Propanal (18.21%) and 2-Propanol (16.45%). These three volatile components nearly contribute 50% of the total volatile composition in this cultivar. In UA5414RR (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), the contribution of Ethyl-2-Methyl Butyrate (24.07%) and 2-Methyl Propanal (19.42%) is still high but instead of 2-Propanol, contribution of Ethyl 2-Methylbutanoate (16.01%) was higher in the total volatile composition. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biosensors-09-00066-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, it is clear that esters were the major contributor of the volatiles followed by aldehydes and alcohols in both UA5414RR and UA5014C. Acids and monoterpenes were not detected in UA5414RR. Alcohol was significantly higher in UA5014C compared to UA5414RR.
