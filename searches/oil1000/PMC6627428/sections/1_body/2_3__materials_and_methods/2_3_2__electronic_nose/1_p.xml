<p class="p">The HERCALES GC Flash electronic nose (AlphaMos, Toulouse, France) was used to discriminate the odor patterns of different aroma models. For each variety, 20 gm of seed was weighed and grinded in a grinder (Waring WSG60 Grinder) at high speed for 2 min. The resulting soy flour was weighed (6 gm) and placed in a 20 mL glass vial. Following this, 7 mL of sterile distilled water was added to each tube. The sample was prepared in a septa-sealed screw cap vial and equilibrated for 200 s at 50 °C, separately. Subsequently, the aroma headspace above the sample was introduced into the electronic nose at the speed of 270 μL/s using automatic headspace sampler (PerkinElmer, MA, USA). The column temperature program used for the experiment was 40 °C (1 min)-2 °C/min-200 °C (3 min), and the injection temperature of the injector and detector were set at 180 °C and 220 °C, respectively. In addition, at the end of each column a FID detector was placed and the acquired signal was digitalized every 0.01 s. The Heracles electronic nose is equipped with two columns working in parallel mode. A non-polar column (MXT5: 5% diphenyl, 95% methylpolysiloxane, 10 m length, and 180 μm diameter), and a slightly polar column (MXT1701: 14% cyanopropylphenyl, 86% methylpolysiloxane, 10 m length, and 180 μm diameter). A single comprehensive chromatogram was generated by joining the chromatograms obtained with the two columns. This approach helps reduce incorrect identifications due to overlapping of chromatograms obtained with two different columns, and represents a useful tool for improved identification. For calibration of the instrument, an alkane solution (from n-hexane to n-hexadecane) was used to convert retention time in Kovats indices and to identify the volatile compounds using specific software (AromaChemBase). Each analysis was repeated a total of three times, and all of the response data was analyzed using Alpha Soft software (Version 3.0.0, Toulouse, France). </p>
