<p class="p">Fluorescence spectroscopy has been employed for the characterization of buffalo ghee for the first time. It was found that desi ghee is enriched with CLA, vitamin-A and small quantities of vitamin D, E and K. In addition, emission spectral region from 620–700 nm has been assigned to chlorophyll. It was observed that up to a temperature of 150°C, desi ghee remains stable when heated for a time period of five minutes. Heating of desi ghee from 140–150°C does not affect its natural molecular composition and this temperature range can be used for household cooking/frying purposes. However, up to temperature of 170°C, ghee can be used for cooking/frying with less deterioration of valuable ingredients. Above temperature of 180°C, it deteriorates more and more and becomes rancid at 250°C.</p>
