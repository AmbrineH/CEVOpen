<p class="p">In order to illustrate that PCA classification is based upon its loading vectors, two samples heated at 150 and 200°C were selected with prominent spectral differences to produce their PCA scatter plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and their loading vectors in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref> shows Fluorescence spectra of ghee samples heated at 150 and 200°C and evidently explains that Fluorescence emission bands at 400, 435 and 452 nm show variations in intensity/shapes of bands which are induced as a result of heating. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B</xref> illustrated that the samples heated at 150°C are clustered in the positive side and samples heated at 200°C in the negative side of the PC1 axis which follows from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively[

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C</xref> shows PC1 loadings and corresponding labelling of bands. It is clear from PC1 loadings that Fluorescence emission bands at 400 and 435 nm are loaded positively while at 552 nm are loaded negatively which shows that heating at 200 induces prominent changes in these molecules as compared to heating at 150°C. Therefore, it can be concluded that PC1 mainly separates the two-data set with maximum variance of 100% while PC2 gives only noise. This shows that PC1 and PC2 are independent of each other which causes the separation of both types of data when score plot is produced. It means that features identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> are also feature in the loadings of PC1.
