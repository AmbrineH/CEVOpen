<p class="p">In order to make heated sample of buffalo ghee, an experiment was performed in which an egg was fried with desi ghee in a frying pan with a controlled heat supply. Gas burner was used for the heat supply and the flame was kept at low value so as to achieve a possible constant heat supply to the frying pan and to avoid rapid temperature changes. The frying pan was moved up and down slowly in an effort to maintain the required temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to monitor the time and temperature taken by an egg to get fried. 100 grams of buffalo ghee was heated in a frying pan up to a temperature of 140°C and an egg was poured in pan at this temperature. Before pouring egg in frying pan, heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled for acquiring its fluorescence spectra. Immediately, after pouring the egg, the temperature of ghee dropped down to around 120°C and it took around one minute to rise back to 140°C and then continued towards 150°C. A temperature ranges from 140–150°C was maintained to get the egg fully fried and whole process took around five minutes. After five minutes frying at this temperature range, egg got fully fried and its corners turned light brown and at 150°C heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled again for acquiring fluorescence spectra. Further heating of ghee with egg in frying pan causes the egg to turn dark brown from light brown around temperature 180°C and then black around temperature of 200°C. It shows that food cooked at this temperature and above loses its nutritional values and got oxidized.</p>
