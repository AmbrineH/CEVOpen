<p class="p">Fish is a high‐quality food containing first‐class protein and nutrients, important for human health and growth (Olaifa, Oladapo, &amp; Bello, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Different fish species have been used as foods by humans from ancient times and form an important part of the diet in many countries (Haard, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref> and Macrae, Robinson, &amp; Sadler, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). They are generally low in cholesterol compared to meat from terrestrial animals because they contain a wide range of lipids high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Bell, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). The expansion of aquaculture and increase in livestock production strongly indicates that a “feed crises” will be inevitable in the nearest future if possible solutions are not proffered. Increasing competition in the feed industry plus rising cost of traditional feed ingredients in recent years are forcing feed manufacturers to find alternatives to conventional feed stuffs and cost of feeding constitutes 60% of the total production cost. There are numerous raw materials of plant origin with low cost when compared to that of animal origin, as such, are potential replacements to the former. Cereal and oilseed proteins play prominent roles in the diets of omnivorous fish species such as catfishes, carps, and tilapias (Naylor et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The proportion of fishmeal and alternative protein ingredients in aquafeeds depends on the nutritional requirements of the species, stage of development, and the regulatory environment of production systems. Feed stuffs of plant origin often possess high‐binding capacity which is associated with the presence of digestible or indigestible substances (Pike &amp; Hardy, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). The major limitations associated with plant feedstuffs is the presence of antinutrients and less palatability. 
 <italic class="italic">Telfairia occidentalis</italic> (fluted pumpkin) seeds have high nutritive values such as protein, fats and oils, and minerals (potassium, iron) but their utilization could be affected by the presence of antinutritional factors such as lectins and trypsin inhibitor that are present in the seeds (Kuku, Etti, &amp; Ibironke, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Several researchers at different times have evaluated the importance of various parts of the plant. The plant is important for its edible seeds which are rich in protein and fat (Ajiboye, Yakubu, &amp; Adams, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>); the leaves constitute an important component of the diet of many people in West African Countries (Akwaowo, Ndon, &amp; Etuk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) and are rich sources of protein, oil, vitamins, minerals, which nourishes, protects and heals the body (Nwanna, Falaye, &amp; Sotolu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The young shoot and leaves of the plants are also used as soup because of the pleasant taste (Odiaka, Akoroda, &amp; Odiaka, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and due to the richness of the leaves in iron, it is used to cure anemia (Ajibade, Balogun, Afolabi, &amp; Kupolati, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The seeds are valuable as a high protein for human and animal food and used in herbal preparation for the treatment of sudden attack of convulsion, malaria, and anemia (Ladeji, Okoye, &amp; Ojobe, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Growth of fish depends largely on good nutrition which is more pronounced with fish raised in intensive aquaculture system. In fish culture, supplementary feeding plays major roles in determining the nutritional and economic success of the aquaculture venture. Hybrid catfish (
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic>) is a good experimental fish in aquaculture due to its relative fast growth rate, better feed conversion efficiency, resistance to diseases, ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, and wide acceptance by the populace (Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref> and Omoruwou &amp; Edema, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of partial or total replacement of soybean with
