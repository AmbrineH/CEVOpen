<p class="p">Water quality determines to a great extent the success or failure of a fish cultural operation and determines the growth, physiology, and health of the animal (Camus, Burrow, Hemstreet, Thure, &amp; Hawke,

 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Water quality parameters measured in this experiment were dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, nitrate, and ammonia. The dissolved oxygen ranged from 3.50 to 5.75 mg/L and there was a decrease in DO with increase in 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal. Reduction in DO content could be attributed to the oily nature of experimental diets, leaving a thin oil film on surface water, thereby, preventing diffusion and saturation of atmospheric air. Dissolved oxygen of 5–10 mg/L in culture water favors productivity (Ovie &amp; Adeniji, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Temperature range was between 26.80 and 27. 50°C, and according to Boyd and Lichthoppler (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>), the water temperature range for freshwater fishes is 24.50–29.50°C. The levels of water temperature monitored were within the reported range for hybrid catfish as supported by Abu, Gabriel, Sanni, and Akinrotimi (
