<p class="p">Growth indices in 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fed the treatment and control diets revealed significant variations (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤ .05). There was a decline in mean weight gain of fish with increase in the quantity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal in fish diets. This trend was also observed in other parameters such as specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and feed intake. The best FCR was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic>‐fed diet TOSM2 (25% supplementation) level. This implies that the fish would have to consume a feed of 3.39 g to gain 1 g of flesh. Protein efficiency ratio is measured as a quality indicator of amino acid balance in fish diets. This parameter is used to assess protein utilization and turnover whenever there is a partial or total replacement of a protein feedstuff. The best protein intake and feed intake were observed in fish‐fed diet TOSM2. The gradual decline in mean weight gain could be attributed to low feed intake with increase in the quantity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic>. Most plant seeds contain 60%–80% phosphorus in the form of phytate (phytic acid), which is not available to the animal (Ravindran, Ravindra, Sivakanasam, &amp; Rajaguru, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). The phytic acid also exerts a negative influence on the solubility of proteins and function of pepsin. The phosphate groups of the inositol ring can bind various cations such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc in a fixed complex and thus interfere with their availability. As mentioned earlier, seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> used in this experiment was full‐fat, as such, after feed preparation, diets were found to be very oily. Excessive oil reduces acceptability of feed by fish coupled by a drastic reduction in the dissolved oxygen content. These conditions amount to deterioration of water quality as a result of unconsumed feed and cause rancidity of oil in feed when exposed to atmospheric oxygen (Hillestad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Furthermore, low percentage survival was recorded in 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings‐fed full‐fat 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> as a result of cannibalism. This behavior depicts that fish were actually hungry and the low feed intake was not sufficient to meet their daily metabolic and physiological functions. On several occasion, head and some skeletal parts of fish were found in water as the flesh would have been consumed by the voracious fishes. At the end of the experiment, the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> remaining in each treatment was 30 fingerlings in TOSM 1 (control), 24 in TOSM 2, 23 in TOSM 3, 27 in TOSM 4, and 21 in TOSM 5.
