<p class="p">Result showed that seeds of full‐fat 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> had high protein (25.20%) and fat (36.00%) contents (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Previous researchers have shown the nutritional value of 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> leaves (Dada, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref> and Odiaka et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Composition of experimental diets revealed crude protein of diets was iso‐nitrogenous between 40.25 and 43.02% (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), therefore, no bias was introduced as a result of nutritional imbalance. Nutritional studies recommended 40–42% crude protein for culture of tropical fishes such as African catfish (Jauncey 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>, Machiels &amp; Henken, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref> and Uys, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Proximate analyses and bomb calorimetry provide information about the chemical compositions and gross energy contents of feeds but digestibility studies are required to reveal the availabilities of the various nutrients to fish (Friedman, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Wilson (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>) estimated protein requirements of juvenile fish of a variety of species to be between 30% and 56%. Crude lipid of experimental diets ranged between 16.00% and 19.05%. Apart from satisfying the requirements of a fish for essential fatty acids, dietary lipid acts as a source of energy in diets. Cowey and Sargent (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>) reported that 10%–20% lipid in fish diets gives optimal growth rates without producing excessively fatty carcass. There was a significant variation (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤ .05) in crude protein and lipid of whole body composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings‐fed 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> seed meal diets when compared with the control (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The reason for this is not far‐fetched from the high protein and lipid contents in 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> seed meal. Lipids play a major role in energy supply and serve as a vector during intestinal absorption of liposoluble vitamins and carotenoid pigments (Sheridan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Higher lipid contents were recorded in 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic>‐fed 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal supplemented diets. The main storage sites for lipids in fish are the liver, visceral adipose tissue, or the muscle. High lipid in fish diets when fed 
 <italic class="italic">ad libithum</italic>, lead to modifications in body compositions as a percentage of body weight. As the lipid content also increases in carcass, the moisture content decreases, with protein content remaining unchanged (Watanabe, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Guillaume, Kaushik, Bergot, and Metailler (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) gave a range of 7%–10% as optimal fat incorporation level for some tropical freshwater omnivorous fish species. There was also a significant variation (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤ .05) of ash content in the body of 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fed the test diets, signifying higher mineral deposition in fish muscle. Ladeji et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>) and Christian (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) reported that elemental analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed contains higher mineral contents. The assertion by Eyo (
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) that there is reduction in moisture content as lipid deposition increases was also confirmed in this study. Minerals are needed by animals to maintain most of their metabolic processes and to provide material for major structural elements (De Silva &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="fsn3659-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>).
