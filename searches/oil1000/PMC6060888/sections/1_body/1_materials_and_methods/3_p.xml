 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings (4.26 ± 0.04) g were acclimatized for 7 days in a holding tank and feed with a farm‐made diet prior to the commencement of feeding trials. Fingerlings were randomly allotted at 10 fingerlings / tank in five dietary groups with each treatment in triplicate. Fish were fed at 5% body weight in two equal rations daily between 8:00–09:00 hr and 16:00–17:00 hr. Rations were adjusted biweekly based on the sampled total weight of the fish in each experimental unit. Some physiochemical water parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, nitrate, and ammonia) were also measured (Table
