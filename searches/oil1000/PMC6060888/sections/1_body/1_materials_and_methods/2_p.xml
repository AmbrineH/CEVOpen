<p class="p">The experiment was carried out in the teaching and research farm of the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture Technology, The Federal University of Technology, Akure. Five iso‐nitrogenous (40% crude protein) diets were prepared using same basal conventional feedstuffs. 
 <italic class="italic">Telifaria occidentalis</italic> seeds were obtained from local farmers and authenticated by the Department of Crop, Soil and Pest Management of the University. The fluted pumpkin gourds were dissected to remove the coated seed pods, and the pods were broken to expel the seeds. Seeds were oven‐dried to a constant weight at 60°C for 120 hr before grinding using a kitchen blender. Basal ingredients were weighed using a top load balance (Metler Toledo, PB 8001 London), milled separately, and later mixed in different proportions (Table

 <italic class="italic">Telifaria occidentalis</italic> seed meal was added to each batch of the basal ingredients in different proportions (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100) %. All feedstuffs were thoroughly mixed and pelleted using a Hobart A‐2007 pelletizer machine (Hobart Ltd, London, UK) with a 2 mm opening die. Resultant pellets were oven‐dried at 60°C for 24 hr and later refrigerated in airtight bags prior to use. Experimental diets were designated as TOSM1 (control), TOSM2, TOSM3, TOSM4, and TOSM5.
