<p class="p">This study revealed that partial or total supplementation of 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> seed meal in the diet of 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> actually led to higher protein, lipid, and ash contents in muscle but had poor performance in their growth. Further processing (defatting) of 
 <italic class="italic">T. Occidentalis</italic> seed meal could further unlock and release other potential nutrients. The result of this experiment showed that full‐fat 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal can replace soya bean meal in the diet of 
 <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> at a minimal level of 25%. Theoretically, the ideal source of protein for an organism is a protein containing same amino acid content and amino acid proportions of the organism itself. Furthermore, if properly processed, 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> (fluted pumpkin) seed meal could replace soybean meal in fish diets to reduce competition between man and animals. From this study, it is recommended that 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> be deffated to remove oil and if not removed, oil should not be included during feed composition in other to reduce its effect on water quality.
