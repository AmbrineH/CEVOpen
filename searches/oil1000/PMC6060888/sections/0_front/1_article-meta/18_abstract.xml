 <p class="p">The study evaluated the effect of partial or total supplementation of soybean meal with full‐fat 
  <italic class="italic">Telifaria occidentalis</italic> seed meal on performance and whole body composition of 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings. Five iso‐nitrogenous (40% crude protein) basal diets were prepared using locally available feedstuffs, while 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal was added at varying inclusion levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). One hundred and fifty apparently healthy 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings (4.26 ± 0.26 g) were stocked in glass tanks (50 L capacity) at 10 fish / tank with each treatment in triplicate. Fish were fed at 5% body weight in two equal portions daily for 56 days and culture water changed on alternate days. The result of this study showed a significant variation (
  <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; .05) in crude protein and lipid contents of whole body composition of 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings‐fed 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal supplemented diets compared with the control. Increasing levels of fat and protein deposition were also observed in the muscle of 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> with increase in 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic>. Also, some growth evaluation indices (weight gain, specific growth rate, feed intake, and protein efficiency ratio) of 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fingerlings decreased with increase in inclusion levels of 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal. Dissolved oxygen in culture units also decreased with increase in 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic>. From this study, chemical body composition of 
  <italic class="italic">Heteroclarias</italic> fed 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal supplemented diets increased with increase in inclusion levels, while the reverse was the case in weight gain. There was a decline in the quantity of dissolved oxygen with increase in quantity of 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> seed meal. Other water parameters such as 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">pH</styled-content>, temperature, nitrate, and ammonia were within the limits for culturing tropical fish species.
