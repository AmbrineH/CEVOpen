 <p class="p">Laurel, 
  <italic class="italic">Laurus nobilis</italic> L. is an evergreen plant belonging to the Lauraceae family, native to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean area. This is the first report on the composition and bioactivity of laurel essential oil (EO) from Bulgaria. The oil yield was 0.78%, 0.80%, and 3.25% in the fruits, twigs, and leaves, respectively. The main constituents in the fruit EO were 1,8-cineole (33.3%), 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (10.3%), 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (11.0%), 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene (7.5%), sabinene (6.3%), 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-phellandrene (5.2%), bornyl acetate (4.4%), and camphene (4.3%); those in the twig EO were 1,8-cineole (48.5%), 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (13.1%), methyl eugenol (6.6%), 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-linalool (3.8%), 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene (3.4%), sabinene (3.3%) and terpinene-4-ol (3.3%); and the ones in the leaf EO were 1,8-cineole (41.0%), 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (14.4%), sabinene (8.8%), methyl eugenole (6.0%), 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-linalool (4.9%), and 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial and antifungal properties of laurel EOs were examined according to the agar well diffusion method. The leaf EO showed antibacterial and antifungal activities against almost all strains of the microorganisms tested, whereas the twig EO was only able to inhibit 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027 and 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 8739 were the bacterial strains that showed the highest resistance to the laurel EO. The results can benefit the EO industry and biopesticide development.
