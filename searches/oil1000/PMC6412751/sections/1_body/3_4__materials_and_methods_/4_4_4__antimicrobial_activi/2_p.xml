<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar well diffusion method with a well size of 8 mm. The growth media were Tryptic soy agar (Merck) for the tested bacterial strains and Sabouraud–Dextrose–Agar (Merck) for the yeast and fungi. The media were inoculated with a 24-h suspension of the bacterial species with a density of approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cfu (colony forming units)/mL (turbidity: 0.5 McFarland standards). Media melted and cooled to 50 °C were inoculated with the tested microorganisms and then equally dispensed into Petry dishes. Next, a hole with a diameter of 8 mm was punched aseptically with a sterile cork borer, and a volume (50 µL) of the antimicrobial agent was introduced into the well. After that, the agar plates were incubated at 37 °C or 28 °C for 24 or 72 h according to the microbial species. After cultivation, the distinct zone of growth inhibition around the wells was measured using a digital caliper. The diameter of the zones, including the diameter of the well, was recorded in mm, for instance, up to 15 mm the microbial culture was poorly sensitive, from 15 to 25 mm it was considered sensitive, and over 25 mm it was considered very sensitive. The tests were performed in parallel with solvent controls [
