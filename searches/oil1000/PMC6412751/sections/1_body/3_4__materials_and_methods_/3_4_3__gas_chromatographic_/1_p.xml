<p class="p">The gas chromatographic (GC) analyses of all samples of laurel EO from Bulgaria were performed using a GC Agilent 7890A, an HP-5 ms column (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm), temperature: 35 °C/3 min, 5 °C/min to 250 °C for 3 min, total: 49 min; helium as a carrier gas at 1mL/min constant speed, and 30:1 split ratio. The GC/MS analysis was carried out on an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer, using helium as a carrier gas, and the same column and temperature as in the GC analysis. The identification of chemical compounds was made by comparison to their relative retention time and library data. The identified constituents were arranged in order of retention time and quantity in percentage.</p>
