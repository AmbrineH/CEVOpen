<p class="p">Laurel EO has been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Overall, the results from this study are in line with previous literature reports [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-00804" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00804" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Laurel EO has shown significant antibacterial properties and greater effectiveness against some microorganisms than tetracycline antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-00804" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Our results are in good agreement with the ones reported by Caputo et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00804" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. A possible explanation for the antibacterial activity of laurel EO is the fact that plant EOs disrupt cellular membranes and increase membrane permeability; they may alter membrane-embedded proteins and subsequently disrupt membrane transport. It was previously demonstrated that terpenes are the constituents responsible for the antibacterial activity of laurel EO [
