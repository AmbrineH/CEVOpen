<p class="p">There are several different methods for testing the antimicrobial activity of plants and their constituents, which may significantly influence the observed levels of inhibition. Additionally, various other factors, such as seasonality, variability the plant material, and the EO composition within a plant species, may cause differences in the antimicrobial activity outcomes. This study showed that laurel EOs were effective against all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains, while two of the Gram-negatives were completely resistant to the tested EOs. Gram-positive bacteria are generally more susceptible to the action of the oils compared with the Gram-negative ones. This is due to the presence of an additional outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, which may better protect the cytoplasmic membrane from the antimicrobial compounds, such as EOs [

Each EO included an admixture of a number of constituents that may have contributed to the extended spectrum of antimicrobial activity. No assays with pure 1,8-cineole were conducted in this study though. The inhibition strength of laurel EO on microbial growth in this study was probably due to the synergistic or antagonistic effect of 1,8-cineole with oxygenated terpenes of the oil [
