<p class="p">In Bulgaria, laurel is found mainly as an ornamental plant or escapee in the wild in the southernmost regions. The majority of the laurel genotype pool in Bulgaria was probably introduced from Greece after the Second World War [

However, some may have been transferred from Middle Eastern countries during the 15th to 18th century, or the Ottoman period. Generally, laurel fruits are not harvested and, therefore, not used although they have a potential to provide an EO with unique characteristics and other novel bioactivities. The leaves have been used as a spice and preservative in the food industry for making various products, as well as in folk medicine. According to Georgiev and Lazarov [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00804" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], the laurel trees found in Bulgaria had a sufficient EO content, which was higher in plants growing in the warmer parts of the country. The leaves of the middle part of the shoots had a higher EO content (1.9â€“3.35%). The EO in the twigs (less than 0.4%) allowed them to be used, together with the waste from the processing of the leaves (crushed and non-standard leaves), as a raw material for EO production. However, the latter authors did not analyze the EO composition.
