<p class="p">This is the first study on the EO composition and bioactivity of laurel fruits, leaves, and twigs from Bulgaria. The laurel EOs from Bulgaria was characterized by a higher content of 1,8-cineole and Î±-terpinyl acetate with a characteristic odor. The oils produced demonstrated antimicrobial activity against some of the highly susceptible strains of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria and yeasts. Laurel fruit and leaves, along with the branches that carry them, can be used as a non-traditional material for the production of EOs to be used as an additive in the cosmetic industry. Currently, the studies on the application of laurel EOs in cosmetic and food products are in progress.</p>
