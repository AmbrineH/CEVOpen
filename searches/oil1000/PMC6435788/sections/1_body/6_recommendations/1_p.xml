<p id="Par81" class="p">Biologic molecules encounter multiple types of interfaces during development, manufacturing, and throughout the lifetime of the product. Here, we have highlighted many of the interfacial stress conditions to which proteins are exposed, as well as the effect of these stresses on the stability of the drug substance and drug product, and methods used to characterize. While some mitigation strategies, such as the addition of surfactant, are relatively common, other risk assessment tools and strategies around evaluation of interfacial sensitivity of a given protein should be considered. Each protein has its own unique sensitivities, and in order to develop a robust drug product, it is important to understand the different risks for each molecule. While some recommendations have been made within each section, here we provide a summary of recommendations during different stages of biologics product development.</p>
