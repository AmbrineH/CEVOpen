<p id="Par87" class="p">The described risk assessment tools can also be used to set an appropriate level of surfactant to be included in a given formulation. For example, formulations with different levels of surfactant can be exposed to the same stress conditions, then evaluated for formation of particles and soluble aggregates. Surfactant degradation should also be considered; in some cases, surfactants can degrade from either oxidation or enzymatic activity. Degradation kinetics should be well-understood to enable prediction of the remaining surfactant levels at the end of shelf life. Subsequently, enough surfactant should be added to the formulation to ensure that enough intact surfactant remains at the end of the use period, so that even drug shipped to a site and administered to a patient in the last month of the use period will be stable and safe for clinical use.</p>
