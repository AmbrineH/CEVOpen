<p id="Par84" class="p">First, in addition to the freezing and thawing studies that are often performed on small volumes early in development, scale down models are often used to evaluate performance with freezing and thawing in smaller containers representative of the surface area to volume ratio of the target storage container for commercial drug substance manufacture. In addition to the agitation studies performed above, after a drug product presentation is locked, more specific agitation studies should be performed to ensure the product is robust enough to handle the interfacial stress sustained during transportation. Performing these studies at the target fill volume provides representative conditions for both the air/water interface and the container compatibility. In particular, shock testing and shipping tests are often performed on representative drug product vials prior to commercialization. In these shipping studies, the drug product is shipped and exposed to real-world conditions that may arise during transportation. In particular, using aged drug product for these studies can account for any surfactant degradation that may occur over time in certain products, demonstrating the robustness of the formulation to protect against transportation-induced interfacial stress, even at the end of the use period.</p>
