<p id="Par85" class="p">Container and manufacturing component compatibility is also critical. While the majority of commonly used containers and manufacturing components can be considered low risk for causing substantial stability challenges, it is still important to perform a risk assessment and/or a study to ensure no surprises emerge on stability. For example, small volumes of bulk drug product can be incubated in the container(s) of choice for 1 to 3 months under recommended storage conditions and under appropriate accelerated conditions for the protein of interest. Similarly, small pieces of each component of a given manufacturing scheme can be incubated with the bulk drug product for 3 to 7 days at the temperature anticipated for manufacturing, then compared to protein simply held at the same temperature in an adjacent vial. Filtration is likely the unit operation where a solid/liquid interface problem will emerge; most importantly, protein and surfactant concentration should be measured before and after filtration to ensure no material has been lost to the filter. If material is lost in the first volume to pass through the filter (for example, in the first 100 mL of a clinical manufacturing scale filter), but a saturation point is reached, a surge vessel can be used. Alternatively, a filter flush volume can be built into the manufacturing instructions in order to saturate the filter and allow the remainder of the material to pass through without loss of protein concentration. Different filter types can also be explored, as some may be more likely to cause protein adherence than others.</p>
