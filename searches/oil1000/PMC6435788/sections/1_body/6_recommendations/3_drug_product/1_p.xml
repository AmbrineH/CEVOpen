<p id="Par83" class="p">Each drug product should also be evaluated for sensitivity to different interfaces during manufacturing, storage, and transportation. During drug product manufacturing, the protein is exposed to freezing/thawing; shear stress and stress at the air/water interface during stirring, pumping, and filling operations; and solid/liquid interfacial stress during filtration and with exposure to different manufacturing components. During transportation and storage, both container compatibility and ruggedness with respect to agitation are critical for the long-term stability of a molecule. Thus, sensitivity to freezing and thawing, shear and air/water interfacial stress, and solid/liquid interfacial stresses should all be examined. Because degradation of surfactant on stability can occur, studies on aged drug product and/or studies using surfactant levels representative of the end of shelf life should be performed.</p>
