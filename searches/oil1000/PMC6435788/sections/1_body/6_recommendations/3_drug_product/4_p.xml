<p id="Par86" class="p">In addition to agitation and interfacial screening tools, shear rates for different mixing and filling parameters can be modeled, and mini-piloting tools can be utilized to expose the molecule to these levels of shear. Interestingly, in some cases, problems do not manifest in immediate aggregation, but aggregates may form over time in solutions that have been exposed to stress. Thus, it is also recommended to expose the molecule to the anticipated stress condition and then set it on stability in order to observe any lasting effects the exposure to interfacial stress may cause. Aggregates and particle counts should be measured before stress, immediately after stress, and again after storage at recommended and accelerated storage conditions.</p>
