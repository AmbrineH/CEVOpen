<p id="Par88" class="p">Once the drug product has been manufactured and has reached the clinical site, the steps used in product administration can still expose the molecule to stress conditions. A thorough description of in-use stability studies can be found in the “
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec" class="xref">IN-USE STABILITY STUDY OF INJECTABLE BIOLOGICAL DRUG PRODUCTS</xref>” section above. For IV infusion, it is important to assess the stability of the product in the diluents recommended for the product’s administration. Because dilution of the drug product with the vehicle inherently dilutes the surfactant, as well, particulate formation can reemerge as a problem for sensitive molecules. In-use stability studies are therefore a critical part of the development process. These studies evaluate the stability of the molecule when exposed to different diluents and components used during product administration, including IV bags, IV sets, and in-line filters. If the product is to be administered subcutaneously, the stability of the product in the presence of the silicone oil and in contact with the administration device should be considered. Advances in patient drug delivery and increased interest in patient convenience have led to an increase in the use of autoinjectors and other self-administration devices. If these devices are to be used, the contact surfaces and solid/liquid interfaces encountered during use should be evaluated for their impact on the stability of the protein itself. In all cases, the infusion product should be tested for formation of high molecular weight species and particulate matter, as well as tested
