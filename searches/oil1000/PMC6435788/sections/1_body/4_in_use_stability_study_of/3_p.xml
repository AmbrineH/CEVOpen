<p id="Par40" class="p">Subcutaneous delivery of therapeutic proteins is a fast-growing field, which often requires large quantities of drug to be administered within a small volume. High protein concentration drug products are conventionally delivered with different types of syringes and needles. Recently, prefilled syringes, autoinjectors, or on-body delivery systems have been increasingly utilized in subcutaneous drug delivery. In-use stability studies should include the evaluation of interfacial impact from the surfaces of those injection devices and the approaches to use them during administration.</p>
