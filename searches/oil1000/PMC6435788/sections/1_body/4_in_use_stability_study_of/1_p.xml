<p id="Par38" class="p">The integrity of biological drugs for administration in clinical settings is very important because it affects not only the efficacy of the drugs but also the safety of patients. Understanding postproduction handling risks is therefore critical to the development of a robust product (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>). The purpose of in-use stability testing is to establish a period of time for the preparation and administration of biological drugs used in the clinical settings while retaining quality within accepted specification. At this time, biological drugs are delivered 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> intravenous injection of either neat drug product or product that has been diluted with vehicle to achieve specific dosages in a clinical setting, or subcutaneously by various devices that are often self-administered by the patient. For IV administration, the commercially available fluids 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP (normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water (D5W) are widely used as diluents. The infusion solutions for administration encounter various materials throughout the preparation and administration period, including syringes, tubes, IV bags, and in-line filters. In certain cases, it has been reported that the IV bag materials have an impact on aggregate formation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>); however, infusion solutions containing certain levels of protein aggregates or particles are not suitable for IV administration because they may reduce potency or increase immunogenicity (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>). In-line filters are therefore often used to prevent any formed particulate matter from reaching the patient; however, protein adsorption to this filter or to other surfaces encountered throughout administration can lead to the patient receiving less than the intended dose, especially for very low dose therapies. Thus, in-use stability should be evaluated as a part of formulation development to avoid unforeseen problems.
