<p id="Par39" class="p">Due to the high variability in clinical study designs, no specific guidance is available on defining the scope of in-use stability studies. Knowledge of how a product is intended for use in clinical settings is necessary prior to conducting the in-use stability study. However, in-use stability studies typically evaluate the compatibility of drug products with the diluents normal saline or D5W, along with various syringes, closed system transfer devices, tubes, IV bags, transfer lines, and in-line filters. Various concentrations of diluted drug products and flow rates should also be qualified. After preparation of the dosing solution, initial samples should be collected, then the infusion solutions should be exposed to the appropriate room temperature/room light conditions representative of the clinical environment before infusion. Both initial and infused samples should be tested, and intermediate samples can be tested, as needed. Generally, the samples should be aged longer than expected clinical use time in order to ensure the stability of the product throughout the longest allowable preparation, storage, and administration period. Microbial testing is not required when the infusion samples are stored at room temperature up to a maximum of 4 h because the assumption is made that the infusion solutions prepared aseptically and contained in sterile bags will remain sterile for this period of time. The analytical tests performed on the samples usually include those to probe levels of soluble aggregates, particles, charge variants, and fragmentation, as well as protein concentration, appearance, and pH. In particular, the HIAC liquid particle counter is the instrument often used for subvisible particle detection following guidance of USP &lt;787&gt; Subvisible Particulate Matter in Therapeutic Protein Injection, using small volumes and designed specifically for biologics, or USP &lt;788&gt; Particulate Matter in Injections. As stated in USP &lt;788&gt;, pass/fail limits for HIAC particle counts for small volume parenteral products (less than 100 mL) are 6000 per container for particles larger than 10 μm and 600 per container for particles larger than 25 μm. For larger volumes (more than 100 mL), HIAC particle pass/fail limits are 12 per mL for particles above 10 μm and 2 particles per mL for particles above 25 μm. Performing an in-use stability study allows the development team to understand any risks around interfacial interaction of the protein with the clinical components, as well as to define a safe operating space for clinical studies.</p>
