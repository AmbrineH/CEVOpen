<p id="Par5" class="p">Aggregation of therapeutic proteins can be induced by stresses encountered at vapor–liquid, solid–liquid, and liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>). Aggregation typically involves some degree of protein conformational change, relative to the folded monomer, that allows two or more proteins to form interprotein bonds that possess similar or greater stability than the intraprotein bonds of the native folded structure. The corresponding growth of aggregates typically occurs through addition of monomers and/or through combining aggregates to form soluble high molecular weight (HMW) aggregates. The mechanism by which the stresses encountered at interfaces promote protein aggregation relative to that in the bulk of solution is less well established. Whether the proteins distort/unfold and self-assemble into aggregates at the interface, and/or whether they release from the interface and further aggregate while in the bulk solution (or even disassemble and refold) is not definitively settled. In principle, each type of interfacial species can reversibly exchange with the corresponding bulk species through convective and/or diffusive mass transport between the bulk and interfaces. The adsorption and desorption processes may be at equilibrium or under mass-transfer control. If under equilibrium control, gentle sample mixing processes are not expected to affect the concentration of adsorbed species; however, if under mass transfer control, then mixing should enhance the adsorption and/or desorption rates
