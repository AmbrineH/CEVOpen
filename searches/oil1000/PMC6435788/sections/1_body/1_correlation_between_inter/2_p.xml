<p id="Par6" class="p">While long-term exposure to interfaces can be detrimental to the physical stability of therapeutic proteins, transient exposure to interfaces in combination with mechanical disruption of the interface (
 <italic class="italic">e.g.</italic>, agitation, mixing, pumping) is particularly conducive to causing protein aggregation. Interfacial exposure and shear stress typically occur together, but it is unlikely that the shear stress alone causes protein aggregation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>). Numerous reports in the literature support the hypothesis that protein adsorption to interfaces, followed by subsequent denaturation and aggregation at the interface, leads to formation of protein particulates and soluble aggregates. In particular, due to the dilution of surfactants typically included in formulations to stabilize proteins against interfacial stress, handling and transportation of protein drugs prepared in IV infusion bags can result in substantial aggregation due to the air–liquid interface present in the bags. By removing the air headspace, and thus eliminating the air–liquid interface in the IV bag, the bags can undergo agitation with essentially no protein aggregation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>). One marketed biologic, LUMIZYME® (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA), explicitly instructs for the removal of air from the IV bag “to minimize particle formation because of the sensitivity of LUMIZYME® to air–liquid interfaces” (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>). Similar to IV bag agitation, agitation of a mAb in a drug product vial with air headspace led to extensive aggregation, whereas shaking under identical conditions without the air headspace substantially limited the observed aggregation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>). Other investigators have studied the effect of agitation in siliconized 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> unsiliconized prefilled syringes and found that the presence of silicone oil exacerbated the agitation-induced aggregation of a variety of protein therapeutics (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>). Because protein adsorption to interfaces is frequently limited to the formation of a monolayer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>), rather than multilayers, increases in protein concentration in the bulk solution can result in an inverse relationship between the percent of protein aggregated
