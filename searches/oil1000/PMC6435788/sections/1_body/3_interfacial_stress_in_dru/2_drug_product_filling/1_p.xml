<p id="Par30" class="p">The drug product filling process can affect product quality attributes, since the protein solution may be exposed to shear, friction, and cavitation during this unit operation. Several factors, including the filling pump mechanism, contact material, filling speed, and filling needle size, can all affect the overall stress encountered by a protein during the filling operation. For instance, Noyak 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> reported that the rotary piston pump generated more protein subvisible particles compared to the rolling diaphragm pump, peristaltic pump, and time-pressure pump (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>). The authors attributed possible factors to be the narrow annular gap that produced high shear and friction, as well as the maximum exposure of the product to metallic/ceramic surfaces during filling. Biddlecombe 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>) have also reported significant levels of protein aggregation and precipitation in therapeutic antibodies due to shear in the presence of a solidâ€“liquid interface. Therefore, filling systems and processes should be well understood and carefully selected for each drug product, especially for any protein molecules that are known to be highly sensitive to shear stress.
