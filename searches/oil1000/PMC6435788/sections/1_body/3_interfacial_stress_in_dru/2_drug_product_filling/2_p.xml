<p id="Par31" class="p">Though the filling system is often a fixed parameter due to the equipment setup in the filling line in a given manufacturing facility, a well-designed, product-specific pump filling study and/or recirculation laboratory study is recommended to evaluate the molecule susceptibility to filling stress and to identify any potential risk associated with the filling process. This type of study can be used to optimize filling parameters and confirm that the product quality attributes are not compromised during a worst-case filling process. The key for the suggested laboratory study is to use a representative filling pump (filling mechanism, contact material) with representative filling parameters such as nozzle size (time-over-pressure filling technology), filling speed, filling needle size,
