<p id="Par29" class="p">During drug product manufacturing, a drug substance may be mixed with additional excipients, often after thawing, before being filled into vials, syringes, and other devices. The thawing process exposes the protein to the ice/liquid interface, then the mixing step exposes the protein to the air/water interface while being sheared 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> stirring. The effects of these stresses on biologics were described above. However, the unit operation that likely results in the most interfacial stress is the filling process. Once filled into vials, opportunities for exposure to interfacial stress emerge during storage, transport, and clinical administration.
