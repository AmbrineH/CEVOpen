<p id="Par32" class="p">Achieving desirable storage stability is one of the major challenges in the development of protein drugs. Proteins can experience a variety of environmental stresses during storage and degrade 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> different pathways. Interfacial stress is one of the primary causes of protein instability during storage. Protein drug products can be stored in various container–closure systems, such as vials, prefilled syringes, and stainless steel containers, and during IV infusion, in disposable plastic bags. Depending on the container–closure systems used, proteins can be exposed to various types of interfaces during storage, such as air–liquid interface, solid–liquid interface, and oil–water interface. Understanding the mechanisms of interface-induced protein instability is of great significance to the development of stable protein formulations and selection of appropriate storage conditions.
