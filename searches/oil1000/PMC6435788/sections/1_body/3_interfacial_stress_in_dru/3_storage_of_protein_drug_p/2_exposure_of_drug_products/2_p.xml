<p id="Par34" class="p">Agitation studies are routinely carried out during formulation and process development to assess the air–liquid interfacial stability of therapeutic proteins. The variables tested in agitation studies usually include method of agitation (such as stirring and shaking), intensity of agitation, size of headspace (in vials) or bubble (in prefilled syringe), and container orientation. Adsorptive loss of protein, structural and conformational change, aggregation, and particle formation are usually the key parameters to monitor in an agitation stability study. A number of techniques can be used to monitor the adsorption of proteins to the air–liquid interface and the strength of protein–protein interaction at the interface, including confocal microscopy, interfacial ellipsometry and X-ray/neutron reflectivity, and dilatational interfacial rheology (

Surfactants, such as polysorbates, can prevent the adsorption of proteins to the air–liquid interface and are very effective at mitigating air–liquid interface–induced protein instability. Formulation conditions that can help improve protein colloidal stability may also enhance air–liquid interfacial stability of proteins.
