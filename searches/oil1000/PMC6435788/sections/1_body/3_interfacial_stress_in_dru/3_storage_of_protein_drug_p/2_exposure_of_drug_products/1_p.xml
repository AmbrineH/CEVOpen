<p id="Par33" class="p">Aqueous solutions of therapeutic proteins are exposed to the air–liquid interface due to the vial headspace or when bubbles are present. Proteins can adsorb to the air–liquid interface and form a viscoelastic interfacial film (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>), with the same mechanism as that described during stirring above. Agitation during shipping can enhance air–liquid interface–induced protein aggregation by increasing the area of air–liquid interface and by accelerating the transport of denatured proteins from the air–liquid interface back to the bulk solution. Liu 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> showed that compression of the air–liquid interface promotes aggregation at the interface and consequent release of aggregates/particles into the bulk solution (
