During formulation development, an important part of the container compatibility evaluation is the solution depletion study, which is used to evaluate the adsorption of proteins to container surfaces. In this study, liquid-state proteins are incubated in the containers of interest for various amounts of time. The protein concentration is measured before and after the incubation to obtain the adsorptionâ€“time curve. Surface adsorption of proteins can often be mitigated by adjusting the pH and ionic strength or by the addition of suitable excipients, such as surfactants, depending on whether adsorption is predominantly driven by electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. However, formulation strategies used to mitigate against an electrostatically driven interaction (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, storage in a glass container) may not be effective in a situation where hydrophobicity is driving the interaction between the protein and the container. Alternatively, a container material/coating that has a low adsorption profile to the protein of interest should be selected.
