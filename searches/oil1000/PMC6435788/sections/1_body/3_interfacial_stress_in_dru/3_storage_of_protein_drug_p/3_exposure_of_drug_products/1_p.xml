<p id="Par35" class="p">The solid–liquid interface of container–closure systems is another type of interface that proteins encounter during storage. It has been shown that proteins can adsorb to various types of solid surfaces, including glass, plastic, rubber, and metal. Adsorptive loss of proteins can significantly reduce the dose that can reach patients and is of a particular concern to therapeutic protein products stored at a low concentration. A clinically well-studied example in this regard is insulin. It has been demonstrated that insulin can adsorb to various types of containers such as glass vials, plastic vials, and infusion bottles, which can result in 20–60% reduction in the dose available to patients (

Denatured proteins, once desorbed from solid surfaces, can form potential nucleation sites and trigger protein aggregation in the bulk solution. Particles shed from solid surfaces encountered during manufacturing and storage, such as glass and stainless steel, can also act as potential nuclei and induce protein aggregation in bulk solutions (
