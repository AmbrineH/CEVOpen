<p id="Par89" class="p">Exposure of proteins to interfaces during development, manufacturing, and storage is inevitable. Each protein has its own unique sensitivities, and in order to develop a robust drug product, it is important to understand the different risks for each molecule. While some mitigation strategies, such as the addition of surfactant, are relatively common, other risk assessment tools and strategies around the evaluation of interfacial sensitivity of a given protein should be considered. In this commentary, we have described the interfacial conditions to which proteins are exposed, the effects interfacial exposure have on the stability of the protein, potential stability studies and risk assessment tools to understand the impact on each individual molecule, as well as new analytical techniques that are available to explore the behavior of different molecules at the air/liquid and solid/liquid interface. Understanding the particular sensitivities of a molecule throughout the development process is key to development of a robust drug product.</p>
