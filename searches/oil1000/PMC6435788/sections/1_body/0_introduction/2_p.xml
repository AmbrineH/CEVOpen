<p id="Par3" class="p">Various types of interfacial stress are encountered throughout both drug substance and drug product processing, storage, and clinical use. The protein isolation and purification steps used in the drug substance manufacturing process involve interaction of the molecule with various solid/liquid interfaces, such as columns and filters, processing equipment, container surfaces, and ice during storage. The molecule is also exposed to air/liquid interfaces as part of mixing and mechanical pumping operations. During drug product manufacturing, the proteins are thawed and often mixed with additional excipients before being filled into vials or syringes. The thawing process exposes the protein to the ice/liquid interface, then the mixing step exposes the protein to the air/water interface while being sheared, before the filling process exposes the molecule to high shear for a short period of time. Once filled, opportunities for air/liquid interfacial stress are the primary packaging, the containerâ€™s headspace, agitation during transport, and stress during clinical administration. Administration of the drug product is achieved using either IV bags, syringes, or autoinjectors, in which the protein is exposed to a variety of surfaces and materials, including plastics of IV bags and infusion sets, in-line filters, silicone oil, and metals.</p>
