<p id="Par8" class="p">Biologics are developed and manufactured in two major stages. Biologic drug substance is the purified bulk material that has been concentrated to the target protein concentration, partially (or fully) formulated, and typically frozen until initiation of drug product manufacturing. The drug product is the fully formulated protein solution contained in a vial, syringe, or other delivery device that is ready for patient administration. Both protein drug substance and drug product process development and manufacturing workflows can expose proteins to various interfacial stress conditions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). During drug substance manufacturing, the protein is taken through a series of unit operations, including harvest, centrifugation or filtration for removal of cell debris, purification

In particular, the drug substance filtration, freezing/thawing, as well as unit operations that combine mechanical and interfacial stresses are particularly impactful and will be detailed here.
