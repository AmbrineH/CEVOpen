 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>). Stability differences between small- and large-scale samples of the same formulation could be related to different ice nucleation and crystal growth patterns and, therefore, variations in interfaces proteins are exposed to on different scales. Accordingly, a surfactant such as polysorbate, which competes with proteins for interfaces, can improve the stability of frozen proteins, as demonstrated,
