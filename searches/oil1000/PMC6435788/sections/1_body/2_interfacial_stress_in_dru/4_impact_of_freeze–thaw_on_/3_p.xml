<p id="Par21" class="p">Several key studies have demonstrated clear correlations between freezing (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, ice formation) and protein instability. Conformational changes of globular proteins were studied by employing the phosphorescence emission of tryptophan (Trp) residues as a monitor of the conformational changes of six proteins in response to variations in conditions of the medium (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>). Changes in well-structured compact cores of the macromolecules were monitored by the direct correlation between the phosphorescence lifetime 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> and the rigidity of the protein matrix surrounding the chromophoric probe. The solidification of water markedly decreased 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> and indicated unfolding-related changes in conformation of the proteins, which was related primarily to the protein–ice interaction. Additionally, Trp florescence was employed to monitor unfolding of an azurin mutant C112S from 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The results obtained with C112S azurin indicated that the stability of the native fold may be significantly perturbed in the frozen solutions depending mainly on the size of the liquid solution pool in equilibrium with the solid phase (
