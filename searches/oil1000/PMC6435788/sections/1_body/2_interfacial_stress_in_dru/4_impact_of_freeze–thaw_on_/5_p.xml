<p id="Par23" class="p">Understanding the mechanism for freeze-induced protein stabilization is essential to the development of appropriate stabilization strategies. For example, if a main destabilization pathway were direct sorption of protein molecules onto ice, minimization of surface area of ice crystals would be a sensible approach. On the other hand, if protein is partitioned in the quasi-liquid layer or resides predominantly in the bulk freeze-concentrate, stabilization would involve modification of the amorphous protein environment, where the following approaches could be considered:
