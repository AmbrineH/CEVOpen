<p id="Par19" class="p">Biologic drug substances are typically frozen for long-term storage, and then thawed at the start of drug product manufacture. Drug product containers can also experience unintentional frozen excursions during shipping and/or storage. While a frozen drug substance allows time to elapse before drug product manufacture without affecting overall stability, and permits the manufacture of multiple drug products from a single drug substance lot, multiple freeze/thaw cycles can have a negative impact on product quality. Multiple stresses are associated with freeze–thaw, including freeze concentration, pH changes, mechanical stresses, and low temperature per se which could result in cold denaturation. In addition, freezing (water-to-ice transformation) creates extensive ice/solution interfaces, and it has been suggested that freeze-induced destabilization of proteins is related to exposure of the protein molecules to these interfaces (

In formulations that contain a crystallizable solute, such as NaCl, mannitol, PEG, sorbitol, or trehalose, freezing can result in secondary solute+water crystallization (
