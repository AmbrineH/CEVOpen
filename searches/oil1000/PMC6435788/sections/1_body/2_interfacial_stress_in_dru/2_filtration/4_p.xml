<p id="Par12" class="p">In addition to pore size and distribution, the interfacial stress during filtration is also impacted by the surface properties of the filter membrane and the physical properties of the filtrates. It has been reported that the interfacial adsorptionâ€“desorption of the protein to and from hydrophobic interfaces during ultrafiltration/diafiltration is the principal cause of particle formation, and the level of surfactant-free particle formation depends on the colloidal stability of the protein (

Though formed particles can likely be removed through further downstream filtration processes, the exposure of the molecule to this interfacial stress may still potentially have an impact on the filterability of the protein solution. These systems may require alternate strategies, such as performing UF/DF at low conductivity, adding additional stabilizer(s) to improve colloidal stability, or adding surfactants, such as polysorbate, to the process stream (
