<p id="Par13" class="p">Frequently, polysorbate is found to be a critical excipient that helps to protect the protein solution from interfacial stress during various unit operations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>). However, if included in the UF/DF operation, polysorbates can be retained with the protein. Thus, in many cases, surfactant is not added until after the UF/DF unit operation, so this protectant is not present until the end of drug substance manufacturing. Additionally, because polysorbate adsorption to the membrane is often encountered during the filtration process, any polysorbate adsorption during filtration needs to be carefully evaluated. If significant adsorption is observed, mitigation strategies need to be in place in order to both monitor and control the adsorption, to ensure that the surfactant concentration postfiltration meets the intended requirements. During filtration process development for both drug substance and drug product, laboratory-scale studies are recommended in order to screen suitable filter membranes and choose the right filter with appropriate size. In particular, in certain cases, an appropriate product flush volume may be warranted during drug product manufacture to ensure filter adsorption does not lead to vials with reduced levels of protein or excipients. The predetermined filter flush volume can be assessed based on the filter adsorption behavior in laboratory-scale studies, then further confirmed or adjusted in at-scale studies based on the sterile filtration and filling process during drug product manufacturing.
