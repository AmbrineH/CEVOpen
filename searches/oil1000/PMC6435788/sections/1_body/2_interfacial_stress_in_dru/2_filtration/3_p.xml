<p id="Par11" class="p">During each of these filtration processes, high levels of shear stress are often generated at the interface of the filter membrane and the protein solution. Interfacial stress may promote protein–protein interactions, or even lead to protein conformational rearrangement to reduce the energy of interaction, which could further lead to protein aggregation or particle formation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>). In the ultrafiltration process, the protein concentration at the membrane interface may be much higher than the overall bulk solution. This might further result in membrane fouling and boundary layer polarization near the filter membrane. All these factors could potentially lead to protein aggregation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>). The filtration force is closely related to the membrane pore size and the distribution. It has been reported that filtration forces through polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filters are lower than those through polyethersulfone (PES) filters (

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> showed that the PVDF filter investigated had larger pore sizes as compared to the PES filter tested. Mercury porosimetry also confirmed that the PVDF filter had a wider pore size and relatively more heterogeneous pore size distribution (
