<p id="Par9" class="p">Several steps in the drug substance manufacturing process can lead to interfacial stress due to interaction with various types of filters. First, following protein expression in the production bioreactor, a filtration operation is employed to remove cells and/or solid cellular debris. The industry standard for large-scale manufacturing involves a disk-stack centrifugation step, followed by normal flow depth filtration. Further purification is typically achieved through one or more chromatography operations to isolate the protein of interest, while removing impurities and increasing concentration. Purification of most mammalian cell–derived biologics includes a virus removal step, which is typically a normal flow operation. Additionally, multiple normal flow filters are placed throughout drug substance processing; in particular, particle reduction or microbial control filters are commonly placed before the load and pools of each process step (
