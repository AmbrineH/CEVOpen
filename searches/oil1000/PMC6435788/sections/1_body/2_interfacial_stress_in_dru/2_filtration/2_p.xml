<p id="Par10" class="p">During drug substance manufacturing, protein solutions are often concentrated and/or buffer exchanged using an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) process, which is a membrane-based tangential flow filtration (TFF) process where products are exposed to multiple pump passes, recirculation, and mixing. Likewise, in aseptic drug product manufacturing, compounded protein bulk solutions are filtered for bioburden reduction or sterile filtration using normal flow filtration. While both operations are membrane-based filtration unit operations, the differences are mainly the direction of the fluid flow relative to the membrane and the total time spent in contact with the membrane, which thus affects the total amount of shear and surface exposure the molecule is exposed to throughout the filtration process.</p>
