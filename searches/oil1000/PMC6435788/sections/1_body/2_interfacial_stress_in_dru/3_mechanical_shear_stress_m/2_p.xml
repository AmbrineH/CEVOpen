<p id="Par15" class="p">Across the drug substance manufacturing process, air/liquid interfaces must be considered and minimized to prevent negative impacts to the protein of interest. Due to sparging in bioreactors, shear protectants are employed to prevent damage to the cells (

Process-intermediate mixing should be controlled to maintain gentle agitation and avoid the formation of a vortex, while ensuring agitators remain fully submerged. Stainless steel tanks are commonly used for process pool collection or TFF retentate recirculation, where solution flows through a dip tube into the tank. The design and location of these dip tubes are important to minimize and avoid violent air/liquid interfaces and prevent foaming. To assess the susceptibility of a biologic to air/liquid interfaces, a variety of methods have been employed, including shaking in a partially filled vial, mixing with deep vortex, and mixing with partially submerged agitator.
