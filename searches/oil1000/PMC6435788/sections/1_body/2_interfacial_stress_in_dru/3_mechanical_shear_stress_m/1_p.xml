<p id="Par14" class="p">Mechanical shear stresses may be introduced from a variety of the manufacturing equipment utilized throughout drug substance and drug product manufacturing, including gas sparging, centrifuges, pumps, agitators, and flow-through plumbing. Generally, highly polished, slower moving mechanical parts are designed into the process equipment, and where required, pumps with lower RPM and low shear impellers are employed. Plumbing and piping are typically sized to ensure linear velocities remain low enough to avoid highly turbulent flow regimes, typically targeting &lt; 5 ft/s (
