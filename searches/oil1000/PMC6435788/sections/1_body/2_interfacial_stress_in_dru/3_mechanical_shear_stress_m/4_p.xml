<p id="Par17" class="p">A recent review paper from Thomas 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> focuses on the effects of shear stress on proteins in solution (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>). This work suggests that protein aggregation or instability is not solely induced by mechanical shear, and other factors such as interfacial effects are often found to be the primary mechanisms, or at least significant contributing factors. Kiese 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> evaluated the impact of agitation on proteins by using different agitation methods and found that shaking and stirring resulted in the formation of different numbers of particles (
