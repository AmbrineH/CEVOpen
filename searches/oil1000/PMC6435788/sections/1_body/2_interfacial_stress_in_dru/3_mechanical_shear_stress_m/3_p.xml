<p id="Par16" class="p">Several mixing unit operations take place during both drug substance and drug product manufacturing processes, such as diluent mixing and concentrate preparation; adjusting the solution pH, concentration, and/or conductivity to the appropriate conditions for the subsequent process step; 
 <italic class="italic">etc</italic>. These mixing operations are often performed in mechanically agitated tanks. During the agitation step, inappropriate mixing conditions may lead to extensive foaming and/or cavitation for protein solutions. The air/liquid interface is hydrophobic, resulting in the adsorption of surface-active molecules like proteins to this surface. The interfacial exposure may lead to at least partial unfolding of the protein, hence exposing their hydrophobic core and promoting protein–protein interactions and aggregation. Stirring forces these partially unfolded species into the bulk and allows more protein to be exposed to the interface. For instance, recombinant human growth hormone solutions (0.5 mg/mL) mixed by vortexing for just 1 min have been shown to lead to as much as 67% of the protein precipitating as noncovalent insoluble aggregates (
