<p id="Par68" class="p">USP Chapter &lt;1&gt; requires parenteral dosage forms to be essentially free from visible particulate matter (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>). While the precise phrase “essentially free” may not appear in the analogous chapters of other global pharmacopeia, the underlying intent of such chapters is the same. Visible particles are most readily assessed by adhering to the basic approach outlined in the three International Council for Harmonization (ICH) region’s pharmacopeia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>). Briefly, the pharmacopeia require inspection against black and white backgrounds using a light intensity of 2000–3750 lx from a white light source. Even in these controlled lighting conditions, the detection of visible particles is probabilistic and depends on many attributes, including both observer- and particle-specific characteristics. As such, the probability of detecting a single spherical particle only begins to approach 100% for particles that are ~ 200 μm and larger, while trained operators may be able to detect particles in the 50–100-μm range (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>). If more enhanced visible particle detection capabilities are desired, one can consider the use of manual, table-top inspection machines such as those from Seidenader (V90-T or VPE) or Bosch Packaging Technology (APK series or ETAC ProView). In some instances, these machines can be configured with high-resolution cameras to aid in detection of visible particles.
