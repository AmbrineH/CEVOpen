<p id="Par67" class="p">Particle morphology can be detected using flow imaging (FI). In this technique, optical images are captured as the sample flows through the detector and are subsequently analyzed. In addition to size and number, the images can be analyzed for brightness, shape, and Feret diameter. This method can help differentiate protein particles from fibers, solid spheres, or silicone oil droplets. FI is useful for root cause analysis; however, the method is not as robust as LO, and at present, there is no linkage of FI particle counts to historical specifications using LO as the test methodology. Thus, while flow imaging is a powerful characterization technique, it is not currently a batch release method with the robustness necessary for routine application in a GMP or quality facility. Both LO and FI are optical methods and, thus, depend on differences in refractive index between particle and surrounding solution. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has done extensive studies comparing these methods to understand why the size distributions obtained from the same sample are different, and a thorough discussion of the confounding issues has been published (
