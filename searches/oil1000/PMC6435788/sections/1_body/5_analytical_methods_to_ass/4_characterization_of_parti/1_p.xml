<p id="Par66" class="p">As the inherent heterogeneity of proteinaceous particles became better understood, it became apparent that the compendial methods were not sufficient for characterization and root cause analysis (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>). As a result, new method development was needed to provide a more detailed description of the particles formed during process development and characterization. The particles should be assessed for size, number, morphology, chemical modifications, and conformation, if they are proteinaceous (
