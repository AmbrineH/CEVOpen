<p id="Par70" class="p">Interfacial rheology is typically performed either as a shear measurement under constant surface area or as a dilatational measurement where the surface area is uniformly compressed or expanded. Interfacial shear measurements performed with traditional rotational rheometers, which are typically employed for bulk rheological measurements, are the most common due to the availability of the instruments. A bicone disk geometry allows for the measurement of interfacial viscoelasticity of protein films (
