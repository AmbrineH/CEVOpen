<p id="Par71" class="p">Academic labs have developed a variety of dedicated interfacial rheological methods, and some of these are now commercially available. An interfacial shear rheometer based on a thin magnetic rod floated at the fluid–fluid interface (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>) and is commercially available. To further increase the sensitivity of interfacial shear measurements, several active microrheology measurements that use smaller probes can be employed, thus increasing sensitivity to the interfacial film rather than the bulk fluid(s). A microrheometer based on the rotation of magnetic 300 nm rods successfully measured the interfacial viscoelasticity of a protein film over four orders of magnitude as the film aged at the air–liquid interface (
