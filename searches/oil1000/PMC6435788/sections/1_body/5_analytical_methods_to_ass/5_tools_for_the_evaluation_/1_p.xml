<p id="Par69" class="p">The response that an interfacial film of protein and/or surfactant exhibits when a force is applied to the film provides a wealth of information about the nature of the molecules adsorbed to the interface. Interfacial rheology, which measures this relationship, is therefore a valuable tool to understand protein aggregation at interfaces. Fuller
