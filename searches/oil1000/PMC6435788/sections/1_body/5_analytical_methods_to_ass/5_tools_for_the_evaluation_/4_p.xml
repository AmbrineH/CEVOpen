<p id="Par72" class="p">While interfacial shear rheometers are ubiquitous, dilatational measurements obtained after the surface area is uniformly compressed and/or expanded offer additional insight into the properties of protein films. Notably, the uniform compression of protein films adsorbed to an air–liquid interface highlighted the difference in aggregation propensities of two mAbs (
