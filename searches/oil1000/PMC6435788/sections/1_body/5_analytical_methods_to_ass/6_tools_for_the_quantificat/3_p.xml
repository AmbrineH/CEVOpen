<p id="Par75" class="p">As proteins begin to populate the interface from the aqueous buffer, the surface concentration increases and lateral interactions between proteins will define a 2D phase behavior that can be visualized using microscopy tools such as Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) or fluorescence-based microscopy. The execution of a BAM experiment mirrors the Wilhelmy plate setup described above, where proteins adsorb to the air–water interface as a function of time. BAM images
