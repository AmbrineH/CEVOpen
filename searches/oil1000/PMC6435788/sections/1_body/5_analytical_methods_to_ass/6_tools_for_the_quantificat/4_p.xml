<p id="Par76" class="p">Fluorescence-based microscopy techniques can also quantify adsorption and examine protein aggregation at various interfaces. These techniques typically require an extrinsic fluorophore to label the protein or molecule of interest, but carefully choosing the dye and limiting the labeling can allow for excellent visualization while not compromising the interfacial behavior of the molecule. Confocal microscopy, which provides good axial resolution for selectively observing interfacial phenomena, can be used to quantify the amount of protein adsorbed to an interface either in a Langmuir trough (

Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy utilizes an evanescent wave to selectively visualize molecules within a few hundred nanometers from a solid–liquid or liquid–liquid interface. TIRF has been used to track single protein molecules at an oil–water interface to determine adsorption and aggregation kinetics (
