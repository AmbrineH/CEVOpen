<p id="Par74" class="p">One of the oldest and most ubiquitous methods for measuring adsorption to fluid–fluid interfaces is surface (interfacial) tension. Surface tension was used to predict the aggregation propensity of a panel of mAbs and, therefore, could serve as a method for identifying problematic protein molecules early during development (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>). Two common techniques are available commercially for the measurement of quasi-static surface tension on timescales of seconds to hours: the Wilhelmy plate method and the pendant drop method. The Wilhelmy plate method directly measures the force acting on a flag placed at the fluid–fluid interface. This method typically requires milliliters of solution to measure. The pendant drop (or pendant bubble) apparatus works by allowing a ~ 1-mm-diameter drop of fluid to equilibrate in another bulk fluid, allowing for protein and surfactant to adsorb to the interface. The pendant shape of the drop is a balance between the tension of the interface and gravity acting on the drop, as described by the Young–Laplace equation. The pendant drop technique has been used to examine the kinetics of protein adsorption to fluid–fluid interfaces (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>). This method typically requires ~ 5 mL of solution to measure the dynamics of surface tension; however, there have been recent developments to build a microfluidic-based pendant bubble/drop apparatus that requires ~ 20 μL of solution (
