<p id="Par79" class="p">OWLS and SPR work on a similar principle of producing an evanescent wave to measure the local change in refractive index within approximately 100 nm of the surface due to adsorption of molecules. Both have been used to understand the interplay between surfactants and proteins adsorbing to solid–liquid interfaces (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">121</xref>). However, due to the sensitivity to refractive index changes, OWLS and SPR can both suffer from matrix effects. In contrast, BLI measures a wavelength shift due to the thickness and optical properties of an adsorbed layer to a solid substrate, so it can therefore be used in complex sample matrices. The substrate can be modified, as with the other techniques mentioned above, and this tool has been used to measure protein adsorption and desorption kinetics to various polymer-modified surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>). SFG uses two incident beams, one in the visible and one in the IR to create a “sum frequency.” The IR beam is broadly tuned to match the vibrational transition of the C–H or amide I group. SFG can only probe systems where inversion symmetry is broken, which occurs at the interface and not in the bulk. Because of the interfacial sensitivity, SFG can be used to simultaneously quantify adsorption rates, secondary structure, and structural orientation at the interface (
