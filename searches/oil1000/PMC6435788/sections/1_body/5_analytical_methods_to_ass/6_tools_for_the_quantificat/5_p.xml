<p id="Par77" class="p">The change in surface tension upon changing the surface area available to an adsorbed film of protein and surfactant also provides useful information about adsorption dynamics. A Langmuir trough provides a controlled compression/expansion rate and allows for the simultaneous measurement of surface tension and other properties (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>). The decrease in surface tension upon compression suggested strong protein–protein interactions in adsorbed films of antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>), and the hysteresis experienced upon compression and then expansion may indicate loss of material from the interface into the bulk and/or an irreversible change in the protein film due to compression. Protein films formed at the air–liquid interface can then also be transferred to a flat, solid substrate for subsequent topological characterization with atomic force microscopy, a combination that was used to better understand particle formation of an antibody at the air–liquid interface (
