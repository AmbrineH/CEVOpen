<p id="Par78" class="p">A multitude of label-free methods can be used to measure the adsorption of proteins and surfactants to solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interface. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measures the change in resonant frequency of a quartz crystal as different materials adsorb to the surface. The crystal may be functionalized with various materials like silicone oil, polymers, and metals. QCM-D measures the wet mass, which includes the molecules of interest as well as any hydration layer around those molecules, and has been used to study therapeutic protein adsorption to silicone oil–water interfaces (

While QCM-D can provide sensitive equilibrium adsorption measurements and can also measure the viscoelasticity of the adsorbed films, it is not well suited for measuring adsorption kinetics. However, several other label-free techniques provide highly sensitive adsorption kinetics at solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interfaces. Well-established tools to examine the rate of adsorption and the developing thickness of the protein-based film include ellipsometry (
