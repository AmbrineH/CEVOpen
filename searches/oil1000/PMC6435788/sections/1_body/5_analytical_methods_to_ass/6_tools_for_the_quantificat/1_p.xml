<p id="Par73" class="p">As discussed throughout this paper, the adsorption of therapeutic proteins to interfaces can drive the lateral aggregation of those confined proteins. Therefore, measuring both the adsorption dynamics of proteins and the interfacial phase behavior can play an important role in biotherapeutic development. In parallel, the role of surfactants in multicomponent systems with proteins can be quantified, as the competitive adsorption process is known to limit protein adsorption.</p>
