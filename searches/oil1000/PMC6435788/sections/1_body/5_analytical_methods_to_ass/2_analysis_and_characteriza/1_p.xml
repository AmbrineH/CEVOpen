<p id="Par42" class="p">The quantitation and analysis of soluble aggregates (particularly dimers, but also higher molecular weight species up to tetramers) is an important element in assessing, characterizing, and mitigating interfacial stress-induced protein alterations. The analytical workhorse for simple quantitation of soluble aggregate content is size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The use of a multi-angle light scattering detector during analysis by SEC (SEC-MALS) can provide further information regarding the absolute molecular weight of the aggregate species. For situations where interprotein disulfide bonds may form due to the interfacial stress, capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) can provide valuable insight, due to its convenient ability to be used in both reduced and nonreduced formats.</p>
