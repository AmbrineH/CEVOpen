<p id="Par43" class="p">The classic spectroscopic techniques, including ultraviolet absorbance, circular dichroism (CD), infrared (FTIR), Raman, and fluorescence (intrinsic and extrinsic), are capable of measuring changes in secondary and/or tertiary structure of the monomeric or aggregated forms and may provide information that can yield a mechanistic understanding of the root cause of aggregation/particle formation. In hyphenated microscopy format, FTIR and Raman have found particular use in characterizing the nature of proteinaceous particles.</p>
