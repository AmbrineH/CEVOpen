<p id="Par44" class="p">Light scattering techniques, such as static light scattering (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), can be useful for characterizing aggregates in the submicron range. The former, when used in combination with size exclusion chromatography (
 <italic class="italic">e.g.</italic>, SEC-MALS), is particularly convenient for the characterization of the absolute molecular weight of soluble aggregates. DLS can provide an assessment of the hydrodynamic radii and size distribution (although resolution is limited) of particles and is generally well suited to detecting small amounts of relatively large aggregates. Turbidimetry, which measures the reduction in light passing through a sample, and nephelometry, which measures the amount of forward scattered light produced by a sample, can both provide a coarse assessment of particle concentration. Differential scanning calorimetry may afford an understanding of the stability of the potentially altered conformational state of the perturbed native state or aggregated states. More specialized techniques, such as analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), asymmetric flow field-flow fraction (AF4), and hydrogen deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) or FTIR (HDX-FTIR), may also be used to characterize soluble aggregates formed due to interfacial stress.
