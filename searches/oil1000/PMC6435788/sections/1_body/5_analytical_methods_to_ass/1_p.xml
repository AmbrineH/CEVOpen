<p id="Par41" class="p">Biologics subjected to interfacial stress can generate a diverse assortment of aggregated species ranging in size from dimers and other soluble aggregates, to subvisible or micrometer-sized particles, to particles in the hundreds of micrometers that are visible to the unaided eye. Due to this size diversity, no single analytical technique is capable of providing a comprehensive assessment of the variety of aggregates that can be generated by interfacial stress. The subsequent section presents a brief overview of the analytical tools useful for characterizing aggregated species, including techniques that assess secondary/tertiary/higher order structure, size, and morphology. An analytical and characterization strategy needs to be developed that utilizes techniques that provide insight into the composition, morphology, mechanism of formation, and quantitation (
