<p id="Par64" class="p">Submicron particles are generally defined as those particles between 100 and 1000 nm in size. This size range will likely gain more attention as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Immunogenicity Assessment for Therapeutic Protein Products states that sponsors should strive to characterize particles in this smaller size range (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>). At present, there are two primary techniques for characterizing particles in this size range: nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and resonant mass measurement (RMM). NTA counts and sizes particles by tracking the Brownian motion of individual particles within the sample of interest. Tian 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> have recently contributed an evaluation of NTA and its application in characterizing submicron, proteinaceous particles (

The RMM method (also referred to as SRM, or suspended microchannel resonator) relies on the measurement of a particle’s buoyant mass to calculate a variety of useful parameters, including particle size and concentration. Like flow imaging (described later), this method can be particularly useful in differentiating silicone oil droplets from proteinaceous aggregates due to natural differences in buoyancy (
