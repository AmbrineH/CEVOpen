<p id="Par65" class="p">Subvisible particles (SbVP) are typically classified as those particles in the range of 1 and 100 μm. Particles in this range must be assessed as part of batch release and are also an important part of comparability testing and process development. The batch release methods, light obscuration (LO) or membrane microscopy analysis, for these particles/protein aggregates are described in several pharmacopeia chapters (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>). The LO method is an optical method in which the amount of light passing through the aliquot being tested is measured. Whenever a shadow passes over the detector due to obscuration of the light, this is assumed to be a particle; the size is determined from the 2D shadow, and each individual shadow counted. For the membrane microscopy method, the sample is filtered, and then the particle size and number are determined by manual analysis of the filter (
