<p class="p">The present research showed that the replacement of soybean oil with 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae fat in the diet for finisher broiler chicken is technically feasible, up to the 100% substitution level. Moreover, overall chicken meat quality was satisfactory from a nutritional and sensory point of view, thus suggesting that the 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae fat can be considered a possible ingredient to be included in commercial diets for broiler chickens. The fatty acids profile of the derived meat, however, is the sole drawback related to the use of this alternative feed ingredient as it was negatively enriched in saturated fatty acids, mainly to the detriment of the polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction. To solve this problem, two possible strategies can be adopted: improve the fat composition of larvae through substrate modulation or equilibrate the lipid quality of the poultry diet by including, in the feed formulation, ingredients rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially of the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 series, in combination with the 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae fat.
