<p class="p">Up to now, defatted HI meal has been the feed ingredient which has been the most appealing for the feed industry because it is very rich in protein [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], thus making it a possible substitute for soybean meal. Consequently, research efforts have also been mostly directed towards this emerging feed ingredient, studying the optimal defatted HI meal incorporation levels intended for different poultry species of economic interest. Dietary inclusions ranging between 5% and 19% have been tested in broiler chickens [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], broiler quails (

 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], ducks [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and Barbary partridges (

 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Findings in all these avian species were encouraging, as general health status, growth performance, carcass and meat quality traits, were satisfactory and suggested a possible practical application of the defatted HI meal in the formulation of poultry diets.
