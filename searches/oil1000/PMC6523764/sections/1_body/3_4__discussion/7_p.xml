<p class="p">Such FA modifications were constant in different animal species, meat cuts, and different dietary inclusion levels of the studied innovative ingredients, thus highlighting the need to adopt appropriate strategies to cope with this issue. Firstly, it was recently demonstrated that the killing procedure for HI larvae can have a great effect on the quality of their lipid fraction. In fact, HI larvae have a high concentration of the lipase enzyme [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] which is activated when the larvae are subjected to direct freezing as the killing procedure. This generates selective hydrolytic reactions, with a further selective cleavage of unsaturated FA by lipase enzymes and a subsequent intense saturation of the larvae FA profile [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Despite this, also when lipase enzyme was inactivated by thermal treatment, SFA were lower but were still the predominant FA fraction of HI larvae lipids. Secondly, the specific FA composition of the larvae can be also affected by the rearing substrate, even if to a limited extent: independent of the FA composition of the feed, HI larvae demonstrated they preferentially synthesized lauric acid mainly from dietary carbohydrates, which is deposited in large amounts in their body [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Despite the physiological role of lauric acid in insects not yet being characterized, it has been demonstrated to be involved in insect development, particularly during the transition from larval to adult life, and during adult maturation [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], as well as in the production of antimicrobial and antiviral compounds [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], thus explaining why, independent of the growing medium for HI larvae, it is always the main FA. The limited effect of the rearing substrate on the HI larvae FA composition was also further demonstrated when HI larvae were fed in a substrate enriched with fish offal, as it was observed that their FA composition was mainly constituted of SFA (72% of total FAME), as is commonly observed in this insect species reared on any other substrates, whereas the PUFA content decreased (6.99% of total FAME). The 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fraction and the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 ratio benefited from the fish offal inclusion, but it was not enough to improve the overall healthiness of the lipids [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Similarly, HI larvae reared in a substrate enriched with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA (50% 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> and 50% processed wheat), increased their content of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA to 25.3%, but SFA accounted for more than the 60% of the total FAME. Unfortunately, the substrate enrichment with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA had a drawback in ensuring satisfactory productive performance of larvae [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Based on such considerations, it seems therefore that the easiest and most effective way to improve the quality of the lipids in a feed formulation containing either HI larvae fat or protein meal would be to include another feed ingredient of vegetable origin rich in PUFA and in the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fraction, such as linseed [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>].
