<p class="p">Cholesterol is known for being an essential element in vertebrate cell membranes and an obligatory precursor of steroid hormones, bile acids, and oxysterols [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In different animal species, including birds, increases in dietary cholesterol levels are compensated for by changes in lipid metabolism in the liver, including decreased de novo cholesterol synthesis and/or increased transformation and transportation. These are essential to preserve health status, welfare and productivity [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. For these reasons, dietary changes should affect meat cholesterol content only to a moderate extent. In the literature, it has been observed that the dietary presence of ingredients containing phytosterols in chickensâ€™ diet lowered the cholesterol content of the skeletal muscle as a possible result of the blocked reabsorption of bile acids and cholesterol in the ileum by phytosterols [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, this was not confirmed in the present study, as chicken fed with 100% soybean oil produced breast meat with the same cholesterol content as that obtained from HI100 chickens. Also, animal growth rate was found to be inversely correlated with the cholesterol content of both chicken breast and thigh muscles [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, in the first part of the present study [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] chickens in the three dietary treatments displayed similar daily growth rates and final live weights, thus making it not possible to relate growth to meat cholesterol content. Up to now, no other study has observed a meat cholesterol-lowering effect possibly attributable to an insect-based feed product. The only available results deal with laying poultry species. In laying quails fed with defatted HI larvae meal (10% or 15% inclusion levels), eggs did not display a reduction in their cholesterol content [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] consistent with the fact that most animal species, including birds, have tight cholesterol regulation. In contrast, Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] found that laying hens fed with HI larvae meal as a 100% replacement for soybean meal showed the lowest cholesterol content in the egg yolk. The authors attributed this finding to a reduction in the serum cholesterol level, caused by the chitin content, which should attract negatively-charged bile acids and free FA. However, the latter mechanism cannot explain the present findings in chicken meat as HI larvae fat does not contain chitin.
