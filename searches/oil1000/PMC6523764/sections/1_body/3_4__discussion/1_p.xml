<p class="p">The fat fraction of the HI larvae represents a promising ingredient quantitatively and nutritionally, with possible application in livestock feeding which could alleviate the pressure on conventional overexploited feed sources. For this reason, in some recent research the dietary incorporation of HI larvae fat in juvenile Jian carp [

 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and rabbit [

 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] was studied. Regardless of the animal species, results provided positive outcomes which were consistent with those of the present research, as the overall nutritional composition of the studied animal products remained unaffected by the insect fat-based dietary treatments. Recent findings highlighted that HI larvae can lower lipid deposition in the intraperitoneal fat tissue of Jian carp due to an augmented lipid hydrolysis mediated through the mRNA up-regulation of PPARα, a gene involved in FA synthesis, which decreased adipocytes’ size [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> more rapidly than other long-chain FA, thus being less available to be stored in tissues [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, a similar lowering effect on the lipid deposition related to feeding HI larvae fat to finisher chickens was not observed in the present study, as the lipid content of the breast and leg meat cuts were similar in the three dietary treatments.
