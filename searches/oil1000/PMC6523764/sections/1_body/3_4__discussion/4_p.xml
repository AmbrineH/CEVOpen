<p class="p">The observed enrichment of the breast and leg chicken meat in medium-chain FA with increasing incorporation levels of HI poses, on the one hand, an issue regarding meat healthiness as lauric (C12:0) and myristic (C14:0) FA are well known for their hypercholesterolemic properties [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, it was also demonstrated that diets rich in lauric acid, which was the second most abundant SFA in chicken meat in the present study, have a greater proportional effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) than on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, thus lowering the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol level [

It is also true that the above-mentioned FAs are also physiologically active compounds which are preferentially utilized as an energy source which has been shown to improve energy availability without increasing the deposition of lipids [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The only other published work dealing with the dietary inclusion of HI larvae fat in chickens’ diets as a replacement for soybean oil is that of Schiavone et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] which, however, tested experimental diets from the starter to the finisher phases, thus for the chickens’ whole production cycle. The present and the above-mentioned study showed that, independent of the duration of the dietary treatment, the resulting effects on overall meat quality traits were similar: physical meat quality remained unaffected, as well as the proximate composition of the meat.
