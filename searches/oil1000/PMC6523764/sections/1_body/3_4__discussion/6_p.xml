<p class="p">The observed reduction of both the dietary 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 proportions of the PUFA fraction when increasing HI fat levels directly reflected that of the meat. The reduction was more intense for the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 than for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 FAs, which led to the highest 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 ratio. This pattern found confirmation in the existing literature on chickens [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] but also on rabbits [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Up to now, the research conducted on the use of HI larvae in livestock farming has highlighted that modification of the FA profile of the diets, and thus meat, towards higher saturation of lipids was an issue not limited to the use of the fat fraction of the HI larvae, but also extended to its protein meal. In fact, the dietary inclusion of higher levels of defatted HI protein meal in rainbow trout [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], quail [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and Barbary partridge [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] diets led to significant modifications in the FA profile of their meat, worsening its healthiness overall by increasing and reducing the SFA and the PUFA contents, respectively, as well as increasing the PUFA

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 ratio.
