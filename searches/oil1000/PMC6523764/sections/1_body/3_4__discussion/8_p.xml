<p class="p">The breast meat of chickens fed with increasing levels of HI larvae fat showed a similar sensory profile to the meat of those fed with a conventional soybean oil-based diet. This finding, which is very important for the consumer point of view in accepting the use of this alternative ingredient in animal feed, is supported by previous research considering the sensory profile of meat derived from different animal species fed with HI protein meal. In fact, the sensory traits of quail breasts derived from birds fed either with 10% and 15% defatted HI meal were comparable to those obtained from quails fed with a conventional soybean meal diet [
