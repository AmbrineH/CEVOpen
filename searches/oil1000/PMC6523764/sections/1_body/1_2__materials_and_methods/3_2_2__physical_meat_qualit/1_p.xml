<p class="p">After 2 weeks of frozen storage, all right breasts and legs were weighed, allowed to thaw for 12 h at 4 °C and weighed again to calculate the thawing loss (%). The pH was measured in the cranial and caudal part of the 
 <italic class="italic">Pectoralis major</italic> muscle for the breast, and in the 
 <italic class="italic">Iliotibialis lateralis</italic> muscle for the leg (portable pH meter FG2-Five GoTM; Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland; calibration at pH 4.0 and 7.0). Color measurements were performed on the 
 <italic class="italic">Iliotibialis lateralis</italic> muscle (RM200QC colorimeter; X-Rite Co., Neu-Isenburg, Germany) and considered lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. pH as well as the color values represented the average of two repeated measurements. Legs were then vacuum-sealed using the above-mentioned equipment and cooked in a water bath set at 80 °C, until the core temperature reached 77 °C. Then, samples were cooled in an ice bath, dried and weighed to calculate the cooking and total losses (%).
