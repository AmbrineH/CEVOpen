<p class="p">For the experiment, a total of 15 chicken breasts/treatment were used and 2 days of analysis were scheduled (7 and 8 breasts/treatment/session). After 1 month of frozen storage at −40 °C, chicken breasts were allowed to thaw for 16 h at 4 °C. Each sample was then placed on a cooking plate (model GR6010 XL Health Comfort, 2400 Watt; Rowenta, Erbach, Germany) set at thermostat position ‘2’ and cooked 8 min/side, until the core temperature reached 74 °C. Subsequently, samples were put in aluminum trays and served to the panel in a random sequence. Samples were identified by a random three-digit code. The evaluation sheet, distribution of samples to the judges and data acquisition were performed using FIZZ software package 2.60.4(BIOSYSTEMES FRANCE, St-Ouen l’Aumône, France) installed in eight terminals in the tasting booths of the laboratory. Still water at room temperature and unsalted crackers were available to panelists throughout each sensory session.</p>
