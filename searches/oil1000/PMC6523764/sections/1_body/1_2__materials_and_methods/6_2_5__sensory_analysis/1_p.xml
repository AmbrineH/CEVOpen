<p class="p">Left breast meat samples were subjected to a descriptive sensory analysis, to detect possible differences among the dietary treatments (C vs. HI50 vs. HI100). The sensory analysis was performed by an eight-member trained panel (Istituto per la Qualità e le Tecnologie Agroalimentari, Laboratorio Analisi Sensoriale—Veneto Agricoltura, Thiene, Vicenza, Italy), whose members were qualified as experts according to ISO 8586 and had experience with descriptive tests (ISO 13299) on various food matrices. All judges who perform tests with accredited methods undergo training every three years. Panelists underwent two pre-test training sessions of 1 h each to familiarize them with the matrix and select appropriate descriptors, also drawn from the literature. The panel received a list of descriptors to score on numerical and continuous scales from 0 (the lowest score for each attribute) to 10 (the highest score for each attribute). Olfactory, gustative and textural aspects were evaluated. The descriptors were: chicken odor, chicken flavor, saltiness, unctuosity, acidity, fibrousness, chewiness, juiciness, adhesiveness and toughness. The meat used for the training sessions was that of chicken breasts fed with a conventional diet which was processed, stored, handled and cooked in the same manner of the samples which were used for the subsequent sensory analysis.</p>
