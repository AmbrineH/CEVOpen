<p class="p">A total of 45 chickens from 15 birds/experimental group (3 birds/pen, 5 pens/dietary treatment) were considered for meat quality evaluations. From each slaughtered bird, breasts and legs were excised and analyzed at the Laboratory of the Department of Animal Medicine, Production and Health, MAPS, of the University of Padova (Italy). Each breast was halved, and each half breast was labeled, vacuum-packaged using a CSV-41n ORVED machine (99% vacuum level) in polyethylene bags (water vapor transmission rate: 3.5 ± 1 g/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> day at 23 °C and 85 ± 2% relative humidity) and stored at −40 °C until analysis. The same procedure was adopted for the right and left leg of each chicken. Overall, a total of
