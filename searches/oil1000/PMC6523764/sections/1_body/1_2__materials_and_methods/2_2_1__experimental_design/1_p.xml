<p class="p">For the present experiment, three dietary treatments were tested on chicken broilers (ROSS 708) from 21 to 48 days of age (finisher diet): a basal control diet (C: 100% soybean oil), and two diets with either 50% or 100% replacement of soybean oil with HI larvae fat (HI50 and HI100 groups, respectively). The diet that was fed to day-old chicks up to 21 days of age was a commercial broiler starter diet containing 217 g/kg crude protein and 12.9 MJ/kg metabolizable energy. Detailed information about the chemical composition of the diets, chicken farming conditions and live performance are provided in the study by Schiavone et al. [
