<p class="p">The lipid extraction was performed by Accelerated Solvent Extraction (M-ASE) using different solvents according to the specific matrix: petroleum ether for HI larvae fat, soybean oil and diets, and chloroform:methanol 1:2 for breast and leg meat samples. The FA profile was determined as described by Cullere et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Samples were transmethylated using a methanolic solution of H2SO4 (4%) in order to determine fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A biphasic separation was obtained by adding 0.5 mL of distilled water and 1.5 mL of N-heptane to each sample. FAME were quantified by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC17A), equipped with an Omegawax 250 column (30 m × 0.25 µm × 0.25 µm) and Flame Ionization Detector. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 0.8 mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 260 °C. Peaks were identified based on commercially available FAME mixtures (37-Component FAME Mix, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). The results are expressed as the percentage (%) of total detected FAME. The FA composition of the
