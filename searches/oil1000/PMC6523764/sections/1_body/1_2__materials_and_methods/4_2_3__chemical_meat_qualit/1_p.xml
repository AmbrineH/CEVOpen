<p class="p">After physical evaluations, all right breasts were ground with a Retsch Grindomix GM 200 (7000 g for 10 s); an aliquot of about 20 g/breast was dedicated to the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) analysis, whereas the remaining meat/breast was frozen at −40 °C, freeze-dried and ground again (7000 g for 5 s) to obtain a fine powder which was used to determine: proximate composition, FA profile and cholesterol content. The left legs were thawed for 12 h at 4 °C, deboned and then they were processed following the same procedure described for breast meat samples. The same meat quality evaluations conducted on the right breasts, were performed on the left legs.</p>
