<p class="p">A similar situation to that observed for the MUFA, but even more remarkable, was obtained for the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) fraction, which decreased with increasing substitution levels of soybean oil with HI larvae fat: 36.8 vs. 30.6 vs. 23.4% total FAME for the C, HI50 and HI100 dietary groups, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). This change was mainly due to the C18:2 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 (linoleic acid; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and the C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (Î±-linolenic acid; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Consequently, the substitution of soybean oil with HI larvae fat significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increased the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 ratio: 15.8 vs. 18.0 vs. 21.7 for the C, HI50 and HI100 dietary groups, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Due to the extensive changes in the FA profile of chicken breast meat, the atherogenic index (AI), thrombogenic index (TI) and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (HH) ratios decreased, thus worsening from the C to the HI100 groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Opposite to this, the peroxidability index (PI) decreased in the following manner: 57.3 vs. 51.3 vs. 42.4 for the C, HI50 and HI100 dietary groups, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
