<p class="p">The dietary substitution of soybean oil with HI larvae fat significantly changed the fatty acid (FA) profile of the chicken breast meat (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00140-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Most of the saturated FA (SFA) increased with growing HI larvae fat inclusion levels, and the most affected were lauric acid (C12:0; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), myristic acid (C14:0; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and palmitic acid (C16:0; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0004). Different from most SFA, C20:0 decreased with the increasing the HI larvae fat inclusion level (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0002). As a result, the total SFA incidence significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) differed among treatments (28.8 vs. 36.5 vs. 45.8% of total FAME for C, HI50 and HI100, respectively).
