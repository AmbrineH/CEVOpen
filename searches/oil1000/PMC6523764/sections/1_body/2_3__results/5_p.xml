<p class="p">Different from what was observed for SFA, the monounsaturated FA (MUFA) fraction evidenced an inverse trend when substituting the soybean oil with the HI larvae fat. Despite some minor MUFA increases from the C to the HI100 groups (C14:1 and C16:1; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), C20:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9 and, particularly, C18:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9 (oleic acid) consistently decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) which determined the following MUFA proportions in the three groups: 27.7 &lt; 25.6 &lt; 23.5 5 total FAME for the C, HI50 and HI100 chicken breasts (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0012).
