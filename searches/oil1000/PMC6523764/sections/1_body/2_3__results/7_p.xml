<p class="p">As observed for breast meat, the FA profile of the chicken leg was also significantly affected by the dietary treatments and a similar trend was observed (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00140-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The SFA content increased mainly due to the lauric, myristic and palmitic FA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Conversely, even though C17:0, C18:0 and C20:0 followed the opposite trend (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), their relative contributions were insufficient to counteract the growing pattern of the other SFA (SFA: 28.8 vs. 36.5 vs. 45.8% total FAME for the C, HI50 and HI100 dietary groups, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Despite the oleic acid decrease with the increasing substitution level of soybean oil with HI larvae fat (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), the overall MUFA proportion remained unchanged in the three dietary groups (28.9, 27.5 and 26.1% total FAME for the C, HI50 and HI100 dietary groups, respectively). As observed for the breast meat cut, in the leg meat the PUFA fraction also decreased when chickens’ diets contained HI larvae fat (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 ratio increased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). This result was mainly attributable to the decrease of linoleic and arachidonic (C20:4 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6) FAs, and α-linolenic FA. Consequently, health indexes of FA showed the same trend previously mentioned for the breast, worsening with the increasing HI larvae fat inclusion level.
