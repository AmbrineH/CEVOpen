<p class="p">Chicken breast derived from birds fed with diets containing 0%, 50% or 100% substitution of soybean oil with HI larvae fat, overall showed similar physico-chemical meat quality traits (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00140-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, breasts displayed similar weight, thawing loss and pH (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Also, the proximate composition did not differ among the three experimental groups which showed comparable water, protein, lipids and ash contents. An increasing replacement of soybean oil with HI larvae fat did not affect the oxidative status of the meat as chicken breasts displayed similar TBARs values in the three groups. In contrast, the cholesterol content of the HI50 chicken breasts was significantly lower compared to the C and HI100 groups (59.4 vs. 64.2 and 66.9 mg/100 g meat for the HI50, C and HI100 groups, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0003). This result was not expected since in the HI50 group the HI larvae fat, a cholesterol-rich feedstuff (412.8 mg cholesterol/100 g fat), substituted for only 50% of the soybean oil, whereas the 100% substitution level did not provide the same outcome.
