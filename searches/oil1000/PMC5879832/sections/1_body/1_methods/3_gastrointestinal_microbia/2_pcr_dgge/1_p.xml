<p id="Par42" class="p">Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was carried out on all individual genomic DNA samples and on pooled genomic DNA samples which were from the same exposure group. The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA was amplified as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] (forward primer 341f: 5‘-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’ with a GC-clamp 5′- CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3′ attached at the 5′-end and reverse primer 907r: 5′- CCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3′). Each 50 μL PCR mix was composed of molecular grade water, 5 μL PCR buffer (5 Prime), 0.1 mM of each dNTP’s, 10 pM of each primer, 1 μL of genomic DNA and 0.25 μL of Taq polymerase (5 U/μL, 5 Prime). The PCR program was as follows: initial activation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of: (1) denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, (2) annealing at 55 °C for 40 s and (3) elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. A final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min was also included. The DGGE was carried out on a 6% acrylamide gel containing denaturing agents, urea and formamide, in a gradient of 20–80% prepared by using the IngenyPhorU gradient former. Equal amounts of PCR products were loaded into each well (confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis). The run was performed using an IngenyPhorU (Ingeny International BV, Goes, The Netherlands) system (17 L volume, 1 x TAE as buffer, temperature at 60 °C) at 90 V for 18 h. Bands were visualized using post-staining (GelRed in TAE) for 60 min prior to imaging.
