<p id="Par72" class="p">It is recognized that the GI microbiome plays an essential role in gut health, immune function and nutrient uptake in fish. Although several studies have been investigating the intestinal microflora of various fish species, our current knowledge regarding the roles of gut microbiota in ecotoxicology remains limited. The exposure set-up in our experiment represents a realistic situation of chronic oil pollution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating how exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of crude oil alters the intestinal microbiome of Atlantic cod. Despite the low number of samples, we identified 8 OTUs which were present in different relative abundances among lower and upper exposure groups. OTUs classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonadaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rikenella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> decreased in relative abundance. The only OTU which showed increased relative abundance at higher oil exposure was classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacterales</italic>. Hence, 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacterales</italic> appear to be a potentially interesting microbial indicator of oil exposure in Atlantic cod. Further research with a larger sample number and functional analysis is necessary, in order to understand the implications of such shift and the potential changes of metabolic functions of intestinal microorganisms in response to environmental pollutants.
