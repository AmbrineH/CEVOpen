<p id="Par65" class="p">Following exposure to petrogenic PAHs, a wide range of conjugated oxidation products are accumulated in the bile of Atlantic cod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. In this study, an increased level of PAH metabolites, showing a dose-response pattern, was found in bile samples of oil exposed fish. Bile metabolite measurement is considered as a sensitive tool for assessing exposure to oil and also produced water containing PAHs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Several laboratory and field studies documented significantly elevated bile metabolite levels even at very low exposure concentrations similarly to the experiment presented here. PERMANOVA and NMDS analysis of GC-MS measured PAH metabolite concentrations in fish bile showed a dichotomy between the two lower (0.0 and 0.01 mg/L oil) and the two upper (0.05 and 0.1 mg/L oil) exposure levels. Based on these results, statistical analyses performed on the GI microbial community was done on pooled data, i.e., on data combined into lower and upper exposure groups.
