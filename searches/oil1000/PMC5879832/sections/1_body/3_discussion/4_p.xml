<p id="Par66" class="p">OTU richness with numbers ranging from 133 to 720 OTUs identified in the 12 cod microbiomes were similar to that observed in analysis of 11 specimens of wild-caught Atlantic cod, where the number of OTUs per sample ranged from 40 to 228 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. A significantly higher number of OTUs (1850) were detected in 20 specimens of juvenile Atlantic salmon (salmon parr) at a similar sequencing depth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Despite a relatively long time (28 days) spent under laboratory conditions, Shannon and Inverse Simpson indices varied greatly among individuals. Given the assumption that identical environmental conditions and feeding routines are expected to homogenize GI microbial communities this result was perhaps unexpected. Nevertheless, the ranges were somewhat narrower (Shannon: 0.54–2.30 and Inverse Simpson: 1.31–5.14) when compared to 11 specimens of wild-caught Atlantic cod kept under laboratory conditions for 12 days (Shannon: 0.30–3.07 and Inverse Simpson: 1.09–11.18). Large inter-individual variation in the intestinal microbial composition has been observed in other studies as well [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] including GI microbial communities of a group of identically reared sibling zebrafishes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Based on results emerging from next-generation sequencing studies of fish GI tract microbiota, the idea that each individual harbors a unique microbial ecosystem is being constantly reinforced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Such high inter-individual variability has already raised the question of experimental reproducibility of exposure studies, which may be affected by the influence of highly variable fish associated microflora [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. However, implications of this variability in terms of functional variability of the GI tract microbiome and host-microbiome interactions is yet unknown.
