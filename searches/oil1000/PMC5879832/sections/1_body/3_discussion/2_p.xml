<p id="Par64" class="p">Overall, this study showed that a 28-day exposure to Troll C crude oil at 0.01–0.1 mg/L resulted in no fish death and no significant changes in morphological parameters. This confirmed previous findings where no changes in CI and HSI were observed after 3-weeks exposure to produced water at 0.125% (total PAH 0.102 μg/L) in Atlantic cod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Generally, a high CI and a high HSI indicate good health in fish and HSI in particular is considered the most sensitive growth indicator of fish. Nevertheless, CI can take up to several months prior to showing significant change due to environmental stressors [
