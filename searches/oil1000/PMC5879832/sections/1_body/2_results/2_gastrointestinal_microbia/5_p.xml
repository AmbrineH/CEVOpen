<p id="Par56" class="p">The 994 OTUs classified into 11 phyla with highly variable relative abundances among the cod individuals and treatment levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>]. A single abundant OTU was classified by a different method than the rest of the OTUs as described in an additional file [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>]. The phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> represented 45% (263 OTUs) of the sequences in the 12 cod samples, followed by the phyla 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacteres</italic> (20%, 1 OTU), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> (11%, 186 OTUs) and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacteria</italic> (8%, 45 OTUs). 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> dominated 4 out of 6 GI communities in the lower exposure group and 2 out of 6 in the upper exposure group. The remaining two lower exposure samples, 44 and 45, were dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Tenericutes</italic>, respectively. Phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacterales</italic> had the largest relative abundance in the datasets obtained from the remaining 4 upper exposure samples (49, 50, 57 and 58). 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> were present in relatively high abundance among lower exposure samples and in upper sample 49. 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacteria</italic> showed a similar trend with having high relative abundance in only one upper exposure sample, 59.
