<p id="Par59" class="p">Eight OTUs had significantly different relative abundances between the lower and upper exposure groups according to MetaStats analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This was in agreement with the SIMPER analysis, identifying these as some of the OTUs contributing the most to the observed (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarity between the two exposure groups [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media" class="xref">14</xref>]. Interestingly, the 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacterales</italic> OTU02 was the only OTU with a higher relative abundance in the upper exposure group. In contrast, OTU04, a 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales</italic> belonging to the family 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonadaceae</italic>, was considerably more abundant in individuals from the lower exposure group.
