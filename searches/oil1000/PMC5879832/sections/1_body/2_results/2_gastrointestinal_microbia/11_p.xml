<p id="Par62" class="p">The other two samples from the upper exposure group (48 and 59) clustered together with control samples and the majority of low exposure samples. This was mostly due to the high abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrionales</italic>. This order was indeed significantly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004) with these and most of the samples from the lower exposure group. There was also a significant correlation between abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacteriales</italic> and the lower exposure group samples (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005). Finally, samples 44 and 45 were positioned more peripherally on the CA plot driven by their abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales</italic> (phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic>, sample 44) and 
 <italic class="italic">Mycoplasmatales</italic> (phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Tenericutes</italic>, sample 45), respectively.
