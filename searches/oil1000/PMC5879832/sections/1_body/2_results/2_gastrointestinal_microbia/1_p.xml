<p id="Par52" class="p">Three individual fish were randomly selected from each exposure group for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene-based community composition analysis. First, bacterial community compositions were compared by PCR-DGGE. This first screening showed that there were large variations among individuals as shown by discrete band patterns (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). However, some bands were clearly present in all samples. There was also clear distinction between the band patterns of the pooled samples of lower and upper oil exposure groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). One band (#1 on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) in particular appeared to be more dominant in the upper exposure group while two other bands (#2 and #3 on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) were less dominant in comparison to the lower exposure group.
