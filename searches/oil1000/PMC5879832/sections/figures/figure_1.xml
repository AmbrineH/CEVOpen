  <p class="p">Differences in oil exposure levels in Atlantic cod. Oil exposure was assessed by multivariate analysis of PAH metabolite concentrations using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The analysis is based on standardized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolite levels in fish bile, generated using Euclidean distances between samples. Fish subjected to the same oil exposure level are coloured identically. Ctrl = control, Low = low oil concentration, Med = medium oil concentration, High = high oil concentration. Numbers indicate sample (individual fish) numbers</p>
