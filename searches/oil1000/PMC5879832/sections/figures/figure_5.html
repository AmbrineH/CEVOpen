 <p> Log abundance of bacterial orders in two exposure groups of Atlantic cod. Black asterisks denote statistical significance as determined by MetaStats ( p &lt; 0.05). The grey asterisks represent orders that in a Wilcoxon rank-sum test have a p-value &lt; 0.05 but is still above the Bonferroni corrected p-value (0.0045). Numbers in parentheses denote the number of OTUs in the corresponding order. All samples have been normalized to the same number of reads by common scaling </p>
