<p class="p">We demonstrate experimentally that resin type operates a strong control on the decay of fruit flies: over identical time periods, flies in 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nobilis</italic> resin retained anatomical details including non-cuticular internal features, whereas flies in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> showed poor preservation or loss of most features, including cuticle. This suggests that resin type does impart a preservational bias in the amber fossil record. This is the first, but important, step in developing a more complete understanding of the resin-type bias in the amber fossil record. To add to this we need to determine which specific characteristics of these two resins were responsible for the differences in decay. Then, different ambers could be assessed on the basis of these characteristics to determine how successfully they could inhibit the decay of labile tissues or organisms.
