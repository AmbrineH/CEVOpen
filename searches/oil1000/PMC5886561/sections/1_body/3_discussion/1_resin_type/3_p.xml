<p class="p">In essential oils, phenolic compounds such as thymol and carvacrol are considered to be key compounds for robust antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. These compounds in isolation show strong antibacterial properties, and are effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]; they are also often enriched in essential oils that have strong antibacterial effects [

 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Carvacrol is one of the 23 compounds that differ between

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> resin but not in 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nobilis</italic> resin, which seems to suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> resin is more effective at inhibiting gut bacteria activity than 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nobilis</italic> resin. However, carvacrol only makes up 0.07% of the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> resin, whereas it is a major component of antibacterial essential oils (e.g. it makes up 81.4% of thyme essential oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]) and its antibacterial effects in isolation have been tested at 100% concentration. Therefore, the presence of trace amounts of carvacrol in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> resin is unlikely to be significant for decay inhibition.
