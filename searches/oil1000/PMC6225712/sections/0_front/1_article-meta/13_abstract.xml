  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">The current study was conducted to evaluate the protective effect of 
   <italic class="italic">Lavandula stoechas</italic> essential oils (LSEO) against malathion (M) exposure-caused reprotoxicity in male mice as well as the possible mechanisms implicated in such protection.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Six–eight-week-old male mice weighting 25–30 g were used and divided into four groups: normal-control, LSEO (50 mg/kg, b.w.), malathion (200 mg/kg, b.w.) and malathion + LSEO treated mice. Malathion was emulsioned in corn oil and 
   <italic class="italic">per orally</italic> administered for 30 days. LSEO was daily administrated during the same period. LSEO chemical identification was done by Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Reproduction-damages and LSEO-benefits were assessed using histopathological, biochemical and steroidogenesis gene expression disruptions and improvements.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">The GC-MS analysis, allowed to the identification of 25 bioactive compounds in MCEO. In vivo, we firstly found that malathion exposure induced a clear reprotoxicity as assessed by a significant-decrease (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) of testis/epididymis relative weights, serum testosterone level and reproductive performance. Malathion also produced lipoperoxidation, thiol (-SH) groups decrease as well as a significant-depletion (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) of antioxidant enzyme activities such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD in testis and epididymis. The histopathological examination showed marked change in both studied tissues. All these biochemical and structural changes were significantly (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) corrected by LSEO co-administration. More importantly, malathion exposure remarkably (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) down-regulated the expression of StAR gene as well as, the mRNA levels of P450scc, 3ßHSD and 17ß-HSD, while LSEO-administration strangely protected against steroidogenesis disruption.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">The potential protective effects of LSEO against malathion-induced reprotoxicity and oxidative stress might be partially to its antioxidant properties as well as its opposite effect against some gene expression involved in the steroidogenesis.</p>
