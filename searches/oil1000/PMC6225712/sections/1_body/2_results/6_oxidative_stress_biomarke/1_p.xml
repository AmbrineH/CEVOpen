<p id="Par48" class="p">To assess the effect of the organophosphorus compound and essential-oils on oxidative stress situation, the some antioxidant biomarkers were evaluated in the different groups. Results showed that oxidative-stress induced by malathion-treatment is explained by a significant increase (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) of lipoperoxydation in testis and epididymis, hydrogen peroxide production (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) as well as a decrease (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) of thiol groups content (Tables

 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>). However, the treatment of animals with LSEO protects against all these alterations caused by malathion-intoxication. On another hand, we examined the antioxidant-enzyme-activities in testis and epididymis (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table" class="xref">11</xref>). As expected, malathion-intoxication induced a significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduce of CAT, GPx, total SOD and SOD isoforms such as Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities. The sub-chronic co-administration of LSEO markedly (P &lt; 0.05) protected against the depletion of testis/epididymis antioxidant enzyme activities induced by malathion exposure during 30 days.
