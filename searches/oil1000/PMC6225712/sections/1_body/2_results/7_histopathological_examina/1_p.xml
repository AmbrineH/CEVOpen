 <bold class="bold">.</bold> Testis of undamaged control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>) showed regular seminiferous tubules lined with germinal epithelial layer. Different types of spermatogenic, cells appeared in their ordinary form with: spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and mature spermatozoa. Sertoli and Leydig cells with standard form were observed. Leydig cells and blood vessels were found in the interstitial connective tissues between the seminiferous tubules, and the tubules which appeared with regular size and shape. Malathion exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>) caused necrosis, deterioration, diminishing the number of spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules, unscrambling of cells from basal region of seminiferous tubules and loss the Leydig cells in interstitial tissue. LSEO Co-administrated to malathion protected and recovered the damages of testicular tissues, induced by the malathion intoxication. On the other hand, concerning the histomorphology of epididymis, we showed that malathion exposure caused a loss of sperm from the lumen of epididymis as well as the disintegration of basal membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>), whereas the co-treatment with LSEO restored the architecture of epididymis as evidenced by the accumulation of sperm in the centre of lumen and the regeneration of lining cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">d</xref>).
