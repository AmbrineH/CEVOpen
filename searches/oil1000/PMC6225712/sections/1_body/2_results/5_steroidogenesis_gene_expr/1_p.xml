<p id="Par47" class="p">We further looked at the effect of malathion (200 mg kg, b.w.) exposure during 30 days on StAR protein gene-expression responsible for cholesterol transport as well as steroidogenic enzymes P450scc, 3ßHSD, and 17ß-HSD. The expression levels were normalized by β-actin expression detected in the same PCR reaction, and these values were compared with those of the control group. As expected, there was no change in the expression of β-actin in control and treated groups. However, malathion exposure caused a singnificant-decrease (
