<p id="Par29" class="p">Initial (weight at the starting point) and final (weight at the end point) body weights were recorded. Testis and epididymis were stripped from fatty tissues and blood vessels, blotted, and their absolute weights were determined. Clinical signs of body and reproductive organs were evaluated for toxicological criteria. To normalize the data for statistical analysis and to obtain relative weight, data were expressed per 100Â g body weight.</p>
