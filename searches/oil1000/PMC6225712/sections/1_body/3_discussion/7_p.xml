<p id="Par56" class="p">On the other hand, 3ß-HSD and 17ß-HSD, enzymes which can play a crucial role in testosterone biosynthesis. 3ß-HSD convert’s pregnenolone to progesterone, 17 hydroxypregnenolone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to androstenedione, 17 ßHSD transformed androstenedione to testosterone in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. A singnificant reduction of activity and expression these enzymes were also noted in malathion-treated mice compared to control group. In part, this reduction of 3ß-HSD and 17ß-HSD gene expression indicates a possible role of these genes to reduce testosterone level in male mice following malathion exposure, and in the other part, may be due also to the diminished expression of StAR. [
