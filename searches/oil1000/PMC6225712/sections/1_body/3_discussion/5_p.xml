 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>] demonstrated that dimethoate can inhibit steroidogenesis by blocking transcription of the StAR gene in MA-10 Leydig mouse tumor cells, thereby highlighting the sensitivity of StAR to environmental pollutants. In addition, Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] have demonstrated that the administration of cypermethrin during puberty has resulted in a disruption of testosterone synthesis by setting down the expression of the StAR gene. However, the overproduction of ROS observed on the malathion group causes mitochondrial membrane damage with a consequent imbalance in the level of StAR mRNA expression, inducing a reduction in cholesterol transport and testicular steroid formation in mice. In addition, the transport of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane, the primary step of steroidogenesis, performed by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), is the mainly essential step in steroidogenesis [
