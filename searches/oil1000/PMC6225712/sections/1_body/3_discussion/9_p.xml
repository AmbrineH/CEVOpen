 <sup class="sup">Â°</sup>), which is the major cause of lipid peroxidation. However, its well known that sperm cells membranes are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and are very susceptible to free radical attack. Lipid peroxidation of sperm cell membranes is one type of cell damage induced by ROS, which causes an increase in membrane permeability, a disruption in respiratory chain and ATP production, as well as a decrease in phosphorylation of axonemal proteins. Malathion induced a decrease of the sperm quality might be due to the lessening of antioxidant enzyme activities and/or ROS accumulation. Free radical-induced sperm motility decrease was most probably due to a rapid loss of intracellular ATP, which altered axoneme arrangement and caused tail deformity [
