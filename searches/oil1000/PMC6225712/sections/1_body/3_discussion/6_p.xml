Fauser, showed the decrease in the level of P450scc can be attributed to a depletion of cholesterol availability that is due to a reduced level of FSH and LH [

Recent studies in rats suggest that exposure to deltamethrin decreases steroidogenesis by directly inhibiting the expression of StAR and P450scc enzyme [
