<p id="Par50" class="p">Firstly, the chemical analysis using GC-MS technique allowed to the identification of 22 compounds. In vivo part study, we showed that the subchronic-exposure to malathion leads to a significant decline of testis/epididymis relative weights indicating a testicular deterioration. Added to that, our results showed a marked decrease in serum testosterone levels in male mice after chemical intoxication. These alterations were accompanied with a concomitant decrease in the mRNA level of the genes involved in the transport and transfer of cholesterol and steroidogenesis, including that of the StAR protein, P450scc, 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD, was observed in contrast to an increase in the total cholesterol level of the same group. More importantly, we showed in this study, a significative-diminution in mRNA expression of StAR, P450scc, 3ßHSD, and 17ß-HSD was detected after malathion-exposure, while, LSEO co-administration extensively ameliorated the mRNA expression of studied genes. We also studied the effect of coadministration of malathion and LSEO on oxidative stress parameters. In this context, we showed that malathion-administration induced oxidative stress as assessed by an increase of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide level, a decrease of sulfhydrils content, as well as a depletion of antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT, GPx, total SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and Fe-SOD in testis and epididymis. All these alterations were associated with histopathological changes in both reproductive-organs.</p>
