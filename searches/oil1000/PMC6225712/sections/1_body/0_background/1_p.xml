As spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis are dependent upon the maintenance of adequate levels of testosterone and cholesterol, the ability of malathion to reduce their levels may contribute to the reduction of male mice reproductive capability [

However, various naturally occurring compounds are largely used to protect against reproductive damage and many pathways complications in both the experimental and medical situations. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a program for the use of traditional herbal medicines in the treatment of diverse diseases difficulties and complications [
