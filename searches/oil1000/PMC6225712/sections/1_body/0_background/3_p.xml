Therefore, in the current study we intended to investigate the action of a sub-chronic exposure of male mice to malathion on Leydig cell steroidogenesis, free radicals production as well as StAR, P450 scc, 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD genes expression. In addition, this study aims also to investigate the protective effect of
