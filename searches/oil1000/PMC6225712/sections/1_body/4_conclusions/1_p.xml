<p id="Par60" class="p">We have evidently established that LSEO protect in opposition to malathion-induced steroidogenesis disruptions and oxidative stress in the reproductive function. This repro-protection offered by LSEO may be correlated in part to its antioxidant properties. This research supports the therapeutic potential of LSEO for prevention/treatment of reproductive-toxicity and should be further explored in clinical studies.</p>
