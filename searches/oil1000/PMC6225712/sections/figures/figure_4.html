 <p> Determination of spermatic DNA decompaction by flow cytometry using chromomycine A3 (CMA3) as a probe. a Chart type obtained with the cytometer shows the dispersion of the cells according to their fluorescence (FL3) and size (FSC). The fluorescence threshold is indicated, the red dots placed above this threshold represent the fluorescent cells. b The percentage of fluorescent sperm is then determined by the software and averages are calculated is presented as a histogram ( n = 6). ** P &lt; 0.01 Control vs Malathion </p>
