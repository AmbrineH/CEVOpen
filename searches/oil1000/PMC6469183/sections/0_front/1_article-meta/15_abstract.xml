 <p class="p">The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition, antioxidant potential, and the cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of the plant species 
  <italic class="italic">Tithonia diversifolia</italic> (Hemsl) A. Gray. The essential oil obtained was used to identify the chemical compounds present through the techniques of GC-MS and NMR. The antioxidant potential was calculated by the sequestration method of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. For cytotoxic activity, the larval mortality of 
  <italic class="italic">Artemia salina</italic> was evaluated. The main chemical constituents identified are 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>pinene (9.9%), Limonene (5.40%), 
  <italic class="italic">(Z)</italic>-
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene (4.02%), 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (3.0%), Piperitone (11.72%), 
  <italic class="italic">(E)</italic>-nerolidol (3.78%) and Spathulenol (10.8%). In the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity, bacterial strains of 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> were used. The results showed that the bacterium 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were more susceptible to the presence of the essential oil, presenting minimal inhibitory concentration at the concentrations that were exposed. The essential oil presented antioxidant activity of 54.6% at the concentration of 5 mg·mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and provided a CI
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 4.30. It was observed that the essential oil of this species was highly toxic against 
  <italic class="italic">A. salina</italic> lavas, as its cytotoxic activity showed an LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 3.11. Thus, it is concluded that 
  <italic class="italic">T. diversifolia</italic> oils are effective in inhibiting bacterial growth and reducing oxidative stress.
