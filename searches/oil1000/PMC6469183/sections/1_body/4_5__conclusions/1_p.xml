<p class="p">The study based on the essential oil of the species 
 <italic class="italic">Tithonia diversifolia</italic> allowed the determination of antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. The main compounds found in the essential oils of this study were 
 <italic class="italic">α-</italic>pinene (9.9%), Limonene (5.40%), 
 <italic class="italic">(Z)</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene (4.02%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (3.0%), Piperitone (11.72%), 
 <italic class="italic">(E)</italic>-nerolidol (3.78%) and Spathulenol (10.8%). The antioxidant activity proves that the essential oil of this species has antioxidant action, through the DPPH radical capture method, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 4.30. Its toxicity was elevated with LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 3.11 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. For the antimicrobial activity, the samples presented promising results against the bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> with inhibition of bacterial growth.
