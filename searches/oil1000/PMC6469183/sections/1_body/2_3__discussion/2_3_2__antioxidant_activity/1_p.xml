<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was performed by the DPPH radical capture method (or DPPH consumption). This methodology consists of absorbance reading through a Spectrophotometer, the higher the absorbance values, the greater the antioxidant activity. The determination of the antioxidant activity was carried out using the DPPH free radical capture method, however, it is known that the essential oils are complex mixtures and it is difficult to attribute certain biological activities. In the present assay, the elimination of the radical was shown to be low. The aspect presented was still slightly purple. The antioxidant activity is directly related to the free radical consumption. The higher this consumption, the greater the activity and the lower the inhibitory concentration, in this case the IC 50 [
