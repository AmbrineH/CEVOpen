<p class="p">A serial dilution of well A1 to well A12 was performed. Then, 50 μL of the 0.5 turbid inoculum was added to each well, which on the McFarland nephelometric scale is equivalent to 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL in Mueller-Hinton culture medium. The microplates were placed in an oven for 24 h at 35 ± 2 °C.</p>
