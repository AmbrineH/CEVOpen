<p class="p">For the determination of Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), Petri dishes containing Mueller-Hinton agar environment were used with the aid of a sterile bacteriological loop, which was inoculated with 10 μL of the suspension contained in the wells that showed no visual growth during experimental MIC. The plates were housed at 35 °C ± 2, MBC was established as the lowest concentration of test substances capable of completely inhibiting the microbial growth in Petri dishes after 24 h of growth.</p>
