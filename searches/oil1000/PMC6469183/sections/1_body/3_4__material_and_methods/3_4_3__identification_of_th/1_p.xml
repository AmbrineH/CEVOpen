<p class="p">The analysis of the essential oil was carried out by Gas Chromatography coupled to the Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) of the Federal University of São Carlos—UFSCar. The Shimadzu equipment, CGEM-SHIMADZU QP 5000, was used. A molten silica capillary column (OPTIMA®-5-0.25 μm), 30 m long and 0.25 mm internal diameter and nitrogen as carrier gas, was used. The operating conditions of the gas chromatograph were: Internal column pressure 67.5 kPa, division ratio 1:20, the gas flow in the column 1.2 mL/min. (210 °C), injector temperature 260 °C, temperature detector or interface (GC-MS) of 280 °C. The initial column temperature was 50 °C, followed by an increase of 6 °C/min. up to 260 °C, this was held constant for 30 min. The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings at intervals of 29–400 Da, 0.5 s with ionization energy of 70 eV.</p>
