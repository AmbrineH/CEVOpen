<p class="p">Performing the in vitro tests, a stock solution containing 0.06 g of the essential oil, 28.5 mL of the solution of synthetic sea salt and 1.5 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added. The nauplii were selected and divided into 7 groups with 10 individuals in each test tube. In each group, an aliquot of stock solution was added and the volume was filled to 5 mL with a solution of synthetic sea salt to obtain final solutions with the following concentrations: 1250; 1000; 500; 250; 100; 50 e 10 μg·mL
