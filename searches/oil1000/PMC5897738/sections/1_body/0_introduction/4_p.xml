<p class="p">Although several studies on the bioactivities of RC are available, the majority of these studies were carried out using the essential oil, which is not used medicinally, or the observed activities are not related to the traditional use of the plant. Several studies demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of RC essential oil against different bacterial and fungal strains (
