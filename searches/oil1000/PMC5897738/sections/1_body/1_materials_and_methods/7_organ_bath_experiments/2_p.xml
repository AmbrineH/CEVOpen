<p class="p">The guinea pig ileum is a preparation of a low spontaneous tone. In part of the experiments the effects of RC extract, its fractions, essential oil, or flavonoids were studied at basal tone. All experiments commenced with determining the maximal longitudinal spasm by adding histamine (10 Î¼M) to the organ bath for 2 min. This response served as reference for determining the relative amplitude of any contractile effect that the samples to be tested might have had.</p>
