<p class="p">Smooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organ bath arrangement. The preparations were suspended in Krebs–Henseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37°C, and aerated with a mixture of 95% O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The solution contained 119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO
 <sub class="sub">3,</sub> 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 1.2 mM KH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and 11 mM glucose (pH = 7.4). Movements of the preparations were recorded with isotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus, March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personal computer.
