<p class="p">The contraction of guinea pig bladder in response to the RC extract proved to be special, in that it was reduced by half following 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> capsaicin pretreatment. This indicates that capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of the bladder wall are in some way involved in the excitatory effect of the RC extract (see 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barth√≥ et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the RC extract and oil also induced bladder relaxation in pre-contracted preparations.
