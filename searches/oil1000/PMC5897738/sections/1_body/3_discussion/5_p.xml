<p class="p">Different RC extract fractions evoked both contraction and relaxation on guinea pig ileum. While there was a clear-cut tendency correlation between the flavonoid content and the relaxant effect, in case of contractile action such correlation was not observed (on the contrary, fractions with lower flavonoid content exerted slightly higher contractile activities). Fractions with high flavonoid content (F60, F80, and F100) had remarkable relaxant effects, whereas fractions with no (F20) or low (F40) flavonoid content exerted no such activity. The pure flavonoids of the extract showed dual effects in the guinea pig ileum, much similarly to the crude extract. Moreover, there was no substantial difference between the potencies of the flavonoids. This means that any of these flavonoids may contribute to the sustained relaxant and the transient contractile effect of the extract. The essential oil of RC caused no contraction on the test preparations; nevertheless, a consistent relaxant effect was detected. This seems to indicate that (i) chemical components responsible for the stimulant effect may be absent in the essential oil; (ii) it may be that several types of compounds present in the extract are responsible for the smooth muscle-relaxant action. This point needs to be clarified in subsequent experiments.</p>
