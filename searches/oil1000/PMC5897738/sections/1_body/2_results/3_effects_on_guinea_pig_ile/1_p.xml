<p class="p">The crude RC extract induced a transient longitudinal contraction on guinea pig ileum preparations (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). The amplitudes of the contractions were related to the maximal longitudinal spasm evoked with 10 μM of histamine at the beginning of the experiments. The threshold concentration for this effect was equal to or below 20 μg/ml of the extract (which was the lowest concentration tested) and reached a plateau with 60 and 200 μg/ml. Quantitative results were as follows (expressed as % of the maximal spasm): 18.8 ± 3.1% at 20 μg/ml (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 6), 40.1 ± 3.3% at 60 μg/ml (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 11), and 36.3 ± 4.9% at 200 μg/ml (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 7). A second administration of the same concentration after a 40-min washout period usually had a qualitatively similar effect. Yet, because of variable reproducibility, we examined the effects on separate preparations with only one administration of the extract. The solvent of the extract (DMSO; 0.3 or 1 μl/ml) caused no or minimal contraction (on average, 0 and 2%, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 12).
