<p class="p">On histamine-precontracted, atropine- and tetrodotoxin-treated ileum, different fractions of RC extract showed distinct relaxant effects (

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </bold>). F20 and F40 (60 or 200 μg/ml) practically produced no relaxation (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5 for both concentrations). This observation refers to the potential role of flavonoids in the relaxant effect, and experiments with four flavonoids isolated from the plant material reassured this hypothesis. All the flavonoids exerted a dual effect on the guinea pig ileum, i.e., a short-lived contraction at basal tone and a long-lasting relaxation on the histamine-pre-contracted, atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreated preparations (

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </bold>). At a concentration of 1 μM, the flavonoids did not exert contractile activities, however, at 10 μM, a slight effect (34.6 ± 7.4% for hispidulin, 32.0 ± 3.1% for luteolin, 27.1 ± 4.2% for eupafolin, and 20.5 ± 5.1% for apigenin, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5 each) was observed. The relaxant activities at 2 μM ranged between 18.2 ± 5.4% and 24.2 ± 3.7%, whereas at 20 μM between 64.5 ± 4.1% and 81.9 ± 5.3%.
