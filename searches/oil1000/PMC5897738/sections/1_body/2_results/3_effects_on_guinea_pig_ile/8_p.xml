<p class="p">Papaverine was used as positive control. As with other experiments for studying relaxation, the drug was administered to histamine-precontracted, atropine- and tetrodotoxin-treated ileum preparations, in a non-cumulative manner. The relaxant responses obtained were as follows, 0.3 μM: 19.7 ± 4.7% (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 6); 1 μM: 29.1 ± 3.5% (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 6); 3 μM: 30.1 ± 4.8% (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 7); 10 μM: 92.9 ± 4.2% (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 6), where, as also elsewhere in this paper, relaxation to the pre-histamine baseline was taken as 100%.
