<p class="p">Based on their retention times and mass spectrometric data, methallyl angelate, 3-methyl pentyl angelate, and 3-methylamyl isobutyrate were identified as the major constituents of RC essential oil (19.0, 18.2, and 10.4%, respectively) (

 </bold>). The identified components comprised 97% of the essential oil. Previous articles reported isobutyl angelate as the major constituent of RC essential oil (21.6–38.5%), followed by 2-methylbutyl angelate (11.6–20.3%) (
