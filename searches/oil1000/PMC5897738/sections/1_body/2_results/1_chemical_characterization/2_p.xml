<p class="p">The crude RC extract contained eupafolin as the main flavonoid, followed by luteolin, hispidulin, and apigenin (

 </bold>). The fractionation on polyamide resulted in subfractions F20â€“F100 with different compositions, as demonstrated by the differences in their flavonoid content. In F20, the quantities of flavonoids were below the level of quantification. The flavonoid content of the fractions increased with increasing MeOH content of the eluting solvent. The highest flavonoid levels were measured in F80, except for luteolin and apigenin, which were mainly concentrated in F100.
