<p class="p">The relaxant effect of RC essential oil was confirmed on longitudinally oriented preparations of the rat gastrointestinal tract. Rat whole ileum and distal colon preparations are characterized by high intrinsic tone, therefore no pre-contraction was needed. RC oil (10 μg/ml) induced relaxation (41.4 ± 7.4% and 21.8 ± 3.7%, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 7 and 10, respectively, on these preparations, where 100% means the relaxant response to 3 μM isoprenaline, given at the end of the experiment). A concentration of 1 μg/ml was barely effective. No contractile effect was observed. Rat stomach fundus strips were pre-contracted with 0.1–0.3 μM acetylcholine. RC oil produced relaxation (on average 44 and 70.3% relaxation in response to concentrations of 1 and 10 μl/ml, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 4 each, where 100% means relaxation to the pre-acetylcholine level).
