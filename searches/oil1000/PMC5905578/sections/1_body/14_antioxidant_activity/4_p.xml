<p class="p">Considering 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies, there were only three different studies found until 2014 for the validation of 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> experimental results, using the essential oil and carnosic acid. These studies were performed using Wistar rats, and evaluated the catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide synthase activities, as well as lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species, in brain and heart tissues after diet supplementation with rosemary essential oil. This resulted in the decrease of oxidative stress, since dietary rosemary has the potential to quench free radicals, inhibit lipid peroxidation and improve the antioxidant status in rat tissues [
