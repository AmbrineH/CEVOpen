<p class="p">However, a major limitation on the use of plants in the phytopharmaceutical area is the lack consistency in the levels of compounds present in the extract due to natural variability, leading to inconsistent results upon scientific validation [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Also, a major limitation is the lack of reproducibility of the activity by more than 40%, when using plant extracts, as the activity detected often do not occur when the samples are re-extracted [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27–28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This problem is largely due to differences in the biochemical profiles of plants harvested at different times and locations, variations in the same genus plant and variations in the methods used for the extraction and determination of biological activity [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32–33</xref>].
