<p class="p">Standardization defined as the normalization of a sample that can have a minimal amount of one or more compounds is yet another setback [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, phytotherapy rarely satisfies the standardization norms [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This is mainly due to the lack of information about pharmacologically active compounds, and to the plants not being grown in a controlled environment [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The variability of the content and concentration of constituents in a plant, together with the various extraction and processing techniques used by different manufacturers, lead to variability in the content and quality of marketed PBM [
