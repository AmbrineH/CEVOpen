<p class="p">The analysis of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> was performed by GC–MS (Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry) in a model 6850 chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer model 5975C, Agilent Technologies. The analysis was performed using a HP–5MS column Agilent Technologies, which had a length of 30 m, internal diameter of 0.25 mm and film of 0.25 microns. The type of injection was split, and the volume of sample used was 1 μL. The separation conditions were as follows: an initial temperature of 70 °C for two min followed by two increasing heating ramps. The first increasing heart ramp was at 20 °C per min up to 230 °C, while the second was in ramp at 8 °C per min up to 280 °C and held for five min, using a carrier gas of Helium. The total analysis time was 21.25 min. The detected mass range was 35–750 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>, the sample was ionized by electron impact at 70 eV, and the temperature reached by the ionization source was 230 °C. The identification of the compounds was carried out by comparison with the database version 8.0 NIST library.
