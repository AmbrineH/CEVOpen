<p class="p">A tube for at least one of each concentration to test (preferably the correspondent concentrations to MFC, MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and MIC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub>), were prepared with samples taken at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. A tube without extracts served as the development control. The inoculum with approximately 1 Ã— 105 yeast/mL was prepared in a test tube with 10 mL of Sabouraud broth (this fungal concentration is achieved within 48 h of incubation).
