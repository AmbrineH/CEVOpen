<p class="p">For quantitative assays, the broth dilution technique was used. An inoculum (4 µL) of 48 h growth was used. This inoculum was placed into microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) with 396 µL of Sabouraud broth. A total of 4 µL of Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (0.01%

A total of 130 µL of this solution, was then taken and placed in microcentrifuge tubes with a smaller capacity (0.6 mL). This was performed in triplicate. After the mixtures with the oil and pure compounds were incubated at 36 °C for 24 h, a sample was taken and grown in the petri dish for counting Colony Forming Units (CFU). Furthermore, 24 h after the concentration of Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC), Fungicidal concentration at 75% (MIC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) and Fungicidal concentration at 25% (MIC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub>) were determined in mg/mL.
