 <xref rid="B45-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The microorganisms were cultured at 36 °C for 48 h in 10 mL of Sabouraud broth (Difco, Tlalnepantla, Estado de Mexico, Mexico). Cultures were adjusted to turbidity comparable with that of McFarland no. 0.5 standard with sterile saline solution. Petri dishes containing PDA agar (Bioxon, Tlalnepantla, Estado de Mexico, Mexico) were impregnated with these microbial suspensions. Filter paper disks (Whatman No. 5) with a diameter of 5 mm were impregnated either with 5 μL of the essential oil, α-Pinene (5 μL) or γ-Terpinene (5 μL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Disks impregnated with Nystatin (25 μg) were used as positive controls. The plates were incubated overnight at 36 °C, and the diameter of growth inhibition zones (mm) was measured. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.
