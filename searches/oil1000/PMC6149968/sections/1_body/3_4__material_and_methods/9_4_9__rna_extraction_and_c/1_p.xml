<p class="p">Total RNA was isolated from suspensions with 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> yeast/mL containing different concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> essential oil. This was prepared as explained above using the AllPrep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s operating instructions for yeast cells. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was removed from purified RNA by using TURBO DNAse (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis at 80 V for 40 min and concentration was measured for purity estimation using the fluorometer (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> III Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) with oligo-dT.
