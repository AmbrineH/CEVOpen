<p class="p">Synthesized cDNA was used to amplify 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> INT1 gene with the primers and conditions established by Lim and Li [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. B-actin was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the expression [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The level expression of INT1 gene was calculated according to E = Peff(−ΔCt), where Peff is the primer efficiency calculated using LinRegPCR [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Fold changes were calculated between the ratio expressions of all conditions analyzed for two biological replicates.
