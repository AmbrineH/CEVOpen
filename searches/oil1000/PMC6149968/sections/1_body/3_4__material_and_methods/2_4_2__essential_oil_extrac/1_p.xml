<p class="p">Essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> was obtained by the hydro-distillation method. The distillation equipment consisted of a round-bottomed flask of 1000 mL with a heating mantle (SEV-Prendo, MC301-9, Mexico City, Mexico) which was attached to a double pass condenser (designed by the Laboratory of Pharmacognosy at the FES Iztacala, UNAM, Tlalnepantla, Estado de Mexico, Mexico). This condenser was coupled to a cold-water circulator with controlled temperature. The essential oil was separated from the aqueous phase by density differences.
