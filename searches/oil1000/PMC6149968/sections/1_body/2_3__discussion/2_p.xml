As the lipophilic character of the membrane allows it to expand, this can result in increased membrane fluidity and permeability, disturbance of membrane-embedded proteins, inhibition of respiration, and alteration of ion transport processes [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The α-Pinene has been demonstrated to act on cell integrity, inhibiting respiration and ion transport processes, in addition to increasing membrane permeability in

On the other hand, the compounds making up a larger proportion of the essential oil are not necessarily responsible for the majority of the total activity. Therefore, this activity could be attributed to the presence of minor components, such as α-Pinene and β-Pinene (2.85% and 2.30%).
