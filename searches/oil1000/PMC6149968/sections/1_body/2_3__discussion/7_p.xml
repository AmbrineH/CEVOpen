<p class="p">qRT-PCR allowed us to show the effect of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> on the expression of INT1, compared to different concentrations of pure compounds (α-Pinene and γ-Terpinene). After 24 h of interactions, we observed that the expression of the INT1 was drastically inhibited in the samples treated with the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic>. There were significant differences in the results of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> and the pure compounds. These results suggest a possible synergism between the compounds that constitute the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic>. Nevertheless, we must emphasizes that the essential oil alters the expression of the gene that codifies the integrin INT1p. This is very important since the integrins are known to be important in the adhesion of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. It has been mentioned that INT1p is an integrin involved in the adhesion of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> to the host epithelial tissue [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Strains of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> with knock-out INT1 genes are unable to adhere [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This is another possible mechanism of action of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic>.
