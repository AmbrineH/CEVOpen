The integrity of cell membrane was lost using the concentration of 10 mg/mL of essential oil, propidium iodide is able to be inserted in the genetic material, which suggests that the essential oil also damages the cell membrane. Furthermore, it is known that the essential oils have the ability to damage the membrane mitochondrial [
