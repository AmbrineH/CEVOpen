 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-02095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For this reason, we evaluated the capacity of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> to affect the expression of the gene INT1 of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02095-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows the relative expression analysis of the gene INT1 by qRT-PCR. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> inhibits the expression of INT1, at the MIC
 <sub class="sub">12.5</sub>, at which point there was 10% of the expression. With regards to both pure compounds used at different concentrations, 30â€“45% expression was observed, which means that the combination of these compounds in the essential oil, increases the independent effect on INT1 expression levels.
