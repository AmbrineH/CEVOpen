 <p class="p">The candidiasis caused by 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> is a public health problem. The abuse of antifungals has contributed to the development of resistance. 
  <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> has demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activities. In this work the activity of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> was evaluated and for its two pure compounds with analysis of the different mechanisms of pathogenesis important for 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. The essential oil was obtained by the hydro-distillation method and analyzed using GC–MS. The anti-
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> activity was compared between to essential oil, α-Pinene and γ-Terpinene. GC–MS of the essential oil demonstrated the presence of 13 compounds. The essential oil showed antifungal activity against four 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains. The most sensitive strain was 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 14065 (MFC 2.0 mg/mL and MIC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.125 mg/mL) with α-Pinene and γ-Terpinene having MFCs of 4.0 and 16.0 mg/mL respectively. The essential oil inhibited the growth of the germ tube in 87.94% (8.0 mg/mL). Furthermore, it was observed that the essential oil diminishes the transcription of the gene INT1. This work provides evidence that confirms the anti-
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> activity of the 
  <italic class="italic">B. morelensis</italic> essential oil and its effect on the growth of the germ tube and transcription of the gene INT1.
