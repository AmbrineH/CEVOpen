<p class="p">Sandy everlasting [
 <italic class="italic">Helichrysum arenarium</italic> (L.) Moench] has a long tradition in European ethnomedicine as a medicinal plant which is attributed to cholagogue, choleretic, hepatoprotective, and detoxifying activities (Czinner et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). It is herbaceous perennial plant belonging to Asteraceae family and it is native to Europe, Central Asia, and China (Anderberg and Anderberg, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Erhardt et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The origin of the genus name is derived from the Greek words 
 <italic class="italic">helios</italic>, meaning sun, and 
 <italic class="italic">chrysos</italic>, meaning gold, what refers to the shiny-golden color of inflorescence (Maznev, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). The main biologically active compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">Helichrysi arenarii inflorescentia</italic> (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">H. a. flos</italic>) are flavonoids, with chalcone isosalipurposide, and flavanones salipurposide, prunin and naringenin as dominant constituents, while other compounds present in remarkable amount are phtalides, carotenoids, essential oil and yellow pigments: Î±-pyron derivates such as arenol and homoarenol (Bryksa-Godzisz et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Kurkina et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Nevertheless, Smirnova and Pervykh (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>) reported that it is the sum of flavonoids that account for the cholagogue activity of the everlasting flower extracts.
