 <italic class="italic">H. arenarium</italic> is fully protected in Sweden and Serbia, while in Denmark and Estonia the species is listed as “care demanding” (Lilleleht, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>; Butorac, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). In the 1970s the species received partial legal protection in Poland, which stopped the overexploitation of its natural resources (Sawilska and Jendrzejczak, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Besides the unsustainable collection, the main risk factor that threatens species subsistence is the transformation of natural habitat to agricultural land (orchards, vineyards) and areas for the cultivation of fast-growing tree species (varieties of poplar, pine, and acacia) (Butorac, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Protection regulations triggered a need to develop a new efficient growing technology for sandy everlasting, which could restore the species for it use in phytotherapy (Sawilska and Jendrzejczak, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). After first unsuccessful attempts of growing sandy everlasting in plantations, Sawilska et al. (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) have explained the reason why those attempts failed and pointed out the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on the inflorescence yield. Small farms in Latvia also cultivate 
 <italic class="italic">H. arenarium</italic> for local consumption, where the production area was estimated as less than 2 ha since marketing problems have affected the production of domestic medicinal plants in general (Olsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>).
