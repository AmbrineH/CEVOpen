<p class="p">Moreover, significant activities of naringenin, one of the main flavonoids of 
 <italic class="italic">H. arenarium</italic>, were reported. Pafumi et al. (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) found naringenin as the inhibitor of Two-Pore Channel 2 (TPC2) -mediated signaling, a key therapeutic step in a number of pathological conditions including the progression and metastatic potential of melanoma, Ebola virus infection, and Parkinson's disease. Park et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">in press</xref>) suggest naringenin as a potential therapeutic molecule with anti-cancer effects on choriocarcinoma cells acting by inducing generation of ROS and activation of the MAPK pathways, while Liang et al. (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that naringenin protect keratinocytes from apoptosis and oxidative stress injury through inhibition of the NOD2-mediated NF-ÎºB pathway. Furthermore, taking into account that naringenin and naringenin-5-
