<p class="p">Sandy everlasting is hardy perennial with a deep growing root system (Olsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The plant grows 10–30 (50) cm high with obliquely descendent, strong and short rhizome (Butorac, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; WHO, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The stem is usually branched at the upper part and carries alternate leaves, which are 2–5 cm in length (Olsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The rosette leaves are reverse ovoid, while upper leaves are linear-lanceolate (Butorac, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Both the leaves and the stem are covered with gray or silvery wooly hairs (Olsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The inflorescence is capitula, numerous, globose, 3–6 (9) mm in diameter and 10–30 (100) capitulas are grouped in false umbels (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Phyllaries ca. 50, slightly loosely arranged in 3–7 rows, often with the declined tip at end of anthesis, bright lemon-yellow, more pallid yellow, pinkish, or orange; outer ones obovate or elliptic, abaxially densely villous, apex rounded; inner ones widely oblong-spatulate to sublinear. Florets (25–50) are almost always hermaphrodite, tubular-infundibulate, sometimes marginal florets are only female, pappus of about 30 yellowish-white hairs, as long as the corolla; pollinated by insects (Gajić, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>; Yousheng et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Fruit is pentagonal, oblong, brown achene, 0.7–1.2 mm long, with a pappus (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
