<p class="p">Very little attention has been paid to the content of macro- and microelements in 
 <italic class="italic">Helichrysi flos</italic> herbal drugs and extracts. To the best of our knowledge, only one report done by Lemberkovics et al. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) partly studied this subject. Reported values of the observed elements in their highest levels were: Al (353 mg/kg), Cr (6 mg/kg), Cu (19 mg/kg), Mn (349 mg/kg), and P (2907 mg/kg) in the cultivated drug sample from Hungary, while the concentration of Ba (19 mg/kg), Ca (7575 mg/kg), Fe (159 mg/kg), and Zn (59 mg/kg) was highest in a commercial sample from Poland. Macro- and microelements are critical components for a number enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes involved in antioxidant defense of the human body, and a deficiency of any of these essential elements may impair the function of the overall antioxidant system (Zidenberg-Cherr and Keen,
