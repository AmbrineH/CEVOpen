<p class="p">The tree shows that the geographically closest species are grouped: 
 <bold class="bold">Cau-L</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">Cuj-L</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">Can-L</bold> were collected in Caxiuan√£ National Forest and 
 <bold class="bold">Ver-L</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">Flo-L</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">Whi-L</bold> were collected in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Although there may be differences in the composition of essential oils in plants of the same species with the same geographical location, the results of phylogenetic tree showed a good correlation with classes of chemical compounds. The species 
 <bold class="bold">Cau-L</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Can-L</bold> are rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and the samples 
 <bold class="bold">Cuj-L</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">Ver-L</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">Whi-L</bold> showed similar amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons. A higher difference could be observed for sample 
 <bold class="bold">Flo-L</bold>, which had diterpenes as its main compound class. Our results support the hypothesis that 
 <italic class="italic">matK</italic> gene is reasonably useful in phylogenetic reconstructions at high taxonomic levels (to order or family), but shows poorer reliability with lower taxonomic levels of classification (to genus or species) [
