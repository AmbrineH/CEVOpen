  <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic> species present economic importance and biological activities attributed to their essential oils (EOs) and extracts. For this reason, various strategies have been developed for their conservation. The chemical compositions of the essential oils and 
  <italic class="italic">matK</italic> DNA sequences of 
  <italic class="italic">O. caudata</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">O. cujumary</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">O. caniculata</italic> were subjected to comparison with data from 
  <italic class="italic">O. floribunda</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">O. veraguensis</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">O. whitei</italic>, previously reported. The multivariate analysis of chemical composition classified the EOs into two main clusters. Group I was characterized by the presence of α-pinene (9.8–22.5%) and β-pinene (9.7–21.3%) and it includes 
  <italic class="italic">O. caudata</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">O. whitei</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">O. floribunda</italic>. In group II, the oils of 
  <italic class="italic">O. cujumary</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">O. caniculata</italic> showed high similarity due amounts of β-caryophyllene (22.2% and 18.9%, respectively). The EO of 
  <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">veraguensis</italic>, rich in 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (19.8%), showed minor similarity among all samples. The oils displayed promising antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &lt; 19.5 µg·mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and MCF-7 cells (median inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>) ≅ 65.0 µg·mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), respectively. The analysis of 
  <italic class="italic">matK</italic> gene displayed a good correlation with the main class of chemical compounds present in the EOs. However, the 
  <italic class="italic">matK</italic> gene data did not show correlation with specific compounds.
