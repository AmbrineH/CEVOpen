 <italic class="italic">Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. (safflower) is among the important oil seed crops and it is adapted for salt and drought stress conditions. Principally, it is cultivated for the oil used both for food and industrial implications and it is a potential source of biodiesel. As safflower is composed up of complex mixture of unsaturated fatty acids and the separation and quantification of those fatty acids on one dimensional gas chromatography was not satisfactory. Therefore, the use of comprehensive two-dimensional chromatograms containing many peaks and higher peak capacities [
