 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. This part of the study was aimed to improve the oil quality of substrate (i-e safflower) used as a feedstock for biodiesel production using ecofriendly sustainable measures by altering the composition of fatty acids as well as refining oil properties that directly affect the biodiesel quality. Two cultivars of safflower were selected to know their performance under provided conditions.
