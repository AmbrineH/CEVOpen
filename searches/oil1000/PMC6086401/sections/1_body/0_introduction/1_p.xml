<p class="p">Due to increased growth of population and change in life style, the consumption of energy has been increased in these days. This increase in the demand of energy, limiting the resources of fossil fuel and rising the prices of oil internationally have renewed the interest towards the search of alternative sources of energy (fuels) [

In addition, there is an increasing problem of global warming, accumulation of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution leading to climate change which in turn influences the crop productivity. The search for the renewable, sustainable and environmental friendly energy resources is the key factor for improving the economy of a country and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, in order to meet the energy demands, each country is focusing to search the alternative energy sources and among those, biofuel (i-e biodiesel) is one option. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, main barrier for the production of biodiesel is competition with use of oil for food. Measures which can be adopted to overcome this conflict are to use non edible oil resources, to increase production using waste land areas and to improve the productivity of crops by various measures such as use of chemical and biofertilizers (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria: PGPR).
