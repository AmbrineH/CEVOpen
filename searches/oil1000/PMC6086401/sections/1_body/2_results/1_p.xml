 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201738.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> showed the comprehensive two-dimensional chromatograms of safflower which illustrate the fatty acid composition present in the oil extracted from safflower for further analysis. Using dedicated software, individual compounds were visualized as ellipse-shaped peaks in a 2-D contour plot; peak colour and dimension were related to the total analyte quantity. Total 17 fatty acids were detected in safflower oil and among those; five fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid and linoleic acids) were selected for further study because of their important effect on the quality of biodiesel.
