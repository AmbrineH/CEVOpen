 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The present work showed that maximum reduction in both the variables was resulted in SPQ treatment. These results are in line with the findings of Lawania et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] who reported that the application of nitrogen fertilizers in combination with biofertilizers (
 <italic class="italic">Azotobacter</italic>) reduced the iodine value of linseed oil. Reduced values of iodine and refractive indices improve the quality and oxidation stability of oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. There is a negative correlation between oleic acid content and other oil quality parameters such as acid value, free fatty acid, iodine value, refractive index etc. It is an important finding of the study because increase in oleic acid and in parallel decrease in acid value, free fatty acid, iodine value, refractive index etc. imparts good quality biodiesel production (

The higher iodine value tends to result in deposit formation hence causes problems of storage stability. Iodine value decrease with decrease in refractive index and improves the quality and oxidation stability of oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Ahmad et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] reported that impregnation of PGPB with urea and DAP improved the nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency by the wheat plant and also improved the photosynthetic rate and yield. The PGPB such as 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum</italic> improved the nitrogen use efficiency by biological nitrogen fixation and facilitate the uptake of nutrient by the plants. As the treatments containing PGPB with reduced amount of fertilizers (half or quarter doses) are efficient in improving the oil quality, as a result these treatments reduced the application of chemical fertilizers which is the important finding of the study and leads towards the ecofriendly sustainable agriculture.
