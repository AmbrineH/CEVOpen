<p class="p">Saponification number is an important variable that affects the quality of biodiesel. Our results indicated a reduction in saponification value especially with the BTQ treatment. Saponification is negatively correlated with the degree of unsaturation [

It was reported in the previous study that application of nitrogen fertilizer at the rate of 108â€“216 kg per hectare to the plant reduced the saponifiable number and refractive index and lead to parallel increase in unsaponifiable number [
