<p class="p">The PGPRs (
 <italic class="italic">Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum brasilense</italic>) were applied as seed inoculation at the rate of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> bacterial cells/seed. To prepare inoculum, 100 mL of Luria Bertani media (LB) was inoculated with the cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> (24 h old) and kept on shaker (Excella E24, USA) at 120 rpm for 72 h at 24Â°C. The centrifugation of bacterial cultures was carried out at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellet was suspended in distilled autoclaved water; optical density to be one was adjusted to 600 nm. The sterilized seeds were then soaked in the bacterial cultures for six hours before sowing.
