<p class="p">It can be concluded from the above results and discussion that oil quality parameters such as fatty acid profile and oil properties were significantly improved by the inoculation of PGPR supplemented with quarter and half rates of NP fertilizers. Oleic acid content and C18:1/C18:3 ratios were significantly improved by 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum</italic> in combination with half rate of NP fertilizers. However, oil properties such as acid value, iodine value, refractive index etc. were significantly improved by BTQ and SPQ treatments in both the varieties. The behaviour of the varieties varies in response to provided treatments for the specific parameter. According to these results we can reduced the use of NP fertilizers upto 50%â€“75% with the application of 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Azotobacter</italic> for green, sustainable and environment friendly good quality biodiesel production. However, further research at molecular level is needed to confirm the interaction of PGPR with fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. In order to achieve the goal of better safflower oil quality production, the exploration of molecular pathways in combination with biochemical and genetic approaches which are linked with the current study are needed.
