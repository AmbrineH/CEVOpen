<p id="p0010" class="p">Coal, natural gas and oil are source of energy formed over billions of ages from the decay of plants and animals. These assets are entirely irreplaceable ever since the world formed. Also, the exploitation of the use of burning fuels cause pollution to the water we drink, air we breathe, and the soil for agricultural purposes. This in turn, affects humanity, vegetation, wildlife, and the natural world. The outcomes are destruction of wildlife and vegetation, as well as sicknesses, birth defects, and death.</p>
