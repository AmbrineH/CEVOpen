<p id="p0045" class="p">Response surface methodology experimental design (RSMED) is design expert software that can easily handle data analysis and has been used effectively in modeling and optimizing biodiesel production. The benefits of this software over others include availability, asset in statistical quality control, expressive and inferential statistics, statistical process control (SPC), reliability, gage repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R) studies, process ability and improved graphing output

Artificial neural network experimental design (ANNED) is an educative based on assessment method, which shows a nonlinear relationship with joining factors and product formation thru reiteration of outcomes acquired from experimental design
