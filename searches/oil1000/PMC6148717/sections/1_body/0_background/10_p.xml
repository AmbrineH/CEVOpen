<p id="p0050" class="p">In this research work, Lucky nut seedoil was explored to produce biodiesel via heterogeneous base catalyst produced from activated calcined pearl spar. For modelling and optimization, RSMED and ANNED were employed so as to generate the number of experimental runs, determine the predicted yield, compare the error values, and analyze the various variable factors responsible for optimum production of biofuel and increasing the process efficiency. Lastly, the fuel properties of Lucky nut oil biodiesel were evaluated with a view to determining its suitability in replacing fossil fuels.</p>
