 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was used follow the modified method of 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[39]</xref>. 100 ml of the oil was measured in a three necked reactor, preheated on a hot plate with magnetic stirrer. A known volume of acid (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) with a known volume methanol were mixed separately, before the resulting mixture was transferred to the pre-heated oil placed on hot plate, allowed to stir continuously for 1 h to produced esterified oil. After 1 hr, the esterified oil was separated from by product (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH) using separating funnel. Surplus CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH in the esterified oil was evaporated preceding the determination of the acid value. The acid value of oil was determined using the standard method of AOAC, 1997. These steps were carried out repeatedly under different conditions of the mixture of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and methanol until the minimum acid value was obtained.
