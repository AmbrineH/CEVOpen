<p id="p0095" class="p">To ascertain the calcined Pearl Spar with high abundant of base catalyst, EDXRF Spectrophotometer (EDX3600B) was used to determine the relative abundance of each element present. The EDXRF Spectrophotometer was standardized with group II element (silver), the analysis was performed using ore standard calibration curve. Furthermore, an electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the position of the activated catalysts. The calcined pearl spar identified with the high abundant base catalyst was use for the based catalysed transesterification of biofuel production.</p>
