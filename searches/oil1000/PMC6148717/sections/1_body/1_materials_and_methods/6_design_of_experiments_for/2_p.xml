<p id="p0110" class="p">A total of 17 experimental runs were performed in order to optimize the production of biodiesel from the low FFA oil. Selected variable considered were reaction time in min represented by X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>; methanol/oil ratio represented by X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and catalyst amount in g represented in X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> as showed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The effects of the variables were randomized so as to reduce the unwanted impact of unexpected variability in the experimental yield. Meanwhile, second order quadratic model was used for the process. To compare the experimental value to the selected variables, multiple regressions were used to fit the coefficients of the second-order quadratic polynomial model of the response. The quality of the fit of the model was evaluated using both test of significance and analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis.
