<p id="p0230" class="p">This study concluded that Lucky nut seed is very rich in oil with validated optimum yield of 46.82% (w/w) and 50.80% (w/w) by RSM and ANN, respectively, and the oil was highly unsaturated with a high FFA. Based on predicted values, the optimum validated biodiesel by RSM and ANN were 89.68% (w/w) and 92.87% (w/w), respectively. Calcined pearl spar earlier pre-soaked in methanol showed accurate ability to serve as a heterogeneous base catalyst for biofuel production from Lucky nut seed. The produced biodiesel has good properties and it is in line with reports published by other researchers using the same feedstock. Hence, the study concluded that the produced biodiesel could replace the conventional diesel with release of less hazardous emission.</p>
