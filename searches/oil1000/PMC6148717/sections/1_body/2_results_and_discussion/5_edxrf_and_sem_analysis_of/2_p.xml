<p id="p0170" class="p">Calcined four samples of pearl spar labelled A-D for 5 and 6 h were tested by using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (3600B) to determine the essential structures of the samples (
 <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). The patterns of calcined pearl spar with the relative abundance of the elements present are showed in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>. It was observed that the analysis of calcined catalyst resulted in detection of the elements present within the catalyst. Although, potassium dominates with the highest composition, follow by silicon and magnesium. Zirconium (Zr), Niobium (Ni) and Molybdenum (Mo) have closed value, while Tin (Tn) and Antimony (Sb) have the lowest values. The results obtained is in line with what was reported by 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[53]</xref>, who demonstrated that potassium was found to have the highest conversion out of elements found in calcined banana peels used as catalyst in biofuel production via Napoleon's plum. Potassium (59.30%) was also found to be the highest element found in calcined cocoa pod husk used as catalyst in conversion of

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[54]</xref>. In this study, Calcined Pearl Spar earlier pre-soaked in methanol reached its highest concentration of 58.48% at a calcined time of 5 h for the peak value. This observation could be owing to spongy nature of the catalyst (see
