<p id="p0195" class="p">To test the fit of the model equation, the regression model was established using R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> as a measure of how much variability in the observed response values can be explained by the experimental factors and their interactions 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[44]</xref>. The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value is always between 0 and 100% [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. However, to create a good-fit model, it was recommended that R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> should not be less than 80%

 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> indicate an R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value of 99.69% which leaves only 0.31% of the variability not explains by biodiesel, this showed that unexplainable total variation could be due to other factors, which were not included in the model.
