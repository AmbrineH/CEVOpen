<p id="p0205" class="p">The relationship between the variables and the response can be represented on graphical drawing, placing the experimental levels of each variable on the one side, and the type of interactions between the test variables, on the other, which allows deducing the optimum conditions. Figs.

 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> therefore shows the contour and 3 dimensional surface plots for biodiesel under the viable optimum conditions for RSM and ANN. Meanwhile, the line graph helps to determine the relationship between two sets of values, with one data set always being dependent on the other set. 
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 10</xref> therefore shows a plot of the linear correlation between the biodiesel and the predicted value obtained from RSM and ANN. The perfect straight line obtained indicated that the models factor and the predicted values are in agreement with each other. Again, to check for the model accuracy, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, RSME and ADD of RSM and ANN were determined 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. The results obtained showed that both optimization tools certified good predictions to be attained due to the value of R
