<p id="p0215" class="p">Elemental analysis results using EDXRF Spectrophotometer for calcined Pearl Spar revealed that the pre-soaked sample D was found with the highest potassium content (58.48%). The supplementary material showed the consistent spectrum with the comparative abundance of the elements present. Observation from this study implied that K is the major active component responsible for the activity of the catalyst in pearl spar synthesis which served as base catalyst for transesterification of esterified oil to biofuel. Reports showed that calcination always prevented leaching of potassium, and may increase the reusability of catalyst during biofuel production
