 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = −0.5460, X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = −1.0000 and X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> = 0.0608 and ANN predicted 52.95% (w/w) at variable factors of X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = 0.11, X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 1.00 and X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> = 0.52, respectively. Based on predicted values, the experiment was carried out in triplicates so as to validate the values at different variable conditions predicted by RSM and ANN. An average of oil of 46.82% (w/w) and 50.80% (w/w) were obtained for RSM and ANN, respectively.
