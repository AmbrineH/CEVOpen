 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[41]</xref>. According to 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[42]</xref>, an F-value along with low p-value indicates a high significance of the regression model. Nevertheless, the p-value should be lower than 0.05 for the model to be statistically significant 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[43]</xref>. Based on these reports, the regression model found in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> was highly significant, as it is evident by the F-value = 5.50 and the low p-values = 0.0221, respectively.
