<p id="p0150" class="p">The relationship between the variables and the response can be represented on graphical drawing, placing the experimental levels of each variable on the one side, and the type of interactions between the test variables, on the other, which allows deducing the optimum conditions. Figs.

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> therefore shows the contour and 3 dimensional surface plots for oil extraction from oil seed under the viable optimum conditions for RSM and ANN. Meanwhile, the line graph helps to determine the relationship between two sets of values, with one data set always being dependent on the other set. 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> therefore shows a plot predicted against the experimental yield for both RSM and ANN. The perfect straight line obtained indicated that the models factor and the predicted values are in agreement with each other. To check for the model accuracy, R

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. The results obtained indicated that the optimization tools certified are good for predictions due to the high values of R
