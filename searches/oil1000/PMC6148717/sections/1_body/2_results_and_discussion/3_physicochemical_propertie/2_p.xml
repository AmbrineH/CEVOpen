 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> showed the result obtained while carrying out the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. It was noted that the oil was brownish yellowish liquid at room temperature, having a moisture content of 0.0011% with density of 0.9804 g cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’3</sup>. Observation on the moisture content of the oil and the density showed a close agreement with what was earlier reported by 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>. The percentage FFA and acid values of the oil account for the good resistance of the oil to hydrolysis, the values of 2.3175 for FFA and 4.6350 for acid value showed that oil has high resistance to hydrolysis. The peroxide value, always account for the hydroperoxides in the oil 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[47]</xref>, the low value of 33.6000 meq. O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg obtained for oil in this study indicated a greater resistance to oxidation. High saponification value (75.25 mg KOH/g) and high iodine (87.60 gI
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/100 g) value indicated a minimum percentage of triglycerides of oil with substantial level of unsaturation. The higher heating value accounts for the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion products. The higher the value of HHV of the oil, the more suitable the oil is for use as biofuel. The value of 45.3588 MJ/kg obtained from this study shows the oil is a good raw material for biofuel production.
