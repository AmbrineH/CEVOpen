<p id="p0225" class="p">Comparative analysis of the oil and biodiesel was carried out so as to determine the effects of catalytic conversion of oil to biodiesel. The results obtained are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl15" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 15</xref>. From the table, it was observed that there was 9% reduction in biofuel moisture content when compared with the parent oil (
 <italic class="italic">Lucky nut oil</italic>). This decrease helps to prevent or eliminate an engine knockout effect. The density decreases by 11%, which showed a significant increase in heat of vaporization and accelerated ignition when combustion occurred. The iodine value was reduced by 8%, which implied that the biofuel produced contained low level of unsaturation 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[58]</xref>, the acid value reduced by 95.5%, indicating the biodiesel has a long shelf life [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The saponification value was increased by 1.5%, suggesting a high concentration of triglycerides in biodiesel. The higher heating value further decreased by 0.24%, Cetane number increased by 0.5%, which accounts for its greater combustion process ability, as a fuel with low cetane number produces smoke, when used in engine 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[61]</xref>. Other additional fuel properties, such as the diesel index and API increased from oil to biofuel. These results confirmed that the produced biodiesel could serve as an alternative to the conventional diesel and its blends could improve it fuel properties.
