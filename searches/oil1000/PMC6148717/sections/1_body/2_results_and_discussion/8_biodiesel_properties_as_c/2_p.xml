<p id="p0220" class="p">The physicochemical analysis results of the biodiesel were compared with other published research works and also with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards (
 <xref rid="tbl14" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 14</xref>). At room temperature, the biodiesel produced was brownish liquid having a low moisture content of 0.0010. Observation from [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] showed that the produced biodiesel percentage moisture content is in line with what was reported. The density of 0.8720 g cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> was in reasonable agreement with other works and within the range specified by [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The Lucky nut biodiesel acid value obtained was 0.3200 mg of KOH/g oil, this value was higher than what was reported by [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], but lower than the values reported by [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] on the same feedstock. The iodine value of Lucky nut biodiesel of 80.4200 gI

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] but well below the prescribed maximum limit of 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[54]</xref>. The saponification value accounts for the number of milligrams of KOH, required to neutralized the FFA resulting from the complete hydrolysis of 1 g of fat or oil, constituent of the oil. The value obtained in this work was 76.4000 mg KOH/g oil, but no value was recorded by other researchers in the previously published works. The HHV computed for Lucky nut biodiesel in this study was 45.2512 MJ/kg, which takes into account the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion products. Cetane number is a measure of the fuel's ignition delay and combustion quality of the oil/fuel. The higher the cetane number the shorter the delay interval and the greater the combustibility of the fuel. Fuels with a low cetane number are difficult to start the engine, hence producing smoke. The standard minimum specification value of the cetane number for biofuel is within the range of 47–51 [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The values obtained by most authors were within the ranges of 47–61.5, but the value obtained from this work was higher (99.6228). The higher value obtained in this work may be attributed to the nature of the catalyst used during the transesterification process. Other properties, such as Aniline point, diesel index and API of the Lucky nut biodiesel were also found to be in the ranges earlier reported by most authors [
