<p class="p">Data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, Raleigh, NC, USA). The pen was the experimental unit. Differences among treatments were separated by Duncan’s multiple range test. Results were expressed as least squares means and standard error of the mean. Significance was designated at p≤0.05, while a tendency for significance was designated at 0.05&lt;p≤0.10.</p>
