<p class="p">Homogenized skinless thigh meat tissue of broilers (weighting close to average body weight from each pen, n = 7) were defrosted and samples of breast meat (ca. 20 g) lyophilized for 60 h using a freeze dryer. Fatty acid concentrations of lyophilized d 42 breast meat and milled feed was determined. The fatty acid profiles of the lipid sources were determined by gas chromatography (6890 series, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) according to the procedures of Sukhija and Palmquist [

Undecanoic acid (C11:0) was used as the internal standard. Aliquots of 1 mL were injected into a capillary column (60 m×250 m×250 nm, DB-23, Agilent, USA) with cyanopropyl methyl silicone as the stationary phase. Column oven temperature was programmed with a 1:20 split. Injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 260°C and 270°C, respectively. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Fatty acid composition were then calculated in terms of milligrams of fatty acid per 100 g of tissue (fresh weight).
