<p class="p">On d 21 and d 42, one broiler per pen (weighing closest to the average body weight in each pen, n = 7) was selected and euthanized for blood samples. Blood was collected (5 mL) by cardiac puncture into a 10-mL anticoagulant-free Vacutainer tube (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmunster, Austria) and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min to obtain serum. Serum samples were stored at −80°C until needed for analysis.</p>
