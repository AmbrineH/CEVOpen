<p class="p">On d 21 and 42, the broilers were fasted for 12 h and the broilers and feeds were then weighed to determine average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The diets were ground to pass through a 1-mm sieve before analysis, and were analyzed according to the procedures of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The diets were tested for crude protein (CP, method 990.03; AOAC [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]). The mixed oils were analyzed for CP, dry matter (method 934.01; AOAC [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]), ash (method 942.05; AOAC [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]), extract ether (method 920.39; AOAC [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]), while the gross energy was determined by an automatic isoperibolic oxygen bomb calorimeter (Parr 1281, Automatic Energy Analyzer; Moline, IL, USA).
