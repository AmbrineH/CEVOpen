<p class="p">The source of dietary mixed oils used in this study were prepared and supplied in Shandong Zhongda Agriculture Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (Binzhou, China). Chemical composition of mixed oil 1 (MO1) and mixed oil 2 (MO2) is summarized in 
 <xref rid="t1-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The MO1 is a combination of 15% corn oil, 10% coconut oil, 15% linseed oil, 20% palm oil, 15% peanut oil, and 25% soybean oil, while MO2 is a mixture of 50% MO1 and 50% extruded corn. Concentrations of palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1n-9), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), and α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) in MO1 are 17.4%, 17.5%, 36.3%, and 2.50%, while concentrations of palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) in MO2 are 9.79%, 10.2% 21.7%, and 1.49%, respectively.
