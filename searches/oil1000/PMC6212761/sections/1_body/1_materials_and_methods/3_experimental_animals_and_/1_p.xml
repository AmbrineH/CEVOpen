<p class="p">A total of 126 one-day-old as-hatched Arbor Acres chicks (weighing 44.91±0.92 g) were purchased from Arbor Acres Poultry Breeding Company (Beijing, China). All broilers were raised in wire-floor cages in an environmentally controlled room with continuous light (10 to 20 lux) and had 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> access to feed and water. The room temperature was maintained at 33°C for the first 3 d, then the temperature was reduced by 3°C a week until reaching 24°C and this temperature was maintained until the end of the 42-d experiment. The lighting regimen and ventilation were monitored continuously from d 1 to d 42. All broilers were inoculated with Newcastle disease vaccine on d 7 and d 28 and with inactivated infectious bursa disease vaccine on d 14 and d 21.
