<p class="p">Broilers fed MO also showed improved serum parameters. Serum glucose is an important source of energy for animals and can be conducive to growth of body tissues. The increased concentration of serum glucose in our study is associated with increased serum concentrations of insulin and glucagons in broilers fed diets rich in SFA [
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], which reveals that MO (containing high content of palmitic acid and SFA) can help to promote glucose metabolism and improve performance of broilers. Serum concentrations of albumin and total protein reflect the functions of synthesis of proteins in liver of broilers, which may associate with animal growth and physiological status [
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In the present study, we found an increased liver percentage along with an increased concentration of globulin, total protein and albumin, which indicated that MO can improve liver function and performance of broilers [

 <xref rid="b26-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Our study showed broilers fed MO had a tendency for a decreased concentration of serum TC. A possible mechanism for the lower TC concentration in serum of broilers can be that the rate of triglycerides synthesis in the liver exceeds the capacity to produce very low density lipoproteins, resulting in triglycerides to be deposited in the liver, and hence reduced serum TC [
