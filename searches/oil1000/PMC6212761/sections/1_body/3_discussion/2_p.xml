<p class="p">Along with the improved performance, broilers fed MO also showed improved viscera percentages and meat quality. The normal development of animal viscera is the basis of the physical function of animal body, which indicates greater viscera percentages may reflect better viscera metabolism and function. In broilers, liver is the most important fat metabolism organ because more than 95% of fat synthesis occurs in the liver [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Therefore, the higher liver percentage in broilers fed MO2 in the present study reveals greater fat synthesis in these broiler. Color is used as an indicator of freshness, quality and economic value of broiler meat. The unattractive brown color (yellowness) and decreased redness value in meat may be caused by oxidation of red oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin [
 <xref rid="b19-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In the present study, broilers fed MO showed increased redness value and a tendency for a reduced yellowness in meat, which indicates MO can help to minimize the oxidation of myoglobin, maintain meat color of broilers, and minimize the occurrence of pale, soft, and exudative meat in broilers [
 <xref rid="b20-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The increased redness in thigh muscle also reflects the increased growth of muscle fibers, which can help to improve meat quality in broilers [
 <xref rid="b21-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. There is a strong negative correlation between drop loss and water capacity in muscle, so drop loss could be used as a quantitative indicator of muscle water capacity [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Our results showed lower drop loss in breast and thigh muscle of broilers fed diets supplemented with MO, mainly for the reason that linoleic acid contained in the diets could play an important role in increasing water retention capacity of pectoral muscle [
