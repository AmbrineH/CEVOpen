<p class="p">In the present study, we found broilers fed MO showed increased concentration of SFA, which may due to the high concentration of SFA and palmitic acid containing in MO can be deposited in the muscle tissue of broilers [

 <xref rid="b29-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated broilers fed diets rich in SFA showed increased fatty acid deposition in chicken than those fed diets rich in PUFA [

The MO in our study containing 20% palm oil and 15% linseed oil, palm oil is rich in SFAs and is more stable than linseed oil, while a combination of them would increase stability of the fats and maintenance of an appropriate balance between SFAs and PUFAs [

 <xref rid="b30-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our study also found broilers fed MO1 had decreased concentration of C18:1n-9 and C18:3n-3, as well as increased content of C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3, n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA, and total PUFA in breast muscle. Similarly, Wang et al [
 <xref rid="b31-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] found a combination of linseed and palm oils in chicken diets had enhanced n-3 PUFA content in meat of broilers. These results are likely due to high concentrations of Î±-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) in MO can act as a precursor for long chain n-3 PUFA in broilers, such as C20:5n-3 and C22:6n-3, so there are lower content of C18:3n-3 and higher deposition of n-3 PUFA in breast muscle of broilers [

 <xref rid="b32-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Broilers fed a diet supplemented with linseed oil can produce chicken meat with higher concentration of n-3 PUFA and lower n-6/n-3 ratio [
 <xref rid="b7-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], which may benefit human health as a source of n-3 PUFA. A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios in diets could also help to decrease fat deposition by inhibiting fat synthesis [
