<p class="p">In this research, broilers fed MO showed greater ADG and decreased FCR than those fed soybean oil alone, which is somewhat consistent with Crespo and Esteve-Garcia [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], who reported that broilers fed a diet containing a combination of sunflower and linseed oil showed lower FCR. This result might be due to the beneficial effects of an appropriate balance between SFAs (e.g. 20% palm oils) and PUFAs (e.g. 15% linseed oil) [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Moreover, since MO is rich in palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and Î±-linolenic acid, the reason for these improvements of performance can also be the high concentrations of oleic acid and linoleic acid in MO that helped to improve oil utilization and eventually increase ADG and decrease FCR in broilers [
