<p class="p">Many previous studies have showed that a combination of oil feedstocks may be more beneficial for performance of broilers than single oil feedstock [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Broilers fed a diet supplemented with a combination of tallow, sunflower oil, and linseed oil showed improved performance and fatty acid profile in the breast and thigh meat [
 <xref rid="b11-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Besides, a combination of beef tallow, olive oil, sunflower oil, and linseed oil in broiler diets could produce less fat deposits than the ones rich in saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The differences in dietary fatty acid absorption may be due to long-chain unsaturated fatty acids having greater ability to form micelles and can act synergistically in the absorption of saturated fatty acids (SFA) when mixed [
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, a study of the effects of a combination of different kinds of vegetable oils containing both unsaturated fatty acids and SFA would be valuable.
