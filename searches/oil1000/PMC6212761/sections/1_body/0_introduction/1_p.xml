<p class="p">Oil is often used as a high energy feedstock in animal diets. Broilers fed rations containing oil show better performance and higher digestibility of fat than those fed diets without oil inclusion although the nutritive value of the diets is similar [
 <xref rid="b1-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The fatty acid profile and carcass quality of poultry meat is influenced by the fatty acid profile of the diet consumed by the broilers during rearing [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Among all the oil feedstocks, corn oil, coconut oil, linseed oil, palm oil, peanut oil and soybean oil can be widely used in broilersâ€™ diet. Corn oil is rich in oleic acid and linoleic acids, while 4% corn oil can improve performance and meat quality of broilers [

 <xref rid="b4-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Linoleic and linolenic fatty acids derived from linseed oil are recognized as metabolically essential for broilers because broilers are not able to synthesize these fatty acids, and linoleic acid is the only essential fatty acid whose diet requirement has been demonstrated [
