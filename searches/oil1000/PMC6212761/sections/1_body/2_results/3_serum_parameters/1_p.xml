 <xref rid="t5-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. During phase 1, broilers fed MO1 showed a tendency for an increased (p = 0.08) concentration of glucose in serum compared to CTR. In phase 2, broilers fed MO showed higher (pâ‰¤0.05) concentration of glucose and albumin, as well as a tendency for increased contents of globulin and total protein in serum compared to CTR; whereas broilers fed MO1 showed a tendency (p = 0.10) for a decreased concentration of TC in serum compared to CTR.
