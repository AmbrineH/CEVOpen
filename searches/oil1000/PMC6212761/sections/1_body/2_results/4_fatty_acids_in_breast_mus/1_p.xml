<p class="p">The effects of MO on fatty acids deposition in breast muscle of broilers are shown in 
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-31-11-1773" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Broilers fed MO had increased (p&lt;0.05) concentrations of C14:0, C16:0, C17:0, C18:0, C20:0, C20:4n-6, SFA, and n-6/n-3 ratio; whereas these broilers also showed decreased (p&lt;0.05) concentrations of C18:3n-3 and P/S ratio in breast muscle compared to CTR. Broilers fed MO1 had increased (p&lt;0.05) contents of C18:2n-6, C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3, n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA, and total PUFA, as well as a tendency for a lower concentration (p = 0.06) of C16:1n-7 in breast muscle compared to CTR.
