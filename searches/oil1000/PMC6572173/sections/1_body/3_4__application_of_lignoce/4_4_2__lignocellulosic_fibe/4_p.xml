<p class="p">Regarding lignocellulosic fiber reinforced bioplastics, it is typically acknowledged that stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber is enhanced by fibers having a high aspect ratio (length/width). A high aspect ratio is very crucial in lignocellulosic fiber reinforced biocomposites because it indicates possible strength performance [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Biocomposites were prepared using twin extrusion process with lignocellulosic hemp fiber as reinforcements and poly(ε-caprolactone) as matrix. Different aspect ratios (19–38) of fibers were prepared. Properties including low-velocity impact, flexural and tensile were enhanced in the poly(ε-caprolactone)/hemp fiber biocomposites. The best properties were revealed in the biocomposite with 26 aspect ratios, with modulus and flexural strength of 285% and 169%, respectively. However, mechanical properties presented a significant decrease in water immersed biocomposites; flexural moduli and tensile reduced by 62% and 90%, respectively. The results provided a green replacement of a petroleum-based and conventional polymer matrix in potential applications [

In addition, the adhesion between fibers and polymers and the dispersion of fiber in matrix are also vital to an effective stress transfer. The intense shearing forces can reduce the aspect ratio of cellulosic fibers in the mechanochemical process. The milling process can cause the degradation of matter with lower molecular weight, which produces low mechanical properties. However, the negative effect from milling can be compensated by the crosslinked structure and effective fiber dispersion, providing the bioplastics with enhanced performance [
