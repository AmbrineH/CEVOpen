<p class="p">The interaction between matrix-fiber can be promoted with the compatibilizer or coupling agent interacting with both fiber and polymer [
 <xref rid="B141-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Gonz√°lez et al. (2011) reported the thermal and mechanical properties of fiber and PLA-reinforced biocomposites. PLA-based composites were manufactured by injection molding. Both sisal and kraft fibers composites revealed higher impact strengths than that of neat PLA (24.61 and 14.45 J/m, respectively). In addition, a good dispersion of reinforcements in the PLA composites was revealed by microscopic analysis [

Both flexural strength and modulus of starch biocomposites were significantly increased by laccase treatment with the mediators including violuric acid and fibers. The water uptake of biocomposites was reduced considerably. This biocomposites represented a promising means to produce non-food and disposable packaging materials based on above biopolymers [
 <xref rid="B143-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. The effect of coupling agent and fibers on water uptake behavior was assessed in polyhdroxybutyrate-
 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-polyhydroxyvalerate, or PHBV/sisal biocomposites, by analyzing the water absorption capability and water diffusion rate. It was found that more water would be incorporated when the biocomposites absorbed the water more quickly; as the content of sisal fibers increased in the biocomposites, the sample temperature became higher. In particular, saturated water absorption was more associated with the ratio of fibers, while temperature was primarily determined by water diffusion. Owing to chemical bonding between fiber and matrix, the interaction was affected by diffusion rate, but saturated water incorporation did not show significant impact on the interaction [
