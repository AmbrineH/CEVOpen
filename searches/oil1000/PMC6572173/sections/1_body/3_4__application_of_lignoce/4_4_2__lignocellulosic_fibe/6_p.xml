<p class="p">The number of researches on lignocellulosic fibers and lignin reinforced bioplastics are much fewer compared to cellulose reinforced bioplastics. The difference can be explained by the complexity and difficulty to fully utilize lignocellulosic fibers and lignin. The development of processing technologies and innovative ways to enhance the properties of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin would undoubtedly further boost their potential applications in bioplastics [
