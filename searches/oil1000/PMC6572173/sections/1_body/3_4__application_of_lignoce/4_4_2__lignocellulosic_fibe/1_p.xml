<p class="p">During the preparation of bioplastics, physical interactions between lignocellulosic fibers and the biopolymers matrix are usually restricted and do not improve the performance of biocomposites significantly [

 <xref rid="B140-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. Therefore, the ways attempted to improve the compatibility are mainly focused on increasing the fiberâ€“matrix interaction, reducing degree of association and improving the hydrophobic character of lignocellulosic fibers.
