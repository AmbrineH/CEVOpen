<p class="p">The effects of fiber properties such as fiber length or aspect ratio on increasing fiberâ€“matrix interaction are also investigated. Fiber length is an important parameter to enhance toughness and strength, while fiber dispersion mainly promotes strengths [

Mechanical properties and dynamic mechanical analysis characterized the effect of the processing method and fiber length on the performance of the biocomposites. The modulus and impact strength of the bioplastics rose with fiber orientation, fiber content and fiber length increasing. Microscopy observations revealed that fiber length could positively influenced the fracture surface as fiber content and fiber length increased. This suggested the predominant fiber bridging effects on impact strength of the bioplastics [
 <xref rid="B95-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. A complex biocomposite by a compounding and molding process was investigated with the aim of achieving high impact strength. Low and high screw extrusion methods were involved. Fiber with 2.3 mm fiber length and 20 wt % fiber content indicated a good dispersion in the biocomposite whose impact strength was 130 J/m. It can be concluded that toughness was influenced by fiber dispersion, length and concentration [
 <xref rid="B145-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. In order to investigate the effect of fiber amount and length, curaua fibers and poly(butylene succinate) were used to develop the biocomposites by compression molding. Mechanical strength, morphology and water uptake studies were performed to evaluate the characteristics of the biocomposites. It was found that the flexural and impact strengths increased as the fiber content increased. In addition, in the biocomposites with fiber content of 20 wt %, its impact strength was also affected by the fiber length ranging from 1 to 4 cm. However, the length of the fibers did not affect flexural strength significantly. Water uptake analysis confirmed the material was more sensitive to fiber content compared to fiber size. The resulting bioplastics could be applied to interior car parts or rigid packaging because they possessed the same mechanical properties as poly(butylene succinate) [
