<p class="p">The addition level of lignocellulosic fibers in bioplastics is seriously restricted by the low compatibility. There are a variety of pretreatment methods to overcome these problems. However, most of the products or residues of these pretreatments have been based on biomass biorefining which removes lignin. This process is technically demanding and profitably impractical because lignin is also widely used in bioplastics [

 <xref rid="B138-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. Therefore, in this section we will review a few examples about lignin-containing cellulosic fibers to produce bioplastics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00751-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). To some extent, we can regard them as lignocellulosic fibers which remove water soluble matter and hemicellulose. Therefore, these lignocellulosic fibers have a higher hydrophobic character and lower intermolecular interaction. In the end, we summarize the ways attempted to enhance the interaction between lignocellulosic fibers and biopolymers or to reduce the degree of association of lignocellulosic fibers without delignification when developing the bioplastics.
