<p class="p">Based on above discussion, lignocellulosic fibers and lignin have showed great success in making the bioplastics. In this section, we will make a comparison on structure, role, modification and future of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin in the bioplastics. Similarities are examined due to their structure and addition amount. Firstly, there are strong inter-molecular interactions in lignocellulosic fibers and lignin which render recalcitrance for interaction with other biopolymers. This usually reduces the performance of the composites. Agglomeration occurs in the biocomposites due to the intense interaction within lignocellulosic fiber or lignin molecules. Free movement of fibers will be restricted by the high viscosity of biopolymers during the melt process [

 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Secondly, the addition of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin in the bioplastics can be as high as 10% or above with improved properties in some reports, but additional contents of nanoscale particles are restricted below 3% due to the presence of aggregation. As we know, most of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin have low added-value [
