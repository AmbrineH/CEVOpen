<p class="p">Lignin-containing cellulosic nanofibrils (LCNF) can produce enhanced properties when incorporated into bioplastics. Residual oil palm empty fruit bunches were extracted to obtain lignin-containing cellulosic nanofibrils (LCNF) with a variety of seperation methods. Different kinds of LCNF isolated were incorporated into starch bioplastics. The Young’s modulus and yield stress achieved remarkable increases after the incorporation of LCNF. In addition, with LCNF loading increasing, water uptake of the composite bio-foams was reduced because of the low hydrophilicity of lignin residuals. The starch/LCNF nanocomposites displayed the same mechanical properties as those of polystyrene polymers. Therefore, they can be recognized as a potential and green alternative in insulation and packaging composites [

In order to develop composite films by casting and hot press, PLA and different amounts of LCNF from 5 to 20 wt % were blended. A good interfacial adhesion between PLA and LCNF was indicated due to the existence of lignin and also evidenced by results of infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscope characterization at the nanoscale. Water resistance, thermal and mechanical properties were confirmed to improve remarkably in the resultant bioplastics at 5–10 wt % LCNF addition [
