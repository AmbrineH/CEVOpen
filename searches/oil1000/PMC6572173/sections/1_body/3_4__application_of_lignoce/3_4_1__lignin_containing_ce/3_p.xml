<p class="p">Though the reports on lignin-containing cellulose-reinforced bioplastics are scarce, they are adequate to indicate their promising application in bioplastics in future. We might conclude that they might significantly affect and even determine whether direct use of lignocellulosic fibers in bioplastics will be achieved. They should be the hotspot in the future. Lignin-containing cellulosic nanofibrils would play a significant role in preparing the bioplastics with lignocellulosic fibers.</p>
