In the different cell walls, the arrangement of microfibrils is also different. Microfibrils are combined to form the cellulose fiber [

 <xref rid="B43-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Degree of polymerization of cellulose is between 1510 and 5500, which strengthens its crystallinity. Moreover, amorphous cellulose is non-organized, which takes up a small proportion. Crystalline cellulose is more resistant to degradation of enzyme compared to amorphous cellulose [
