<p class="p">Lignin differs from cellulose and hemicellulose as it contains aromatic rings rather than long molecular chains. Depending on the different plant and extraction process, lignin is characterized by diverse chemical structures [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The most essential differences are found in the monomer composition, linkage type and functional group in the lignin fragments [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Lignin is a polyphenolic macromolecule, which consists of three phenylpropane monomeric units, coniferyl alcohol(G), p-hydroxyphenyl alcohol(H), and sinapyl alcohol(S) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00751-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The coniferyl alcohol structure dominates in softwoods. Lignin in hardwood commonly contains both sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol structures with sinapyl alcohol dominant, while p-hydroxyphenyl alcohol structure predominates in lignin found in grasses [

 <xref rid="B47-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Different types of carbon-oxygen (aryl-ether) and carbon-carbon bonds are formed in different subunits of lignin. The most frequent bonds are the carbon-oxygen links between β-end of the propenyl group (β-O-4) and p-hydroxy moiety [

 <xref rid="B48-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Different percentages of chemical groups in the lignin molecule structure such as methoxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl et al. impart polarity to the lignin macromolecule. The dominant chemical groups are hydroxyl groups which are aliphatic or phenolic [

 <xref rid="B49-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. As the most recalcitrant component in lignocellulosic fibers, lignin is extremely resistant to enzymes and chemical impacts [
 <xref rid="B50-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Lignin does not dissolve in hot water, acids, and other solvents except alkalis [
