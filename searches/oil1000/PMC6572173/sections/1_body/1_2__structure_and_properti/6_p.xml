<p class="p">Broadly speaking, lignocellulosic fibers are made up of cellulose fibers reinforced by a matrix of hemicellulose and either lignin or pectin in one or more layers, with the volume fraction and orientation of the cellulose fibers varying in each layer [
 <xref rid="B42-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The cellulose molecules are hydrogen-bonded to hemicellulose. The cellulose-hemicellulose network is considered as the primary structural component of the fiber cell [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Then, lignin covalently linked to hemicellulose strengthens the structure of cellulose-hemicellulose [

 <xref rid="B63-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The hydrophobic lignin functions as a coupling agent filling in the voids that exist in the cellulose-hemicellulose network. Lignin improves the stiffness of the cellulose-hemicellulose network and protects cellulose fibers against biological attack and environmental pressure [

 <xref rid="B65-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Eight types of bonds are present in lignin-carbohydrate including benzyl ester, benzyl ether, hemiacetal or acetal linkages, glycosidic or phenyl glycosidic, and diferulate or ferulate esters which link with lignin at the 4-O and 4-OH positions [
