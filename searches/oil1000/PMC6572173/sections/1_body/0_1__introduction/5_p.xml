<p class="p">The first section of the review focuses on specific characterizations of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin. The second section summarizes the recent advances and issues of lignin in the development of bioplastics. The third section reviews some challenges inherent in the application of lignocellulosic fiber in bioplastics and the means attempted by researchers to modify their properties. Finally, we give an outlook on their future applications in bioplastics.</p>
