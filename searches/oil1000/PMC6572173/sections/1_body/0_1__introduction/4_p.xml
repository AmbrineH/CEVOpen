<p class="p">Recently, lignin-reinforced bioplastics have gained the attention of researchers around the world. Lignin is one of the three main ingredients in natural lignocellulosic materials. Lignin is second in plant biomass abundance after cellulose and the most plentiful natural aromatic resource [

 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Many studies are being conducted to use lignin in biocomposites including bioplastics because of its wide availability, good mechanical properties, biodegradability, besides the various modifications based on its chemical structure [
