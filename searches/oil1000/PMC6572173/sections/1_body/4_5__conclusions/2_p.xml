<p class="p">We can conclude that more studies should be directed at lignocellulosic fibers without removing lignin when preparing the bioplastics. However, the application of lignin in the bioplastics still has a prosperous future because of its various sources from paper-making and ethanol production. Due to some similar application issues in the bioplastics, such as complex structure, lignocellulosic fibers and lignin will promote and develop mutually in the future.</p>
