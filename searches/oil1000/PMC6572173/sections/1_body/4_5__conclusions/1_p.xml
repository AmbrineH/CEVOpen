<p class="p">In this review, the structures and properties of lignocellulosic fibers and lignin are characterized. Their recent advances and issues in making bioplastics are elaborated comprehensively. In conclusion, the lignin as reinforcements can produce bioplastics with high performance. Lignin has the possibility to function as a plasticizer, stabilizer, or bio-compatibilizer in bioplastics, which will produce different properties on bioplastics. In addition, lignin is modified to enhance its miscibility with biopolymers considerably by functionalization of hydroxyl groups. However, due to its complex structure, the ability to obtain technical lignin of a reduced degree of association is presently a very tough challenge for promoting the use of lignin in bioplastics. Although studies on the application of lignocellulosic fibers in bioplastics have been conducted extensively for many years, the low fiber-matrix compatibility is still not addressed. Recent research on cellulose-lignin and lignin-containing cellulosic fiber-reinforced bioplastics are very attractive and meaningful. Fiberâ€“matrix interactions by compatibilizer, crosslinking and proper fiber length are overcoming the low compatibility further. Simple modifications of lignocellulosic fibers, which do not extensively change the chemical content or composition of the fibers, are very promising for making more functional groups of fibers exposed for interaction with biopolymers.</p>
