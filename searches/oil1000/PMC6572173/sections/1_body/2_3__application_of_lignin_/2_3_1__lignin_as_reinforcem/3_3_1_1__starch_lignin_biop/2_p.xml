<p class="p">Blending starch with hydrophobic polymers typically increases the water resistance, mechanical strength and thermal stability of starch. Lignin is an obvious candidate for blending with starch because of its high miscibility [

 <xref rid="B85-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Films containing wheat starch and KL were produced by extrusion and hot molding. Stress-strain tests were used to evaluate the influence of lignin content on the mechanical properties of films at two ambient humidity. Stress and elongation at break increased slightly with 20% lignin and 58% relative humidity. Compared to the control group, a significant reduction of film resistance to elongation was observed at 71% relative humidity and 30% lignin. Water sorption isotherms and dissolution analysis revealed that lignin reduced the total water uptake of the films [
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Souza de Miranda et al. (2015) evaluated the morphological and mechanical properties of thermoplastic corn and cassava starch films, using lignin and glycerol as reinforcements and plasticizers. The results indicated that the addition of lignin significantly improved the elastic modulus and the maximum stress by about 4200% and 840%, respectively, compared to the sample without lignin. Moreover, lignin caused the rougher surface of the film, modified some structural properties, and improved thermal properties [
 <xref rid="B88-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Stevens et al. (2010) have prepared novel starch-KL foams. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) together revealed that there were significant starch–lignin interactions that stabilized residual structure in the starch. Lignin decreased water absorption of the foams. Starch–lignin foams prepared by the present method had approximately the same flexural strength as foamed polystyrene [
