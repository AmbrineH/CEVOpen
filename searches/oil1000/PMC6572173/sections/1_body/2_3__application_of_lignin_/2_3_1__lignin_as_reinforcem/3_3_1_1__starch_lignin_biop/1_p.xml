<p class="p">Starch is considered as the most widely used biopolymer as a replacement for conventional plastics due to advantages such as high abundance, low cost, renewability and its ability to be degraded without the formation of toxic residues [

 <xref rid="B85-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. In general, the properties of starch-lignin blends are mainly determined by the compatibility between their components. The lignin is dispersed into starch through the interactions of hydrogen bond. Films based on starch and lignin bioplastics reinforced by graphene oxide were fabricated by casting and solvent evaporation method successfully. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that a homogenous biocompatible blend matrix was formed through the presence of a hydrogen bond. After the introduction of graphene oxide, additional interactions were found between the hydroxyl groups of lignin and starch and the groups of graphene oxide containing oxygen, forming an interacted network. The properties of the resulting bio-nanocomposites such as water uptake, water swelling, hydrolytic degradation, water vapor permeability, mechanical and thermal properties were enhanced significantly due to these interactions [
