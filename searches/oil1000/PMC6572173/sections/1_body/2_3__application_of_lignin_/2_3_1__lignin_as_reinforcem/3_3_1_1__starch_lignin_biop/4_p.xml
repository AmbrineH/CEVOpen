<p class="p">The addition level and sources of lignin greatly influence the performance of starch bioplastics. The composition of lignin will also determine the final properties of the bioplastics at high lignin percentages. Many reports found the 10% of lignin content can produce the optimal performance of bioplastics. A biodegradable starch/lignin film was fabricated by corn starch and sodium lignosulfonates. The effect of lignosulfonates on hydrophobicity and the mechanical properties of films was identified. The ultimate stress was reduced, and the hydrophobicity of films was improved with the lignosulfonates to starch ratio increasing from 1:9 to 9:9. The results from a scanning electron microscope (SEM), FTIR, and XRD revealed that there was good compatibility among lignosulfonates, starch, and sorbitol [

Vengal and Srikumar (2005) reported the results of water absorption and tensile tests of different starch-lignin polymer films. The study adopted solution blending followed by curing for the preparation of the films. The optimal proportion of starch to lignin was 90:10, as it showed high Young’s modulus and tensile strength. The water uptake tests showed that the system was highly hydrophilic. The material was suitable for internal use and biomedical purposes [

Incorporating 10% lignosulfonates modified the tensile resistance of the films, independently of the composition of the lignosulfontes; When the addition of lignin was above 10%, sodium and calcium lignosulfonate-based films showed different mechanical performance.
