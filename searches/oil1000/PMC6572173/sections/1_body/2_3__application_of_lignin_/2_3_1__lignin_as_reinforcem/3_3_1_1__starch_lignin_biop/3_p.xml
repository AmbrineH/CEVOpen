<p class="p">To enhance the properties of starch–lignin bioplastics, starch is modified and then blended with lignin to make bioplastics. Starch-lignin biocomposites were fabricated with modified starch microparticles originating from cross-linked starch containing adipic acid and glycerol. The thermal stability and the water resistance of composites were increased via the introduction of lignin. Starch–lignin composite materials presented a lower elongation at break, but higher tensile strength compared with those without lignin [

The lignin with 5%, 10%, and 15% content was incorporated to improve the water resistance of the urea crosslinked starch films. To investigate the water uptake behavior, the produced films were placed in distilled water at three temperatures, 25, 35 and 45 °C. Lower water uptake equilibrium confirmed that the addition of lignin decreased water uptake effectively due to the hydrophobicity of lignin [
