<p class="p">The plasticization of lignin on starch is reported. Baumberger et al. (1998b) investigated that proportions of KL in starch bioplastics could lead to great changes of mechanical strength: high molecular weight led to very brittle materials whereas low molecular ones functioned as a plasticizer. The mechanical properties of the bioplastics were significantly affected by the low molecular weight lignin in small quantities due to the plasticizing effect [
