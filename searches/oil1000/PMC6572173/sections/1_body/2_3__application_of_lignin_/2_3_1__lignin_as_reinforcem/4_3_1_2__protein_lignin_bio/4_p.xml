The addition of KL resulted in increased Youngâ€™s modulus and mechanical strength, while the elongation at break remained constant. Water vapor sensitivity was reduced and

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> were unchanged in the presence of lignosulfonates. These effects were usually observed from plasticizers. It suggested that commonly used glycerol in WG could be replaced by lignosulfonates. The addition of lignosulfonates did not induce a decrease in the glass transition temperature or an increase in moisture absorption, which was different from the incorporation of glycerol [
