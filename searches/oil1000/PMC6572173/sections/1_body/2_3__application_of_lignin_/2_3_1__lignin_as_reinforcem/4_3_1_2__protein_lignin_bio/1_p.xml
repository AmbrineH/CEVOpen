<p class="p">As a natural polymer, proteins have long been used to produce bioplastics owing to their abundant, biodegradable, renewable, and environmentally friendly features [

 <xref rid="B94-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. However, the performance of bioplastics derived from protein such as water absorption, thermal stability and mechanical strength is relatively lower compared to other common plastics [

 <xref rid="B96-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Lignin has been evaluated to enhance the strength and water resistance as a filler in protein-based bioplastics. Strong hydrogen bonding between the amino acids of proteins and the functional groups of lignin generates a reconstruction of intra- and intermolecular interactions in secondary structures of β-turn, β-sheet, and R-helix. This restructuring produces an extensive conformational modification of protein which, conversely, causes a great increase on the physical properties of the biocomposites [
