<p class="p">Lignin can act as a stabilizer in protein-lignin bioplastics due to the radical scavenger activity of lignin. KL was mixed with WG and incorporated into materials by thermal molding. The results proposed a radical scavenger activity of KL to the thiyl radicals was observed during material mixing. Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the good connection of WG and KL [
 <xref rid="B99-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. Different concentrations of alkali lignin and lignosulfonates were introduced to enzymatically modified soy protein in order to improve physical and functional properties of the bioplastics. Compared to commercial butylated hydroxytoluene, alkaline lignin and lignosulfonates indicated typical radical scavenger activity, which presented possible potential application in active packaging. Due to the color of lignin, the blends with alkaline lignin revealed strong ability of ultraviolet (UV)-blocking. Compared to the control films without lignin, thermal stability and mechanical strength of the films including lignin were enhanced significantly [
