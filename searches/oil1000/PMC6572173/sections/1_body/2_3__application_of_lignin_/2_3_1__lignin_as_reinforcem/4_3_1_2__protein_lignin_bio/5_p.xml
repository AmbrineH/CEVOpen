<p class="p">In addition, colloidal lignin nanoparticles and lignin particles were coated by proteins and the composites were characterized. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron examined the morphology of individual lignin particles coated with protein. The enhanced adsorption ability to specified amino acid residues such as proline and serine was evidenced by FT-IR and capillary electrophoresis. As the surface chemistry of colloidal lignin particles was tailored by the protein corona, the colloidal lignin particles presented significant applications in bioplastics and biomedicine [
