<p class="p">Innovative PLA-lignin biocomposites are recommended due to the underlying interaction between the carboxyl groups of PLA and the hydroxyl groups of lignin [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The addition of lignin affects the thermal stability and tensile strength of PLA significantly. Wang et al. (2015) reported that the preparation of lignin/PLA-based fibers was attempted by melt spinning, thermal stabilization and carbonization of lignin/PLA fibers. The tensile modulus of the blended carbon fibers was improved by the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between PLA and lignin, confirmed by FT-IR and DSC. However, its tensile strength was decreased primarily attributed to numbers of voids produced in the thermal stabilization and carbonization processes [
 <xref rid="B110-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. The role of lignin as fillers in PLA-based polymeric composites was studied. PLA biocomposites with lignin contents from 5 to 15 wt % were fabricated by using injection molding. As the filler content increased, the tensile strength of the biocomposites fell. Compared to pure PLA, PLA-lignin biocomposites started to degrade at a little lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="B111-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. The effect of lignin loading on the mechanical and morphology properties of the obtained PLA-lignin biocomposites was identified. The addition of 7 wt % lignin resulted in a decrease in the tensile strength and an improvement of the Youngâ€™s modulus. The subsequent increase of lignin levels from 7 to 15 wt % generated a significant improvement of tensile strength [
