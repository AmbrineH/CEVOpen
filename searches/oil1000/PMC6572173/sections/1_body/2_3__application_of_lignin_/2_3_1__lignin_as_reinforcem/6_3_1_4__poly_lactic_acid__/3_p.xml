<p class="p">Aggregation of lignin at the nanoscale will also lead to poor properties of PLA-lignin bioplastics. PLA bionanocomposites, which were blended lignin nanoparticles with 0, 1 and 3 wt % contents, were fabricated by melt extrusion and solvent casting. A decreased tendency of tensile strength was observed in the biocomposites, ascribed to inhomogeneous dispersion of lignin nanoparticles; nonetheless, the introduction of lignin nanoparticles affected elongation at break of the biocomposites positively. Chemical, morphological and thermal properties confirmed that the PLA biocompositesâ€™ disintegration was limited by 1 wt % lignin nanoparticle content because of its hydrophobic nature. Rougher surface structure and aggregation led to higher degradation rate When the nanoparticles content rose up to 3 wt % [
