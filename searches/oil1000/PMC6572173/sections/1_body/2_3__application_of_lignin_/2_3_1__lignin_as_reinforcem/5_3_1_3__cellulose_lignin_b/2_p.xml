<p class="p">Cellulose and lignin play different parts in celluloseâ€“lignin bioplastics. In general, cellulose reinforces mechanical strength of the composites, while lignin reduces water uptake, improves thermal stability of the polymer matrix and assures the good dispersion of cellulose in biopolymers [

 <xref rid="B103-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. They can generate mutual effects on the bioplastics [
 <xref rid="B104-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. A number of bio-based composites based on starch, lignin and cellulose were fabricated from an ionic liquid, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and coagulated in a system without solvent. The study found that the mechanical strength of the biocomposites was evidently depending on the contents of lignin, starch and cellulose, resulting from the mutual supplement among different components. High gas barrier ability and great thermal stability were clearly observed in the biocomposites [
 <xref rid="B105-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Holo-cellulose and acid insoluble lignin of Pecan nutshell fiber were utilized as reinforcements of PLA-based bioplastics. Flexural tests demonstrated that modulus of holo-cellulose biocomposites increased by 25% in comparison with the pure biopolymer. Conversely, high ductility and improved elongation at break were provided by the acid insoluble lignin in the PLA bioplastics. Plain PLA showed higher resilience than all the other biocomposites owing to the low compatibility between lignin and PLA [
 <xref rid="B106-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Moreover, isolated lignin and holo-cellulose components were blended with PHB. PHB melt crystallization was facilitated by holo-cellulose in the cooling period as evidenced by DSC investigation, while this phenomenon was not influenced by lignin. The rheological investigation of PHB and PHB-based blends indicated polymer viscoelastic properties improved remarkably. The high melt viscosity of PHB/lignin sample hampered chain mobility. The research provided a new point of view regarding the impact of cellulose and lignin on PHB [
