<p class="p">The compatibility between cellulose and other hydrophobic biopolymers could be remarkably enhanced by the amphiphilic lignin with polar phenolic OH and non-polar hydrocarbon groups [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Therefore, lignin is a potential component for bio-compatibilizer [

 <xref rid="B64-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The addition of lignin could improve the compatibility between cellulose and matrix as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations. The impact properties are decreased, while Youngâ€™s modulus and tensile strength could be improved significantly [
