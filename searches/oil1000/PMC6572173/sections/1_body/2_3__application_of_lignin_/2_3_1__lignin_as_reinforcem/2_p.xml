<p class="p">The lignin molecule is relatively polar due to its numerous hydroxyl groups and generally presents good compatibility with polar polymer matrix. Therefore, lignin is immiscible with most polymers [

 <xref rid="B80-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. This is often related to strong intermolecular interactions of lignin which result in poorer interactions between the polymer and lignin. The resulting bioplastics show poor adhesion and dimensional stability [

 <xref rid="B60-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Moreover, lignin tends to aggregate in biopolymers owing to the p-p stacking of hydrogen bonding, its aromatic rings and van der Waals attractions between the polymer chains, which can impair the properties of the resulting composites. Consequently, the properties of the composites are determined by competitive interactions. Obviously, the interactions developed in the blends such as hydrogen bridges are not sufficient to form complete compatibility. The deformability of the blends might be compensated for by using the compatibilizers and coupling agents in the bioplastics [
