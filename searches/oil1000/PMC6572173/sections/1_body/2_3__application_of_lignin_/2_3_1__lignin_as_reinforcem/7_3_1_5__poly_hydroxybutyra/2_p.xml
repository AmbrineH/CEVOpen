<p class="p">Compatibility of the biocomposites is related to strong hydrogen bonding interaction present in the carbonyl groups of PHB and the phenol hydroxyl groups of lignin. The present studies indicate that good compatibility is achieved but the tensile strength and thermal stability are reduced. The miscibility and thermal properties of soda lignin and PHB bioplastics were explored. Intermolecular interactions between soda lignin and PHB in bioplastics with 40 wt % lignin content were enhanced remarkably as suggested by the DSC, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and SEM results. These results showed good correlation with the

The rheological and thermal properties of lignin and PHB bioplastics were examined and analyzed by DSC, TGA and rheological tests. The lignin reduced the thermal stability of PHB because the activation energy of decomposition decreased from 112 kJ·mol

The rheology data showed that lignin developed a single phase with PHB when lignin content was below 30 wt % and acted as a plasticizer (as indicated by scanning electron microscopy and glass transition temperature). The viscosity and elasticity were reduced in comparison to raw PHB. Phase separation took place in 60 wt % lignin content and thus the blend viscosities were increased and the ability to dissipate energy of the blends was decreased [
