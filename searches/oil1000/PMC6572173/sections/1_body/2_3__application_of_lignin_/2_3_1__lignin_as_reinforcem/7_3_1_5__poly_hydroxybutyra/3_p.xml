<p class="p">From the application of lignin with five biopolymers, we can see that when lignin functions as the reinforcement or plasticizer, opposite effects on mechanical strength and water uptake are induced. Whether lignin will act as the reinforcement or plasticizer is still not clearly studied. The different content and type of lignin incorporated into bioplastics will remarkably influence the properties of the resulting bioplastics. The starch, protein and cellulose reinforced bioplastics with the addition of lignin commonly generate better water resistance, tensile strength and thermal stability, while PLA and PHB with the presence of lignin show lower tensile strength and thermal stability. This phenomenon might be associated with the different structure and properties of biopolymers. Compatibilizers and crosslinkers promote the effect of lignin in these bioplastics by increasing compatibility. The addition content of lignin in these bioplastics can be as high as 10â€“30% with intended application, which holds potential alternative to substitute the biopolymers. The introduction of lignin nanoparticle is limited within 3% content due to the stronger intermolecular interaction than the interaction between lignin and other biopolymers, especially when the bioplastics are produced by melt extrusion. In order to avoid secondary particles aggregation, incorporation of lignin must use lignin slurry instead of powder in the process of preparation [
