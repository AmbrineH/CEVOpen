<p class="p">Polyhydroxyalkanoates are made up of a set of linear and biodegradable aliphatic polyesters with R-(-)-3-hydroxyalkanoate dominant. They provide important energy and carbon storage sources to a variety of bacteria and algae. The most widely used unit in the Polyhydroxyalkanoates family is the PHB [
