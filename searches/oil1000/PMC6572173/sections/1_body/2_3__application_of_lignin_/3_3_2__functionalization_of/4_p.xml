<p class="p">PHB/modified lignin biocomposites are investigated by several reports. Thermal and mechanical tests described these biocomposites extensively. Acetylation modification using acetic anhydride was conducted on extracted rice husk lignin by the means of acidolytic method. Then the modified lignin was utilized to manufacture the PHB biocomposites with the solvent-casting method. The data found that thermo-oxidative degradation of the PHB was strongly interfered with by the acidolytic sample. Enhanced thermal stability was demonstrated, depending on the lignin amount in the bioplastics [

The lignin core was grafted with Î²-butyrolactone by ring-opening polymerization that was solvent-free. Nanofibers were produced by blending PHB with different amounts of lignin-PHB copolymers through electrospinning. Original PHB exhibited much higher mechanical properties than the lignin-PHB nanofibers. The greatest mechanical properties were demonstrated in nanofibers reinforced with 2% lignin copolymer. In addition, tunable antioxidant activity was indicated in the lignin/PHB nanofibers, which can be employed to neutralize extra free radicals in vivo. The non-irritating and biocompatible lignin/PHB nanofibers were also revealed by the animal experiments. As a result, the lignin/PHB nanofibers held possible applications in biomedicine [
 <xref rid="B120-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. A lignin-polycaprolactone copolymer was synthesized through the ring-opening polymerization without solvent. To improve their mechanical properties, these lignin-polycaprolactone copolymers as reinforcement fillers were combined with PHB nanofibers. It was shown that the lignin copolymer with PHB nanofibers revealed the optimal mechanical strength. Elongation at break of PHB nanofibers enhanced from 15% of 55%, and tensile strength increased from 1.81 to 3.13 MPa. Lignin acted a rigid core, polycaprolactone played as a rubbery layer in the complex system and fiber matrix formed strong hydrogen bonding with PHB nanofibers. In addition, lignin/PHB nanofibers with superior biocompatibility and biodegradability were demonstrated, displaying that the novel nanofibrous composites showed important applications in biomedicine [
