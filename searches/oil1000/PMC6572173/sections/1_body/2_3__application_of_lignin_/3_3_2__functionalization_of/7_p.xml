<p class="p">In general, modified lignin, which commonly involves complex reactions or toxic materials, shows better adhesion and enhanced properties in the bioplastics compared to pure lignin. However, its application in industry needs to consider the cost and benefit comprehensively because bioplastics demand low cost of production. More environmentally friendly methods and technologies of lignin modification are required urgently.</p>
