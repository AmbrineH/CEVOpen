<p class="p">Thermoplastic starch (TPS)/esterified lignin composites improve the mechanical properties compared to TPS. Esterified lignin was used as fillers in the TPS matrix. The TPS/lignin bioplastics were fabricated by compression molding; 5 wt % lignin content was used in the composites. The TPS/esterified lignin and TPS/KL bioplastics presented higher tensile strength than that of the TPS by about 32% and 17%, respectively. Moreover, water uptake properties decreased significantly owing to the existence of lignin in the TPS bioplastics [
 <xref rid="B133-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. A hydroxy-methylated alkali lignin/corn starch cross-linked film was produced. Results showed elongation at break and tensile strength of the corn starch film were lower than that of the composite film. In addition, thermal stability of the lignin/starch bioplastics at high temperatures was improved. The water uptake ability of lignin/starch bioplastics was 1.3 times of the TPS. Hence, the resulting lignin/starch biocomposites could be utilized as a biodegradable material for agricultural mulching and packaging [
 <xref rid="B134-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. Thermoplastic starch and layered double hydroxide obtained from lignosulfonates showed excellent dispersion in the nanoscale, with lignin concentrations between 1 and 4 wt %. Thus, the lignin was a promising bio-based reinforcement for TPS [
