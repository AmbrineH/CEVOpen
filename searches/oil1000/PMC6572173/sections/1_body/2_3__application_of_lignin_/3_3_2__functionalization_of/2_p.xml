<p class="p">Functionalization of hydroxyl groups of lignin is typically used to render it suitable for the intended applications by altering the surface character of lignin [
 <xref rid="B125-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Two types of functionalization of the hydroxyl groups have been carried out. The first method is by connecting the hydroxyl groups of lignin with biopolymer chains, thus improving ligninâ€™s reactivity. The second method involves alkylation or esterification reactions in hydroxyl groups, which facilitates the compatibility of biopolymer matrices with lignin [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. As a result, the amount of hydroxyl groups will be reduced and hence the water resistance of the blends is greatly improved [
