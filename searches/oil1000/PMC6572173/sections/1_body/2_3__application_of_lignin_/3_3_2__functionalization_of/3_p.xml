<p class="p">To improve the properties of PLA-based bioplastics, lignin is modified and then processed in the bioplastics. The thermal stability, mechanical strength, and antimicrobial properties show different changes depending on the different modification of lignin. Dodecanoyl chloride fatty acid was used to modify lignin obtained from Organosolv process. Different concentrations of esterified lignin (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50%) was incorporated into PLA bioplastics produced by solvent casting. Thermal, water barrier and mechanical properties of resulting films were studied. Esterified lignin still had the phenolic radical scavenging property. The introduction of modified lignin contributed to lower stiffness and greater ductility, which provided plasticity to PLA [
 <xref rid="B126-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. Different proportions (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10% and 20%) of Organosolv lignin and commercial alkali lignin were prepared from almond shells and used to prepare PLA blends by the extrusion method. In order to improve their compatibility with PLA, both lignin was acetylated. The thermal stability of PLA bioplastics was improved by lignin content. Maximum strength decreased as original lignin content increased. However, even at high lignin content, mechanical strength of PLA/acetylated lignin bioplastics still remained unchanged. The elongation at break increased in all composites [
 <xref rid="B127-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. PLA was combined with alkylated lignin (contents from 10% to 50%) to synthesize copolymers by ring-opening polymerization. Nanofibrous composites were fabricated by combining these PLA-lignin copolymers with grafted PLA by electrospinning. The outstanding compatibility between the PLA-lignin and grafted PLA was displayed clearly in nanoscale. The mechanical properties of the bionanocomposites were not enhanced by the introduction of PLA-lignin copolymers, which was different from bulk materials. Copolymers or nanofibers with the lignin all presented prominent radical scavenging capacity for more than 72 h as shown by antioxidant assay. Owing to excellent biocompatibility and antioxidant activities, the grafted PLA/PLA-lignin blends showed potent possibilities as biomedical materials to prevent the cells against oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B128-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Original lignin was grafted with PLA directly using ring-opening polymerization. Controllable chain lengths of PLA in Lignin-g-PLA biocomposites were produced in the graft polymerization process, catalyzed by triazabicyclodecene. With the content of lignin increasing from 10% to 50%, glass transition temperatures of the grafted biocomposites increased from 45 to 85Â°C. An increase in the tensile strength (+16%) and strain (+9%) was shown after the existence of lignin copolymers without a sacrifice of the tensile modulus [

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> of PLA/B-lignin biocomposites was revealed by DSC analysis, indicating a highly compatible blend. The impact of PLA on the lignin thermal degradation was offered by TGA curves. Considering lignin content, storage modulus and overall high compatibility, PLA/B-lignin 25/75 biocomposites may be the optimal percentage to produce carbon fiber in the future [
