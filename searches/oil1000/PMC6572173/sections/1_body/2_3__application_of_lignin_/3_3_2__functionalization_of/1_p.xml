<p class="p">High polydispersity is one of the major problems affecting the applications of lignin. Lignin is commonly treated to enhance its compatibility with biopolymers or to modify its dispersibility in the polymer blends [
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Based on functional groups and complex structure, modification of lignin to enhance the properties of lignin mainly uses the following approaches: modifying the structure by functionalization of hydroxyl groups, decreasing the molecular weight by depolymerization, and isolating lignin fragments with a specified molecular weight and structure [

 <xref rid="B122-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Lignin depolymerization is a very promising process that can generate value-added low weight molecules for fuels and basic chemicals or oligomers for further application [

 <xref rid="B124-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. For example, the impact of diverse lignin derived from a solvent fractionation technique on cellulose-starch bioplastics was reported by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B125-polymers-11-00751" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. This research emphasized the lignin diversities on biocomposites properties, indicating that ligninâ€™s applications in bioplastics were determined by their specific features.
