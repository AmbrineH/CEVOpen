 <italic class="italic">L monocytogenes</italic> was resistant to ampicillin and penicillin as the first-choice antibiotics used for treatment of human listeriosis. Erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are generally used for treatment of listeriosis in pregnant women and patients having allergy to penicillin, respectively. In this study, 
 <italic class="italic">L monocytogenes</italic> was susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that is in agreement with the previous reports.
