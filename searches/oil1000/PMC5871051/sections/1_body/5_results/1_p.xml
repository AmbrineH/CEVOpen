<p class="p">In the present study, using cultural techniques, 2 of 106 samples (1.88%) were positive for 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic> strains. No 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic> was isolated from fresh fish samples. In contrast, 2 shrimp (5%) samples were contaminated with 
 <italic class="italic">L monocytogenes</italic> (2.5%) and 
 <italic class="italic">L grayi</italic> (2.5%). The resistance pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic> spp isolates to 16 antibiotics tested in this study is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2515690X17751314" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The 2 isolates (100%) were multidrug resistant. In addition, 2 isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. The 
 <italic class="italic">L monocytogenes</italic> was more sensitive to antibiotics than 
 <italic class="italic">L grayi</italic>.
