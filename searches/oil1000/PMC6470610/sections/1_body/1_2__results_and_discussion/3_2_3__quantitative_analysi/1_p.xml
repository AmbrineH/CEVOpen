 <xref rid="molecules-24-01138-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) provided very similar quantitative results as well as those with the lower relaxing times, thus demonstrating the method’s ruggedness. In particular, 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR seems to slightly underestimate the CBD and CBG content with respect to HPLC, since this situation occurs for every cultivar. The mean recovered amounts of CBD and CBDA were significantly higher respect those of CBG and CBGA; this finding is supported by other studies, in which the measured concentrations for these cannabinoids were undetectable or very low [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In the majority of samples (Antal, Carmagnola, China, Fibrante, Futura and Santhica), the acidic compounds were more concentrated with respect to their neutral counterparts, demonstrating that the extraction method is able to limit the decarboxylation process. Codimono was the cultivar which provided the highest content of CBD, while Futura was the one with the highest amount of CBDA. With regards to CBG, only one hemp variety (Santhica) showed a concentration over the LOQ value. CBGA contents were determined instead for Antal, Carmagnola, Futura and Santhica, with the latter two varieties being the richest ones.
