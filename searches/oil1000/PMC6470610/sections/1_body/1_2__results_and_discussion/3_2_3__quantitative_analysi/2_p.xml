<p class="p">The 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR method here proposed for the quantification of non-psychoactive cannabinoids in hemp provided reliable results in comparison to the most commonly and consolidated HPLC technique. The validation confirmed the ruggedness of this qNMR approach, which was found to be precise and sufficiently sensitive. In conclusion, this 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR method is suitable and advantageous for a multi-component analysis of cannabinoids in hemp extracts. This technique could be useful to gain a holistic view of the composition and chemical profile of different hemp varieties, and it could be applied in the quality control of both the plant material and its derivatives.
