<p class="p">The Concentration Conversion Factor (CCF), obtained from the analysis of standards and used by the software to calculate the concentration of compounds in samples, was measured in the range of expected concentrations, by diluting a CBD standard solution. The CCF value was constant (0.71605 ± 0.00004) in all the considered concentration ranges, thus assuring a good linearity (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9998). The method proposed here provided also a good intra- and inter-day precision, with percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) values of 0.8 and 1.5%, respectively. With regards to the limit of detection (LOD), in these experimental conditions the lowest concentrations which presented clearly distinguishable signals from the spectral background were 0.6, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.5 mM for CBD, CBDA, CBG and CBGA, respectively, corresponding to LOD values of 188, 180, 190 and 180 μg/mL in the NMR tube. The lowest quantification limits (LOQ), by applying the below mentioned S/N restriction, corresponded to 2.11, 2.15, 2.10 and 2.18 mM for CBD, CBDA, CBG and CBGA, respectively, with relative LOQ values of 660, 746, 664 and 746 μg/mL in the NMR tube.
