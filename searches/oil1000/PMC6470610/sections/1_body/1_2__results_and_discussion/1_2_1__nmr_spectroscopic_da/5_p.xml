<p class="p">In order to reduce the impact of these issues, the following measures were applied. With regards to the sensitivity problem, it was possible to acquire spectra of concentrated hemp extracts without disregarding the spectrum quality in terms of resolution, intensity and resonance shifting, due to the matrix effect. To overcome the issue related to 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C long relaxation time, T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> for each carbon of standard compounds was tentatively measured. Some of the nuclei did not provide results in an acceptable time, due to the molecule structure or to the low amount of standard available (CBDA and CBGA). For this reason, only signals with T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> &lt; 2 s were initially selected for quantification (marked with * in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01138-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, some characteristic signals with T1 &gt; 2 s were also tentatively used for the two acidic compounds (marked with ** in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01138-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Finally, a pulse delay (D
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) equal to 10 s (5*T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) was used. This parameter allowed us to obtain the full relaxation in an acceptable time, thus making possible to perform the analysis in a competitive time (47 min) with respect to the most common HPLC technique. The last question was solved by lowering to zero the proton decoupling power.
