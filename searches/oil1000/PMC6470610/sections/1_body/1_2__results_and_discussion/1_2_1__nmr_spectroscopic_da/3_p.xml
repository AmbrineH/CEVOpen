In this context, in these experimental conditions evident signal doubling, due to conformational equilibria, and line broadening did not occur. In particular, all the signals used for CBD and CBG quantification showed a measured average half width of 1.25 Hz (maximum 1.5 Hz). CBDA and CBGA signals were slightly broader; in this case, the average half width was 3.3 Hz (maximum 4 Hz). This line broadening effect did not invalidate or affect the quantification of these compounds, considering that the differences between qNMR and HPLC data are limited and not significant (
