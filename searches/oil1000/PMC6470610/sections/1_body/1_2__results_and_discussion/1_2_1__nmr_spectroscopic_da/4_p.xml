<p class="p">On the other hand, it is well known that 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR presents some complexities, which often makes the use of this technique quite problematic. In particular, the major issues related to 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR are:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">low sensitivity, due to the lower 
    <sup class="sup">13</sup>C isotopic abundance (1%) in comparison to 
    <sup class="sup">1</sup>H;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">carbons typically have long T
    <sub class="sub">1</sub> relaxation time; in this way, signals could not reach their full intensity;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">the 
    <sup class="sup">13</sup>C signal intensity is affected by the Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) effect, that depends on 
    <sup class="sup">13</sup>C type (from primary to quaternary).
