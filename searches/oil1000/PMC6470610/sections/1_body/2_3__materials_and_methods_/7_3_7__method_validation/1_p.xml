 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the attention was focused on the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR method in the present work. Linearity was investigated by analyzing both standard solutions at different concentrations (from 2 to 100 mM) and a sample prepared with different dilution factors. Linearity was evaluated by calculating the CCF of the selected signals for quantitative analysis in the aforementioned samples and verifying its constancy inside the concentration range. Precision was assessed by analyzing the same extract five times for three different days. The LOD for the target compounds (CBD, CBDA, CBG and CBGA) was determined by gradually diluting a sample containing measurable amounts of the four molecules, until a S/N ratio equal to 3 was reached. Since only signals with a S/N ratio &gt; 50 were considered to be suitable for quantification, the LOQ value was calculated by considering the area of a signal with a S/N equal to 49.
