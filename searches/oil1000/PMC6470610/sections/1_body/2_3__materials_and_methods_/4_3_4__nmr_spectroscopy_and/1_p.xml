 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired with a Bruker FT-NMR Avance III HD 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin GmbH Rheinstetten, Karlsruhe, Germany). All the experiments were performed at 300 K and non-spinning. The assignments for the major compounds were carried out by using standard compounds and by comparison of
