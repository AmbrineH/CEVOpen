 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR quantification experiments were performed by using a 1D inverse gated decoupling sequence to avoid NOE during relaxation (Bruker sequence: “zgpg_pisp_f2.fas”). The acquisition parameters were as follows: time domain (number of data points), 64 K; dummy scans, 10; number of scans, 256; acquisition time, 1 s; delay time, 10 s; spectral width, 220 ppm (33333 Hz); fid resolution, 1.017 Hz; digitization mode, baseopt; the proton decoupling power, 0 db. Total acquisition time was 47 min.
