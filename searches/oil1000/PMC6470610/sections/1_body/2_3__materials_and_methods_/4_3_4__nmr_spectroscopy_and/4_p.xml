<p class="p">The acquisition parameters for the HMBC experiments (Bruker sequence “hmbcetgpl3nd” with three-fold low-pass J-filter to suppress one-bond-correlations) were as follows: time domain, 4 K in the acquisition or direct HMBC dimension F2 (
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H) and 256 in indirect HMBC dimension F1 (
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C); dummy scans, 16; number of scans, 8; acquisition time, 0.310 s; delay time, 1.5 s; delay time for evolution of long range couplings, 62.5 μs; spectral width, 11 ppm (6602 Hz) in F2 (
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H) and 210 ppm (31692 Hz in F1) (
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C); fid resolution, 3.22 Hz (F2) 247.60 Hz (F1); digitization mode, baseopt. J-coupling for one-bond correlations suppression: 1J (XH) Min 120 Hz, 1J (XH) Max 170 Hz; J (XH) long range, 8 Hz. Total acquisition time was 1 h and 5 min.
