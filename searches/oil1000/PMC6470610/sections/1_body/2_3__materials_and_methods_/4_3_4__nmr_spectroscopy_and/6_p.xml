<p class="p">After introducing the sample into the probe, at least 5 min were required to achieve a thermal equilibrium. Afterwards, the magnetic field was locked, the probe head was tuned and matched and, finally, the sample was shimmed. To assure the highest reproducibility, all these procedures were automatically executed. The correct 90° pulse was calibrated for protonic and bi-dimensional spectra with the Bruker AU program “pulsecal” and the receiver gain was set.</p>
