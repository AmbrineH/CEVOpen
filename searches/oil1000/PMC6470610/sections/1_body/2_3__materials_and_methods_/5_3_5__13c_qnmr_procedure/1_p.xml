<p class="p">Quantitative NMR was performed by using the Concentration Conversion Factor (CCF) method, implemented in Mnova® 12.0 (Mestrelab Research, S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain) software. A CBD standard solution (1 mg/mL) was used as the external reference compound. The CCF provided by this analysis was verified and corrected by using a commercial standard of 40% dioxane in benzene-

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C sensitivity test; in our case, the signal at 66.69 ppm (corresponding to the four equivalent carbons) was used for the quantification. In order to determine the correct delay time (D

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> was measured for both dioxane and the standard compounds, when possible. In the case of acidic compounds, the T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> of the signals related to the presence of carboxylic groups was directly estimated in the sample richest in CBDA and CBGA. For T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> determination, the Bruker Sequence “T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>IR” was employed. The following parameters were applied: a list of 8 increasing delay times (from 0.2 to 20 s); delay time, 20 s; number of scans, 32; total acquisition time, 2 h. A D
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> time equal to 10 s (5*T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) was set 
 <styled-content style="color:#131413" class="styled-content">t</styled-content>o ensure the nuclei complete relaxation during acquisition. Moreover, only signals presenting a signal to noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 50 were used for quantification. An exponential window function, with a line broadening (lb) equal to 0.3, was selected for spectra transformation. Each spectrum was calibrated according to TMS signal and then an automatic zero order phase and base line correction were applied, before peak integration. The quantification tool of Mnova requires a multiplet analysis for the integration; therefore, after the initial spectra processing, a manual multiplet analysis was performed and the peak area of signals belonging to the target compounds were compared to the area of those generated by the CBD standard solution, whose spectrum was acquired under the same conditions. The results were then corrected with the correction factor obtained from the dioxane standard solution. The resonances suitable for quantification are marked with * in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01138-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In general, more than one signal should be integrated for each compound. In the cases of CBD and CBDA, eight carbons having the required characteristics were chosen and they were used to calculate the average concentration of related compounds. For CBG and CBGA, six resonances were selected. In addition, both CBDA and CBGA showed three well resolved peaks, in the region ranging from 160 to 180 ppm, related to the presence of the carboxylic group on the aromatic ring, which were also used for quantification and they are marked with ** in
