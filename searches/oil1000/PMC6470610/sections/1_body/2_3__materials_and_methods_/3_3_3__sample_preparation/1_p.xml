<p class="p">Hemp inflorescences were manually separated from twigs and seeds. After this procedure, the samples were stored at +4.0 Â°C until analysis. Cannabinoids were extracted from hemp inflorescences by means of dynamic maceration, as previously described in detail [

A weighed amount of each sample (1 g) was extracted with 20 mL of absolute EtOH at room temperature for 15 min, under magnetic stirring. The solution was then paper filtered and the residue was extracted with the same procedure twice more with 20 and 10 mL of same solvent, respectively. The filtrates were then combined and adjusted to 50 mL with EtOH in a volumetric flask. The extraction procedure was repeated twice for each sample.
