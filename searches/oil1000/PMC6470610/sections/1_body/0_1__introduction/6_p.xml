<p class="p">Quantitative NMR (qNMR) refers to the application of NMR in order to determine the concentration of one or more target compounds in solution. The underlying principle is the direct proportional correlation of the area of a signal to the number of nuclides contributing to it. This proportionality depends on pulse excitation, delay time and broad-band decoupling; therefore, constant conditions are necessary [

Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the application of qNMR, due to its numerous advantages over chromatographic methods. Indeed, qNMR enables the simultaneous identification and quantification of many analytes, also chemically very different, in complex mixtures with a reduced time of analysis and a lower solvent usage, compared with the HPLC technique [
