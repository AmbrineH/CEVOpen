<p class="p">In the light of all the above, the aim of this study was the development of a reliable 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR method for the comprehensive characterisation and determination of the main non-psychoactive cannabinoids (CBD, CBDA, CBG, CBGA) in eight different hemp varieties. The obtained results were compared with those provided by a previously developed method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-qNMR method developed in this study for the first time produced satisfactory results in a competitive time with respect to the most widespread and consolidated technique for cannabinoid analysis (HPLC), thus demonstrating to be suitable for a multi-component analysis of hemp extracts. This technique could also be useful to gain a holistic view of the composition and chemical profile of different hemp varieties, and it can be applied for the quality control of both the plant material and derivatives.
