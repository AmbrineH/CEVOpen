<p class="p">Hemp non-psychoactive cannabinoids include cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG) and their related acids, that accumulate principally within glandular trichomes of female inflorescences [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) are biosynthesized in plants as prenylated aromatic carboxylic acids and their neutral counterparts (CBD and CBG) are generated as a consequence of the spontaneous decarboxylation that can occur either by heat or light for instance during long storage processes [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This assumption is supported by the fact that almost no neutral cannabinoid can be detected in the fresh plant material [
