<p class="p">In addition to separation techniques involving chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be applied to the analysis of the composition of plant extracts, in the structure elucidation of compounds in metabolomics as well as in their quantification [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The measuring principle is based on the effect of an external magnetic field on spin possessing atomic nuclei 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C. Due to changes in the intramolecular magnetic field around an atom, absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation take place. Then, the resonance is detected with a radio receiver. The Fourier transform converts the complex time domain signal emitted by the nuclei into the frequency domain spectrum.
