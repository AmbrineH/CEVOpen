 <p class="p">In this study, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay musts, and fruit juices from cherry, kiwi, peach, and strawberry were co-fermented with 
  <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> EC1118 and 
  <italic class="italic">Torulaspora delbrueckii</italic> UMY196 at two different proportions (80:20 (
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and 60:40 (
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>)). The most pleasant fruit-based drink was obtained with Cabernet Sauvignon must and kiwi juice in a proportion of 60:40 and fermented with 
  <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic>. This beverage was produced in higher volume to simulate a scale-up, and the aromatic profile, sensory description, and consumer acceptability were determined. The most powerful odorants of the kiwi-based drink were ethyl octanoate, phenylethanal, ethyl hexanoate, vinyl-guaiacol, benzaldehyde, and nonanal, for which the odor activity values were 21.1, 3.3, 2.6, 2.2, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. These findings were in accordance with the sensory analysis, since the emerged descriptors were fruity (ethyl octanoate), honey and floral (phenylethanal), apple and peach (ethyl hexanoate), and citrus (nonanal). The consumers judged the kiwi-based drink acceptable (67%) and 39% of them would buy it. The reliable fermentation of a grape must/fruit juice was demonstrated. The kiwi-based drink represents an innovative and pleasant beverage with a positive impact on sustainability as its production can limit the loss of fresh fruits, as well as contribute to the enological field.
