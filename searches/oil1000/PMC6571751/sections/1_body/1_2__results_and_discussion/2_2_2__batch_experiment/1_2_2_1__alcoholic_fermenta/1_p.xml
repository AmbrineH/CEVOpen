<p class="p">The Cabernet Sauvignon/kiwi blend had the chemical characteristics shown in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00086-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The yeast inoculum resulted similar to the one performed during the preparation of flasks (5.8 ± 1.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> vs. 6.2 ± 1.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL). A higher amount of g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L was developed in 48 h during the fermentation in batch in comparison to the fermentation in flask (28.5 ± 5.4 vs. 8.97 ± 0.53 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L produced in two days). The faster alcoholic fermentation could be due to the sampling, which was carried out by opening the bottles, leading to a possible aeration of must. This could favor the synthesis of essential fatty acids and sterols required for yeast replication [
 <xref rid="B15-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and, consequently, the fermentation rate could increase.
