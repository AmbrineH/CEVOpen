<p class="p">Twenty glycosylated aroma compounds were detected and are listed in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00086-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Their concentrations decreased from the beginning of AF, in particular those of benzyl alcohol, 2-hexanal, 4-vinyl guaicol, and 3-oxo-Î±-ionol. Our findings suggest that the strain of 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> used for the AF could perform a glycosidase activity, as reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B27-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Further investigation will be carried out to confirm this activity.
