<p class="p">The contents of the aromatic compounds were monitored in the must/kiwi juice mix and during the AF, on the third, seventh, and 17th days (decanting), allowing us to follow the evolution of aromas. Fifty-seven free aroma compounds were detected (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00086-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Except for aldehydes, the fermentation was fundamental for the aromatic complexity of the drink [
 <xref rid="B16-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In fact, most of the free aromas were already found in the must/kiwi juice mix, and 33 free aromas (out of 57 compounds detected) increased just on the third day. Their concentrations were relatively unchanged during the fermentation with the exception of 3,4-dimethyl pentanol, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl hexadecanoate, ethyl hydrogen succinate, and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-linalool oxide, for which higher amounts were found on the seventh day. For some of the free aromas, the slight decreases observed may be caused by the bottle opening for the sampling and, except for aldehydes and acids, they were not statistically significant. The most powerful odorants of the kiwi-based drink were ethyl octanoate, phenylethanal, ethyl hexanoate, vinyl-guaiacol, benzaldehyde, and nonanal, for which the odor activity values (OAVs) were 21.1, 3.3, 2.6, 2.2, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Ethyl octanoate and ethyl hexanoate are esters derived from the enzymatic activity of yeasts, confirming that the use

 <xref rid="B17-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Comparing the aromatic composition of wines obtained from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and one of two kiwi fruit juices and purees [
 <xref rid="B18-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], we can hypothesize that phenylethanal and nonanal derive from kiwi juice, as they were not present in Cabernet Sauvignon wines analyzed by the cited authors. All the other compounds originated from the fermentative activity of yeasts, since varietal aromas specific to the Cabernet Sauvignon variety were not detected. This highlights that kiwi juice can positively influence the aromatic profile of the final grape/kiwi-based drink.
