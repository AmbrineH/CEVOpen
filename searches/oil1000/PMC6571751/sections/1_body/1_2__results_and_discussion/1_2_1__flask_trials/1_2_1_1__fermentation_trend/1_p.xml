<p class="p">The trend of alcoholic fermentation (AF) was monitored for each must/fruit juice mix.

 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> started the AF in 24 h, producing the following averages: (i) from Cabernet musts/fruit-based mixes, 10.90 ± 0.40 and 12.55 ± 0.70 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L in 80:20 and 60:40 proportions, respectively; (ii) from Chardonnay musts/fruit-based mixes, 12.35 ± 0.95 and 13.55 ± 0.08 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L in 80:20 and 60:40 proportions, respectively. The AF started in 48 h with 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> reaching similar values of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L as the corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> trials: (i) from Cabernet musts/fruit-based mixes, 10.49 ± 3.35 and 13.84 ± 4.39 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L in 80:20 and 60:40 proportions, respectively; (ii) from Chardonnay musts/fruit-based mixes, 11.55 ± 2.73 and 13.26 ± 2.16 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/L in 80:20 and 60:40 proportions, respectively. While the AF carried out with 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> ended in 3–10 days, depending on the grape/fruit-based mix, 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> completed the AF in a longer time (9–33 days) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00086-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> showed a comparable fermentative profile for all types of fruit. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic>, the fermentative trend with kiwi was significantly slower, regardless of the grape–kiwi juice proportion and combination. Since all inocula were standardized at the same cell concentration (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) (data not shown), this result needs further investigation.
