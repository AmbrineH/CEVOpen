<p class="p">At the end of AF, the concentrations of sugar, ethanol, and organic acids, as well as the pH and total acidity, were determined; the characteristics of all final products are summarized in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00086-t0A1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table A1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00086-f0A1" class="xref">Figure A1</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-metabolites-09-00086" class="xref">Appendix A</xref>). The decrease in tartaric acid found for the cherry-, peach-, and kiwi-based drinks could be due to either salification or precipitation phenomena [
 <xref rid="B12-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A drop of malic acid was detected particularly for the cherry-based drinks. This finding needs further investigation since the contribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> in malic acid decrease can be excluded because it lacks a specific system for malic acid transport. An increase in total acidity was found, especially in trials where 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> was inoculated. This could be due to the higher concentrations of succinic acid responsible for an increase in titratable acidity during fermentation [
 <xref rid="B13-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> was a higher producer of succinic acid than 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> during the fermentation of must [
 <xref rid="B11-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]; further studies will be carried out to clarify the behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> during the co-fermentation of grape must and fruit juice.
