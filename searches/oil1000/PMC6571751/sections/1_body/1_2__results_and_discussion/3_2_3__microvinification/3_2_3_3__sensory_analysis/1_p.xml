<p class="p">The descriptiveâ€“quantitative profile was evaluated for the final product from microvinification. Moreover, in order to reach the target amount of sugars (30 g/L), reducing the perception of acidity, the drink produced with microvinification was supplemented with 22.4 g/L sucrose. Since the aromas were already produced after three days of fermentation, it is plausible that the addition of sugar at this step could attenuate the perception of acidity and affect the aromatic profile to a relatively low extent. Nevertheless, further steps of scaling-up will optimize the technological operation to stop the fermentation at the required sugar content. The two kiwi-based drinks were tasted by an expert panel that identified the following descriptors: coppery color for the visual perception, peach, floral, passion fruit, and honey for the olfactory perception, and citrus, fruity, apple, and fruit salad for the retro-olfactory perception. Sweetness, acidity, bitterness, olfactory flavor intensity, viscosity, and aromatic intensity were also evaluated.</p>
