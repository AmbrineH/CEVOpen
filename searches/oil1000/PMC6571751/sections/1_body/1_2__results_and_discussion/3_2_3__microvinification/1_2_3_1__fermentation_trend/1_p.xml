<p class="p">The Cabernet Sauvignon/kiwi blend used for the microvinification experiments was characterized by slightly lower contents of sugar and tartaric acid (

Possibly due to the fermentation temperature set at 18 ± 1 °C, the trend of fermentation showed a more prolonged lag phase; indeed, only after five days of fermentation, a similar amount of CO
