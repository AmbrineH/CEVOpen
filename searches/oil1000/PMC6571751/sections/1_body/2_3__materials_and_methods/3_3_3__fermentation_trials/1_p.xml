<p class="p">Grape/fruit-based drinks were produced through alcoholic fermentation (AF). Must/fruit juice mixes were tested in proportions of 80:20 (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and 60:40 (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) for each must and juice collected, for a total of 48 grape/fruit-based drinks. The level of readily assimilable nitrogen (RAN) was measured in must/fruit juice mixes. If necessary, ammonium sulfate was added prior to the yeast inoculum adjusting the RAN content at 200 mg/L. The AF was carried out in a flask (200 mL) at 25 ± 1 °C and it was daily monitored by weight loss until no weight change was observed after two consecutive days. At the end of AF, the drinks were centrifuged at 5000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min at 10 °C (Beckman, CA, USA), removing the yeast cells, followed by the addition of potassium metabisulfite (50 mg/L), before being stored at 4 ± 1 °C.
