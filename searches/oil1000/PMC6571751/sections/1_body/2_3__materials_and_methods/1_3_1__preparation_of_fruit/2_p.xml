<p class="p">The fruit juices were obtained from cherry (
 <italic class="italic">Prunus avium</italic> var. Durone nero di Vignola), kiwi (
 <italic class="italic">Actinidia chinenesis</italic> var. Gold), peach (
 <italic class="italic">Prunus persica</italic> var. Nucipersica), and strawberry (
 <italic class="italic">Fragaria ananassa</italic> var. Nabila). In the case of kiwi, a further amount of juice was produced for microvinification experiments. The ripe fruits of Italian origin were collected at a local farmer market and they were washed, gently dried, and cut (prior to seed removal) or peeled after purchasing. The fruit juices were obtained with a juicer and stored at −18 ± 1 °C.
