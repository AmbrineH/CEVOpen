 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> EC1118 is a commercial yeast strain commonly employed for vinification (Lallemand Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada). 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> UMY196 is part of the yeast culture collection of the University of Milan (Italy), and it was isolated from wine. Cells were maintained in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L glucose, pH 5.5) supplemented with 20% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glycerol stock freeze culture in YPD broth maintained at 30 °C for 24–48 h in aerobiosis. The final biomass was determined by optical density (OD) at 600 nm. For the inocula, cells from the pre-culture were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min (Hettich, ROTINA 380R, Tuttlingen, Germany), collected, and washed once with 0.9% (
