<p class="p">Colony-forming unit (CFU/mL) enumeration was obtained for yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LABs). The spreading dual plating (100 µL) of useful decimal serial dilutions was carried out on Wallerstein Laboratory (WL) nutrient agar medium (Scharlau, Spain), after 2–4 days of incubation time at 30°C in aerobiosis for yeasts. LABs were enumerated on De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS; (BD Difco, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) solid medium (1.5%
