<p class="p">Ethanol, glucose, and fructose were determined using a Megazyme ethanol, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-fructose/
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucose assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total acidity was determined by titration up to pH 7 in accordance with the method OIV-MA-AS313-01 [
 <xref rid="B29-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The RAN was quantified by the formol number with titration at pH 8.5 [
 <xref rid="B30-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The quantification of methanol was carried out by Enoconsulting (Erbusco, BS, Italy), an ISO 9000-accredited laboratory, through gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector. The organic acids were quantified as described by Falqué López and Fernández Gómez [
 <xref rid="B31-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] with some modifications. An Acquity HClass UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) system equipped with a photo diode array detector 2996 (Waters) was used. Chromatographic separations were performed with a Hypersil BDS C8 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA). The separation was carried out in isocratic conditions using sulfuric acid (0.01 N) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, and the column temperature was 25 °C. Calibration curves were obtained for tartaric, malic, lactic, citric, acetic, and succinic acids at concentrations of 0.1–10 g/L. Quantification was performed according to the external standard method. Data acquisition and processing were carried out with Empower 2 software (Waters) at 210 nm. The free and glycoconjugate aromas were determined as reported by Fracassetti, Gabrielli, Corona, and Tirelli [
 <xref rid="B32-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Based on the known perception thresholds, the odor activity values (OAVs) were calculated as the ratio between the aroma concentration and its perception threshold.
