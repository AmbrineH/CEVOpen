<p class="p">This study aimed to investigate, from microbial, chemical, and sensory points of view, the co-fermentation of grape musts and fruit juices obtained from cherries, kiwi, peaches, and strawberries. Alcoholic fermentations were carried out inoculating either 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or the non-
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces</italic> species, 
 <italic class="italic">Torulaspora delbrueckii</italic>, in four blends of grape musts (Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon) and juices in different proportions. Consumer acceptability was also evaluated. The novel products could be produced using the surplus of some agriculture systems, such as spring/summer fruits and grape.
