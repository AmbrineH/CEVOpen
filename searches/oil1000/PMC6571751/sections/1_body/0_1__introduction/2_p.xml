<p class="p">In the last 15 years, global wine consumption went up and down [
 <xref rid="B4-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Europe is consuming less and less wine, while the wine consumption in young producing areas is still growing. New alternative wines are appearing on the market and they are cheap and easy-drinking. Examples are the “flavored” wines (red lollipop, peach, grapefruit, mandarin, or black currant) with medium alcohol content (from 8% to 10.5%) obtained by blending wines and fruit juices or flavoring wines with artificial or natural aromas. The main consumers of these products are younger people between 18 and 34 years old, with 33% drinking flavored wines as an aperitif.
