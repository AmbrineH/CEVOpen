<p class="p">Fruit wines are produced from fruit juices other than grape, such as apples, apricots, berries, cherries, plums, strawberries, oranges, mangoes, bananas, and pineapples [

 <xref rid="B7-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Moreover, the production implies the use of fruit juice concentrates, which allows increasing ethanol yield and taste, aroma, and functional features [
 <xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The production of alcoholic beverages obtained from the co-fermentation of grape must and fruit juice is yet to be investigated. Advantages of this approach are ascribable to an ever-growing rate of global food consumption, whereby the food supply production needs to fulfil all requests in a sustainable way in terms of environmental soundness, social equity, and economic feasibility. The formulation of new mixed-fruit alcoholic beverages could represent a reduction in fruit surplus and post-harvest fruit loss, and it could positively contribute to the economy of the existing wine industry. The reduction of food loss and wastes is gaining increasing importance [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] for increasing the food chain sustainability, even with the production of novel foods. The fermentation of fruit juices using selected yeasts can yield final products enriched in novel bio-functional compounds not found in traditional wines [
