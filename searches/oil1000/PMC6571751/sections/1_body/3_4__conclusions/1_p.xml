<p class="p">The present study proposes an innovative alcoholic beverage obtained by co-fermenting, using 
 <italic class="italic">T. delbrueckii</italic> yeast, Cabernet Sauvignon must and kiwi juice in a proportion of 60:40. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a product appears in literature. The feasibility of co-fermenting grape must and fruit juice was proven, leading to the production of a novel food resulting acceptable from the sensory point of view. The acceptability and approval expressed by potential consumers suggests that this drink could represent a valid strategy for the “re-use” of both kiwi and grape/must surplus, combining a sustainable approach with innovation in the alcoholic beverage field. The production of this alcoholic beverage can provide benefits to both wineries and farmers, since the losses of grape/wine and fruit can be limited and a longer use of the fermentation compartment of the cellar can be achieved. The proposed Cabernet Sauvignon/kiwi drink can be considered a pleasant beverage with low alcohol content, indicated as an aperitif. Future developments foresee a scale-up in the production of this drink, eventually using the equipment already present in a cellar to produce kiwi juice without compromising the quality of the juice, and managing the fermentation in order to preserve the desired residual sugar attenuating the acidity.
