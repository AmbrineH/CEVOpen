  <p id="Par1" class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of disease in pregnant women and new born babies where it causes early and late onset disease characterised by sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. Ten to 37 % of pregnant women in the world are colonised with GBS while intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has led to significant reduction in early onset disease. The increase in drug resistant microorganisms has become a major threat. Development of vaccines is still in progress so there is need for new and safer alternatives to treatment.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Benzyl penicillin, Ampicillin, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, Linezolid, Vancomycin, Tetracycline and Cotrimoxazole, 
   <italic class="italic">Olea europaea</italic> leaf extracts and essential oil were tested against GBS isolates from South Africa and Namibia.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">The isolates showed 100% sensitivity to benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, vancomycin, 
   <italic class="italic">O. europaea</italic> leaf extracts and essential oils. Only one isolate (0.6%) was resistant to cefotaxime and 23.4 and 10.4% were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin respectively.

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">GBS isolates showed sensitivity to 
   <italic class="italic">O. europaea</italic> extracts at low minimum inhibitory concentrations. 
   <italic class="italic">Î’ lactams</italic> are still the drugs of choice for treatment of GBS disease but 
   <italic class="italic">O. europaea</italic> extracts potent as an alternative source of antimicrobials.
