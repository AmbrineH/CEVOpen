<p id="Par35" class="p">The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of: denaturation at 93 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final elongation step of 72 °C for 7 min was followed by a hold at 4 °C. 
 <italic class="italic">S. agalactiae</italic> ATCC reference strain BAA-2670 was used as positive control. Amplicons were loaded on 1% agarose gel stained with 10 μL ethidium bromide and electrophoresed for 45 mins at 110 V in 0.5X Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer and viewed under transilluminator and photographed.
