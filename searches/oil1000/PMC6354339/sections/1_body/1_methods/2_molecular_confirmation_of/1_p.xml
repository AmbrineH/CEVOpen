<p id="Par34" class="p">Glycerol stocks were inoculated in Muller Hinton broth for 24 h at 37 °C and streaked on Columbia blood agar. GBS isolates were confirmed by molecular techniques using a pair of primers specific for the 
 <italic class="italic">scp</italic>B gene. A single colony of GBS was picked from Columbia blood agar containing 5% horse blood and suspended into 160 μL of nucleic acid free water in a 2 mL conical tube that was placed on a heating block and allowed to boil at 100 °C for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant containing GBS DNA was transferd in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and stored at − 80 °C. The amplification reactions were performed using the One Taq® Master Mix (New England Biolabs, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Thus, the reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μL containing 12 μL of Master mix, 6 μL of purified DNA, 10 pmol of scpBF (5’ACAACGGAAGGCGCTACTGTTC3’) and scpBR (5’ACCTGGTGTTTGACCTGAACTA3’) primers as adapted from Elbaradie et al., 2009 [
