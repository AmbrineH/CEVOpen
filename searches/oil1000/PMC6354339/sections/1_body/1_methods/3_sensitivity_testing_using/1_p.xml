<p id="Par36" class="p">Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was performed using Vitek Sensitivity Card (AST-ST01) on the following antibiotics: Benzyl penicillin, Ampicillin, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, Linezolid, Vancomycin, Tetracycline, Cotrimoxazole and Inducible Clindamycin Resistance (ICR). MICs were determined for each antibiotic on all the isolates and the results were interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2015) guidelines. The results were classified as sensitive (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R). All isolates were evaluated for inducible clindamycin resistance.</p>
