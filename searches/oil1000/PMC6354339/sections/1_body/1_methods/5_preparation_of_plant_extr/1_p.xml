<p id="Par38" class="p">Leaves were harvested from the plants and washed in water to remove dust. The leaves were rinsed in distilled water to cleanse them of impurities and were dried in air for 3 days. The leaves were pulverized as previously described by Darsanaki et al., 2012. Fifty grams of leaf powder was mixed with one litre of ethanol and placed on a shaker to solve and thereafter, the solution was filtered and the solvent dried to obtain a crude ethanol extract of the

For the extraction of essential oils, 200 g of dried pulverized leaves was mixed with 200 mL of water and the mixture placed in a modified hydro distiller or a Clevenger’s type apparatus and allowed to hydro distillate for 3 h for complete extraction of the essential oils from the leaves. The procedure was repeated thrice to obtain adequate essential oil for experimental assays and the extracted essential oil was dried using anhydrous sodium sulphate and extracts stored at − 20 °C in actinic bottles from which working solutions were prepared with Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) for use in experiments.
