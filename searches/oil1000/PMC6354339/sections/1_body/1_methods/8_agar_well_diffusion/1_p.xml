Standard bores of eight millimetres in diameter were made in the agar plates using a sterile cork-borer. Ten percent DMSO was used as a negative control while 5 μg of ciprofloxacin served as a positive control. One hundred microliters each of the ethanolic leaf extracts (0.5 mg/ml), essential oils (300 mg/ml), positive control and negative control were put in labelled wells and allowed to stand for 1 h and culture plates incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The test extracts were compared to the negative and positive control to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extracts on the isolates. Ten isolates each from both South Africa and Namibia were selected by systematic sampling and used in the experiment.
