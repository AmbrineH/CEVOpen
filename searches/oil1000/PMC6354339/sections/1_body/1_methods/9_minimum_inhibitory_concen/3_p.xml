<p id="Par44" class="p">For the concentrations of the extract which showed antimicrobial effect against the bacteria it was determined if the extract had bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect. This was performed by inoculating 20 μL from each of the tubes above onto Mueller Hinton agar and the culture plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Absence of growth in the broth and agar plate was assumed as the extract having bactericidal effect while absence of growth in broth and bacterial growth on solid agar plates, indicates bacteriostatic effect of the extract.</p>
