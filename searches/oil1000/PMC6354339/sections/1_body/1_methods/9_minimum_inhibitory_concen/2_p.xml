<p id="Par43" class="p">Broth was used as a negative control while 5 μg of ciprofloxacin was used as a positive control. One hundred microliters of broth was placed in six labelled tubes for each experiment. One hundred microliters each of broth (negative control), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (positive control) and each of the dilutions for both essential oil and plant extract were put in a respective labelled tube and 20 μL of 0.5 McFarland of the test isolate was inoculated in each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Thereafter, the test tubes were checked for turbidity and compared to the negative and positive control to establish the antimicrobial activity of the different concentrations of the extracts. Tubes without apparent growth were regarded as concentrations where the extract had growth inhibitory activities.</p>
