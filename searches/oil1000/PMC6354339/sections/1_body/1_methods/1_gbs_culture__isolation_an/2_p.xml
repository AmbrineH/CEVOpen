<p id="Par33" class="p">Samples were inoculated onto Columbia blood agar and Todd Hewitt broth (Rochelle Chemicals and Laboratory Equipment, Johannesburg, South Africa) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Inoculums in Todd Hewitt broth were subcultured onto blood agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the cultures were checked for colonies exhibiting β-haemolysis on the blood agar. The colonies were tested for the catalase reaction and catalase negative colonies were further screened using the Lancefield grouping antisera (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA). Colonies which tested positive for the latex agglutination assay were presumptively identified as GBS isolates and were confirmed using the Vitek 2 and by molecular techniques. All presumptive isolates were stored in glycerol stocks at − 80 °C until further analyses.</p>
