<p id="Par26" class="p">Antibiotic resistance can arise due to the expression of genes that confer resistance to drugs in an organism. The most clinically significant genes are those that code for enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of β-lactams (
 <italic class="italic">bla</italic> genes). These genes confer high level bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics like cephalosporins (including 4th generation cephalosporins), penicillins and monobactams (except cefamycins) [

 <italic class="italic">bla</italic> genes can be borne on plasmids or transposons which are transferable and this facilitates horizontal spread of antibiotic resistance [
