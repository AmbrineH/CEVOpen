<p id="Par50" class="p">In this study 117 isolates from Namibia and 37 isolates from South Africa were analyzed and they were confirmed as GBS based on the 
 <italic class="italic">scp</italic>B gene. All the isolates showed absolute sensitivity to benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin with only one isolate (0.6%) showing resistance to cefotaxime as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. In reports from other studies done in other African countries, such as in Malawi [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] and Nigeria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], GBS has not shown resistance to the 
 <italic class="italic">β lactams</italic>. In a study in Brazil, GBS also exhibited no resistance to 
 <italic class="italic">β lactams</italic> [

 <italic class="italic">β lactam</italic> group of antibiotics has been evolving as noted in reduced MICs for more than a decade and recently an Italian study recorded outright resistance by some GBS isolates to penicillin [
