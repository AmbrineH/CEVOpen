The findings of this study are different from those of a similar study done by Boukhebti et al., (2015) in Algeria in which the essential oils were composed of 38 components. In the study palmitic acid (14.71%), z-nerolidol (9.45%), octacosane (6.32%), ceryophyllene oxide (4.77%), tetracosane (4.06%) and 4-hydroxy-4-methy-2-pentane (4.04%) were the main components of the essential oils [
