<p id="Par51" class="p">Thirty six isolates (23.4%) and sixteen isolates (10.4%) were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin respectively and the results of this study are comparable to a report from a recent study in Pretoria, South Africa where GBS isolates had 17.2 and 21.16% resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. The results also fall within world statistics of clindamycin resistance (8.2–70%) and erythromycin resistance (14.5–70%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, studies in Brazil have recorded low GBS resistance to clindamycin (3.0%) and erythromycin (4.1%) [
