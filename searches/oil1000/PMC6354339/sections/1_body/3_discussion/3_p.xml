<p id="Par52" class="p">There was high resistance of GBS to tetracycline (96.1%) and this appears consistent with other studies which have reported high GBS resistance to tetracycline (86.7%) in South Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] and in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>] and this could be due to the indiscriminate use of tetracycline and its availability as a non-prescription drug. Tetracycline is commonly used at farms as a growth promoter and for treatment purposes. Resistance to the drug could spread through the environment due to agricultural runoff and contaminated effluent while antibiotic residue in farm produce like meat is another serious concern which perpetuates drug resistance as low levels of drugs in farm produce exert persistent selection pressure on bacteria thus giving rise to the emergence of resistant strains [
