<p id="Par53" class="p">Resistance to cotrimoxazole was low in this study (11.0%) contrary to its reported high resistance level among GBS isolates from other studies in other African countries like Ethiopia (29.0%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. In Tanzania, just like many other sub Saharan African countries burdened by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cotrimoxazole is used for prophylactic purposes in all acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients including pregnant women before 36â€‰weeks gestation. Resistance to cotrimoxazole in Tanzania ranges from 56.0% in 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> to 87.5% in 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> with no difference in prevalence among patients on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and those not on it. The high resistance to cotrimoxazole could be attributed to the excessive use of the drug for prophylactic purposes in HIV positive patients. In a South African study, 85.7% of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolated from HIV infected children was resistant to cotrimoxazole [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. The World Health Organization noted that although cotrimoxazole is a broad spectrum antibiotic, increased use of the drug for prophylactic purposes would spur development of drug resistance which could ultimately render the drug ineffective when applied to common community pathogens [
