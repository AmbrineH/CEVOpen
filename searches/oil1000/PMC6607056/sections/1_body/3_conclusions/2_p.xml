<p id="p0175" class="p">Protein hydrolysate from defatted BSFL that contains 50 % w/w of protein had been successfully synthesized using a bromelain enzyme as a biocatalyst. The DH of protein hydrolysate from BSFL lies in the range of 10â€“48%. The optimum conditions of the hydrolysis process with a DH of 47.4%, occurred at 3% of enzyme concentration, pH 8, and hydrolysis time of 24 hours as suggested by regression model. The protein hydrolysate from BSFL had a yield of 10.7% w/w and a productivity of 21 mg/mL/batch. The protein hydrolysate from BSFL contains high amount of hydrophobic essential amino acid, particularly lysine (8.0%), leucine (7.7%), and valine (7.3%). The protein hydrolysate from BSFL had an antioxidant activity in terms of its ability to scavenge DPPH free radicals up to 77% at 1.25% sample concentration with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.84% v/v.
