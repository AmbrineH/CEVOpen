 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). BSFL has the potential to be further developed as high-value bioproducts, such as protein hydrolysates. Recent works that report systematic studies on the production of protein hydrolysate from BSFL are still very scarce. Hence, this study aims to investigate the potential valorization of BSFL as a substrate to produce protein hydrolysate.
