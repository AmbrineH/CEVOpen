 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caligiani et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, each sample was poured into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes at 25 °C. The supernatant was separated from the precipitated part and stored in a 20 ml bottle which was tightly closed for further processing. The supernatant obtained was stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 °C for further analysis. Protein hydrolysate from BSFL was dried using a freeze-drying method. Briefly, 35 ml of the supernatant of protein hydrolysate from BSFL was frozen in the freezer until the phase changed into a solid. The solid sample was then placed inside a freeze drier at temperature and pressure of -55 °C and 1500 mTorr, respectively until a constant weight was obtained. Dried protein hydrolysate from BSFL was stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 °C for further analysis.
