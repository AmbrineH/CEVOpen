<p id="p0040" class="p">Protein hydrolysis of defatted BSFL was carried out using a bromelain enzyme with an activity of 200 CDU/mg according to the procedure suggested by 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Auwal et al. (2017)</xref>. A total of 10 grams defatted BSFL was dissolved in 50 ml phosphate buffer solution at different pH and the enzyme was added at different concentrations in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask. The hydrolysis reaction was carried out in a water bath shaker at a temperature of 50 °C, rotation speed of 150 rpm, and at different time variations according to the conditions in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The hydrolysis reaction was terminated by heating the sample at a temperature of 90 °C for 10 minutes using a water bath. Remaining BSFL samples were completely hydrolyzed by using 6 M HCl at a temperature of 110 °C for 24 hours to determine the total free amino acid content.
