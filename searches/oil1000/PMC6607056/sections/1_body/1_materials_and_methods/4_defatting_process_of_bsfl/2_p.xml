 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abduh et al., 2016</xref>). N-hexane was used as a solvent with a ratio of 1: 4 of biomass to solvent. The extraction process was carried out for 6 hours at a temperature of 70 °C. The mixture of oil and solvent was separated using a rotary evaporator for 2 hours at a temperature of 60 °C until the n-hexane solvent was completely separated and a pure oil fraction was obtained. The yield (% w/w) of oil was determined based on
