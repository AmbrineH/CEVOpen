<p id="p0090" class="p">The analysis of DH was carried out by adding 0.4 mL of a protein hydrolysate sample containing 200–300 ug/ml of protein with 3.0 mL of OPA reagent to determine the amount of free amino acid in the solution. L-serine amino acid (0.01–0.10 mg/ml) was used as a standard solution to make a standard curve. The standard solution and all samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 minutes. The standard solution and all samples were measured for absorption at a wavelength of 340 nm using a Shimadzu UV-3101 spectrophotometer. Absorption of each sample was converted using the standard linear curve regression equation obtained. The degree of hydrolysis was calculated based on
