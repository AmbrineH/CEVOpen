 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mirzaei et al. (2015)</xref> with slight modifications. O-pthyaldyaldehyde (OPA) reagent was always freshly made before used to determine the DH of the sample. Briefly, 7.62 g of sodium tetraborate decahydrate and 20 mg SDS were dissolved in 150 ml of deion water and stirred using a magnetic stirrer until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The mixture was added with 160 mg of 97% O-pthyaldyaldehyde powder which was dissolved in 4 ml of 95% ethanol. The mixture was added with 176 mg 99% of DTT and stirred until homogeneous. The final volume of the OPA reagent mixture was made up to 200 mL by adding deion water. OPA reagent was stored in a dark bottle at 25 °C.
