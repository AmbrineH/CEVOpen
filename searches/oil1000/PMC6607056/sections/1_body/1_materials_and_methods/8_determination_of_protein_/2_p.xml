 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kruger, 2009</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 ml of the protein hydrolysate from BSFL was poured into a cuvet. Each sample was added with 5.0 ml of commassie brilliant blue-G solution. The mixture was incubated for approximately 2 minutes at 25 Â°C. The sample absorbance was determined using a Shimadzu UV-3101 spectrophotometer instrument at a wavelength of 595 nm. Protein concentration was calculated was based on a BSA standard curve.
