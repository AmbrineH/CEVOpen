 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zielińska et al., 2017</xref>). DPPH free radical inhibition activity analysis was carried out at the Chemigreecal Laboratory of the Padjadjaran University (UNPAD), Jatinangor. Briefly, DPPH free radicals were dissolved in methanol and added with samples at several concentrations (0.25–1.25% v/v). All samples were incubated for 30 minutes in a dark room and then tested for absorption using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 517 nm. The value of free radical inhibition was determined using
