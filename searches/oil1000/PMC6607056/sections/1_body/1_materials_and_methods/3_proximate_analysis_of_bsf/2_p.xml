<p id="p0030" class="p">Biomass composition of BSFL was determined by proximate analysis out at the Integrated Chemical Laboratory of IPB, Bogor, Indonesia. Determination of total crude protein content was carried out using a standard Kjeldahl method with a total crude protein content calculated as %N and a conversion factor of 6.25. Determination of total crude lipid was carried out using a standard soxhlet extraction method (
