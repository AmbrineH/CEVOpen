<p id="p0100" class="p">Molecular weight distribution of protein hydrolysate from BSFL was determined using a Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Poly Acrylamide-Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al., 2017</xref>). Polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis was made by mixing a solution of acrylamide bis-acrylamide mix 12%, deion water, Tris-Cl buffer 0.5 M pH 6.8 (staking gel), Tris-Cl buffer 1.5 M pH 8.8 (separating gel), SDS, ammonium persulfat, and Temed, respectively. Protein samples and protein hydrolysates were prepared by mixing 50 μL samples with a staining solution containing 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 0.05% bromophenol blue in 62.5 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 6.8). The samples were incubated at 90 °C for 10 minutes in a water bath. Electrophoresis was operated using a Biorad SDS-PAGE device at a voltage of 100 V, current of 0.1 A, for 150 minutes at 25 °C. A ladder protein of 14–116 kDa was used as a comparison to determine the distribution of protein molecular weight. The electrophoresis gel was stained using a staining solution consisting of commassie brilliant blue R-250, 40% technical grade methanol in a volume basis (v/v), 10% v/v glacial acetic acid, and 50% v/v deion water. The gel coloring process with staining solution was carried out for 12 hours. The colored gel was rinsed and soaked in a destaining solution consist of 10% v/v methanol in deion water. The destaining process was carried out for 12 hours until the protein band in the gel could be clearly seen.
