<p id="p0115" class="p">The relatively high lipid content in the BSFL (35% w/w) was separated prior to the hydrolysis process was. The lipid component was separated by a Soxhlet extraction method using an n-hexane as a solvent. After the lipid component has been removed, the BSFL protein fraction was doubled to 54, 81% as compared to the initial content (25.6%) as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Increased protein content after lipid extraction process was also reported by 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Longvah et al. (2011)</xref> with a 50% increased of protein content for silkworm prepupae. So that, the hydrolysis process using bromelain enzyme was more effective after the separation of lipid content in BSFL because the non-protein component have been reduced (
