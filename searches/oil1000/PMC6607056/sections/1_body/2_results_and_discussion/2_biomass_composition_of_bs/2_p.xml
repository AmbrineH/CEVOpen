<p id="p0110" class="p">Biomass composition of BSFL was analyzed using a proximate analysis method to determine crude protein, lipid, carbohydrate, fiber, and ash content. BSFL has crude protein and lipid content of 25.6% w/w and 35.5% w/w, respectively. The content of protein, lipid, carbohydrates, fiber, and ash in BSFL depends on the substrate consumed (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al. (2017)</xref> cultivated BSFL using a commercial chicken feed substrate and produced BSFL biomass with a protein content up to 39.2% w/w. 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abduh et al. (2018)</xref> reported that BSFL has a protein content of 45% w/w when fed with defatted residual Philippine tung seeds (
 <italic class="italic">Reutalis trisperma</italic>) during its cultivation period. The BSFL used in this study has a lower protein content compared to the other studies. It is probably due to the substrate composition used in this study that comprises a mixture of vegetable and plant-based food residues. However, the protein content is still greater than 25% w/w of BSFL used in this study is still classified as a high protein biomass (
