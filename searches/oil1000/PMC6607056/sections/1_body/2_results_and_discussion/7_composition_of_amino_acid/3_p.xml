<p id="p0160" class="p">In this study, protein hydrolysate from BSFL also contains a relatively high amount of alanine (12.1%). This is because the bromelain enzyme used in hydrolysis process of BSFL mostly consisted of L-alanine amino acid (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Murachi, 1964</xref>). The protein hydrolysate from BSFL contains almost all essential amino acid. Hydrophobic amino acids, such as, lysine (8.0%), leucine (7.7%) and valine (7.3%) were the most dominant essential amino acids. High amount of hydrophobic amino acid in a protein hydrolysate, can be a sign of the ability to scavenge or inhibit free radicals (
