<p id="p0145" class="p">Molecular weight distribution of protein sample without the addition of enzymes and protein hydrolysate from BSFL was compared using the SDS-PAGE method. The results of the electrophoresis and ladder protein as a comparison are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. In general, protein bands and peptides in protein water extract or control sample (A) appear in a molecular size ranges of around 14–116 kDa. Meanwhile the protein hydrolysate (B) sample has bands in a molecular size range of about 14–45 kDa.
