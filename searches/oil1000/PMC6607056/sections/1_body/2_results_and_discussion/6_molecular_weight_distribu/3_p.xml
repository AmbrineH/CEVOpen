<p id="p0150" class="p">Protein bands appeared around 116 kDa and 45 kDa were possibly albumin fraction, because this protein fraction are hydrophilic and also water soluble (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caligiani et al., 2018</xref>). Protein hydrolysate from BSFL (A) also has a 45 kDa band, but had a thinner appearance as compared to the control sample (B). There is another difference between the control sample (A) and (B), which is the presence of protein band at a molecular weight around 35 kDa that belongs to bromelain. Bromelain itself is a protease with a molecular weight varying from 28 - 33 kDa (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ketnawa et al., 2012</xref>). This result occurred because bromelain was added to protein hydrolysate from BSFL as a protease to catalyze the hydrolysis process while bromelain was not added to the control sample without hydrolysis treatment.
