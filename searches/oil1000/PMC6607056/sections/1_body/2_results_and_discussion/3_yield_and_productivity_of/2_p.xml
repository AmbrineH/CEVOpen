<p id="p0120" class="p">The yield and productivity of protein hydrolysate from BSFL in the form of freeze dried solid was calculated to investigate it's potential to be developed on a larger scale production. As much as 1.07 grams of freeze dried protein hydrolysates from BSFL were obtained from a series of production processes (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The yield of freeze dried protein hydrolysates from BSFL reached up to 10.7% w/w and 6.9% w/w based on the defatted BSFL and based on initial non-defatted BSFL, respectively. Similar findings were reported by 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al. (2017)</xref> which produced solid protein hydrolysates from cricket biomass with yields ranging from 5.2 to 11.7% w/w. The yield of protein hydrolysates varies depending on the hydrolysis conditions performed (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the experiments conducted in this study, the productivity of protein hydrolysates from BSFL reached up to 21 mg/ml/batch.
