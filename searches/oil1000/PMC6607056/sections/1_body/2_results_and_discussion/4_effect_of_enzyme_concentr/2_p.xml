<p id="p0125" class="p">Protein concentration of the protein hydrolysate from BSFL was analyzed using a Bradford method. Protein concentration analysis was carried out to determine the range of dissolved protein concentration in the protein hydrolysate which can be used as a reference for determining the degree of hydrolysis using the OPA method. The results of protein hydrolysate concentration obtained from experimental data and regression model are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table.2</xref>. In general, protein concentration of protein hydrolysate from BSFL varies in the range 240–310 μg/mL. The highest protein concentration of protein hydrolysate from BSFL (308.7 μg/mL) were obtained at 3% enzyme concentration, pH 8, and 13.5 hours of hydrolysis time. The lowest concentration (249.1 μg/ml) was obtained under the conditions at 1% enzyme concentration, pH 6, and 24 hours of hydrolysis time. The varying protein concentrations in the protein hydrolysate from BSFL showed that protein concentration was influenced by enzyme concentration, pH and hydrolysis time.
