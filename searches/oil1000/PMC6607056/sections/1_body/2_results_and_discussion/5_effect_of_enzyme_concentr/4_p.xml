<p id="p0140" class="p">The optimum conditions for the hydrolysis of protein in BSFL according to the regression model are the enzyme concentration of 3%, pH 8, and hydrolysis time of 24 hour with a DH up to 47.4%. An enzyme concentration of 3% produces the highest DH compared to enzyme concentrations of 1% and 5%. A maximum DH value at 3% enzyme concentration was also reported for the hydrolysis of cricket proteins (

As such occurred because the interaction of protein substrate with bromelain had reached its maximum saturation (plateaued state) and the hydrolysis process will not run effectively and efficiently when the enzyme concentration was greater than 3% (
