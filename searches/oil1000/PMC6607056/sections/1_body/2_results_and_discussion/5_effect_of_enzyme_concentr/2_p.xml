<p id="p0130" class="p">The DH of the protein hydrolysates from BSFL was determined using the OPA method which calculated the ratio of free L-serine amino acids in the sample and total amino acid from extensive hydrolysis. The DH values of the protein hydrolysate from BSFL are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and the coefficients of the regression equation are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The profile of enzyme concentration, pH, and hydrolysis time effect on DH is shown in
