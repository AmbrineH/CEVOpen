<p id="p0135" class="p">Protein hydrolysate from BSFL was successfully obtained from a series of production processes, with the DH values varies in the range of 10â€“44%. This finding shows that the DH value is influenced by various factors, including the concentration of enzymes, pH, and hydrolysis time (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pasupuleti and Demain, 2010</xref>). Hydrolysis conditions of 3% enzyme concentration, pH 6, and hydrolysis time of 13.5 hours had the highest DH value, reaching up to 43.7%. Meanwhile the hydrolysis conditions at an enzyme concentration of 5%, pH 7 and the hydrolysis time of 13.5 hours had the lowest DH value (10.6%).
