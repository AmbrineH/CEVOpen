<p id="p0170" class="p">The antioxidant activity of a protein hydrolysate is the result of various synergistic mechanisms, including the deterrence or inhibition of free radicals, inhibition of lipid peroxidation processes, metal ionization, countering oxidative reactions by oxygen-containing compounds, and electron transfer processes (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 1996</xref>). The DPPH free radical inhibition activity possessed by protein hydrolysate from BSFL is influenced by the amino acid composition in it. Aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, and tyrosine are able to stabilize DPPH free radicals through the mechanism of proton donors to electron-deficient free radicals (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dávalos et al., 2004</xref>). The proton donor process results in propagating termination of free radical reaction (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Auwal et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, amino acids that have hydrophobic properties played an important role in the process of deterring free radicals (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saadi et al., 2015</xref>). This occurs because of the ability of hydrophobic amino acids to increase access of free radicals to related amino acids, thereby reducing access of free radicals in attacking compounds and targeted cells (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nasri, 2017</xref>). Thus, protein hydrolysate from BSFL has the potential as bioactive hydrolysate with an antioxidant activity based on the amino acid composition and the ability to inhibit DPPH free radicals.
