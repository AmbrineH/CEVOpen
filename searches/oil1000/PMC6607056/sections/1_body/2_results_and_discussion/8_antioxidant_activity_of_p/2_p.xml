<p id="p0165" class="p">According to the DPPH free radical scavenging analysis, both protein hydrolysate from BSFL and control sample had the ability to inhibit DPPH free radical up to 72.6 ± 0.41% v/v and 66.3 ± 0.40% v/v, respectively at a concentration of 1.25% v/v (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). The activity of DPPH free radical inhibition is also found in the protein hydrolysate from sea cucumber or stone fish (
 <italic class="italic">Actynopiga lecanora</italic>) which had an inhibitory ability up to 50% at 1,0% v/v sample concentration (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Auwal et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zielińska et al. (2017)</xref> also reported that protein hydrolysates in three types of insects had DPPH* free radical inhibitory activity indicated by IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of protein hydrolysate from BSFL and control samples were 0.84 ± 0,001% v/v and 0.92 ± 0,015% v/v, respectively. It means that protein hydrolysate from BSFL has a higher DPPH free radical inhibition activity then protein hydrolysate from sea cucumber (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> ∼ 1% v/v) reported by Auwal dkk., (2017). In another study, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zielińska et al. (2017)</xref> reported that protein hydrolysate from selected insect, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">Schistocerca gregaria, Gryllodes sigillatus</italic>, and larva of 
 <italic class="italic">Tenobrio mollitor</italic> have an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> up to 0.004–0.010% v/v which were better than the results obtained in this study.
