<p class="p">Experimental procedures were followed as already described for three of the four diets in reference [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] (SD, standard chow diet; high-fat diets: EVOO, standard chow enriched in virgin olive oil, and BT, standard chow enriched in butter, until reaching 35% of total energy in both cases). In this work, a fourth experimental group fed with ROO diet was also added, consisting of standard chow enriched in refined olive oil until reaching 35% of total energy. As in Prieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], standard Panlab A04 chow was used but this time it was supplemented with 20% refined olive oil instead of virgin olive oil or butter. 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00061-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the composition of the four diets. Briefly, we fed ad libitum 8 male Swiss Webster mice with SD diet, and 9 mice with EVOO, BT, and ROO diets, respectively, making a total of 35 mice, during a 12-week period.
