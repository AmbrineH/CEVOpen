<p class="p">For the statistical analysis, we followed the procedures described previously [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Statistical significant differences in the distributions of the variables of interest according to the type of diet were tested at a 5% of signification by ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test depending on whether the assumptions were met or not. When the null hypothesis was rejected, pairwise comparisons were performed by Dunn test with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values adjusted by Bonferroni correction. In addition, for each physiological variable under consideration, multiple lineal regression models were developed using as independent variables those that showed significant differences in ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test. The regression models were fitted by stepwise regression and backward elimination. The statistical software used was SPSS 19 IBM (Armonk, NY, USA), R 3.4.4 (Auckland, New Zealand, and Gretl 2018c (San Diego, CA, USA).
