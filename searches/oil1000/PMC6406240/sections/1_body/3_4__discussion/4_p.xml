<p class="p">Spiroplasmataceae is another remarkable case (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), moreover because it belongs to phylum Tenericutes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), also significantly incremented in the ROO group. This family shows significant pairwise differences between ROO and SD and nonadjusted signification between ROO and the other two high-fat diets (with EVOO

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-07-00061" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). At genus level, several genera belonging to this family have been detected but only one, Spiroplasma, reaches significance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Spiroplasmataceae correlates highly with total cholesterol (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00061-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), which makes sense because these bacteria require cholesterol for growth since they have it in their cell membranes but cannot synthesize it [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. They also require different fatty acids: mainly palmitic acid but oleic acid can also promote growth [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The low levels detected in the EVOO group can be related to the statistically significant different levels of total cholesterol present in the two groups, but polyphenol content can also play an important role, since hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols have been described as important antimicrobials for Tenericutes [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In this case it seems that the increment in bacterial taxa does not produce the physiological change but it is the physiological change that produces the bacterial increment. However, nondetected additional effects of this bacterial increment cannot be discarded and therefore it is important to be aware of this trend.
