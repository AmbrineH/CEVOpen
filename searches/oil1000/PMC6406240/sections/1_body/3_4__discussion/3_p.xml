<p class="p">In this work, we analyzed data obtained from mice fed a diet enriched in ROO in comparison with mice fed a diet enriched with EVOO or with BT or a standard chow diet. Differences in microbial percentages as well as in the host physiology and their correlations have been evaluated. After twelve weeks of diets, ten bacterial families showed significant statistical differences upon a Kruskal–Wallis test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). In two of them (Prevotellaceae and Marinillabiliaceae) there was a marked distinction between the standard diet and the three high-fat diets. In the case of Prevotellaceae, there was adjusted signification between the SD and EVOO groups (SD versus the other two fats nonadjusted signification was also &lt;0.05;

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] which fits with the high levels detected in SD, a grain-based chow, and with its significant inverse correlation with total plasmatic cholesterol, not present in this diet. Contrary to this, in another five families—Desulfovibrionaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Sutterellaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Helicobacteraceae—there were differences among the three high-fat diets. One of the most interesting ones was Desulfovibrionaceae where global comparisons are significant even though adjusted pairwise signification was not detected, but where EVOO-ROO nonadjusted signification showed a

 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] Desulfovibrionaceae are sulfate-reducing bacteria that could be sustained by butter sulfate sources, since chondroitin sulfate, a common dietary supplement of animal origin, has been shown to stimulate Desulfovibrio intestinal growth [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and, in some instances, they have been related to high-fat diets derived from milk [

 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. According to our own report [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], this could explain the high presence of this bacterial taxon in the BT fed group in opposition to the EVOO group, also a high-fat diet. However, the unexpected high levels found in ROO in the present study delimitates more this scenario. With no sulfates from animal origin, this family was expected to behave in ROO as it does in the EVOO diet, unless there was an alternative available source of sulfur compounds. Indeed, the extra virgin olive oil used in this work is from organic farming, with no additives pre- or postharvest, and therefore no external components, like sulfur compounds, are present. On the contrary, commercial refined olive oils are mixed stocks from different origins and different cultivation conditions and the presence of other compounds cannot be ruled out. In addition to this, the effect of polyphenols in the low Desulfovibrionaceae levels detected in EVOO cannot be discarded either. Another interesting result is related to the physiological correlations since Desulfovibrio presents a positive correlation with food intake, water intake, diuresis, and total cholesterol (
