 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). These are three genera belonging to the order Clostridiales (Ruminoclostridium, Fusicatenibacter, and Desulfotomaculum), two Proteobacteria (Marispirillum and Pantoea), and one Bacteroidales (Olivibacter), none of them with adjusted significant differences between EVOO and ROO. It is worth noting the case of Desulfotomaculum—another sulfate-reducing bacteria that has a higher presence in BT and ROO—as Desulfovibrio does, although with a slight decrease in ROO with respect to BT that coincides with the loss of correlation with total cholesterol. With respect to the Proteobacteria genera, the five detected belong to the five described proteobacterial lineages (α, β, γ, δ, ε-Proteobacteria) and all of them are present in a higher proportion in one of the high-fat diets. This reinforces the hypothesis that relates this bacterial taxon with fats [
