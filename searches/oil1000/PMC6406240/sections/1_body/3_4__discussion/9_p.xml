<p class="p">As indicated previously, correlation is not causation and the fact of uncovering two variables that evolve in parallel does not automatically indicate that one is the cause of the other. In the case of the present report, a number of physiological variables have proven to modify their values in relation to the presence of certain bacterial taxa but more work has to be done, mainly in controlled gnotobiotic mice models, to undoubtedly show the extend of the responsibility of the microbiota in those effects. The results here presented delimitate the scenario for these future experiments.</p>
