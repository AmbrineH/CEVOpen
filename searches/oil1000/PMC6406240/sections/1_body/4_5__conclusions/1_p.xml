<p class="p">As a summary, we have detected five bacterial families with different percentages between virgin and refined olive oil fed mice. In three of these families (Desulfovibrionaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Helicobacteraceae) extra virgin olive oil polyphenols and/or other minority components could contribute to prevent undesirable bacteria from reaching the levels obtained in ROO diet. In another two families (Erysipelotrichaceae and Sutterellaceae), polyphenols may act indirectly to promote these families increment with outcomes that still remain to be completely elucidated. Another prevalent bacterial family, Prevotellaceae, does not seem to be affected by the unsaponifiable fraction, at least in an apparent manner, showing the same behavior in the three high-fat diets, independently of their composition. Finally, the detected specific increment of Spiroplasma and Helicobacter species in the ROO enriched diet should be further studied.</p>
