 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value in the significant cases. As it is shown, EVOO had statistical significant differences with SD in the percentage of Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Sutterellaceae, and Christensenellaceae, while ROO had differences with ROO in Marinilabiliaceae and Spiroplasmataceae, and with BT in Staphylococcaceae. Additionally, the levels of Microbacteriaceae were significantly different between BT and each one of the three other diets.
