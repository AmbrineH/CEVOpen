<p class="p">Different multiple linear regression models were fitted to explain each physiological variable, using as independent variables all the families with significant differences. 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00061-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the results obtained. Only nine families are shown since Christensenellaceae did not retrieve any significant model.
