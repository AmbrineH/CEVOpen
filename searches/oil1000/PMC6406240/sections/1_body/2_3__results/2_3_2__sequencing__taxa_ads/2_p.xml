<p class="p">For clarity, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows only the seven most representative phyla. These are complemented with the phyla Synergistetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Deinococcus-Thermus that are present in a very low proportion in one single mouse under SD in the first case and under the ROO diet in the other two. After analyzing the distributions using Kruskalâ€“Wallis test, only the phylum Tenericutes showed statistically significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023), with a pairwise comparison rending adjusted signification only between the standard and ROO groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00061-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). When a regression fit was performed, Tenericutes showed positive correlation with total cholesterol (
