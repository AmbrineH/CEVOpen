 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value is also indicated in the significant cases. As specified, EVOO had statistical significant differences specifically with ROO in the percentage of Desulfovibrio; with SD in the percentage of Fusicatenibacter, Parasutterella, and Marinilabilia, and with BT in Christensenella. On the other hand, ROO had statistical significant differences with SD in Ruminiclostridium, Marispirillum, and Spiroplasma, and with BT in Helicobacter. Additionally, the three high-fat diets presented significant differences with SD in Anaerophaga, and BT had significant differences with the other three diets in Curtobacterium.
