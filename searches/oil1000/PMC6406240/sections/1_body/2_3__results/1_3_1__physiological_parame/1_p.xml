<p class="p">At the end of the experimental period, different physiological variables were measured. Raw data corresponding to BT, EVOO, and SD were previously reported in Prieto et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the present work, we found that BT-enriched diet produced the highest statistically significant body weight (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and SBP levels (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) of all four diets, as well as the highest plasma insulin levels, which were also significant versus EVOO- and ROO-enriched diet values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00061-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Mice fed SD had the lowest statistically significant total cholesterol levels in plasma (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and EVOO fed mice had the second lowest levels, being significant versus the values found in the ROO group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). It is worth mentioning that there is no cholesterol present either in EVOO or ROO in opposition to BT, where it can be found at about 215 mg/100 g. EVOO also triggered the highest HDL/LDL ratio, being significant versus SD values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as already reported [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], ROO produced the second lowest values but with no statistical significance (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00061-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). No significant differences were found in food or water intake, diuresis, and plasma leptin, ghrelin or triglycerides.
