 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and, hence, this different effect has concomitant outcomes as well on the microbiota profile [

 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The specific effect of olive oil on intestinal microbiota was consequently highly interesting and the study was undertaken by our laboratory using, first, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [
