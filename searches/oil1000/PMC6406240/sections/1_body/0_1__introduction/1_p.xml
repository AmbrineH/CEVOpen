<p class="p">The negative effects of high-fat diets (HFD) on health, mainly favoring the condition known as metabolic syndrome and the worsening of several cardiovascular variables, have long been known [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], and the possible influence of an intestinal microbial misbalance or dysbiosis on animal physiology [
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], have been widely acknowledged. Intestinal microorganisms have an essential role in the host homeostasis and a disturbed colonic microbial ecology can lead to numerous disorders of different kinds, not only digestive but also metabolic or even cognitive through the gutâ€“brain axis. Therefore, gut microbiota has emerged as a new and important factor to be considered in the negative consequences of HFD [
