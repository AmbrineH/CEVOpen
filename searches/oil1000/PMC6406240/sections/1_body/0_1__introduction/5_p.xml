<p class="p">In spite of all these facts, few scientific studies have focused on the influence of ROO on health [

 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and none of them have studied its effect on the intestinal microbiota. Aware of this, we included commercial ROO in the above mentioned analysis [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In that report ROO showed different behavior to EVOO and a distinctive microbial profile using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. However, microbial taxa were not thoroughly studied, neither was the physiological effect on the host. Recently, using a 16S ribosomal DNA metagenomic approach we compared a standard diet (SD) and two high-fat diets enriched in butter (BT) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The results obtained showed clear differences both in the fecal microbiota profile and in several physiological variables related to metabolic syndrome. Some of these variables held statistically significant correlations with the percentages of several taxa that increased in the butter-enriched diet but not in the one with EVOO. As ROO was not included then, in the present study we have extended the previous report by incorporating a diet enriched in commercial ROO in order to elucidate differences in microbial taxa between this and the other diets and to look for possible correlations with physiological variables in the host. The results obtained can not only add new data to the influence of ROO on health but also on the specific role of polyphenols on the effect exerted by virgin olive oil.
