<p class="p">Considering that intestinal microbiota is composed of a large number of bacterial cells, distributed in a high number of taxa with complex ecological relationships among them and with an increasingly more evident metabolic continuous communication with the host, it makes sense to think that changes in the microbiota might have a concomitant effect on the organism [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-07-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. If the large intestine is viewed as a fermenter or a bioreactor, it also seems reasonable to consider that food and the type of diet may be the main or one of the main factors exerting an effect on the microbiota that thrives within. Therefore, when this diet presents certain physiological distinctions, it is not illogical to consider that these variations could be produced, at least in part, throughout the bacterial metabolism, being this step necessary for the physiological outcome. This assumption is especially rational when correlations between the biological traits and the bacterial presence are statistically significant and, hence, a link is proven to happen. However, correlation is not causation and the two variables can change concomitantly for different reasons. One variable can certainly affect the other or vice versa or it could just happen that both of them are equally affected by the specific diet, with no interaction at all between the microbial taxon and the physiological variable.
