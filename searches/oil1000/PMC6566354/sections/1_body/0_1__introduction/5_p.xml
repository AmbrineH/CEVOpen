<p class="p">The mechanism of action of KD in the treatment of neurometabolic disorders is clearer: in the brain, the ketone bodies act as an alternative fuel to glucose. GLUT1-DS is caused by a defect in the protein responsible for the transfer of glucose across the blood-brain barrier, and is manifested in seizures early in life and impairment of brain growth with developmental delay and other neurological problems, including a complex movement disorder. The use of ketone bodies as an alternative fuel to glucose bypasses the deficit of the glucose transporter, as the ketone bodies can enter the brain via facilitated diffusion mediated by the MCT1 transporter [
