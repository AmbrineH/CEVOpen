This occurs through the fatty acid-induced activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARs), which, in turn, inhibits the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B pathway, and the ability of BHB to bind the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 and inhibit the innate immune sensor NOD-like receptor 3 inflammasome that controls the activation of caspase-1 and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 [
