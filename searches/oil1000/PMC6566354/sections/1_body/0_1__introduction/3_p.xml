<p class="p">KD can also exert a neuroprotective effect. It is known that the epileptogenic state involves complex molecular pathways in which oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction can play important roles in neuronal cell death [

However, KD has been shown to enhance energy reserves, ATP levels, and the expression of many enzymes involved in multiple metabolic pathways in the mitochondria, and it increases mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus [
