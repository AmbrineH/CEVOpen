<p class="p">The ketogenic diet (KD) is a normo-caloric, high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate dietary treatment that, according to recent international guidelines, is recommended for children and adults with drug-refractory epilepsy and two rare neurometabolic disorders: glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency [

Indeed, in conditions of restricted carbohydrate and high-fat availability, the brain metabolism shifts from glucose dependence to the utilization of ketone bodies, principally Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (ACA), produced in the liver by the oxidation of fatty acids [
