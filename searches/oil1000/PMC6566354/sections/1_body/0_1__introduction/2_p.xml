<p class="p">Despite KD having been used for the first time in 1921 to treat patients with drug-refractory epilepsy, the mechanisms by which KD exerts its anti-seizure effects are not completely understood. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain the KD effects. One hypothesis involves the modulation of brain neurotransmitters, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and adenosine, as well as ion channel regulation [

 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It has been proposed that ketone bodies alter the metabolism of glutamate in such a way that the levels of GABA increase and inhibitory neurotransmission is enhanced [
