<p class="p">Currently, several KD variants are used in clinical practice: the classic ketogenic diet (CKD), the medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCTKD), the modified Atkins diet (MAD), and the low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) [

The CKD is the most restrictive diet and is based on the ketogenic ratio (KR), the ratio between the grams of fat and the sum of the grams of proteins and carbohydrates. Today, CKDs aim to achieve a KR of 4:1 (90% of daily calories derive from fat) or 3:1 (87% of daily calories derive from fat). In CKD fat are represented especially by long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Instead, the carbohydrate allowance is very limited, and the proteins are kept to a minimum to satisfy the requirements for growth. In the MCTKD, 30–60% of the energy is derived from medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, which yields more ketone per kilocalorie of energy than LCT, allowing a decrement of total fat and a higher carbohydrate and protein intake, compared to CKD. MAD is characterized by a KR of 1:1 or 2:1 and a carbohydrate intake of up to 20 g/day. Finally, the LGIT allows a carbohydrate intake of 40–60 g/day limited to food with a glycemic index &lt;50 [
