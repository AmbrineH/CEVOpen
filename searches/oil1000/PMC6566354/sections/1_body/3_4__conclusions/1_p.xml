<p class="p">The present review summarizes the foods and the food products available on the Italian market for the ketogenic dietary treatment of neurological diseases. However, it cannot be excluded that there are other products on the international market that have not been taken into consideration in this review. We think that this article is helpful for clinicians trying to promote KDs to patients, and researchers that want to implement the diet into their studies. Moreover, all the information described in this review can be used to provide information for patients treated with KDs and for their caregivers. </p>
