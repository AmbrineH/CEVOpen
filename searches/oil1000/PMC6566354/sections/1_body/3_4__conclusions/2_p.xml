<p class="p">Today, thanks to the awareness campaigns carried out by the associations of families with children treated with KDs, such as Charlie Foundation, Matthewâ€™s friends and, in Italy, Associazione Italiana GLUT1, one hundred years after the birth of KD, food companies have started to develop, and make available on the market, several food products intended for this category of patients. This is very important as it has made it possible to improve the quality of life of patients and their families [
 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. In fact, the range of products to choose from has increased, improving dietary variability. Indeed, patients now have access to alternative foods that resemble the traditional ones rich in carbohydrates, making patients feel less different from their healthy peers, and giving them new ingredients for the realization of recipes that are otherwise difficult to make. However, the road is still long. More ready-to-eat ketogenic foods are needed. In addition, the use of KDs for prolonged periods, as in GLUT1-DS patients and in patients with metabolic diseases, requires foods with a lipid profile characterized by a greater presence of MUFA and PUFA and lower in SFA; this is in order to reduce the risk of future dyslipidemia and cardiovascular problems. Moreover, given the reduced consumption of fruit and vegetables, ketogenic foods with added antioxidant and bioactive compounds are really necessary. Finally, much work remains to have these products recognized as medical food products by the various health systems, so that their cost does not fall entirely on the patient, allowing all families, regardless of their income, to access these products.
