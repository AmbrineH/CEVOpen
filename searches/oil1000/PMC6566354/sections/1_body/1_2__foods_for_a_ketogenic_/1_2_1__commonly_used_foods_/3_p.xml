<p class="p">KDs must satisfy protein requirements. However, the maintenance a constant KR limits, especially in CKD, the amount of proteins that can be included in the diet. Generally, in infants and young children, it is still possible to provide 1 g of protein per kg of body weight [
 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. This value is, however, below the recommended protein requirement for infants and children aged 1–3 years, but meets the needs of older children [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In adults, CKD allows to provide 0.5–0.7 g of protein per kg of body weight in function of the KR. With less restrictive KDs it is easier to satisfy protein requirements. Due to the limit imposed by the KR, proteins must be of high quality (able to satisfy the need for essential amino acids) [
 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. For this reason, protein foods are almost exclusively selected from animal foods that are also rich in fat. Particular attention must be paid when such foods need to be cooked before being consumed, as the fats of these products, represented mainly by saturated fatty acids (SFA), tend to be liquefied during cooking and to collect inside the cooking medium. In order to guarantee the correct intake of lipids and to maintain high ketosis, it is important that the lipids released from the food are also consumed.
