<p class="p">With regard to fat intake, what matters to maintain KR is the amount of fat to consume. However, from the nutritional point of view, the dietary fatty acid composition is also important. Several studies have reported an increase in serum lipids and the risk of hyperlipidemia in patients treated with KDs, especially with the more restrictive variants. To reduce the cardiovascular risk, several authors suggest increasing the ratio of polyunsaturated (PUFA) + monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to SFA in the ketogenic meal [

A recent prospective study on 12 children with pre-existing hyperlipidemia, and treated for 12 months with KDs (nine CKD and three MCTKD) containing very low SFA (10–11% of daily calorie intake), low dietary cholesterol (less than 80 mg/day), no added trans fatty acids, an optimized intake of MUFA and PUFA, and supplementation of omega-3 and carnitine (if the triglycerides and carnitine levels were, respectively, high and low), showed a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. This suggests that with an optimized dietary fat intake, a healthy serum lipid profile can be achieved [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Another prospective study treated 121 children with intractable epilepsy with olive oil-based KDs (the olive oil amount was 80–85% of the total fat) and observed that even the olive oil-based KD caused hyperlipidemia within the first month of treatment. However, this elevated serum level tended to decrease during follow up [

 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. It has also been seen that PUFAs induce a greater level of ketosis than SFA [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Moreover, PUFAs are natural activators of PPARs, and there is evidence that activation of brain-localized PPARs can influence seizure activity [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. PUFAs, together with ketone bodies, have been shown to exert neuroprotective activity in neurodegenerative conditions associated with impaired mitochondrial function [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Therefore, olive oil, which is particularly rich in MUFA, should be used as the main fat source. To increase the PUFA intake, portions of nuts should be included in the dietary plan. Several epidemiological studies and trials have shown an inverse association between nuts consumption and the risk of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. However, the effects of nuts in subjects treated with KDs remain unknown. A further strategy to increase PUFA intake consists in the addition of soy lecithin, commercially available in the granular form, to the meal. Finally, vegetable oils rich in PUFA, such as sunflower, wheat germ, and rice oils, can be used in addition to olive oil. In addition to being rich in PUFA, rice oil is also a source of γ-oryzanol, a bioactive compound with antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], and subjects treated with KDs could benefit from its consumption.
