<p class="p">Steviol glycosides are sweet tasting compounds extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Stevia rebaudiana</italic> leaves. The most abundant steviol glycosides are stevioside and rebaudioside A. From the chemical point of view, steviol glycosides are diterpene compounds formed by steviol molecule in which the hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group has been replaced by a glucose molecule to form an ester, and a hydroxylic hydrogen has been replaced by combinations of glucose and rhamnose to form an acetal. Once ingested, the glycosidic steviols are not hydrolyzed by the enzymes and acid of the upper gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B116-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>], so much so that they arrive intact in the large intestine, where they are hydrolyzed to steviol by the gut bacteria. The thus-produced steviol is absorbed and transported to the liver and glucuronidated. The steviol glucuronide is excreted mostly in urine [
