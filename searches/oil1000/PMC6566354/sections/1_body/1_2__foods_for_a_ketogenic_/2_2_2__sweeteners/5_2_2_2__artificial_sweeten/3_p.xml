<p class="p">Aspartame is used extensively as a tabletop sweetener and in a wide variety of foods and beverages like chewing gum, yogurt, desserts, and nutritional bars. From the chemical point of view, aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide containing two amino acids: L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Its calorie content per gram is similar to that of sucrose (4 kcal/g), but aspartameâ€™s sweetening intensity is approximately 200 times that of sucrose. As a result, only a small amount of aspartame is needed to achieve sweetness, leading to virtually no calories from aspartame in sweetened products. Indeed, 125 mg of aspartame approximately replace 25 g of sugar [

Formaldehyde, in turn, is then oxidized, by formaldehyde dehydrogenase, to formic acid which is excreted in the urine, or is further metabolized to carbon dioxide and excreted through the breath. The two amino acids derived from the digestion of the aspartame follow, instead, the normal metabolic fate expected for these amino acids, including gluconeogenesis [
