<p class="p">Xylitol is a polyol with the same sweetness as sucrose [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] and it is widely used in various pharmaceutical products, as well as in sugar-free candies and chewing gum. Like other polyols, xylitol is partially absorbed in the small intestine by either passive or facilitated diffusion. Several experts and authorities have proposed that xylitol absorbability is approximately 50% [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Once absorbed, xylitol is transferred to the liver where it is dehydrogenated by a non-specific cytoplasmic NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, with consequent production of xylulose, which is first phosphorylated via a specific xylulokinase to xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose-phosphate pathway and, thus, converted to glucose that is released into the bloodstream or stored as glycogen [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. It is not known how much glucose is released per gram of xylitol, however, a small (approximately 4 mg/dL) but significant increment of postprandial glycemia has been observed 60 min after the ingestion of a solution containing 25 g of xylitol [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], suggesting a very low glucose production. Unabsorbed xylitol reaches the large intestine where it is fermented by gut bacteria. As a result of its metabolism and fermentation, xylitol contributes 2.4 kcal/g. Moreover, in animal and human studies, xylitol has been reported to have an antiketogenic effect, decreasing ketone body production by the liver and also decreasing blood ketone body levels [
 <xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Presumably, this antiketogenic effect is mediated by an indirect mechanism, and is due to a stimulation of insulin release from the pancreas by xylitol [
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], improving peripheral glucose utilization [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. With regard to gastrointestinal side effects in healthy humans, these occur after the consumption of an excessive dose of xylitol. In general, single doses ranging from 10â€“30 g are normally tolerated without diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. In this light, small amounts of xylitol, such as those contained in chewing gum, should not interfere with the ketosis level. However, it is advisable to avoid consuming it in excessive doses.
