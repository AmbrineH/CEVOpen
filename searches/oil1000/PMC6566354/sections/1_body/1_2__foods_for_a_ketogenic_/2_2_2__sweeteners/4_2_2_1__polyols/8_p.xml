<p class="p">Isomalt is a mixture of mannitol and sorbitol and is used in the manufacture of sugar-free hard candies, chewing gum, chocolate, and cough drops. Its sweetness is up to 65% of that attributed to sucrose [

After ingestion, isomalt is hydrolyzed by the sucrose-isomaltase and the glucoamylase-maltase complexes of the intestinal brush-border. However, because of its poor affinity with such enzymes, compared to maltose and sucrose, only 10% of ingested isomalt is hydrolyzed and absorbed, while 90% passes into the colon where it is fermented to volatile fatty acids and H

Studies investigating the gastrointestinal symptoms following the ingestion of isomalt have shown that 40 g isomalt leads to an increased incidence of several symptoms, including mild laxation. A reduction of isomalt to 30 g increased tolerance, with evidence of only mild borborygms, mild flatulence, colic, and laxation [
