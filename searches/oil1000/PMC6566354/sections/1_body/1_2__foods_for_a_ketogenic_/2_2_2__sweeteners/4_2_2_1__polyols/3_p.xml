<p class="p">Erythritol is a small polyol (four-carbon, tetritol) naturally found in fruit and vegetables, mushrooms, and fermented foods like wine and soy sauce. Its sweetness is 60â€“80% that of sucrose [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Being a small molecule, approximately 90% of the erythritol assumed with food is readily absorbed, by diffusion, by the small intestine, while approximately 10% reaches the large intestine. Absorbed erythritol is minimally metabolized by the tissues, and it is essentially excreted unused in the urine [

 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Therefore, erythritol contributes no calories and does not affect blood glucose levels [
 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Moreover, as erythritol is almost totally absorbed, it causes fewer intestinal symptoms [
