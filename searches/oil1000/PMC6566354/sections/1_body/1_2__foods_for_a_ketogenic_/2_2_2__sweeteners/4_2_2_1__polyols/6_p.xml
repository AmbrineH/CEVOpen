<p class="p">Sorbitol, a polyol naturally found in some fruits and vegetables, has a sweetness approximately 50â€“70% of that of sucrose [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. The amount absorbed in the small intestine varies depending on the dose ingested. However, overall, an absorption percentage of 25% has been established [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. This part is fully metabolized in the liver through a non-specific NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, resulting in the production of fructose and then glycogen or glucose, which is then slowly released into the bloodstream [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Unabsorbed sorbitol is fermented by gut bacteria to short-chain fatty acids and only small and insignificant amounts of sorbitol are excreted with the feces [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. As a result of digestion and fermentation, sorbitol contributes 2.6 kcal/g, but it does not seem to affect blood sugar levels [

 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Several human studies have shown that 10 g/day of sorbitol provokes only a mild gastrointestinal problem, like flatulence or bloating, while a dose of 20 g/day can lead to more distressing symptoms, like abdominal pain and diarrhea [
