<p class="p">Polyols, or sugar alcohols, are poorly-digestible carbohydrates commonly obtained by the hydrogenation of sugars. They are used as sugar substitutes to confer a sweet taste to food, and are characterized by a lower degree of sweetness than sucrose, but also have a lower nutritional value. Once ingested, only about one-third of the introduced polyols are absorbed in the small intestine via passive diffusion. The amount absorbed varies depending on the individual polyol [

Moreover, the addition of polyols to food determines a lower increment in blood glucose and insulin secretion, which is particularly relevant to diabetic subjects. The major health concern concerning polyols is that such sugar alcohols can have a laxative effect if eaten in large amounts, causing bloating, intestinal gas, and diarrhea. Furthermore, some polyols have known anti-ketogenic effects, which is a concern for subjects treated with KDs (
