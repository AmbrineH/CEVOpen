<p class="p">Mannitol is a polyol with a sweetening potency approximately 50–70% that of sucrose, and it is naturally found in the exudates of certain trees, in marine algae, and mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Once ingested, approximately 25% of mannitol is absorbed in the small intestine and subsequently excreted not-metabolized in urine [

 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-01104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Unabsorbed mannitol is slowly fermented by gut bacteria with the production of volatile fatty acids [
