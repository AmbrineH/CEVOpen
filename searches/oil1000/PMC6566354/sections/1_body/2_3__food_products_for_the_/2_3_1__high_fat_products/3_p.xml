 <underline class="underline">Liquid ketogenic formulas:</underline> In addition to powder formulations, there are also liquid ketogenic formulas. These are, substantially, ready-to-drink ketogenic formulas with a KR of 4:1 and fortified with docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids, fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Some versions also have L-carnitine added, and a part of the total fats present in these products consists of MCTs. Liquid ketogenic formulas can be used for infants, children, and adults as meal substitutes or a snack, or in combination with solid foods to increase the KR of a meal or its contribution in vitamins and minerals. Such products have been shown to be safe and generally well accepted by children and their parents. Refractory epileptic children treated almost exclusively with liquid ketogenic formula have been shown to achieve a stable ketosis in a mean time period of seven days. [
