 <underline class="underline">Products rich in medium-chain triglycerides:</underline> MCTs are triglycerides with two or three fatty acids having an aliphatic tail of 6–12 carbon atoms, also called medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). These include caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric (C10), and lauric (C12) acids. A KD containing 60–75% of calories from lipids induce ketosis if it includes a high proportion of MCT, as, unlike LCTs, they do not require the actions of bile or micellar-chylomicron-mediated absorption into the lymphatic system, being instead diffused into the hepatic portal vein and preferentially converted into ketone bodies in the liver [

On the market, there are products consisting of mixtures of MCTs obtained by extraction from palm and coconut oils, the main food sources of MCTs. Such mixtures, primarily available in the oil form, have different percentage amounts of MCTs, and can have added fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, and E. Other available forms include margarines and ready-to-use ketogenic formulas and powders consisting almost exclusively of MCTs. These products are not exclusive to MCTKD, but can also be used in other KD variants, for example, to increase the production of ketone bodies.
