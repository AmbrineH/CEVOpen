 <underline class="underline">Powder ketogenic formula:</underline> This is the first food product specifically developed for KDs. It is a high-fat powder food product, with a KR of 4:1 or 3:1, available in different flavors, fortified with docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids, fiber, minerals, and vitamins, primarily intended for infants from six weeks of age. For infants, it is generally dissolved in water, and used as a meal replacement. For older children and adults, it can be used as a meal substitute and in combination with solid foods, to increase the KR of a meal or to supplement it with vitamins and minerals. Several studies have shown that the use of powder ketogenic formula in KDs is effective, safe, and tolerable for infants and children suffering refractory seizures [

In a recent study, 27 infants and children with drug-refractory epilepsy, aged between 12 months and five years, were treated with a powder ketogenic formula for four months. Of the 27 children, five were lost to follow-up, 22 remaining to the end of the study. After four months, a reduction of the median frequency of seizures per week was observed: 68.2% of patients showed a 50% reduction in seizure frequency per week, 40.9% showed a 50–90% reduction in seizure frequency per week, and 27.3% showed more than 90% reduction in seizure frequency per week. As far as concerns the adverse effects, 27% of the children developed constipation, one developed gastroesophageal reflux, and another developed hypercholesterolemia. No child discontinued the diet because of the complications. Finally, about 60% of children and their parents reported that the diet was palatable, and quite tolerable [

Similarly, in another study involving 10 children with drug-refractory epilepsy, aged nine months to 16 years, a powder ketogenic formula was administered for three months together with solid foods. The authors observed that ketosis was achieved in 7–10 days and at the end of the study, 60% of children showed a 50% or more reduction in in seizure frequency per week, while 10% was seizure-free. The formula was accepted and tolerated by 90% of the children [

It was also shown that the addition of the powder ketogenic formula to MAD during the initial month improved the efficacy of the dietary treatment of intractable childhood epilepsy. In this study, 30 children with intractable epilepsy were prospectively followed for two months. During the first month of treatment, MAD was used in combination with a daily 400-calorie powder ketogenic formula. At one month, 80% children had &gt;50% of seizure reduction, of which 37% had &gt;90% of seizure reduction. These findings showed that the likelihood of &gt;50% and &gt;90% seizure reduction was higher than that reported by other studies where only MAD was used. No significant loss of efficacy during the second month, after the powder ketogenic formula was discontinued, was observed. Therefore, the addition of a powder ketogenic formula to the MAD during its initial month may be beneficial for the efficacy of dietary treatment [
