 <underline class="underline">Ketogenic baking mixes:</underline> To be effective, KDs require, according to the variant, the almost total exclusion or the limited introduction of carbohydrates. This excludes, or limits, foods like bread, pasta, and all bakery products in general. However, these days there are readily available on the market ketogenic baking mixes that substitute grain flours and, thus, allow the domestic production of foods alternative to traditional cereal-based foods. These mixes are basically vegetable oils, in particular sunflower or palm oil, absorbed on a cellulose substrate and rendered in powder form, to which protein sources or other lipid sources, like nut flour, can be added. Currently, there are several versions of these products, with a KR ranging from 4.5:1 to 5:1.
