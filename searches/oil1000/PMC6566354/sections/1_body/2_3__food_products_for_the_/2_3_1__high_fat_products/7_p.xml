 <underline class="underline">Ready-to-eat ketogenic products:</underline> The number of these products on the market is constantly growing, e.g., biscuits, bread, crackers, savory biscuits, focaccia, and desserts. The nutritional composition of these products is very different from each other. However, two categories can be distinguished on the basis of the KR: ready-to-eat products with a medium-low KR (2:1) and ready-to-eat products with a high KR (3:1 or 4:1). Both categories have the benefit of being ready for consumption, improving diet management due to their palatability and tolerability. Indeed, for a family with a child on a KD, the fact of having safe, ready-to-eat products, with a certified nutritional composition, greatly facilitates the management of the childâ€™s diet, as it reduces the time spent preparing meals. Thus, the child has more foods to choose from, so as to increase the dietary variability, and the fact that the foods consumed are similar to those consumed by healthy peers reduces the feeling of diversity, marginalization and isolation.
