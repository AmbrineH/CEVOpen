<p class="p">This category includes many food alternatives to traditional cereal-based products, like pasta, bread, biscuits, and desserts.

The KR and, therefore, the yield in ketone bodies, is, thus, very low and, therefore, they find little use within ketogenic dietary plans, especially in CKD, except in small quantities and balanced with an adequate quantity of fat-rich products.</p>
