<p class="p">In recent years there has been a notable increase in the number of foodstuffs labeled “ketogenic” on the market. However, not all these products have been developed specifically for the ketogenic dietary treatment of neurological diseases. Many are suggested for the dietary treatment of obesity. Two different categories of ketogenic food products can be distinguished: high-fat products and high-protein low-carbohydrate food products. Furthermore, there are the glucomannan-based products developed for the dietary treatment of obesity and for losing weight, and also these are used in the ketogenic dietary treatment of neurological diseases. </p>
