<p class="p">As stressed in the first part of the Introduction, there is an increasing interest in the use of insects as food and feed, and this, in turn, has led to an increased number of insect-related scientific publications. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to report all the current and up-to-date literature available on the use of insects as feed for monogastric animal production systems, organizing it in a single, easy-to-read document. In particular, the attention will be herein focused on the use of insect-derived products (protein meals and oils/fats) for livestock (poultry, rabbits and pigs) and aquaculture species and the related effects on digestibility, performance and product quality. Furthermore, the use of well-organized, summary tables reporting all the dietary ingredient inclusion and substitution levels will help the readers to clearly understand the topic, also providing them with a practical, useful instrument for diet formulation.</p>
