<p class="p">By 2050, the world will host more than 9 billion people, and this will lead to food security and environmental issues. In particular, a dramatic increase in the demand for animal products is expected. In 2018, the industrial compound feed production was 1.103 metric billion tons, that is, an increase of 3% compared to 2017 [

Since the growing consumer demand for animal products will be met by concentrated animal feeding operations, with a further dramatic increase in the consumed feeds, great research efforts have been made to find new ingredients. Moreover, since feeds represent one of the major costs from an environmental point of view (land, energy and water uses) [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], there is a pressing need to find alternative sustainable ingredients for animal diets. The use of insects for feeds is widely recognized as one of the potential solutions, as they are rich in valuable nutrients (proteins, amino acids (AA), fat and energy, vitamins and minerals), and have a lower environmental impact than other protein sources (i.e., whey, egg protein, fishmeal) [
