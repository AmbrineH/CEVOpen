<p class="p">As far as the utilization of HI meal is concerned, most of the fish feeding trials that have been performed have shown that FM replacement is feasible at low and moderate inclusion levels, without any negative effects on the growth performance or FCR. The survival, growth performance and FCR of salmonids, particularly in rainbow trout, were not affected in fish-fed diets in which 13%, [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], 46% [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], or 50% [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] of FM have been replaced with a defatted HI meal for fish with a mean initial body weight of 46, 67 or 179 g, respectively. Similar conclusions on fish growth were obtained by Sealey et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] in a trial carried out on rainbow trout, where 25 and 50% of FM were substituted with fish offal-enriched HI pre-pupae. Belghit et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] also observed that a partial or total replacement of the diets of sea-water phase Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) containing 100 g/kg FM with insect meal did not affect the FI, daily growth increase or FCR in fish with an initial body weight of 1400 g. Similar results, in terms of growth performance and feed utilization, were found by Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and Magalh√£es et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. These authors concluded that up to 14% and 19.5% of HI meal can be included in diets of Jian carp and juvenile European seabass (
 <italic class="italic">Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>), respectively. HI meal has also been tested in diets for the juveniles of clownfish (
 <italic class="italic">Amphiprion ocellaris</italic>), an ornamental marine fish species, which were fed graded levels of a defatted HI meal in partial or total substitution of FM over a 106-day experimental period [
