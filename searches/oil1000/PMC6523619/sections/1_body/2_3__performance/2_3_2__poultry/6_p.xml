<p class="p">Regarding the use of MD in poultry diets, Adeniji [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] did not observe any effects on the performance of broiler chickens when groundnut cake was substituted with MD meal. On the contrary, TÃ©guia et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] showed that replacing fish meal with MD in the starter and grower-finisher diets led to a higher LW, without affecting the FCR. Similarly, Hwangbo et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] showed that the body weight gain (BWG) was significantly higher in birds receiving 10 or 15% maggot supplementation than in the control, while the FCR was not affected by dietary insect meal inclusion. However, when Okah and Onwujiariri [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] replaced FM with maggot meal, they instead showed that the broiler chickens fed maggot meal-based diets had superior FCR than those fed the control diet.
