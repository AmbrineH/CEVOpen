<p class="p">As far as other insect species with great potential as feeds are concerned, the introduction of TM meal into broiler and free-range chicken diets, respectively, has been reported not to influence the growth performance of the animals [

 <xref rid="B60-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. On the contrary, in female and male broiler chickens fed increasing levels of full-fat TM meal inclusion (50, 100 and 150 g/kg) as partial replacement of SBM, corn gluten meal and soybean oil, Biasato et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] showed an improvement in LW and FI, but the feed efficiency was observed to be partially impaired. The FCR of broiler chickens fed a corn-SBM-based diet in which TM larva meal was included at 29.65% as total replacement of SBM was instead positively affected by dietary insect meal inclusion [

 <xref rid="B63-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] showed reduced feed consumption and FCR, as well as increased BWG, in broiler chickens fed diets in which TM larva meal was used to completely replace SBM. In the same context, Ballitoc and Sun [
 <xref rid="B65-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] pointed out that an inclusion level of 10 g/kg TM in broiler chicken diets had a great impact on the growth performance of the animals, in terms of improved final LW, FI and FCR.
