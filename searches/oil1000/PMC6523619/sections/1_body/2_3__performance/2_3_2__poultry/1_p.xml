<p class="p">Among the various insect species (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00170-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), HI larva meal is the most widely used, and it is also the one that has been studied the longest as a protein source for poultry feeding [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. This first research showed that chicks fed a diet containing dried HI larvae (as a substitute for SBM) gained weight at a rate of 96% (even though non-significant) compared to that of birds fed the control diet, but they only consumed 93% (significant) as much feed. The majority of studies on broiler chickens and quails fed HI larva meal, compared to broilers and quails fed conventional protein sources, have revealed that there is no influence on the growth performance of the birds [

 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], with broiler quails being reported to prefer diets including HI larva meal [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In one of the most recent studies performed on broiler chickens, Dabbou et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] observed that the inclusion up to 10% of HI larva meal in partial substitution of SBM improved the final live weight (LW) and the FI during the starter period, even though the FCR of the growing and finisher periods resulted in impaired HI-fed birds (in particular those fed a 15% inclusion level) [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. On the other hand, Barbary partridges (
 <italic class="italic">Alectoris barbara</italic>) fed dietary inclusions of 100 and 190 g/kg of HI larva meal in substitution of 25 and 50% SBM, respectively, resulted in a higher LW and better FCR than the control group [
