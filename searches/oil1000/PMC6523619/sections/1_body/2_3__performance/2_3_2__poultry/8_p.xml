<p class="p">The use of insect oils/fats in poultry diets, in substitution of conventional lipid sources, has led to controversial results as far as the performance parameters are concerned. For instance, no differences were observed by Schiavone et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], who fed broiler diets containing 3.43 or 6.87% of HI fat in partial or total substitution of soybean oil. On the other hand, Kierończyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] in a first trial reported a decrease in FI and FCR, but no effect on BWG, when broilers were fed diets containing TM oil in substitution of soybean oil. Nevertheless, in a second trial, the same authors used TM and
