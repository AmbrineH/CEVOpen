<p class="p">As far as laying hens are concerned, no significant differences have been observed for diets containing partially defatted HI larva meal of dried HI larvae as a partial or complete replacement of soybean cake [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Al Qazzaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] reported an unaffected or improved growth performance and productivity in laying hens fed diets supplemented with 1% or 5% of HI larva meal. On the contrary, laying hens fed diets in which the SBM was completely replaced by HI larva meal showed a more favorable FCR than birds fed the control diet, but a lower laying percentage, FI, average egg weight, and egg mass [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Mwaniki et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] showed that the inclusion up to 7.5% defatted HI larva meal in a cornâ€“SBM diet fed to pullets (19 to 27 weeks of age) increased FI and FCR. Bovera et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] observed no change in the egg weight, FI or FCR in HI-fed laying hens, although the egg mass and the laying percentage were positively affected by the lowest inclusion levels of HI larva meal (7.3%). Hens fed diets containing HI have also been reported to show higher egg production and weight than those fed a control diet [
