 <xref rid="B70-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. MD maggot meal has been reported to have been used to replace 50% of FM in a cassava-based diet without any adverse effects on FI, FCR, egg production, or shell strength. However, 100% replacement was deleterious to hen-egg production [

 <xref rid="B70-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] showed an improvement in the clutch size, egg weight, number of eggs hatched, and chick weight of birds supplemented with 30 and 50 g of live MD.
