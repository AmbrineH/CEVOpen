<p class="p">Similarly to what has been observed for nutrient digestibility, the growth performance of pigs fed diets containing insect meal may vary remarkably (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00170-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). However, these differences seem to be related to the insect species rather than to the dietary inclusion levels.
