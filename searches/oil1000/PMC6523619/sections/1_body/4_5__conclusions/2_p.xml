<p class="p">Research interest in this topic is growing, and this has led to an increase in the number of published data. The available scientific literature demonstrates that insect-derived product digestibility is impacted by the insect species, the inclusion levels and by the process (drying, defattening). Generally speaking, high digestibility values have been recorded. Sometimes, the presence of chitin can lead to a decrease in nutrient digestibility. The same considerations are true for animal performance. As far as product quality is concerned, although the effects of chitin on the proximate composition are not consistent, a dramatic effect of insect products has been recorded for the fatty acid profile, together with a decrease in the valuable n3 fatty acids and a general worsening of the nutritive value. The sensory analyses that have been performed report no or only slight differences against the product obtained using conventional nutrient sources, especially when untrained panelists are involved. Other insect-derived products, such as fat/oil or chitin, have shown a great potential, not only as a source of nutrients, but also as an immunostimulant and modulator of the animal microbiota, thus opening the way to new uses and possibilities.</p>
