<p class="p">Regarding the effect of insect meals on egg quality characteristics, Mwaniki et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] reported that including up to 7.5% of defatted HI larva meal in a corn–SBM diet for pullets (19 to 27 weeks of age) led to an increase in the intensity of the yolk color, as well as an increase in the egg shell-breaking strength and thickness. The same results were obtained by Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>], who recently tested the effects of the total replacement of SBM with HI larva meal in laying hen diets (Lohmann Brown Classic) and they have reported a higher proportion of yolk in the eggs, as well as higher amounts of γ-tocopherol, lutein, β-carotene and total carotenoids in HI-fed birds. Ruhnke et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] instead showed a decrease in egg weight, shell weight and thickness, as well as a decrease in the intensity of the yolk color in free-range laying hens fed HI larva meal.
