<p class="p">Little information is available on the effect of insect meals on meat sensory properties. An unaffected meat sensory profile (odor, flavor, aroma, texture, juiciness, and tenderness) was observed in broiler quails [
 <xref rid="B95-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>] and chickens [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] fed HI larva meals. However, Altmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] instead showed that the breast meat of broilers fed diets containing HI meal had a more intense flavor that decreased over storage time. In a study by Pieterse et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], broiler chickens that were fed HI larvae produced breast meat that had a higher metallic aroma and aftertaste, and more sustained juiciness values than those fed soya bean- and fishmeal-based diets. Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] reported that various IM products did not affect the meat taste or the flavor, but the tenderness and the juiciness were higher in a TM-fed group than in the control and the other diets.
