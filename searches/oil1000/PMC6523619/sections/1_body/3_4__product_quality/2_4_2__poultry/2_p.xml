<p class="p">The effect of insect meals on meat quality parameters and chemical composition have partially been studied. Studies carried out on broiler chickens [

 <xref rid="B93-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] fed different HI and TM meal inclusion levels reported no significant differences for the color of broiler meat. On the other hand, Cullere et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], Schiavone et al. [

 <xref rid="B92-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] showed that HI and MD larva meals affected the meat color of broiler chickens and broiler quails, respectively. Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] did not observe any effect on the color of raw meat of Barbary partridges fed HI and TM meal, but an increase in the yellowness index of the cooked meat was observed.
