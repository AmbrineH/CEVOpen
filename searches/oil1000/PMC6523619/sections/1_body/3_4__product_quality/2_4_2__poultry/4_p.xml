<p class="p">With regards to the effect of insect meals on poultry meat FA profile, as a result of the high SFA content of HI, quails fed increasing levels of HI larva meal showed increased and decreased contents of SFA (mostly lauric acid, C12:0) and valuable PUFA (both n-3 and n-6), respectively [

 <xref rid="B91-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] showed a higher SFA and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and a lower PUFA rate in broiler chickens fed different inclusion levels of HI larva meal. The same results were obtained by Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], who observed that Barbary partridges fed 25 or 50% of HI and TM diets were characterized by higher rates of SFA and MUFA, as well as a lower PUFA content. Feeding broilers a diet containing full-fat TM meal resulted in an increase in C12:0 and C14:0, but no differences were reported as far as quality indexes, such as the PUFA n6/n3 ratio or atherogenicety and thrombogeniticy indexes, are concerned [
