<p class="p">A limited number of studies evaluating the effect of insect fats in poultry diet has so far been conducted. Schiavone et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>], after feeding broiler diets containing 3.45 or 6.9% of HI fat in partial or total substitution on soybean oil, reported no changes in the carcass characteristics or meat quality parameters, but an increased SFA, to the detriment of the PUFA fractions. Kiero≈Ñczyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] showed that TM addition had a positive effect on the PUFA, MUFA and SFA contents. The authors observed that the AI and TI values in the breast of broiler chickens were both reduced by dietary TM oil inclusion.
