<p class="p">The TM-based diets may affect the lipid content of broiler chickens when high TM larva meal levels are included in their diets [

 <xref rid="B91-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] instead observed a progressive increase in crude protein and a decrease in the moisture content in the breast meat of broilers fed 5, 10 and 15% inclusion of HI larva meal in the diets.
