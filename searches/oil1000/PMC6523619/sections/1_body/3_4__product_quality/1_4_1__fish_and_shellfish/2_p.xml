<p class="p">With regards to the proximate composition, high dietary inclusion levels (up to 50%) of TM larva meal did not lead to any changes in the moisture, protein or ash content in shrimp muscle [

 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] in fish fed the highest level (40%) of HI larva meal inclusion in their diets when compared to 20% HI- and FM-fed groups. Furthermore, Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] reported no significant effects related to dietary HI larva meal utilization on the whole body composition of carp. Similarly, Belghit et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] observed no changes in the whole body composition of HI-fed Atlantic salmon.
