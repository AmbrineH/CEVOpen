<p class="p">Regarding the effect of insect meals on product quality parameters, dietary TM larva meal utilization has been reported to not influence the water holding capacity or texture characteristics of fillets obtained from blackspot seabream [
 <xref rid="B81-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], gilthead seabream [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and rainbow trout [
 <xref rid="B82-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. With regard to the fish color, a higher redness index (a*) and increased yellowness (b*) were detected in the skin ventral region and fillet epaxial region, respectively, of blackspot seabream fed the maximum dietary inclusion level (40%) of TM larva meal [
 <xref rid="B81-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Mancini et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] instead highlighted decreased fillet yellowness in rainbow trout
