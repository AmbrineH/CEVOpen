 <xref rid="B100-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>] recently focused attention on the meat quality traits of insect fat-fed weaned rabbits. The first result that deserves mentioning is that diets with HI larva fat reduced the intramuscular fatty acid (FA) content, but increased the 12:0 and 14:0 in meat, compared to extruded linseed-based diets. Furthermore, meat from HI-fed rabbits showed a worse atherogenic index, thrombogenic index and n-3/n-6 ratio than those of linseed-fed animals. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the overall lipid profiles of the meat from HI-fed rabbits were not as healthy as those of linseed-fed animals [

On the other hand, rabbits fed diets with grass hopper meal (inclusion level of 2.5%), aimed at substituting 50% of FM, had carcasses that showed significant differences between treatments as far as the slaughter weight, carcass weight, dressing percentage, skin pelt, tail, feet and abdominal fat are concerned, with the slaughter weight and carcass weight being better in rabbits fed grass hopper meal than those fed FM [
