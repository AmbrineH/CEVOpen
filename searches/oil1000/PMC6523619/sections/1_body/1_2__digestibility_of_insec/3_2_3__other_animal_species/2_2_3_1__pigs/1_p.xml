<p class="p">The digestibility trials conducted so far have led to heterogeneous results, depending on the insect species and life stages, as well as on the dietary inclusion levels. Low inclusion levels of HI pre-pupa and larva meal (4–8% [

 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], respectively) in weaned piglet diets have been reported to have no effect on nutrient digestibility, while TM larva meal utilization (low inclusion rates of 1.5–6%) determines a linear improvement in DM and CP digestibility [

 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] also observed a higher apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of lysine, histidine, arginine, and cysteine in growing pigs fed TM larva meal-based diets (low inclusion level of 9.95%) than in pigs fed other protein source diets, as well as a greater standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of GE and cysteine. On the other hand, Newton et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] observed lower DM and higher EE digestibility in piglets fed a high inclusion level (33%) of dried HI larva meal than those fed soybean meal (SBM). Increasing levels (from 5 to 20%) of a rumen content-MD larva meal mixture in the diets of early weaned piglets has also been reported to not affect nitrogen digestibility [
