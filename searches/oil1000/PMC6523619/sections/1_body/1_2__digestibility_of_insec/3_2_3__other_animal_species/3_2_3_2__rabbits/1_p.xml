<p class="p">Very few researches have concerned the digestibility of insect-derived products in rabbits, with contrasting results being reported, in particular when different dietary inclusion levels have been considered. Dietary HI and TM larva fat utilization at low inclusion rates (0.75–1.5%) has been reported not to affect the nutrient digestibility of weaned rabbits [
