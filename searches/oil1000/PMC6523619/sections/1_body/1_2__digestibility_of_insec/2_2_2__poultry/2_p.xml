<p class="p">In the first available study about full-fat HI and TM digestibility in broiler chickens, De Marco et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] observed similar apparent digestibility coefficients of the total tract (CTTAD) for DM, CP and GE, whereas the EE was more digestible in HI meal than in TM meal (0.99 and 0.88, respectively). On the other hand, the AA apparent ileal digestibility coefficients (AIDC) reported in their study were higher in TM meal (0.86) than in HI meal (0.68). The same authors were also the first to provide data on the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and the nitrogen-corrected AME (AMEn) of HI and TM meals, which is useful information for formulating broiler diets (AME = 17.38 and 16.86 MJ/kg DM, respectively; AMEn = 16.60 and 16.02 MJ/kg DM, respectively).
