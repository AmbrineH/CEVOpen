<p class="p">As far as the different defatting processes adopted for insect meal production are concerned, Uushona [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] was the first to investigate the combined effects of heat and the defatting method on HI digestibility in broiler chickens. The author observed that diets containing defatted HI pre-pupa meal dried at 65 °C were characterized by higher nutrient CTTAD and AME than those containing full-fat HI pre-pupa meal dried at 65 °C. Cockcroft [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] also focused attention on two different defatted HI larva meal diets (namely dry rendered (DR) and extruded) and compared their effects with those of a full-fat HI and a control diet. They observed that DR diets showed the higher CTTAD for CP, EE, ash, and crude fiber.
