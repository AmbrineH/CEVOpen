<p class="p">As far as various dietary inclusion levels are concerned, Cullere et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reported higher CTTAD of EE in growing broiler quails fed a 15% level of defatted HI larva meal inclusion (89.6%) than those fed 10% (82.5%). Woods et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], in a trial with HI reared on layer mash and an equal mixture of layer mash and fish offal, recently observed a higher AME for larva-fed quails. Quails fed an equal mixture of layer mash and fish offal showed higher CTTAD for DM and OM. However, no significant differences were observed for the CTTAD of DM, OM or CP. On the contrary, high inclusion levels of TM larva meal (29.6%) in the diets of broiler chickens have been reported to lower the AIDC of DM, CP and OM [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Bovera et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] also observed a decrease in the AIDC of DM, OM and CP in HI-fed laying hens as the percentage of insects increased, with the negative effects being particularly evident when HI larva meal was included at 14.6% in their diets. Analogous findings, in terms of nutrient digestibility, were also obtained by Cutrignelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] for laying hens fed diets with high inclusion levels (17%) of HI larva meal.
