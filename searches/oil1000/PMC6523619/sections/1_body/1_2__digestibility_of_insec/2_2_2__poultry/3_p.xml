<p class="p">In order to facilitate and improve the use of insect meal in feed formulations, manufacturers have started to produce defatted larva meals. Defatted insect meals can in fact be an optimal way of providing high protein insect meals and lipid or fat by-products, which, in turn, have a great potential for alternative purposes [

 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] provided new information concerning CTTAD, AME, AMEn, and AIDC of a partially and a highly defatted HI larva meal (HIp and HIh, respectively) for broiler chickens as replacement of 250 g/kg of the basal diet. They observed that both the EE and the GE ADCs were higher in HIp (0.98 and 0.61 for the EE and GE, respectively) than in HIh (0.93 and 0.50, respectively). However, no significant difference was found for the CTTAD of CP. The same authors also showed that the animals were able to utilize the AA of both the partially and the highly defatted HI meals (AIDC of 77â€“80% for HIp and HIh, respectively), with AIDC overall not being affected by the defatting process (except for glutamic acid, proline and serine). Furthermore, as a consequence of the different defatting processes, the HIp meal showed higher levels of AME and AMEn (16.25 and 14.87 MJ/kg DM, respectively) than the HIh meal (11.55 and 9.87 MJ/kg DM, respectively) [
