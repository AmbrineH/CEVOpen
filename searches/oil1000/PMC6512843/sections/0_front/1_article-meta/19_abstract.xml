 <p class="p">Starch is one of the digestible natural polymers found in vascular plants. This natural polymer is the primary source of polysaccharides to produce energy for humans. In this work, starch was extracted from the defatted and dephenolated 
  <italic class="italic">Limnophila aromatica</italic> (DFPLA) by using the alkaline method. The DFPLA contains starch with a purity of 70.43 % where 55.1 % of it is the resistant starch. Physicochemical properties of the DFPLA starch such as solubility, morphology, swelling power, crystallinity, gelatinization, retrogradation, decomposition temperature, pasting profile, and surface functional groups were evaluated. The DFPLA starch possesses a medium-amylose content of 23.78 %, and the particle diameters of the starch were varied from 3 to 6 μm. The swelling power and solubility of the DFPLA starch are increasing as the temperature increased, where at 90 °C the swelling power and solubility of the starch is 13.73 g/g and 7.26%, respectively. Starch from DFPLA has a high total dietary fiber (76.28%) which is comparable to that of starch extracted from staple foods. The results indicate that starch from DFPLA possesses good physicochemical properties; this alternative starch may have potential application as a new feedstock for food industries.
