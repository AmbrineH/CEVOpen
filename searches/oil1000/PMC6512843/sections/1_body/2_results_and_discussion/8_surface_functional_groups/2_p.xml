<p id="p0120" class="p">FTIR spectroscopy was used to affirm the surface functional group of the starch extracted from DFPLA. The selected functional groups are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, functional groups that should be present in ordinary starch were also observed in FTIR of DFPLA starch (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The starch from DFPLA has a broad FTIR peak at 3383 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> which represent the stretching of O–H group. The peak at 2895 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was assigned to C–H stretching. The presence of water molecules associated with the starch is indicated by the peak at 1635 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Other organic functional groups also observed in DFPLA starch are at 1421 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1079 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> which assigned to C–H bending and C–O stretching, respectively.
