<p id="p0090" class="p">In this study, DSC was used to analyze the thermal properties of DFPLA starch. Gelatinization and retrogradation profile of the DFPLA starch were determined using starch with an original moisture content of 2.05 wt.% as well as starch mixed with DI water (1:4, w/w) and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The heat flow profile of gelatinization (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) of the DFPLA starch has endothermic peaks at 59.3–81.2 °C with a peak temperature at 68.3 °C and corresponding gelatinization enthalpy of 3.7 J/g. At the onset temperature (To = 59.3 °C), the structural stability of the starch starts to be disrupted. The starch granules are swelled very rapidly in water environment at high temperature. As the temperature increases to the peak temperature (Tp = 68.3 °C), some of the crystallinity parts of the starch become amorphous due to the swelling of amylopectin region that causes dissociation and uncoils of its double helices (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Atwell et al., 1988</xref>). At this rate, the original appearance of the starch should not encounter a significant change. The apparent changes should occur at the completion temperature (Tc = 81.2 °C), in which the starch granules will interconnect to each other thus cause an increase in viscosity (

The Tp obtained for DFPLA is higher than that of rice starch (67.26 °C), but lower than that of corn starch (74.81 °C). The Tp is influenced by the amylose content in which higher amylose content will produce higher Tp and vice versa. The low amylose content signifies high amylopectin content; amylopectin has lower thermal stability due to its branched structure, in this case, starch which has low amylose content tend to have low Tp.
