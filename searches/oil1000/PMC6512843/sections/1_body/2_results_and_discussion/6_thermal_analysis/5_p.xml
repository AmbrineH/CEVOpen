<p id="p0095" class="p">Retrogradation of starch was determined by keeping the gelatinized starch at refrigerator (4 °C) for 7 days, the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The endothermic peaks of the DFPLA starch appeared between 58.7 and 76.8 °C with a retrogradation enthalpy of 1.1 J/g. Generally, the retrogradation temperatures and enthalpies are lower than those of the gelatinization (main peak). At a temperature range of 4–6 °C, the recrystallization of amylopectin will overcome the maximum rate of propagation and nucleation (
