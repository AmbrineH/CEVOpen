<p id="p0100" class="p">Thermogravimetric (TG) curves obtained for DFPLA starch are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. The TG analysis began at a temperature of 34 °C. The first peak at a temperature range of 80–115 °C is indicated the evaporation of free moisture content of starch. Further increase in temperature causes the loss of water bond from the starch and some decomposition of some carbohydrate structure. The decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and carbohydrate continued until the temperature reached 387 °C. At this stage, the loss of the sample was 26.81 %. As the heating continued, the decomposition of lignin and other dietary fiber continued, and almost 80% of the sample was lost at 800 °C. As seen in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, a steep drop of the derivative curve occurred at 327.1 °C, this indicates that principal decomposition of starch occurred at this temperature.
