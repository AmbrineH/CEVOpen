 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krueger et al., 1987</xref>). In general, starch is mainly composed of amorphous and crystalline phases of amylose and amylopectin. Starch gelatinization occurs in amorphous regions where hydrogen bonds weaken rapidly so that amylose is released, the amylose caused a decrease in the melting point of crystalline regions and energy of gelatinization (
