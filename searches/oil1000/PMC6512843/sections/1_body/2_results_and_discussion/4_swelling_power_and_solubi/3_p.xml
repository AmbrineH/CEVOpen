 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">TableÂ 2</xref>. The swelling power of DFPLA starch is comparable to the wheat, potato, and cassava starch; but lower than that of banana, chestnut, corn, and rice. The difference in swelling power is due to the difference in amylose content, in which biomasses with lower amylose content tend to possess high swelling power. In the characteristic of solubility, the temperature is the most influential. The solubility of the starch is increased at a higher temperature and decreased at a lower temperature.
