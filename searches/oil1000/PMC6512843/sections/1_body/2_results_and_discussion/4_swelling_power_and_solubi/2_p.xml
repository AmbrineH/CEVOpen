<p id="p0065" class="p">The starch swelling power indicates the uptake of water during the gelatinization of starch. In the gelatinization process, hot water is absorbed in the molecules of starch granules and caused them to swell. The hydrogen bonds between water and hydroxyl groups of amylopectin and amylose are disrupted during the process, and it will trigger the swelling and solubilization of the starch granules. Subsequently, some of the amylose content is released from the granules. Eventually, the starch granules absorbed more water and more swelled. Several factors influence the extent of this interaction is the amylose/amylopectin ratio, degree, and length of the branch of amylose and amylopectin, as well as the distribution of the molecular weight (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoover, 2001</xref>). The swelling properties of starch isolated from DFPLA as a function of temperature were tested and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. The swelling power of starch increases from 9.47 g/g at 30 °C to 13.73 g/g at 90 °C. The starch solubility increased from 1.87 wt.% at 30 °C to 7.26 wt.% at 90 °C.
