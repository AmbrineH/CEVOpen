 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 5</xref> depicts the X-ray diffractogram of DFPLA starch. In order to identify the crystalline type of starch, the diffraction pattern of DFPLA starch was compared with the diffraction pattern of other starches (

The starches of cereal usually have the A-type diffraction pattern, while for tuber and starches with a high amylose content usually possess B-type diffraction pattern. The starches of some fruit, roots, legume have C-type diffraction pattern. It is also believed, that C-type diffraction pattern is the combination of A-type and B-type starches (
