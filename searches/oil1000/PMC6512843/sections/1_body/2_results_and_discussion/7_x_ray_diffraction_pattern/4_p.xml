 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nara and Komiya, 1983</xref>). Based on the result of TOPAS Version 4.2 XRD data analysis program, the relative crystallinity of the starch isolated from DFPLA was found to be 32.18 %. This relative crystallinity is within the range of natural starches, specifically 15â€“45% (
