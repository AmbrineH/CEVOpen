<p id="p0110" class="p">The X-ray diffraction pattern of DFPLA starch indicates that the amorphous structure more dominant than the crystalline structure. Several characteristic peaks of A-type starch and B-type starch were observed in the XRD pattern of DFPLA starch (2θ around 15°, 17°, 22° and 24°). The characteristic of A-type starch indicated by strong reflection at 2θ = 15° and a lower intensity peak at 17°, while the B-type starch indicated by peaks around 2θ = 22° and 24°. The presence of both A-type and B-type of starches in DFPLA starch indicates that the crystalline structure of the starch is C-type starch.</p>
