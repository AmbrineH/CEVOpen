<p id="p0055" class="p">The composition of the starch isolated from DFPLA is summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The isolated starch product has starch content of 70.43 wt.% (55.10% of starch was resistant starch), total dietary fiber (TDF) content of 76.28 wt.%, protein 1.02%, ash 4.87%, water 2.05%, and others 0.45%. The TDF consists of polysaccharides, lignin, remnants of plant cells, and substances resistant to hydrolysis (digestion) by the alimentary enzymes of humans (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trowell et al., 1976</xref>). The resistant starch is one of insoluble dietary fiber. The starch of DFPLA consists of 23.78% amylose (insoluble starch) and 76.22% amylopectin (soluble starch). The yield of starch isolated from DFPLA using the alkaline method is 44.6%, thus 1 kg of dried DFPLA can produce approximately 446 g of starch. This value is still far below the yield of starch from various staple foods; specifically the starch yield for rice is 75.8%, wheat 71.9%, and corn 79.5% (

 <italic class="italic">aromatica</italic> is a secondary food; hence the use of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aromatica</italic> can reduce competition from industry to the human in consuming of staple foods.
