 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, with peak viscosity (PV) of 4380 cp and final viscosity (FV) of 5340 cp. Pasting starts approximately after heating 3.5 min with a pasting temperature of 79.3 °C; starch can withstand heat up to 6.5 min before breaking down. The PV value of the DFPLA starch is found to be lower than that of banana and potato starch, but higher than that of rice and cassava starch (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>); specifically, the PV order is potato (6179 cp) &gt; banana (4577 cp) &gt; DFPLA (4380 cp) &gt; cassava (4372 cp) &gt; rice (3380 cp). Some previous studies indicated that the PV value is affected by the total amylopectin content, where the higher amylopectin (lower amylose) content, the higher the PV (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gupta et al., 2009</xref>). The amylopectin content of the above mentioned starches is as follow: potato (83.12) &gt; banana (81.67) &gt; DFPLA (76.22) &gt; cassava (71.80) &lt; rice (79.55). Based on the above statement, the PV value of rice starch should be higher than that of DFPLA and cassava. The deviation and characteristic in pasting properties are affected by many factors such as amylopectin chain structure, lipid content, granule size, and protein content (
