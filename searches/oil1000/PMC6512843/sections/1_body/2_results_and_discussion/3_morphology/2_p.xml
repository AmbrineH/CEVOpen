 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Most of the starch granules have oval and round shapes which are 3–6 μm in size. Granule size plays an important role in determining the physical properties of starch, such as gelatinization, crystallinity, and solubility. The shape of starch granules is a mixture of granular, oval, and discoid which is a characteristic of starch isolated from photosynthetic tissues (
