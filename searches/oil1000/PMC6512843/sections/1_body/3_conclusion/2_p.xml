<p id="p0125" class="p">Starch was successfully isolated from the defatted and de-phenolics 
 <italic class="italic">L. aromatica</italic> (DFPLA) by using the alkaline method. DFPLA starch contains 70.43% starch, 1.02% protein, 21.18% total dietary fiber (without resistant starch), 4.87% ash, 2.05% water, and others. Resistant starch content and amylose content of the DFPLA starch is 55.1% and 23.78 %, respectively. The shape of starch granules is a mixture of granular, oval, and discoid with sizes of approximately 3–6 μm. Given the physicochemical properties, the medium-amylose starch from DFPLA can be used to partially substitute the potato or rice or corn starches which have similar amylose content and features. DFPLA starch has a quite high viscosity and potential to be an adhesive.
