<p id="p0045" class="p">The starch sample was re-suspended in water and filtered under vacuum using a cellulose acetate membrane filter (0.2 μm). The starch sample was then freeze-dried for 2 days. The surface morphology of the starch was characterized using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM), JSM-6390LV, JEOL – USA. The SEM was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Before the scanning analysis, the starch particles were coated with gold.</p>
