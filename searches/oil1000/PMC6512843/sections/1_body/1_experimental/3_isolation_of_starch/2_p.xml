 <xref rid="bib42a" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang and Wang, 2001</xref>). Briefly, DFPLA was soaked in NaOH solution (0.1%, 1:2 (w/v)) for 18 h under constant stirring. After the process completed, the solid was separated from the solution using filtration. The solid was rinsed several times with 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution and distilled water until the pH of rinse water is constant. The starch then suspended in distilled water (pH 6.5). The starch was separated from the suspension using the centrifugation method. The excess chemical was removed from the starch by rinsing with distilled water several times and dried in a freeze dryer for 2 days. The dried starch was kept in a desiccator before analysis.
