<p id="p0025" class="p">Different biomass cultivars give different starch properties. Understanding of starch physical and chemical properties is vital for the application of starch since they affect the quality of the products produces; for example, in food applications, coating batter prepared using high-amylose starch produce more foods that are firmer and crispier after being fried while low-amylose starch is not (

The chemical or biochemical modification is sometimes conducted if the physical or chemical characteristics of native starch do not fulfill certain applications. So far there have been no studies investigating the content and nature of starch from
