Starch plays an essential role in providing energy for human activity; it also has a broad application in food and nonfood industries. Starch has been used as raw material in industries such as adhesives, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, paper, textile, and construction. Other advanced industries such as biodegradable plastic coating, printed circuit boards (PCB), and dry cell batteries also started to use starch as raw material due to its harmless property and environmental friendly (

Another consideration for some advanced industries for using starch as a raw material is to reduce the use of petrochemical resources by blending it with starch. The resulting polymer blends are known to have increased in biodegradability (
