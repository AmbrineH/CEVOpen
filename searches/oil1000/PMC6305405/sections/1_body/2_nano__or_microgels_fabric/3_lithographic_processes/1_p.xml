<p class="p">Lithographic technique fabricates nano- or microgels by templating hydrogels at nano- or micro-scale level. This method needs a template to control both the size and morphology of the product (Helgeson et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). For example, imprint lithography utilizes a template that acts as a mold for the hydrogel precursors, and UV light is then applied to polymerize the precursors inside the mold (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>). Nano- or microgels are recovered from the mold, typically by mechanical delamination post-synthesis. Biologics are often loaded by incubation with collected nano- or microgels after polymerization to avoid the UV light exposure. Alternatively, biologics can also be mixed with the hydrogel precursors if the crosslinking condition is mild. Lithographic technique provides a precise control over particle size, morphology, and monodispersity by tuning the template characteristics.
