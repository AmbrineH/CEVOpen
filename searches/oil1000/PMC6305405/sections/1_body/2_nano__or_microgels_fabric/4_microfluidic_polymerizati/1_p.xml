<p class="p">Microfluidic synthesis technique requires a lithographically fabricated microfluidic device (typically manufactured by polydimethylsiloxane), and generates nano-, or microgels droplets one at a time in a continuous manner. Taking emulsion-based microfluidic system as an example, multiple phases (monomers in aqueous, crosslinkers in oil, etc.) meet in a junction geometry and droplets form. Crosslinking will occur right after the formation of these droplets (Figure

Characteristics of nano- or microgels, including size, morphology, and size distribution can be precisely controlled by several parameters, such as the nozzle diameter and flow rate (Headen et al.,
