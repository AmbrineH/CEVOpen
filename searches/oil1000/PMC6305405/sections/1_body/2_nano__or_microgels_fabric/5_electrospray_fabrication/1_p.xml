<p class="p">In the electrospray, the liquid flows from a capillary nozzle through an electric field that disrupts a large droplet into nano- or microdroplets. The nano- or microdroplets are then collected and homogenized in the crosslinking solution (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1E</xref>). When an electric field is applied to a droplet, the electric charge generates an electrostatic force into the droplet. Nano- or microdroplets will form when the electrostatic force overcomes the cohesive force of the droplet. The particle size and the size distribution can be tuned by adjusting parameters, such as the flow rate of the solution and the applied electric potential (Tapia-Hernandez et al.,
