<p class="p">Emulsion polymerization generally involves an aqueous phase containing surfactants, an oil phase containing monomers and crosslinkers, and initiators to start the radical polymerization process (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>; Tobita et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). The system is then homogenized to generate droplets of monomer in oil phase, surrounded by the water phase. The surfactants stabilize the droplets and prevent them from aggregation. By initiating the reaction (e.g., heating the system for a thermal initiator), the initiators react to form free radicals that start the polymerization process. In a variant of this technique (inverse emulsion polymerization), the aqueous phase contains the monomers and crosslinkers while the initiators can be in either of two phases. The particle size can be tuned by adjusting parameters such as the homogenization speed and the reaction temperature (Tobita et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Biologics, such as functional proteins or drugs can be loaded by incubation with collected nano- or microgels after synthesis (Liu and Garcia, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The system for emulsion polymerization may also be adjusted to remove the heating step, or the surfactants, to facilitate the biologics loading.
