<p class="p">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been a focus in cell-based therapies for tissue repair and regeneration because of their multilineage differentiation potentials (Augello et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Boeuf and Richter, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Growth factors and other chemical inductive cues can effectively induce MSCs differentiation. However, this approach suffers from its own restrictions including the potential off-target effects when treated in large dosages, and long-term maintenance of phenotype after the removal of these cues (Leach and Whitehead, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). It has been proven that extracellular matrix (ECM) can direct the MSCs fate through the physical interactions (Engler et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Multiple studies have used nano- or microgels as building blocks to assemble the extracellular matrix (ECM) and investigate their effects on the MSCs differentiation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2D</xref>).
