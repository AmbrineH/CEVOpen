<p class="p">Nano- or microgels have been used as building blocks for scaffolds due to its several advantages including ease of fabrication and rapid response to stimulus (Gan et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Dhandayuthapani et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Cell adhesion on two-dimensional surface or three-dimensional scaffold has been a focus of biophysical research (Dai and Ngai, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Multiple physical or chemical features of the nano- or microgels can dictate their interactions with cells, including the composition, physical properties (porosity, stiffness, etc.) and topography (Leach and Whitehead, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). These interactions will direct cells morphogenesis, proliferation, or even differentiation.
