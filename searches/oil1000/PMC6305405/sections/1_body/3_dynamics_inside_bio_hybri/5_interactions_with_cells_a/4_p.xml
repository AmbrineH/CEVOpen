<p class="p">In another work, Caldwell et al. assembled the PEG (polyethylene glycol) microgels into a microporous, covalently linked material, and seeded the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into the porous scaffold (Caldwell et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). To assemble the scaffold, two PEG microgels functionalized with DBCO (dibenzocylcooctyne) or azide groups were separately prepared, and then mixed for crosslinking. Especially, they used two conditions (low shear and high shear) to generate microgels with different sizes. Microgels formed using low shear (votex) had a mean particle diameter of 120 μm (PEG microgels with DBCO) and 130 μm (PEG microgels with azide). Microgels formed using high shear (sonication) were an order of magnitude smaller, with average particle sizes of 16 μm (PEG microgels with DBCO), and 15 μm (PEG microgels with azide). While cells showed high survival rate in both cases, their morphology differed significantly in two scaffolds made by small or large microgels. The cells seeded in the networks made of small microgels had only small protrusions into the matrix, with only diffuse actin fibers present. Comparatively, in the networks made by the big microgels, hMSCs spread and exhibited visible actin fibers.
