<p class="p">From composition perspective, Dai et al. demonstrated that the interactions between MSCs and pNIPAM-AA (poly-N-isopropylacrylamide-acrylic acid) microgels can have a direct effect on osteogenesis of MSCs. Due to the existence of carboxyl groups in the microgels, supplementing microgels could either absorb the free calcium ions and prevent the osteogenesis (supplementing during early osteogenesis), or bind the calcium deposited cells (supplementing during the late osteogenesis) to further promote the osteogenesis through its interactions with cells.</p>
