<p class="p">Responsive nano or micro-drug delivery systems have been extensively studied in cancer therapy. Due to the weak acidic micro-environment of tumors, pH-responsive nano, or microgels carriers with acid-cleavable bond are usually designed to ensure the controlled drug release. Xiong et al. reported a drug carrier, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) nanogel with dual temperature and pH sensitivity (Xiong et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The system precipitated on the heated cancer tissues (~42Â°C, local hyperthermia) due to the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition when temperature was higher than its LCST. The anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was covalent linked to the nanogel via an acid-cleavable bond, which could be released efficiently in the acidic microenvironment of tumor tissues. The system utilized both the temperature and pH sensitivity of the materials, as well as acid-cleavable design to ensure the controlled release missions.
