<p class="p">These responsive nano- or microscale biohybrid system are also widely used in controlled diabetic therapeutic delivery. For example, Sung et al. developed a pH-responsive system consisting of chitosan and poly(γ-glutamic acid) for oral insulin delivery (Sung et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Poly(γ-glutamic acid) was incorporated since it could conjugate with insulin via Zn

At intestine (pH ~ 7.0–8.0), the chitosan chains were deprotonated and collapsed. The swollen to shrunk transition of the encapsulating materials enabled the insulin release.
