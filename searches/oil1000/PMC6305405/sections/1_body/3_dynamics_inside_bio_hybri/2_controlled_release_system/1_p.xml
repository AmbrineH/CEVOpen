<p class="p">Besides the general requirements for a drug delivery system, such as optimum loading capacity and biocompatibility, effective delivery of drugs at correct time and location is always considered a big challenge. It requires the system to sense the signals (environmental sensitivity) and actively respond to them (controlled release). Nano- or microgels are potential candidates since the materials can be engineered to sense the environmental cues, while the release of the drugs can be triggered by the volume change of materials (Figure
