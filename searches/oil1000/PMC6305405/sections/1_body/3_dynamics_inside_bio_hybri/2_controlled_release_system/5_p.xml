<p class="p">The stimulus-responsive features of nano- or microgels can be further coupled with other biologics, such as an enzyme, to achieve a more sophisticated signal-sensing capability. Gu et al. reported an injectable microgels for controlled glucose-responsive release of insulin by integrating a pH-responsive chitosan matrix, enzyme nanocapsules and insulins (Gu et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The enzyme converted the glucose into the gluconic acid at the hyperglycemic condition, and therefore swelled the chitosan matrix due to the protonation of the chitosan networks. Consequently, these microgels were self-regulating and able to release insulins at the basal or higher rate based on normal or hyperglycemic conditions.
