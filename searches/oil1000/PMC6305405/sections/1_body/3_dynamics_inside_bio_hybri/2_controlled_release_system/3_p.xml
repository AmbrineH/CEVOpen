<p class="p">In another work, Song et al. developed a responsive nanogel system to deliver both a chemotherapeutic drug (paclitaxel) and a cytokine (interleukin-2) to combat tumors (Song et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). They first modified the chitosan into two oppositely charged chitosan derivatives. The nanogels were then assembled by mixing these two chitosan derivatives, and further photo-crosslinked with addition of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin acrylate. The pH responsiveness of nanogel to a weak acidic tumor microenvironment could be fine-tuned by adjusting the formulation, while incorporation of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin acrylate increased the encapsulation efficiency of paclitaxel (very low solubility in aqueous phase). This responsive bio-hybrid nanogel system integrated chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and significantly enhanced the antitumor activity with improved calreticulin exposure and antitumor immunity.
