<p class="p">Wang et al. reported a pain management strategy based on microencapsulated cell-engineering principles (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). The engineered cells can respond to volatile spearmint aroma and produce an analgesic peptide (huwentoxin-IV) that selectively inhibits the pain-triggering voltage-gated sodium channel. Engineered cells were encapsulated in alginate capsules (400 Î¼m). Their results showed that mice (chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain model) implanted with the capsules demonstrated reduced pain-associated behaviors on oral or inhalation-based intake of spearmint essential oil, with negligible cardiovascular, immunogenic, and behavioral side effects.
