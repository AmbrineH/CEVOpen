<p class="p">In another example, Shao et al. demonstrated a smartphone-assisted treatment of diabetes in mice by microgel encapsulated cells (Shao et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In their design, the implanted capsules carried both optogenetically engineered cells and wirelessly powered far-red light (FRL) LEDs (light-emitting diodes). The far-red light LEDs were remotely controlled by smartphone programs or bluetooth-active glucometer in a glucose-dependent manner. Optogenetically engineered cells could respond to FRL based on the bacterial light-activated cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) synthase, and activate the expression of mouse insulin. The mouse insulin would then diffuse out from the capsules to control the glucose level in blood.
