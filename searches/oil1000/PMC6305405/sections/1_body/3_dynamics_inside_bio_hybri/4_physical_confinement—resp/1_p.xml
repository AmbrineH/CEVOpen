<p class="p">Quorum sensing (QS) refers to the ability of organisms to detect and respond to the population density with a specific behavior (Figure

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Shuma and Balazs, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). QS plays an essential role in the life cycle of bacteria, yeast, as well as social insects. Designing a man-made system mimicking QS behavior, that is sensing and responding to the system size and density is important but challenging (Ford and Silver, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Shuma and Balazs, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In this notion, polymeric microgels can be integrated with QS cells, since the microgels provide a natural spatial segregation in differentiating the interior and exterior environments. Therefore, the cell populations in individual microgel are effectively insulated from the surrounding environment and other microgels. The porous structure traps the cells, but allows the free diffusion of nutrients and signaling molecules.
