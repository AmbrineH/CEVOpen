<p class="p">In this notion, Huang and Lee demonstrated an engineering safeguard to prevent unintended proliferation by coupling collective survival and environment sensing of bacteria (Lopatkin et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Programmed by an engineered circuit, the cells can produce beta-lactamase (BlaM), which is able to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics, such as carbenicillin (Cb) only at a sufficiently high density regulated by QS. At the same time, sufficient cells were required to produce and secrete enough BlaM for population survival. Consequently, the cells inside the microgel can sense the physical confinement, produce BlaM and get rescued due to their high densities. Those escaping from microgel, instead, will be eliminated.
