<p class="p">Although we have discussed various modes of dynamics inside the bio-hybrid systems, it is noted that all these dynamics remain in one-direction, from the side of either materials, or cells. We hardly find two-directional communications between the materials and biologics in a published bio-hybrid system, which may possess enormous potentials in both fundamental studies and real applications. For example, the cells can respond to physical confinement from the materials, while the materials can probe the dynamics of the cells. In this notion, we are expecting to design and discover bio-hybrid nano- or microgels systems with more delicate and sophisticated functional dynamics in the future.</p>
