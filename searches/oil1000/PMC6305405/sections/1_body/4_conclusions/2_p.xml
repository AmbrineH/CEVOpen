<p class="p">It is noteworthy that for each nano- or microgels system we are discussing here, it still bears some intrinsic limitations. For example, the typical method for alginate polymerization is introducing divalent cations, such as Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> or Ba
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, normally at a relatively high concentration comparing to the intracellular conditions. That means, the introduced ions may shift the physiological status of living organisms, complicating the biological processes. For many synthetic polymer system (e.g., pNIPAM), polymerization and crosslinking are mostly initiated by the radical ions. However, either chemical or light-induced method is detrimental to living organisms due to the strong oxidizing ability. Therefore, it is difficult to encapsulate the living cells inside these systems.
