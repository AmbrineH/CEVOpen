<p class="p">Nano- or microgels with tunable properties and sensitivities to external stimulus, have served not only as ideal model systems to explore fundamental questions in physical science, but also as suitable matrixes for diverse applications. With the fast growth in the area of synthetic biology, the integration of engineered microorganisms and polymeric carriers open another door to address both the fundamental problems in population dynamics and evolution, and the real challenges in biotechnology and medicines. This brief review covers several commonly used natural and synthetic nano- or microgels systems, and some of their applications when integrated with diverse biologics spanning from protein drugs, microbiome to mammalian cells. Especially, the dynamics inside the integrated systems to realize the desired function, either from the side of materials or the living organisms, are highlighted.</p>
