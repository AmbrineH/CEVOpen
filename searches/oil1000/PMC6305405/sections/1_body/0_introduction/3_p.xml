<p class="p">By far, the researchers have successfully integrated the nano- or microgels and biologics to demonstrate a broad range of applications. Nano- or microgels are integrated with therapeutics to treat diabetes and cancer (Das et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Sung et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Gu et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kanamala et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), or assembled with stem cells in the tissue engineering (Das et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Caldwell et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Recently, the integration of nano- or microgels with engineered cells has proven their superiority in diseases detection and treatment (Shao et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Xue et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). We will start from the basic characteristics, crosslinking strategies, and synthesis scheme of several nano- or microgels systems, and later discuss their applications when integrated with various biologics. In particular, we will focus on the functional dynamics inside the bio-hybrid systems, from either materials or cells side.
