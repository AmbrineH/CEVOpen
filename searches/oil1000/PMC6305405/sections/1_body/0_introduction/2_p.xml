 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). A key focus for synthetic biology is engineering bacteria for medical and environmental related applications (Ye and Fussenegger, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Slomovic et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Higashikuni et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Karig, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, these engineered cells need to be trapped and separated from the surrounding tissues and environment to avoid side effects (Chang, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Auslander et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Microgels mediated encapsulation provides a solution since the porous structure allows permeability of small molecules, such as oxygen, nutrients, growth factors, and signaling molecules. At the same time, it prevents large molecules, such as immunoglobulins and immune cells (high molecular weight complexes) from reaching the encapsulated cells, and encapsulated cells from reaching tissues and environment (Auslander et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ye and Fussenegger, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
