<p class="p">Hydrogels are polymeric materials that consist of crosslinked three-dimensional (3D) networks. Due to their porosity and high water content, they can serve as ideal matrices for controlled release of biomolecules, cells encapsulation and delivery, as well as scaffolds in tissue engineering (Minh and Lee,

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Smeets and Hoare, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Suo et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Stimulus-sensitive hydrogels, in particular, can swell or shrink in response to multiple modes of external stimulus such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, and light (Gorelikov et al.,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Trongsatitkul and Budhlall,

Compared with macrogels (millimeters to a few centimeters), nano- or microgels (several nanometers to hundreds of microns) can respond more quickly to environmentally-triggered changes, enabling their uses in controlled and regulated applications (Dai and Ngai,

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Headen et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, their small size allows administration by various routes (e.g., injection) (Liu and Garcia,
