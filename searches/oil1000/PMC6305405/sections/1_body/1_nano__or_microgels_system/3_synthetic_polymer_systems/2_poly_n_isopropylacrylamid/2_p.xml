<p class="p">pNIPAM nano- or microgels are usually prepared by precipitation polymerization (Acciaro et al.,

Besides pNIPMA, various comonomers (such as acrylic acid) can be co-polymerized into the nano- or microgels networks during the synthesis process, and the nano- or microgels size can be controlled from tens of nanometers to microns (Karg and Hellweg,
