<p class="p">Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) nano- or microgels systems have been one of the most widely studied systems due to its unique thermal sensitivity. Nano- or microgels made of pNIPAM have a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at approximately 32Â°C (Wu and Zhou, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Dai and Wu, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The nano- or microgels swell or shrink when temperature is below or above the LCST, with their size changing by more than an order of magnitude (Dai and Wu, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The incorporation of other monomers, such as acrylic acid (AA) or methacrylic acid (MAA) further equips the system with pH and ionic strength responsiveness (Gan et al.,

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
