<p class="p">As another typical synthetic polymer, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) nano- or microgels are also widely studied and used. Especially, its utilization has been approved by FDA (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration) due to its biocompatibility, low protein adhesion, and non-immunogenicity (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The end hydroxyl groups of PEG molecules can be readily modified with organic functional groups, such as carboxyl, thiol and acrylate, which greatly facilitates the nano, or microgels assembly, as well as the bioactive agents conjugation (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). PEG nano- or microgels can be fabricated by either batch or continuous fashions. For example, Tan et al. fabricated a PEG-protein nanogels by mixing PEG (modified with benzaldehyde end groups) and protein molecules (lysine residues) in a batch manner (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). In another work, Guerzoni et al. used a microfluidic device to generate PEG microgel capsules in a continuous way (Guerzoni et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The resultant PEG microgels had a hollow core facilitating the bioactive molecules loading, while the shells were assembled by photo-crosslinking six-armed acrylated star-shaped PEG.
