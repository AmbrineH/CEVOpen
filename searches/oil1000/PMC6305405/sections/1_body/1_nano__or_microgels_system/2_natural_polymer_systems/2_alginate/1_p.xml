<p class="p">Alginate is an anionic polysaccharide (α-D-mannuronic acid and β-L-guluronic acid) derived from seaweed, and has been broadly used due to its biocompatibility, flexibility in modifications, and mild crosslinking conditions (Lee and Mooney, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Szekalska et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Divalent cations are the most frequently used crosslinking agents to prepare alginate nano- or microgels. The gel structure forms when the divalent cations bind to guluronate blocks of one alginate chain and the other adjacent chain (Lee and Mooney, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Calcium chloride is commonly used as a divalent cation related crosslinking agent. However, its high solubility and fast diffusion in aqueous solution typically lead to rapid but poorly controlled gelation. To control the gelation rate in order to attain a more uniform gel structure and better mechanical integrity, one approach is to use a buffer system containing phosphates. The phosphate groups will compete with carboxyl groups from alginate for calcium ions and slow down the overall gelation rate. Calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate, because of their lower solubility, can also be used to control the gelation rate and derive a more uniform crosslinking structure (Augst et al.,
