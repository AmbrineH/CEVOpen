<p class="p">The major concern about the ionically crosslinked alginate nano- or microgels is their limitation in long-term stability, since monovalent cations will gradually replace divalent cations and dissociate the network in the physiological condition. Therefore, cationic polymers such as poly (L-lysine) (PLL), have been utilized to coat the surface of alginate nano- or microgels based on their electrostatic interactions (polyanions and polycations) to enhance the overall stability. In another approach, chemical crosslinking (covalent bonding) can be applied parallelly with ionic crosslinking. For example, a photo crosslinked alginate-methacrylate microgel was prepared by integrating the ionic and chemical crosslinking strategies (Li et al.,

Photo-crosslinking, which proceeds much slower, was used to increase the stability of beads due to the irreversibility of covalent bonding.
