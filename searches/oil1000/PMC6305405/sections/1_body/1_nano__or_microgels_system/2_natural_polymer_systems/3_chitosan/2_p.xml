<p class="p">Chitosan can form hydrogels by either chemical or ionic crosslinking. The most frequently used chemical crosslinkers for chitosan are dialdehydes, such as glutaraldehyde (Suh and Matthew, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Berger et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). The reaction between amine groups (chitosan) and aldehyde groups (dialdehydes) forms covalent imine bonds. Although the reaction can proceed in gentle conditions (aqueous media, room temperature), there are concerns due to the toxicity of dialdehydes (Berger et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Alternatively, other chemical crosslinkers, such as genipin, which possesses similar crosslinking properties with glutaraldehyde, but without corrosiveness, cytotoxic and carcinogenic side effects, are preferably developed and applied in recent studies (Skop et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
