<p class="p">The positively charged polysaccharide chitosan is essentially composed of β-(1,4)-linked glucosamine units (2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose) together with some proportion of N-acetylglucosamine units (2-acetamino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose), and prepared by partial deacetylation of the natural polymer chitin (Anitha et al.,
