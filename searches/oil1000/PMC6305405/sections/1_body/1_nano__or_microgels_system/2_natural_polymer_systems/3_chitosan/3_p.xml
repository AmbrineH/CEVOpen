<p class="p">Compared with chemical crosslinking, ionic crosslinking of chitosan is much simpler and milder, and therefore applied widely in medical or pharmaceutical applications. The networks form due to the electrostatic interactions between positively charged amine groups from chitosan backbones and the negatively charged crosslinkers. Both polyanions, such as heparin, or anionic molecules, such as tripolyphosphate (TPP) or phytic acid (PA) can be applied as ionic crosslinkers (Gan et al.,

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). To reinforce the stability and mechanical property of the chitosan network, the chemical and ionic crosslinking strategies can also be integrated. For example, Skop et al. has demonstrated the fabrication of genipin covalently crosslinked chitosanâ€“heparin complex microspheres (Skop et al.,
