<p class="p">Both natural and synthetic polymers have been used to synthesize the nano- or microgels (Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Oh et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although the source and batch variations provide limitations, natural polymers are generally bio-compatible, biodegradable, and have been successfully used in clinical applications (Dhandayuthapani et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In comparison, nano- or microgels made by synthetic polymers normally have predictable and reproducible physical and chemical properties. The systems made by either natural or synthetic polymers can be further tailored for special purposes, such as sensing and targeting (Gan et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Pich and Richtering, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this section, we will review several well-known and widely used natural and synthetic polymer systems, including their physical and chemical properties, as well as crosslinking strategies.
