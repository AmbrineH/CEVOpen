 <p> Nano- or microgels can be fabricated by multiple methods. (A) Emulsion polymerization (oil-in-water). Droplets of monomers (the oil) are emulsified (with surfactants) in a continuous phase of water. The initiators (often thermally-activated) start the radical polymerization process and form the nano- or microgels. (B) Precipitation polymerization. Precipitation polymerization begins initially as a homogeneous system in a continuous phase, where the monomers and initiators are completely soluble. Upon initiation, polymer networks precipitate, and growth of microgel particles proceeds with the absorption of monomers and initiators. No surfactants or stabilizing agents are needed for precipitation polymerization. (C) Imprint lithography. Hydrogel precursors are filled into a template that acts as a mold. UV light is then used to photo-polymerize the precursors inside the mold. (D) Microfluidic polymerization. Multiple phases (e.g., monomers in the aqueous phase, crosslinkers in the oil phase) meet in a junction geometry (e.g., T-junction) where droplets form. Crosslinking occurs after the formation of these droplets. (E) Electrospray. The polymer solution is pushed through a syringe pump. An electrostatic potential is applied between the nozzle or syringe needle and the crosslinking solution. The formed nano- or microdroplets further crosslink in the crosslinking solution. </p>
