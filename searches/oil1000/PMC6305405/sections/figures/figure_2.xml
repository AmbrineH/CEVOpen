  <p class="p">Dynamics inside bio-hybrid systems. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Materials can respond to external stimulus and release the cargo. Environmental stimulus, such as pH or temperature can trigger the swelling to shrinking transition of the nano- or microgels, and effectively deliver the cargo. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Engineered cells can respond to external signals and express the functional proteins. Engineered cells encapsulated in polymeric microgels can sense certain signals, such as small molecules and respond accordingly due to the synthetic gene circuit (blue circle). The polymeric capsules trap the cells, but allow the free diffusion of the signaling molecules and functional proteins expressed by cells. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Cells carrying quorum sensing (QS) circuit can sense their density inside microgels. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers (red dot), which accumulate in concentration as a function of cell density and regulate gene transcription (blue triangle) as a response. The hybrid of microgels and cells provides a man-made system that exhibits behavior analogous to QS. 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> Cells can respond to chemical or physical properties of the scaffolds with different morphogenesis, proliferation or differentiation behaviors. Nano- or microgels can be assembled into 2D or 3D scaffolds. The physical or chemical features of the nano- or microgels will affect their interactions with cells and direct morphogenesis, proliferation or differentiation of cells. The blue circle presents the nano- or microgels. The MSCs imbedded in the scaffold made by the microgels are able to differentiate into a different cell type due to the interactions between the cells and materials.
