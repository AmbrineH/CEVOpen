<p class="p">Briefly, 10 μL of pure essential oil was mixed with 1 mL of glycerol and placed in 20 mL amber glass screw-capped SPME vials (22.3 × 46mm, SUPELCO, PA, USA). Each vial was incubated in a shaking heated cube at 400 rpm for 25 min under 40 °C. The volatile compounds in feijoa essential oil were further extracted by a Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) SPME fiber (50/30 μm film thickness and 1 cm length; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 5 min, and subjected to GC-MS analysis. The GC-MS program and conditions were as described above in

The GC column effluent was split to the MS and Olfactory port in a 1:2 ratio by a 4-port splitter (SilFlow, Trajan, Australia). The splitter was flushed with helium at 3 mL/min. The olfactory port transfer line was set at 220 °C. To prevent dryness of the nasal mucosa, humidified air was provided to the sniffing port at a rate of 20 mL/min.
