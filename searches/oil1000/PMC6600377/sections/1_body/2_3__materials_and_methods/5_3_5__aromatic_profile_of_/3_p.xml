<p class="p">For the detection of aromatic volatiles from feijoa essential oil, four trained panelists, consisting of two females and two males (aged 20â€“35), carried out the olfactory tests by sniffing through the olfactory port whilst the GC-MS was running. The retention time and the description and intensity of each detected aroma were recorded by the panelists during each test. An initial training using mixed natural aromatic compounds was conducted and the aroma description and intensity was standardized in trial experiments. Five scores, 1 (very weak), 2 (weak), 3 (medium), 4 (strong), and 5 (very strong), were used to evaluate the aroma intensity of each detected aromatic compound. The confirmation of aromatic compounds was made upon consistent detection by more than two panelists. The aroma profile was established after mutual agreement of all panelists. All samples were tested in triplicate.</p>
