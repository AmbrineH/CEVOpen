<p class="p">The aromatic volatiles of feijoa essential oil were extracted, detected, and analyzed using headspace-solid phase micro extraction-GC-olfactory-MS (HS-SPME-GC-O-MS). In addition to the GC-MS system, an auto HS-SPME sampler controlled by a CombiPAL auto-sampler software (Cycle Composer Version 1.5.4, CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen Switzerland) and an olfactory port (Phaser OP275, ODP; ATAS/GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) connected via a 4-port splitter (SilFlow, Trajan, Australia) were equipped.</p>
