<p class="p">Feijoa fruits of the Apollo, Unique, Opal Star, and Wiki Tu cultivars were supplied by local orchards in the northern island of New Zealand. Fresh fruits were collected during the commercial ripening season (March to June in New Zealand) and the peels of the fruits from each cultivar were obtained from the fresh fruit using a handle peeler. The peel samples were stored at −20 °C prior to experiments.</p>
