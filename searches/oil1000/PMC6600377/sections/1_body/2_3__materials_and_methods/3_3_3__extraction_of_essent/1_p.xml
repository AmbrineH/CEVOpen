<p class="p">Two traditional extraction methods, steam-distillation (SD) and hydro-distillation (HD) using a Clevenger-type apparatus [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], were employed to obtain essential oils from feijoa peels. Optimization of extraction time (for both SD and HD) and material to water ratio (for HD only) was carried out to maximize the extraction yield. Briefly, for SD, the whole apparatus was set on a hot plate with 800 g of fresh feijoa peel placed in the upper flask and 2 L of water in the nether flask. The water vapor produced by the boiling water carried the essential oils to the condenser and, subsequently, to the collector. Meanwhile, for HD, the peel and water were mixed in one flask with heating from the bottom. When the mixed solution was heated to boil point, the essential oils were produced along with the water vapor. After the vapor went through a condenser, the water phase and the oil phase automatically separated in the collector. The oil yield was measured and expressed as mL/kg fresh peel.
