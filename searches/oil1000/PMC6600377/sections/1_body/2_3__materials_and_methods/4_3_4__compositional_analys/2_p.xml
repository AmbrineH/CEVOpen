<p class="p">The identification of the volatile compounds in feijoa essential oil was firstly conducted by the comparison of MS with the NIST Mass Spectral Library, through the Unknown Analysis software (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). These compounds were further confirmed with available reference analytical standards and literature records, as well as by comparing the linear retention index (LRI), calculated according to Van den Dool and Kratz [
