<p class="p">The isolated essential oils were further dissolved in hexane and subjected to compositional analysis by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Plus, Kyoto, Japan). Briefly, 10 μL of pure essential oil was dissolved in 1 mL of hexane and a further 10 μL of 2-methyl-3-heptanone (312 ug/mL) was added as the internal standard. A DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness (Agilent technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA)) was employed. Helium (&gt;99.99%) was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The injector temperature was 280 °C using a splitless injection mode with a sampling time of 1.00 min. The oven program was set as follows: Temperatures and times of 35 °C (0 min), 3 °C/min to 150 °C (5 min), 5 °C/min to 230 °C (5 min), and 20 °C/min to 280 °C (5 min). The electron-impact mass spectra were generated at 70 eV, with a scan range from 41 to 500 m/z, the ion source temperature was 200 °C, and the MS interface temperature was 250 °C.</p>
