<p class="p">In this study, four feijoa cultivars, namely Unique (early season cultivar), Apollo (early to mid-season cultivar), Wiki Tu (mid to late season cultivar), and Opal Star (late season cultivar), were carefully selected following suggestions from local growers. This is the first report that optimized the extraction method, investigated the aroma active compounds, and established the aroma profile of feijoa essential oils, with a comparison of four New Zealand grown cultivars. Moreover, the peel of feijoa fruits is normally a waste material from the juicing industry and when consumed as a fresh fruit. Obtaining highly valuable essential oils from waste materials could therefore provide additional value to the feijoa industry.</p>
