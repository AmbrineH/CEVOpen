<p class="p">Cultivar variation exists in many well-known fruits, such as apple [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], grape [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and strawberry [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Cultivar may affect fruit size, color, texture, aroma, flavor, and nutritional and bioactive compound composition. Feijoa cultivars can be roughly divided according to their ripening season. Previous studies have reported the diversity of the compound composition as well as the aroma experience in the essential oils from different plant cultivars [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In addition, the components of essential oils could also serve as biomarkers for the identification of different cultivars [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Therefore, a systematic comparison of the compound composition and aroma profile of essential oils from different feijoa cultivars could be vital in feijoa cultivar selection and differentiation.
