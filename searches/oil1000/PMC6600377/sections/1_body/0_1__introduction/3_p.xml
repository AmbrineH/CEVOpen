<p class="p">Feijoa (
 <italic class="italic">Acca sellowiana</italic> (O. Berg) Burret) is a subtropical fruit with intense aroma. It was originally discovered in South America [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and is now widely grown in New Zealand. The fruit has a green skin and a jelly pulp with a sweet-sour taste. The unique aroma/flavor of feijoa fruit is one of its most characteristic features and is believed to contribute greatly to its increasing consumption. However, very limited research has focused on volatile compounds in feijoa fruit and feijoa essential oil and the aromatic properties of feijoa have not been thoroughly reported. Hardy and Michael [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] are among the earliest researchers of feijoa volatiles and they found that methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate were dominant aroma active volatile compounds, accounting for over 90% of the total feijoa volatile oil. Despite this early publication, to date, fewer than five published works have mentioned the extraction and component analysis of feijoa essential oil and the aroma active compounds largely remain unknown.
