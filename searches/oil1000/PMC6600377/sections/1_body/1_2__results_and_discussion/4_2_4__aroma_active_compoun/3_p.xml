 <xref rid="molecules-24-02053-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, 24 aroma active compounds consisting of eight esters, eight terpenes, three alcohols, two ketones, and three unknown compounds were identified by olfactory tests. The four chemical groups were also major compositional classes in feijoa essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The most important aroma active compound, which was consistently detected with ‘strong’ intensity (aroma intensity &gt; 4) in the four essential oils, was the ‘fresh and minty’ 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol. Other major aroma contributors, with an average intensity above 3 in all essential oils, were the ‘fresh and fruity’ ethyl benzoate, the ‘honey-like’ (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl hexanoate, the ‘floral’ linalool, the ‘fruity and peach-like’ (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-geraniol, the ‘bitter and herbal’ 2-undecanone, the ‘mushroom-like’ 3-octanone, the ‘sweet and herbal’ 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-cubebene, the ‘sweet, herbal, and floral’ germacrene D, and two of the unknown compounds identified with the ‘bitter and pungent’ and the ‘fruity and honey-like’ notes (RI of 1153 and 1367, respectively, in
