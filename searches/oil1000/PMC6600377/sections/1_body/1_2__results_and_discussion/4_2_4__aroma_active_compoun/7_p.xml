<p class="p">All feijoa cultivars, located on the right side of the plot, show high correlations with those compounds separated to the same side by PC-1. This means 15 of the 24 identified aroma active compounds can be regarded as major contributors to the aroma of feijoa essential oils. Moreover, the PC-2 scale has further separated the four feijoa cultivars into different groups, with Opal Star and Unique in the upper side while Wiki Tu and Apollo in the lower side. This indicates that the Opal Star and Unique group can be better characterized by the 14 compounds in the upper side and the Wiki Tu and Apollo group had closer correlations to the eight compounds in the lower side.</p>
