<p class="p">Further to the compositional analysis of the essential oils from the four feijoa cultivars, the aroma active compounds of the essential oils were identified using the HS-SPME-GC-O-MS and they were characterized with aroma description and intensity. Due to the solvent free and non-destructive nature of the samples [
