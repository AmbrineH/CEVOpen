<p class="p">As a result, a total of 97 compounds were detected by SPME-GC-MS (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02053-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, compounds marked with *). A few compounds that were discovered by GC-MS liquid injection were not detected. These compounds were either at extremely low concentrations or had a high boiling point. In particular, the compounds with a retention index (RI) larger than 1847 (after No. 131 in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02053-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were not extracted by SPME. Similar findings from Pripdeevech, Khummueng and Park [
