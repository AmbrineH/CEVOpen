<p class="p">The extraction of feijoa essential oil was successfully conducted by both SD and HD. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A, the essential oil yielded by SD gathered rapidly during the first 90 min of extraction and gradually become stable thereafter. With regards to HD, two parameters, material to water ratio and extraction time, were evaluated to optimize the extraction conditions. The amount of essential oil reached a peak at the material to water ratio of 1:4, although it is not significantly higher than the amount at the ratio of 1:5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B-1). Similar to SD, a time-dependent generation was also observed in the process of HD, in which the essential oil yield tended to reach a plateau after 90 min of extraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B-2). Notably, the extractable quantity of essential oil by HD was significantly higher than that by SD, indicating that HD could be more suitable than SD for the commercial extraction of feijoa essential oil. Thus, HD with a material to water ratio of 1:4 and an extraction time of 90 min was selected as the extraction method with the highest yield for feijoa essential oil.
