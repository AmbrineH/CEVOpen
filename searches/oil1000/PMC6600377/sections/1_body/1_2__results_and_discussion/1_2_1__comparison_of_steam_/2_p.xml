<p class="p">Both SD and HD are well developed and widely applied traditional methods for the extraction of essential oils from natural plants. The history of the extraction and pharmaceutical application of essential oils can be dated back to the 13th century [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Previous studies have compared the extraction efficiency of SD and HD, and results have varied depending on the plant material. Boutekedjiret et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] found SD was more suitable than HD for the extraction of rosemary essential oil. Kasuan et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reached a similar conclusion that SD was more efficient than HD in the extraction of essential oil from both Kaffir lime peel and leaves, while Sefidkon et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] discovered a higher essential oil yield using HD than SD from 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic>. Similar findings from Babu and Kaul [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] were also in agreement with our present study. It has been suggested that, due to the different communication mode occurring in SD and HD, incomplete distillation may occur when materials clump together [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In the case of feijoa peel, significant agglutination and clumps formed during SD, which may have led to inefficient extraction.
