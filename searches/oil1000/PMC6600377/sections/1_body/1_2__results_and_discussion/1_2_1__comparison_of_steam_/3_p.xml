<p class="p">Nevertheless, there are very few studies carried out on the extraction and analysis of feijoa essential oil. The earliest report on feijoa essential oil was by Hardy and Michael [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], who extracted feijoa volatile oil from the whole feijoa fruit by an initial HD using a rotary evaporator, followed by the re-distillation of the collected essence with trichlorofluoromethane. Following this, Shaw et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] extracted essential oil from feijoa peel by low temperature vacuum SD and subsequent liquid-liquid extraction using hexane and diethyl ether. Both of the reports included organic solvents to aid in the separation of the oil phase from the aqueous phase and, unfortunately, neither of these publications mentioned the extraction yield. In a more recent study on feijoa peel essential oil, the extraction method of HD was employed and yielded 0.1% oil [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which is consistent with our results. Despite the aforementioned studies on feijoa essential oil, our research is the first to optimize and compare the extraction efficiency of SD and HD under solvent free conditions. In addition, as evidenced from our results, feijoa peel, as a by-product from the juicing industry, has great potential for utilization in the essential oil industries.
