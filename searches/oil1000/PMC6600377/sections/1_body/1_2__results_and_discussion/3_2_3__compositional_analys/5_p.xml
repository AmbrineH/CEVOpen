<p class="p">Esters were also major components (40 compounds in total) in feijoa essential oils, although the average concentration of the ester compounds was much lower than that of the terpenes (

The concentration of methyl benzoate (No. 27) in the four essential oils varied significantly, with the lowest concentration detected in the Opal Star essential oil being 0.24 mg/mL, with a range of 1.70–15.46 mg/mL in the other three cultivars. Ethyl benzoate (No. 39) was only a minor component identified in the essential oils from the Unique and Wiki Tu cultivars (0.12 and 0.10 mg/mL, respectively). In addition, another important previously reported volatile ester in feijoa fruit, namely ethyl butanoate [
