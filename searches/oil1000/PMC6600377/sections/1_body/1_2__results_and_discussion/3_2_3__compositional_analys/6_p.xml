<p class="p">The third dominant group in feijoa essential oil composition was alcohol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Besides the aforementioned alcohol compound 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-cadinol (No. 111), linalool, espatulenol, rosifoliol, and (−)-spathulenol (No. 28, 101, 105, and 108, respectively) were also observed at high concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), which is generally consistent with the former research [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, alcohols were not determined as major volatile compounds in feijoa fruits [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], which suggested that these compounds may not be abundant in feijoa fruits, but were concentrated during the essential oil extraction.
