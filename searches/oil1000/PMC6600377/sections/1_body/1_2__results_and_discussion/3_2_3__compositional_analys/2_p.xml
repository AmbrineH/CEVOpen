<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the identified compounds (except the unknown compounds and flavone) can be classified into 10 groups. They are esters (40 compounds), sesquiterpenes (26), alcohols (19), aromatic hydrocarbons (17), ketones (11), monoterpenes (9), hydrocarbons (7), aldehydes (6), ethers (2), and an acid (1). Apollo and Opal Star essential oils comprised of more ester compounds, 37 and 36 compounds, respectively, than the Unique (27 compounds) and Wiki Tu (29 compounds) essential oils. All four essential oils contained all of the detected sesquiterpenes, but the Wiki Tu essential oil had one less monoterpene than the essential oils from the other three cultivars. The detected aromatic hydrocarbons varied significantly, reporting 5, 6, 16, and 17 compounds in the essential oils from the Apollo, Unique, Opal Star, and Wiki Tu cultivars, respectively. In addition, slight differences were seen in the composition of alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, hydrocarbon, ether, and acid compounds in the four essential oils.
