<p class="p">The concentration of each compound differed amongst the essential oils from the four selected cultivars. For example, the concentration of 3-octanone in the Opal Star essential oil was over 30 times higher than that found in the Unique essential oil, and similarly with linalool, ethyl benzoate, (
