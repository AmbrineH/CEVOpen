 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, essential oils extracted from the four different feijoa cultivars varied in the strength of each aroma attribute. The Apollo and Wiki Tu essential oils had stronger ‘fruity and honey-like’ and ‘metallic and pungent’ notes than the Unique and Opal Star essential oils, and the Opal Star essential oil was more ‘herbal and woody’ than the others.
