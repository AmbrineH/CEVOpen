<p class="p">The ‘fruity and honey-like’ note was the leading attribute, with a higher score than the other attributes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) in the aroma profile of feijoa essential oils. The typical ‘fruity and honey-like’ note was mostly formed by ester compounds including ethyl hexanoate, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl hexanoate, and the alcohol compound (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-geraniol. To the contrary, the unpleasant ‘metallic and pungent’ note, bestowed by 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene and the unknown compound (RI of 1153), was the weakest attribute in the aroma profile of feijoa essential oil. Therefore, the aroma property of feijoa essential oil predominantly possessed pleasant aromas and could be friendly to the flavor and fragrance industry to develop feijoa aroma-based products.
