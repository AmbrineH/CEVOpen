<p class="p">The optimized HD was applied to the extraction of essential oils from four feijoa cultivars (Apollo, Unique, Opal Star, and Wiki Tu). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02053-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the Wiki Tu cultivar produced the highest volume of essential oil, relative to the other three cultivars, reaching 0.68 mL/kg fresh peel, while no significant difference was observed among the Apollo, Unique, and Opal Star cultivars. The essential oil yield of the Wiki Tu cultivar was about three-times the amount of the other selected cultivars, which suggested that cultivar difference could significantly affect the yield of feijoa essential oils. As mentioned before, Shaw, Allen and Yates [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] conducted essential oil extraction, while none of them compared the essential oils from different feijoa cultivars. Therefore, our research is the first to confirm cultivar difference affecting essential oil production. It may also be of interest to assess additional feijoa cultivars to select the most essential oil-rich cultivar for commercial development.
