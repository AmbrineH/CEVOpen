<p class="p">A bibliographic research was carried out independently by two researchers (blinded to the authors and initially on results) in the major scientific databases and search engines of peer-reviewed literature from 2000 to July 2018, on life sciences and biomedical topics (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar). The following keywords or combination of keywords “Citrus anxiety”, “
 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> axiety”, “
 <italic class="italic">Citrus sinensis anxiety”</italic>, and “clinical trials” were used. Analysis included only articles written in English and published on peer-reviewed scientific journals describing clinical trials and applications of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> or
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> EOs. Articles describing the effects of products containing
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> or
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> EOs in combination with other active substances including medicinal plants derivatives were also excluded. The selection and the review of clinical studies written in English regarding
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> or
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> EOs were performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Methodological quality was assessed using validated tools such as the Consort Statement in Reporting Clinical Trials with Herbal Medicine Intervention (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4" class="xref">Section 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and the Jadad Scale [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. From the eligible articles, two investigators independently extracted data by using a standard data extraction form. Data were considered for therapeutic indication, design of the study, number, sex, and age of subjects, endpoints, adverse effects, and outcome. In all the studies, reporting of adverse reactions was monitored. The absence of adverse reactions was defined as “not reported.” All the authors reviewed all the eligible articles and resolved by discussion any uncertainty regarding the statistical method used to handle the missing data.
