<p class="p">Khosrovi et al. investigated the effect of intraperitoneal injection of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium </italic>EO on anxiety and its interaction with GABAergic pathways, evaluating the coadministration effects of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> and diazepam. Results showed that
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> EO increased the open arms exploration (increase of percentage time spent) of male mice submitted to the elevated plus-maze. Although diazepam increased open arms exploration (percentage of time spent and percentage of entries), coadministration with
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> reduced the anxiolytic effect of diazepam. Flumazenil did not alter the effect of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic>; however, authors suggest that
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> L. may exert an anxiolytic-like effect acting as partial agonist at the GABA-A receptor/benzodiazepine site [

 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> are summarized in
