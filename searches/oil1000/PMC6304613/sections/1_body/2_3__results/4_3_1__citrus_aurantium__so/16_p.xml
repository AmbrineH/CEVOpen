<p class="p">Chaves Neto et al. (2017) studied the anxiolytic effects of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> EO in patients experiencing crack withdrawal. Based on the fact that individuals who experience crack withdrawal present a high anxiety trait, anxiety status was induced with the Simulated Public Speaking (SPS) method (subject is requested to deliver a speech in front of a video camera with its image being displayed on a TV screen). Anxiety levels were assessed by the Inventário de Ansiedade Traço-Estado (IDATE), the Brazilian version of STAI-S.
