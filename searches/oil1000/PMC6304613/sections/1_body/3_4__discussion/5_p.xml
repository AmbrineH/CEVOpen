<p class="p">A series of review articles regarding the safety and efficacy of bitter orange has been published [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. However, this is the first analysis of clinical studies using
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium</italic> or
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> for the treatment of anxiety. We analyzed all clinical studies according to the recommendations described in the checklist developed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] for the reporting of clinical trials using herbal medicinal products (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). The clinical trials included in this review have different levels of methodological accuracy. All of studies were randomized and controlled. Only one study regarding
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus aurantium </italic>use was carried out with a double-blind methodology (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Two of the studies regarding
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> use were carried out with a double-blind methodology, and only one was performed as a crossover study (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>).
