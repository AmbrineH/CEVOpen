<p class="p">The essential oils obtained from APRC were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s, and GC-MS solution software (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA). The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 552 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature was programmed for 50 °C initial temperature, then temperature was increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 7%

Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of n-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [
