 <italic class="italic">Curcuma aeruginosa</italic> essential oils showed three classes in hierarchical cluster analysis based on dissimilarity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00053-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>): (1) a camphor/germacrone rich cluster with large concentrations of isoborneol, curzerene, and germacrone B; (2) a curcumenol/Î²-pinene rich cluster; and (3) a curzerenone/1,8-cineole cluster. 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00053-t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref> summarizes the concentrations of cluster centroids of the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> rhizome oils. Although there are only five essential oil samples of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic>, which is too few to give a comprehensive chemotaxonomic representation of these species, this analysis does provide initial insights into the potential chemotypes.
