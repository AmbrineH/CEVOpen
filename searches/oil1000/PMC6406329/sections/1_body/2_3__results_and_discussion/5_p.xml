<p class="p">A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out based on the 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> essential oil compositions. For comparison, we included 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> rhizome oils that were reported in the literature in this analysis, including 23 steam- or hydrodistilled essential oils and two supercritical CO

 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> rhizome oils were all rich in 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, α-turmerone, and β-turmerone, the cluster analysis revealed four clearly defined clusters based on the relative concentrations of these major components (

 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> rhizome oils are summarized in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00053-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, illustrating the chemical differences in the four clusters. Cluster 2 was the largest, representing 21 samples dominated by the turmerones (particularly 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone). Cluster 1 represents samples with relatively large concentrations of components other than turmerones; therefore, lower concentrations of turmerones. The third cluster was also a large cluster, representing 15 samples dominated by the turmerones (predominantly α-turmerone). The fourth cluster had very large concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone.
