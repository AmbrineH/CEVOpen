<p class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, there are no apparent correlations based on extraction method (steam distillation, hydrodistillation, or supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction) or country or region of origin. Furthermore, the differences between the clusters are not that great, and therefore, the clusters do not likely represent distinct chemotypes but rather just reflect the chemical variation within each species. The data do provide a baseline for comparison of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> rhizome oils, however. These are important points when considering sources of either essential oils or rhizomes. There are still too few data to draw conclusions about the possible chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aromatica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic>; more data are required.
