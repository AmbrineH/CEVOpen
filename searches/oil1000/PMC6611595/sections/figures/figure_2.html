 <p> Total phenolic compound content expressed in mgGAE.g -1 (A); flavonoids expressed in mg mgQE.g -1 (B); and DPPH expressed as IC 50 –μg.mL -1 (C) of the extracts of different samples of Brazilian red propolis (mean ± standard error of mean). IC 50: Lower values of IC 50 indicate higher activity of radical elimination. A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and F1—Extracts obtained by conventional extraction; A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 and F2—Extracts obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction. IC 50: Lower values of IC 50 indicate higher activity of radical elimination. Statistical analysis: Values showing the same letter in the same analysis do not show significant differences (p&gt;0.05) based on the Tukey test at a 95% confidence level. </p>
