<p class="p">In general, a significant variation (p&gt;0.05) was observed for phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity among the extracts obtained for red propolis samples from different origins. The content of phenolic compounds ranged from 277.8±1.32 (D1) to 398.3±11.15 mgGAE.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (B1), the flavonoid content from 42.0±0.75 (E1) to 108.0±0.18 mgQ.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (A2), and the antioxidant activity from 102.94±5.94 (E1) to 47.42±4.28 (IC

Samples of the same specific type of propolis (red color) show variation in the content of antioxidant compounds when collected in different geographic regions. Thus, the results found in this study confirm the effect of the origin of the raw material on the composition of the extracts.
