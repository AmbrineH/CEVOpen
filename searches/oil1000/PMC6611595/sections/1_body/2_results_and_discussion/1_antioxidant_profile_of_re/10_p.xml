<p class="p">Ethanol extraction has been described as the most suitable medium for the extraction of biologically active phenolic components from propolis [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref099" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. In addition, the industrial extraction method commonly used to obtain biocompounds from propolis is conventional extraction (ethanolic or hydroethanolic extraction), where the sample can be submerged in a solvent for days, weeks, or months, which requires an enormous amount of time when extracting on an industrial scale (usually at room temperature) [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Thus, the findings of this study show that the use of ultrasound technology as a treatment during the extraction process is a viable alternative for obtaining antioxidant compounds from propolis in a short period of time when compared with the applied conventional extraction (ethanolic extraction for 7 days) that is usually employed by industry. Furthermore, the ultrasound-assisted method can be efficiently applied to reduce extraction time and energy consumption which is reflected in the lowering of the final cost.
