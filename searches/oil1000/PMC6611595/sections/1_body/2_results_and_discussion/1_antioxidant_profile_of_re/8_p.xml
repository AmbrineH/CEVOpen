<p class="p">In this study, sample A (from Alagoas) had the highest antioxidant activity, which was represented by the lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (extracts A1 and A2). These results indicate that the chemical nature of the phenolic compounds, and perhaps the presence of other compounds, contributes to the total antioxidant capacity of the extracts [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Similar results for antioxidant activity were identified by Alencar et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] (57.0±3.2%) when evaluating the ethanol extract of red propolis from Alagoas. Frozza et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] observed IC
