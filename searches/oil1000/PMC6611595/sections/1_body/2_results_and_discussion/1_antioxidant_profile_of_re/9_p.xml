 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] ultrasound-assisted extraction is the rapid extraction technique, which in comparison to conventional extraction, offers high reproducibility in a short time with simplified manipulation, reduced solvent consumption and lower energy. The achieved results have shown how ultrasound-assisted extraction resulted in shorter extraction time [
