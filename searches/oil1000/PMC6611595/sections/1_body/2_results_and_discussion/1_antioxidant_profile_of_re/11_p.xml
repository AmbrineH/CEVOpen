<p class="p">It is important to emphasize that there is little literature on the application of ultrasound technology for obtaining propolis extracts, despite the advantages already mentioned in different studies using other types of matrices [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], a higher (28% higher) amount of biocompounds was obtained in Italian propolis extracts when using ultrasound exposure combined with conventional solvent extraction. Therefore, the application of ultrasound technology may be useful to increase the extraction of antioxidant compounds in propolis samples when applied in conjunction with the conventional method (ethanolic extraction), or it may reduce extraction time, as shown in this study. Ultrasound-assisted extraction has been confirmed as one of the most economic and efficient extraction methods for recovery of valuable compounds, especially for extraction purposes [
