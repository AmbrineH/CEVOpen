<p class="p">The results of the quantitative analysis of formononetin and kaempferol in the extracts obtained by the two extraction methods from different Brazilian red propolis samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219063.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. The chemical structures of the biomarkers formononetin and kaempferol are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219063.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. The formononetin content ranged from 5.22±0.01 (D1) to 13.64±0.04 mg.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (B2), whereas the kaempferol content ranged from 0.43±0.01 (A2) to 3.72±0.05 mg.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (B1) among the extracts.
