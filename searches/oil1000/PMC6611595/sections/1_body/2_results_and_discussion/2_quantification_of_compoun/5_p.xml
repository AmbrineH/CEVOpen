 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] investigated red propolis samples of different origins to identify the main chemical markers by mass spectrometry. In that study, formononetin was present at significant concentrations in 10 of the 14 investigated samples and was considered as the main marker of this type of propolis.
