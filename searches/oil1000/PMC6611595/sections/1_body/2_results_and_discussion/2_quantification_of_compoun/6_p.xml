 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219063.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed for the levels of formononetin and kaempferol when comparing the two extraction methods applied for the same sample, and when comparing the extracts obtained by the same method for samples of different origins. Thus, this study also proves that the extraction method [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] influence the content of specific compounds in propolis extracts. The achieved results and statistical analysis have shown how ultrasound-assisted extraction resulted in shorter extraction time, and increased extraction capacity of biomarkers with high antioxidant activity from Brazilian red propolis.
