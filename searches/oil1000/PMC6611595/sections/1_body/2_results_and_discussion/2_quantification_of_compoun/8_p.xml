<p class="p">For the other investigated compound, kaempferol, it was not possible to determine which method was the most efficient, since there was a variation depending on the sample analyzed. For example, for samples A, B, and C, conventional extraction was superior, whereas for samples D and E, the application of ultrasound had a very significant effect on kaempferol extraction (p&gt;0.05). However, from the results found in this study, it can be stated that the application of ultrasound is efficient to obtain extracts with high content of antioxidant compounds, such as the formononetin and kaempferol, and as a faster extractive method, compared to conventional extraction.</p>
