As previously reported and evidenced in different studies, the chemical composition of propolis depends on its geographical location, and as such, its biological activity is closely related to the native vegetation of the collection site [

However, Brazilian red propolis presents a composition similar to that of the Cuban red propolis produced in the province of Pinar Del Rio, without benzophenones, but with several isoflavones, such as medicarpin, homopterocarpin, and formononetin [
