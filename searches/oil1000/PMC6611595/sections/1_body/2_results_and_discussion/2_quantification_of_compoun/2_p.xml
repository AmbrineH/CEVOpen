 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] demonstrated some biological activities of the hydroalcoholic extract of the red propolis due to the presence of formononetin, as it was antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory in experimental models. Formononetin has also been associated with the reduced action of IL-1β and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)
