 <xref rid="pone.0219063.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), only formononetin and kaempferol were found to be above the limits of detection and quantification in the extracts. Quercetin and hydrate rutin were present in the chromatograms obtained, however, below the limits of quantification or detection (

Similar results have also been demonstrated by Ruffato et al. [
