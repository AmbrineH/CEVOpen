<p class="p">Based on the results of the chromatographic analysis, red propolis extracts from northeastern Brazil obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction are important sources of formononetin and kaempferol, which are described in the literature as having a high biotechnological potential given their demonstrated pharmacological effects. Therefore, considering the antioxidant potential of the extracts, they can be considered as important candidates for use in new functional foods or new drugs.</p>
