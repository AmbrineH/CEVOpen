<p class="p">For the HCT-116 cell line (colon carcinoma) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219063.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>), regardless of the geographical origin of the sample or the extraction conditions employed, all extracts had a percent inhibition greater than 90%. In general, few significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed for the percent inhibition for the HL-60 (leukemia) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219063.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C</xref>) when evaluating the different extracts (two extraction methods and six samples from different sources). For these lines, all of the extracts had a percent inhibition above 80% (except for extract D2, which showed no inhibition against HL-60). In general, for these three tumor lines, the extraction method used did not influence the cytotoxic response (
