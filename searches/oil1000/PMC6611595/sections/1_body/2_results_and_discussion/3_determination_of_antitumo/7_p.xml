 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] also investigated cytotoxic activity against different cell lines (including HCT-116 and SF295) for red propolis extracts from northeastern Brazil and identified the cell proliferation inhibition potential of the extracts. Banzato et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>] also found cytotoxic activity of the crude extract and fractions of Brazilian red propolis against seven tumor cell lines that included PC3 (prostate), OVCAR-3 (ovary), K-562 (leukemia), and U251 (glioma). Brazilian red propolis induced cell death and decreased the migration potential of bladder cancer cells, suggesting a potential source for the development of new drugs and/or herbal medicines for the treatment of this type of cancer [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref149" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. Thus, red propolis extracts present high levels of cytotoxicity against different tumor cell lines, as was previously demonstrated in other studies [
