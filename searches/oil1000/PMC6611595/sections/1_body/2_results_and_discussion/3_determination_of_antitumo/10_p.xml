<p class="p">For example, the cytotoxic activity of eleven different flavonoids isolated from propolis against colon cancer (HCT-116) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines were investigated by Vukovic et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>], the cytotoxic activity of 42 compounds isolated from red propolis against six different tumor cell lines was investigated. Although formononetin showed good results, the authors found that the compounds (2S)-7-hydroxy-6-methoxyflavanone and (3S)-mucronulatol presented the best antiproliferative effects against the studied lines (26-L5, B16-BL6, LLC, A549, HeLa, HT-1080), suggesting that these flavonoids could be good candidates for the development of anticancer drugs.
