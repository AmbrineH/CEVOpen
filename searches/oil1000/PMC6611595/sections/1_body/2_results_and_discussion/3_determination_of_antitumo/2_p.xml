 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>] comparatively evaluated propolis extracts of different types and geographical origins and found a higher antiproliferative activity for the extracts obtained from the red propolis samples, evidencing the high biological potential of this matrix due mainly to its differentiated composition. Machado et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>] evaluated the chemical composition and biological activity of yellow, green, brown, and red Brazilian propolis and found the highest selectivity against all tumor cells was shown by red propolis especially against HL60.
