<p class="p">Awale et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] found similar cytotoxic effects when comparing Brazilian red propolis extracts and antitumor drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin, in six tumor cell lines (including HCT-116), thus evidencing the biological potential of this natural matrix. Frozza et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] also showed the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antiproliferative effect of Brazilian red propolis against human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Hep-2), human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), and normal human embryonic kidney cells (Hek-293).
