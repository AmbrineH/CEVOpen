<p class="p">However, significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in percent inhibition were observed between the extracts against SNB19 (glioblastoma) (

Overall, a lower percent inhibition was obtained against this line, with only four of the twelve evaluated extracts showing a percent inhibition greater than 80%. In addition, it was found that the geographical origin of the sample significantly influenced (p&gt;0.05) the inhibition potential of the SNB19 line (

The extracts obtained from samples A (Alagoas) and F (Sergipe) showed the best results for the antiproliferative activity against SNB19, and these extracts were the only ones that were able to inhibit more than 80% of cell growth for all cancer cell lines investigated in this study. However, comparing the extracts from the same sample (collection source) obtained by the two different methods, in general, no influence of the method on the cytotoxic response was also observed for the SNB19 cell line, as shown in
