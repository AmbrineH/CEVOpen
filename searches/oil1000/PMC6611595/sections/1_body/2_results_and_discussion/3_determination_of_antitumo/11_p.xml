<p class="p">Based on the results found in this study and the findings in the literature, ethanol extracts of red propolis from northeastern Brazil (treated or not with ultrasound) present high antiproliferative capacities against different tumor cell lines. However, the application of ultrasound was efficient for obtaining red propolis extracts in a shorter time when compared to the conventional method and resulted in extracts with important cytotoxic effects

Because of this, we suggested that assisted-ultrasound extraction may be considered as a more efficient technology for the extraction of red propolis from northeastern Brazil. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the safety of using red propolis extracts
