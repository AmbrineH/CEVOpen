<p class="p">The chemical composition of propolis, and consequently its biological activity, varies according to its geographical origin, botanical source, race of bees, sampling season and climate conditions of the region [

However, few available studies have compared red propolis samples collected in different regions of Brazil regarding their antioxidant composition and cytotoxic activity against different tumor cell lines. Studies evaluating the biological activities of red propolis performed by Machado et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] found differences in antimicrobial and antitumor capacity, antioxidant and antiparasitic capacity, and hypertension and renal damage attenuation capacity, respectively, for samples obtained from different sources. Regueira-Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] investigated the effect of seasonality on the antibacterial activity and chemical composition of a Brazilian red propolis sample and found an important variation in the concentrations of the investigated compounds and, consequently, in the antibacterial activity of the extracts according to the sampling period (dry vs. rainy season).
