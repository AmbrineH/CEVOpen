<p class="p">Several methods are used worldwide to extract the propolis components, and extraction using ethanol as a solvent is the most commonly used method [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Ethanolic extracts have been more commonly used due to of their content in phenolic acids and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Different studies describe different chemical compositions and biological activities for propolis extracts depending on the extraction method employed, demonstrating that the extraction conditions, as well as the extraction solvent used, directly influence the yield and selectivity of some compounds [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and, consequently, the biotechnological potential of the extracts obtained. Thus, although ethanol extraction is the method most commonly used by the industry to obtain different types of propolis extracts, this method has the disadvantages of low selectivity and low yield in the extraction of some compounds of interest in addition to long extraction periods [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], thus increasing the extraction costs. Therefore, other methods have been used to increase the efficiency of the extraction of the bioactive components of propolis, such as ultrasound and microwave-assisted extraction and supercritical fluid extraction [
