<p class="p">In this study, the levels of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity against different tumor cell lines were determined for red propolis extracts from different geographical origins and obtained by two extraction methods. The results showed an effect of the origin and of the extraction method in the chemical profile and biological activity of these extracts. We suggested that propolis extracts showed a high in vitro antioxidant activity. The application of ultrasound technology to obtain extracts rich in active compounds proved to be efficient, mainly due to the shorter time needed to obtain the extracts, thus enabling production on an industrial scale.</p>
