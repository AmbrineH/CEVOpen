<p class="p">The content of total phenolic compounds in the red propolis extracts obtained by the two extraction methods was determined using the methodology of Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] and Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], which are based on the reaction with the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. First, the reaction was prepared with a 0.5-mL aliquot of each propolis extract dissolved in 95% ethanol to a final concentration of 500 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 10% aqueous Folin-Ciocalteu solution (2.5 mL) and 7.5% sodium carbonate (2.0 mL). The vials containing the obtained mixture were heated in a temperature-controlled bath at 50°C for 5 minutes (Marconi, M127, Brazil), after which the absorbance was read in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA 25 UV/Vis Systems, WA, USA) at 765 nm using a quartz cuvette with a 10 mm optical path and a 3.5 mL volume. The amount of total phenolic compounds was expressed as Gallic acid equivalents per gram of sample (mgGAE.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) by calculating a calibration curve (y = 0.0096x–0.0311, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9994) using Gallic acid standard solutions (12 to 200 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) under the same conditions.
