The different samples were donated by the companies Apis Jordans (Vitória da Conquista—Bahia—Brazil), Apis Nativa Produtos Naturais (Prodapys—Santa Catarina—Brazil) and Bee Product Natural (Alagoas—Brazil). The samples were ground in an electric mill (Cadence—Brazil) and sieved through a 52–92 μm aluminum sieve for uniformity of particle size and to increase the surface area. The samples were stored in an ultra-freezer at -20°C and were protected from light in an inert atmosphere (N
