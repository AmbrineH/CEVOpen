<p class="p">For the ultrasound-assisted extraction, the methodology of Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] was used with modifications. Thus, 2 g of each propolis sample was homogenized with 25 mL of ethanol:water (80:20 v/v) in an Erlenmeyer flask and placed in an ultrasonic bath (RMS, Quimis, Brazil) with a power of 200  W, frequency of 60  kHz, and a temperature of 50°C for 50 minutes. Conventional extraction was carried out in a similar way to the industrial process used for propolis extracts in Brazil. The same amount of each red propolis sample (2 g) was infused with ethanol:water (80:20 v/v) and allowed to stand for seven days with periodic shaking (25°C). During the extraction process (conventional or ultrasound-assisted) all samples were kept protected from light.
