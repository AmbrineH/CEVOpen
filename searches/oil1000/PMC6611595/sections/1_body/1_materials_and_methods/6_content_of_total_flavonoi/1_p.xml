<p class="p">The content of total flavonoid compounds was determined using the method proposed by Meda et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] with adaptations. First, 2.0 mL of each extract (0.5 mg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was added into test tubes along with 2.0 mL of a 2% methanol solution of aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>). The samples were then homogenized on a vortex shaker (IKA Lab Dancer, Germany) and placed in the dark for 30 minutes, after which the absorbance was read in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA 25 UV/Vis System) at the wavelength of 415 nm. A quercetin standard curve (5 to 105 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was obtained under the same conditions (y = 0.0271x–0.014, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9994), and the amount of total flavonoids in the extracts was expressed as quercetin equivalents per gram of sample (mgQE.g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>).
