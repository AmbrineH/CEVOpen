The statistical analysis of the results was performed using the Statistica 6.0 software from StatSoft (Tulsa, USA). A one-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (95% confidence level) were used to identify the differences between the concentrations of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, concentration of compounds by HPLC, and antioxidant and cytotoxic activity in the extracts obtained through the two extraction methods and for the different propolis samples. In all statistical procedures, the level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p>
