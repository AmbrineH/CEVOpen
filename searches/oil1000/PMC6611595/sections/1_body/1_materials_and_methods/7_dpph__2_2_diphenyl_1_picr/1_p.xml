<p class="p">To determine antioxidant capacity, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine reactive (DPPH) method was used according to the methodologies proposed by Brand-Williams et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] with adaptations. First, six dilutions of each extract were prepared at concentrations of 10 to 85 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (in triplicate). Next, a 1-mL aliquot of each dilution was transferred to test tubes containing 3.0 mL of ethanol solution (99%) of the DPPH● radical (0.004%). The DPPH free radical reduction was determined by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 517 nm (calibration curve y = 0.897x–4.5, R2 = 0.9955) with a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA 25 UV/Vis System) after 30 minutes of incubation in the dark at 25°C.
