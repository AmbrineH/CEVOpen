<p class="p">The human tumor cell lines HL-60 (leukemia), PC3 (prostate carcinoma), SNB19 (glioblastoma), and HCT-116 (colon carcinoma) were kindly provided by the National Cancer Institute (USA) and used for the analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of the different Brazilian red propolis extracts. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution and were incubated in an incubator (Thermo Scientific, 3425, Massachusetts, USA) at 37Â°C with 5% CO
