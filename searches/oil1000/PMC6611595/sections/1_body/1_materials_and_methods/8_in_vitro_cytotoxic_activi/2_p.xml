<p class="p">The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl) -2,5-diphenyl -2H- tetrazolium bromide] (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA) assay was used for determining the cytotoxic (antitumor) potential of the extracts against the cell lines [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The samples were distributed in 96-well plates (100 μL.well
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) at a final concentration of 0.1x10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. After 24 hours, the extracts were dissolved in 0.001% DMSO and added to the wells to a final concentration of 50 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The experiment was performed three independent times (in triplicate), with 0.25 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> doxorubicin and 0.001% DMSO as positive and negative controls, respectively (incubation for 72 hours in an incubator with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, at 37°C). At the end of the incubation, the plates were centrifuged (15 g/15 min) at 4°C and the supernatants were discarded. Subsequently, 150 μL of the MTT solution (0.5 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was added, and the plates were incubated for 3 hours. After this period, the plates were centrifuged again (3 g.min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) at 4°C, the supernatants were discarded, and the precipitates were resuspended in 150 μL of sterile pure DMSO. For the quantification of formazan produced by viable cells, the absorbance was read using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter, Packard, ON, Canada) at a wavelength of 595 nm. All values were expressed as the 100% inhibitory concentration (IC100).
