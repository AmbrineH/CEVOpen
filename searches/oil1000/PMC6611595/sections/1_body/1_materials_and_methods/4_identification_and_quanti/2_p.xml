<p class="p">Gradient elution, with a mobile phase of 5% acetic acid and methanol at different ratios and with a total analysis time of 42 minutes (from 0 to 35 minutes (0–92% B), 35 to 40 minutes (92–0% B), and 40 to 42 minutes (0% B)) was used as the analysis condition. The injection volume was 20 μL, and the flow rate was 1 mL.min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The machine was operated at a temperature of 25±2°C. The detection wavelengths were set at 300 and 320 nm, and the DAD was operated within a wavelength range of 190 to 800 nm. For the identification of the compounds, comparisons of retention time and ultraviolet spectrum were performed between samples and standards. This analysis was performed according to the parameters of limits of detection, and limits of quantification [
