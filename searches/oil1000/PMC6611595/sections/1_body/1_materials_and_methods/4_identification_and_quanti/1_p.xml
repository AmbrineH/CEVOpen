<p class="p">The quantification and identification of ten phenolic compounds (caffeic acid, gallic acid, formononetin, kaempferol, trans-ferulic acid, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, and rutin hydrate) in the red propolis extracts was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Initially, solutions of 10 mg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were prepared and dissolved in methanol and then placed in an ultrasonic bath (TECNAL, São Paulo, Brazil) for 30 minutes. Methanol solutions of the red propolis extracts were prepared at 1 mg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> with the two methods adopted in this study. The samples were filtered with a 0.45 μm cellulose membrane filter (Millipore) for subsequent injection into an HPLC system (Shimadzu, LC-20AT, Japan) equipped with an automatic injector and diode array detector (DAD) (Shimadzu, SPD-M20, Japan). The chromatographic separation was performed according to the methodology proposed by Castro et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219063.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. A NUCLEODUR 100–5 C18 EC column (150 x 4 mm ID, 5-μm particle size) was used in conjunction with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 4.6 x 12.5 mm precolumn (Agilent, USA).
