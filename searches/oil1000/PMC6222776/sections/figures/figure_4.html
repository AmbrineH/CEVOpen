 <p> Effect of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) silencing on LPS-induced ROS production and inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells. ( a, b) RAW264.7 cells were treated with NOX2-siRNA or control siRNA, and incubated for 24 h. ( a) NOX2 mRNA expression levels were measured using RT-PCR. ( b) NOX2 protein expression levels were measured using Western blotting. ( c) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with LPS 1 μg/mL for 30 min. NADPH oxidases levels were measured using commercially ELISA kits. ( d) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of the DCF-stained cells was quantified using a multidetection reader. ( e– g) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 1 h, and the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA expression levels were measured using RT-PCR. ( h) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h or diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) (10 μM) for 1 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 30 min. NADPH oxidases levels were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. Values represent means ± SEM, n = 3. # p &lt; 0.05 and ## p &lt; 0.01 compared to the control group, while * p &lt; 0.05 and ** p &lt; 0.01 compared to the control-siRNA group ( a– g) or the LPS-treated group ( h). </p>
