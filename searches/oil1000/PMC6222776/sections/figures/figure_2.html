 <p> OEO inhibits LPS-induced AKT, MAPKs, and NF-κB activation in the RAW264.7 cells. ( a) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 1 h. MAPKs and AKT were estimated by Western blot. ( b) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 1 h. Western blot results show the effects of OEO on the protein levels of NF-κB p65 in the nuclear fractions. ERK1/2—extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2; JNK—c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase; P38—p38; Akt—protein kinase B; NF-κB—nuclear factor kappa B; P—phosphorylated; T—total. Values represent means ± SEM, n = 3. # p &lt; 0.05 and ## p &lt; 0.01 compared to the control group, while * p &lt; 0.05 and ** p &lt; 0.01 compared to the LPS-treated group. </p>
