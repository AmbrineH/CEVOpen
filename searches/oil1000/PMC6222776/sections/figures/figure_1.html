 <p> Oregano essential oil (OEO) inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7 cells). ( a– c) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 12 h. ( d– f) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 1 h. The interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression levels were measured using an RT-PCR analysis. Values represent means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), n = 3. # p &lt; 0.05 and ## p &lt; 0.01 compared to the control group, while * p &lt; 0.05 and ** p &lt; 0.01 compared to the LPS-treated group. </p>
