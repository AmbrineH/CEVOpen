  <p class="p">OEO inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS. The fluorescence intensity of the dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-stained cells was quantified using a flow cytometer. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were indicated by DCF fluorescence and detected by fluorescence microscopy. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of DCF-stained cells was quantified using a multidetection reader. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Cells were pretreated with OEO (2.5–10 μg/mL) for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The levels of ROS in the culture supernatant were measured by chemiluminescence. (

   <bold class="bold">g</bold>) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 12 h. The intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), the glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH: oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ration were measured. Values represent means ± SEM,
