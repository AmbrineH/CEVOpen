  <p class="p">Effect of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) silencing on LPS-induced ROS production and inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,

   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) 
   <italic class="italic">NOX2</italic> mRNA expression levels were measured using RT-PCR. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) NOX2 protein expression levels were measured using Western blotting. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with LPS 1 μg/mL for 30 min. NADPH oxidases levels were measured using commercially ELISA kits. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of the DCF-stained cells was quantified using a multidetection reader. (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">g</bold>) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRNA against NOX2 or control siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 1 h, and the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA expression levels were measured using RT-PCR. (
   <bold class="bold">h</bold>) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h or diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) (10 μM) for 1 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 30 min. NADPH oxidases levels were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. Values represent means ± SEM,
