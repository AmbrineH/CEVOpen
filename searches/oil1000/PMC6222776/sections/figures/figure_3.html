 <p> OEO inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. ( a) The RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS. The fluorescence intensity of the dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-stained cells was quantified using a flow cytometer. ( b) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were indicated by DCF fluorescence and detected by fluorescence microscopy. ( c) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of DCF-stained cells was quantified using a multidetection reader. ( d) Cells were pretreated with OEO (2.5–10 μg/mL) for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 30 min. The levels of ROS in the culture supernatant were measured by chemiluminescence. ( e– g) Cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h, then incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 12 h. The intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), the glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH: oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ration were measured. Values represent means ± SEM, n = 3. # p &lt; 0.05 and ## p &lt; 0.01 compared to the control group, while * p &lt; 0.05 and ** p &lt; 0.01 compared to the LPS-treated group. </p>
