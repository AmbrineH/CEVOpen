<p class="p">Oregano (

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Oregano essential oil (OEO) is a concentrate of natural plant products that contain volatile aromatic compounds, and the major constituents of OEO have been characterized. This volatile aromatic compound exhibits several biological actions, including anti-bacterial and anti-oxidative activities [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Carvacrol and thymol, the two main phenolic derivatives that constitute about 81.9 and 3.5% of OEO, are principally responsible for the activities [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In addition, other minor constituents such as γ-terpinene and ρ-cymene, two monoterpene hydrocarbons that constitute about 4.49 and 3.07% of OEO, respectively, also contribute to the activities [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that OEO prevents inflammation in vitro and in vivo [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, the regulatory mechanisms of OEO that reduce the inflammatory responses have not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the effect of OEO on the NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress and the inflammation of murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7 cells) in response to LPS. We also determined whether the anti-inflammatory effect of OEO is associated with the inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS generation.
