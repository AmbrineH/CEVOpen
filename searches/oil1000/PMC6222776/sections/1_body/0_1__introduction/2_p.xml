 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. ROS are intracellularly generated from several sources, including mitochondrial respiration, cytochrome P450, and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is the major source of ROS generation in the macrophage response to LPS [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, LPS may induce an inflammatory response through NADPH oxidase activation-driven oxidative stress. Likewise, the inhibition of the ROS production using inhibitors against NADPH oxidase is proposed as an alternative approach to conventional antioxidant therapies against LPS-induced inflammation.
