<p class="p">In summary, the results of this study showed that the LPS induced RAW264.7 cell inflammatory response through regulating NADPH oxidase activation-driven oxidative stress. OEO effectively inhibited the expression of the LPS-induced inflammatory mediators in the RAW264.7 cells through the activation of NF-ÎºB and the phosphorylation of AKT and MAPKs via scavenging intracellular ROS. The OEO supplementation can effectively antagonize the NADPH oxidase activation, thereby abolishing the oxidative stress in the LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Our study indicates that dietary supplementation with OEO blocks LPS-induced RAW264.7 cell inflammation through decreasing the cellular levels of ROS, directly and indirectly.</p>
