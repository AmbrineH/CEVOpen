<p class="p">Importantly, the OEO concentrations (2.5–10 μg/mL) used in the present study were non-cytotoxic and extremely low. OEO at similarly low concentrations demonstrates favorable pharmacological properties. For instance, the treatment of oxidized low density lipoprotein-activated THP-1 macrophages with OEO (10–30 μg/mL) results in an overall reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine release [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Similarly, the anti-inflammation effects of the OEO components thymol and carvacrol (3–6 μg/mL) have been demonstrated in high glucose-induced RAW264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. To elucidate the mechanisms by which these anti-inflammation effects are exerted, we initially assessed the effects of OEO on the pro-inflammatory secretion in the RAW264.7 cells. In the present study, the most sensitive indicators of the effectiveness of the OEO treatment were shown to be the inhibited expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, LPS is a potent activator for various downstream signal transductions, including MAPK, Akt, and NF-κB [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The activation of these typical pathways is associated with an increased expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Consistent with the inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the RAW264.7 cells treated with OEO showed a greater inhibition of the inflammation signaling pathway, including the MAPKs (e.g., p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK), Akt, and NF-κB signaling pathways.
