<p class="p">ROS plays an important role in LPS-induced macrophage inflammation [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. ROS induces inflammation by stimulating MAPKs, Akt, and NF-κB [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The model used in the present study increases the generation of free radicals and other ROS in the RAW264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The LPS treatment of the RAW264.7 cells dramatically increased the ROS production. Any imbalance between the production of these molecules and their safe disposal may culminate in oxidative stress. An in vitro study reported that OEO exerts an excellent anti-oxidative captivity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and scavenging 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In the present study, OEO decreased ROS production in the RAW264.7 cells. MDA and GSH/GSSG are considered excellent indicators of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. OEO was beneficial in decreasing the MDA levels and increasing the GSH: GSSG ratio in the RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS.
