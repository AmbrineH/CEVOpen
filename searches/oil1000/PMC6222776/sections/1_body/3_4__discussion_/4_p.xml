 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In conjunction with our Nox2 protein silencing data, the NOX2-siRNA knockdown of the Nox2 protein inhibited not only the LPS-induced generation of ROS, but also its protective effect against oxidative stress-induced inflammation in the RAW264.7 cells. These results supported the role of Nox2-induced ROS production in LPS-mediated pro-inflammation expression. Therefore, the inhibition of ROS production using inhibitors against the NADPH oxidase is proposed as an alternative approach to conventional antioxidant therapies against inflammation. We examined the effect of OEO on the activation of NADPH oxidase in the RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS. The results showed that the OEO inhibited the ROS production in the RAW264.7 cells by reducing the NADPH oxidase activity. These data are consistent with previous observations that
