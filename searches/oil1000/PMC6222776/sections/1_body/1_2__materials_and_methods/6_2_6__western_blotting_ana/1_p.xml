<p class="p">The RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells per well in a 6-well plate) were collected and the total protein was extracted using a RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors or phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To determine the subcellular localization of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China). A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay was used to determine the protein concentrations, and 30 μg of protein was loaded per sample. Western blotting was performed, as described in our previous study [
