<p class="p">After the treatment period, the RAW264.7 cells (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> per well in a 96-well plate) were washed with PBS and then incubated with 10 μM DCFH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-DA (dissolved in PBS). After incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, DCFH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-DA was removed and RAW264.7 cells were washed in PBS. Intracellular ROS, as indicated by DCF fluorescence, was observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Minato ku, Japan). The fluorescence intensity was quantified using a multidetection reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) at the excitation 480 nm and emission 520 nm. The RAW264.7 cells supernatant of the ROS level was measured by chemiluminescence assay using luminol, as described in our previous study [
