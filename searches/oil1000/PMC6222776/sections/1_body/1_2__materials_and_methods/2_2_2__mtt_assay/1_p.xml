<p class="p">The RAW264.7 cells (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> per well in a 96-well plate) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then added to 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT (dissolved in PBS). After being incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, the MTT solution was carefully removed and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 μL of DMSO. Th absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (Biomate 5, Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) at the wavelength of 490 nm. The effect of OEO and LPS on the cell viability was assessed as the percentage of viable cells compared with the vehicle-treated control cells (received cell-grade DMSO at a safe concentration), which were arbitrarily assigned a viability of 100%.
