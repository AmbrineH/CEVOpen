<p class="p">The NOX2-siRNA primer was as follows: 5′-GAGUUUGGAAGAGCAUAAUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUUAUGCUCUUCCAAACUCTT-3′ (anti-sense). The siRNA targeting the mouse NOX mRNA was obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China). The RAW264.7 cells were grown in 6-well plates (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well). After beng cultured for 24 h, the cells were then subjected to transient transfection with either a 100 nM NOX2-siRNA or a scrambled duplex, using the siRNA transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 6 h incubation, the medium was replaced with a regular medium and the cells were cultured for another 24 h before treatment.
