<p class="p">The total RNA from the RAW264.7 cells (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells per well in a 24-well plate) was isolated using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and integrity of the RNA were measured at a 260/280 nm ratio. For the cDNA synthesis, 2.5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Prime Script RT reagent kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR primers were designed using Primer 5.0 software, and the primer sequences have been shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01857-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The β-actin gene was used as invariant housekeeping gene internal control. Real-time PCR was performed, as described in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Briefly, the reactions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 30 s for one cycle; then 95 °C for 5 s, 59 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 40 cycles. The relative gene expression was quantified by the comparative 2
