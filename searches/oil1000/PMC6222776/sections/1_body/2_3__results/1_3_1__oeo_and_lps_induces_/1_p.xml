<p class="p">The cytotoxic effects of OEO and LPS on RAW264.7 cells were evaluated using MTT and LDH release assays. Low doses of OEO (1.25–20 μg/mL) did not cause any cytotoxicity, whereas doses of 80–160 μg/mL for 24 h significantly reduced the cell viability and increased the LDH release compared with the untreated control cells (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01857" class="xref">Figure S2c,d</xref>. The cells treated with LPS (100 μg/mL) showed significantly reduced viability and increased LDH release compared with the untreated control cells. To minimize the cytotoxic effect, treatment with 1 μg/mL LPS was selected for the subsequent experiments.
