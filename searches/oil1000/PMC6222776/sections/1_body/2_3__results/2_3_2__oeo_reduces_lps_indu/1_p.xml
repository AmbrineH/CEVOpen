Furthermore, we examined the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α through an RT-PCR analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01857-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>d–f). The treatment of RAW264.7 cells with LPS for 1 h dramatically induced the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Meanwhile, pretreatment with OEO (2.5–10 μg/mL) inhibited the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS.
