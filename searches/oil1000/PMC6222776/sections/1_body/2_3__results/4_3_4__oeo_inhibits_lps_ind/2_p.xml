<p class="p">The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to investigate the effect of OEO on cell lipid peroxidation in cultured RAW264.7 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01857-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>e, the MDA levels in the RAW264.7 cells markedly increased in response to 24 h of LPS treatment, whereas pretreatment with OEO for 12 h significantly inhibited the lipid peroxidation. The exposure of RAW264.7 cells to LPS for 24 h decreased the GSH concentration and GSH: GSSG ratio in the cells. A pretreatment with OEO to the culture medium increased the GSH concentration and GSH: GSSG ratio in the cells (
