<p class="p">The RAW264.7 cells were exposed to LPS for different time intervals (0.25–12 h). The increase in ROS generation started as early as 15 min, and the relative fluorescence peaked at 30 min, and subsequently maintained high levels at 6 and 12 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01857-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). Intracellular ROS, as indicated by the DCF fluorescence, was observed with a fluorescence microscope. The RAW264.7 cells exposed to LPS for 30 min showed a significant increase in fluorescence (
