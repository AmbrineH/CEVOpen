<p class="p">NADPH oxidase is an enzymatic source for ROS production under various pathologic conditions. Nox2 is the catalytic subunit. DPI is a widely used inhibitor of NADPH oxidase [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The NOX2 protein was downregulated by treatment with NOX2-siRNA, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01857-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,b. The treatment with NOX2-siRNA approximately reduced the mRNA and protein expression of NOX2 by 49% and 51%, respectively. The treatment with NOX2-siRNA suppressed the LPS-induced increase in the NADPH oxidase activity (
