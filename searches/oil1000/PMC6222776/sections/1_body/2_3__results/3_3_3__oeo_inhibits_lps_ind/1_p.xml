<p class="p">The production of inflammatory mediators is strongly affected by the AKT, MAPKs, and NF-κB pathways in the RAW264.7 cells. P65 is the major component of the NF-κB activated by LPS in the RAW264.7 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01857-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with OEO for 12 h and stimulated with LPS for 1 h. The OEO suppressed the LPS-induced phosphorylation of AKT and MAPKs (
