<p class="p">The iodine value was measured as described previously (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kyriakidis and Katsiloulis, 2000</xref>). The samples (0.2–0.4 g) were dissolved in 20 mL of chloroform and 25 mL of iodine monochloride solution in a flask. The mixture was kept for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, then 20 mL of 1 N KI solution and 100 mL of distilled water was added. Then, the mixture was titrated against 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution with 1% starch solution as an indicator. IV was calculated with the following equation:
