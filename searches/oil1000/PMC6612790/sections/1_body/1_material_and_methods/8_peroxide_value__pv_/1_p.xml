<p class="p">The PV of the samples was determined by the 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AOAC (2007)</xref> method. The samples were dissolved with 10 mL of chloroform and 15 mL of glacial acetic acid in a flask. Then, 1 mL of saturated solution of KI was added to the flask and kept for 10 min in the dark. Samples added with 30 mL of distilled water were thoroughly mixed and the mixture was titrated against 0.01 N sodium thiosulphate solution with 1% starch solution as an indicator. The PV was calculated as follows:
