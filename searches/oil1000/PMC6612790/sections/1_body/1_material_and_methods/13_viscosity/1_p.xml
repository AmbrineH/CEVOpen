<p class="p">The viscosity of the samples was analyzed using a DV-E viscometer (Brookfield, Toronto, Canada) during the storage period. Thirty mL of sample was added to a conical tube and the analysis was conducted at a constant rotational speed of 50 rpm using the No. 62 spindle. The measurement was repeated five times for 30 s and the results were expressed as centipoise (cP) units.</p>
