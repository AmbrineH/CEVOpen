<p class="p">The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value was obtained following a procedure described previously (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Papastergiadis et al., 2012</xref>). A 1 g sample was weighed into a 50 mL conical tube and mixed with 5 mL distilled water for two minutes. The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 g for five minutes. The aqueous layer was collected, and the procedure was repeated twice. The collected sample (2.5 mL) and 2.5 mL of TBA reagent (46 mM in 99.5% glacial acetic acid) were mixed in a test tube and heated in a water bath at 95Â°C for 35 minutes. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The results were expressed as mg MDA/kg.
