<p class="p">The fatty acid composition was determined using the method reported previously by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muguerza et al. (2001)</xref>. Briefly, the fatty acid composition was determined using gas chromatography (5890, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with a capillary column SP-2560 (100 m×0.25 mm×0.2 μm). Chromatographic conditions were as follows: the temperature of both the injector and detector was 225°C, the oven temperature was programmed to increase from 100°C to 240°C at a rate of 1°C/min. Hydrogen was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The quantification of individual fatty acids was determined by using heptadecanoic acid methyl ester as an internal standard.
