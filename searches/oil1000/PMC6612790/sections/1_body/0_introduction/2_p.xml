<p class="p">Duck meat is a type of poultry meat with a unique flavor. It also contains high levels of essential amino acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (

In fact, these fatty acids have been known to prevent cardiovascular disease, including arteriosclerosis and cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation in blood vessels. It was estimated that the worldwide duck meat consumption is approximately 4.53 million metric tons (MMT) per annum, while poultry meat accounts for 121 MMT per annum (

Duck skin fat has the potential for use as a raw material in the production of healthy animal-derived fats (
