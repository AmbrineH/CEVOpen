<p class="p">Dietary fat is a major nutritional and biochemical component of the human body necessary for maintaining physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms and the composition of cell components and for providing a source of energy. As a dietary component, fat plays a major role in taste, flavor, and aroma in most foods. In contrast, excessive fat consumption has been associated with the occurrence of chronic human diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hariri and Thibault, 2010</xref>). Thus, efforts to reduce total fat consumption have continued for decades. However, according to recent reports from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the incidence of chronic diseases has remained high, despite reductions in fat intake (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Austin et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, recent studies have recommended that people should consider improving the quality of fat consumed, instead of reducing total fat intake, because the balance of health benefits to risks is determined by the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) consumed (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moro and Capel, 2019</xref>). Current recommendations limit SFA consumption to less than 10% of total calories due to the risk of cardiovascular disease (
