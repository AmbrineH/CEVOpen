<p class="p">Therefore, in the current study, the oxidative stability and quality characteristics of duck skin fat were evaluated in comparison with those of other animal fats (chicken, swine, and bovine skin fats). An identical fat extraction method (i.e., PHWE) was used for all animal skins. This study was also performed to provide information on the potential use of duck skin fats as a healthy edible animal fat in the food industry and for cooking.</p>
