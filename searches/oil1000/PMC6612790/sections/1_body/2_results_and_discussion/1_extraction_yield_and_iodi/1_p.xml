<p class="p">The extraction yields of animal skin-derived fats using PHWE are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The highest (p&lt;0.05) fat extraction (60.73%) was obtained from bovine skin, followed by duck skin (34.05%), swine skin (23.20%), and chicken skin (14.52%). Bovine skin products contained the highest amount of fats, whereas chicken skin contained the lowest amount of fats. The IV represents the degree of unsaturated fats and oils and also indicates the relative content of USFA (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The IV of the samples ranged from 55.71 to 79.57 g I
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/100 g. The IV of duck and chicken fats was 77.57 and 77.32 g I
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/100 g, respectively. Fats containing high IVs are chemically unstable because the double bonds in USFA are relatively reactive and vulnerable to oxidation (
