<p class="p">Changes in the viscosity of the animal skin fats during the 90-day storage period are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. Viscosities increased as the storage time increased in duck, chicken, and swine skin fats (p&lt;0.05). Duck skin fats showed the highest viscosity values, while bovine skin fats showed relatively lower values during the storage period. The formation of high molecular compounds by polymerization during the thermal oxidation process can change the rheological properties (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shin and Kim, 1982</xref>). This suggests that polymerized compounds were higher in duck skin fats. Specifically, the increase of viscosity has been explained by the conjugation and isomerization of double bonds in fatty acids and the formation of polymers during thermal oxidation (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ahn et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the viscosity of swine skin fat rapidly increased at 90 days. In fact, swine fat contains higher amounts of USFA, particularly linoleic acid (C18:2), than bovine fat. Thus, as shown for the CD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1E</xref>), the increased viscosity in swine skin fat may be due to the conjugation of double bonds, resulting in polymer formation.
