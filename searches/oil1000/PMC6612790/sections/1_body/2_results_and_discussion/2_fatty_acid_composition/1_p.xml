<p class="p">The fatty acid composition of fat is a critical indicator of nutritional value. The fatty acid composition is associated with oxidative stability and thus, high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to the rapid deterioration of fats (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Symoniuk et al., 2019</xref>). The fatty acid composition of the animal skin fats is summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The fatty acid compositions were significantly different based on the origin of the animal skin fat (p&lt;0.05). For most skin fats, oleic acid (C18:1) was the major USFA, followed by palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2), and stearic acid (C18:0). Only bovine skin fat showed more stearic acid (C18:0) than linoleic acid (C18:2). The fatty acid composition measured in the skin of animals were similar to previously reported data (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rekas et al., 2015</xref>). Particularly, oleic acid is an USFA that provides biologically beneficial effects in the human body. A previous report demonstrated that the consumption of canola oils enriched with high oleic acid decreased atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins compared to commercial canola oils (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bowen et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, high levels of oleic acid in duck skin fat may confer extra value as a food ingredient. In addition, a few reports support the association between oleic acid and flavor. For example, high oleic acid composition provided flavor stability and improved flavor of peanuts (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Talcott et al., 2005</xref>). The total SFA and USFA contents were significantly different between the groups (p&lt;0.05). Duck skin fat showed the highest total USFA content and the lowest total SFA content, while bovine skin fat exhibited the lowest total USFA and the highest SFA content. More importantly, the ratio of USFA/SFA of duck skin fat was approximately 2-fold higher than that of bovine skin fat (p&lt;0.05). The consumption of unsaturated fat has been linked to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">da Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Our fatty acid composition analysis demonstrated that duck skin fat contained higher levels of oleic acid and a high USFA/SFA ratio and these might be useful indicators for the increased use of duck skin fat in cooking and food industries.
