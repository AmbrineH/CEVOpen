<p class="p">The data showed a rapid increase in the PVs in duck, chicken, and swine skin fats up to 40 to 50 days of storage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). After that time, the PVs declined until the end of the storage period. However, in bovine skin fats, the PV increased more gradually and the value was similar to duck skin fats at 90 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). This suggests that peroxides were rapidly produced at the beginning of storage in warm conditions (60Â°C) because of the oxidation of fats. The peroxide product may be further broken down to secondary products, such as aldehydes and ketones (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Afonso et al., 2016</xref>). This chemical reaction explains the decline in PVs after 40 to 50 days of storage.
