<p class="p">CD is a measure of the oxidative stability of fats or oils where CD is a lipid hydroperoxide formed by triplet oxygen or singlet oxygen (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akhtar et al., 2018</xref>). When the oxidation of lipids progresses, the unconjugated double bonds are converted to conjugated structures that absorb ultraviolet radiations of 233 nm (
