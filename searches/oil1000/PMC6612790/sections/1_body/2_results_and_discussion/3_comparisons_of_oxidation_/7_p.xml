<p class="p">The totox value is known as the sum of 2PV and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV. The totox value provides the overall oxidative status of oils and fats (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Halim et al., 2016</xref>). Similar trends of totox values were observed in duck, chicken, and swine skin fats, whereas duck fats showed higher totox values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1F</xref>). Bovine skin fat showed significantly lower totox values compared to other animal skin fats (p&lt;0.05). In duck, chicken, and swine fats, the totox values continuously increased around 40 to 50 days, then decreased until the end of the storage period. This result has been attributed to the formation of secondary oxidation products which replaced the primary oxidation products (

In this regard, a study found that soybean oil containing high amounts of USFA had higher totox values than palm oil with a higher percentage of SFA, such as palmitic acid (
