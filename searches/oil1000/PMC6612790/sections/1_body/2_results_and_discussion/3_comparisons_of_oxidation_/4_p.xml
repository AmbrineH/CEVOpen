<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV showed a rapid increase up to 30 to 40 days of storage in duck, chicken, and swine skin fats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>). These 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AVs remained constant until the end of the storage period and there was no significant difference between the three groups at the end of storage (P &gt; 0.05). In contrast, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV in bovine skin fat gradually increased during 60 days of storage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AVs tended to depend on the USFA content (p&lt;0.05). High USFA contents have been shown to be the major factor influencing 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV in samples (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>). Our 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV data also demonstrated a relationship between the amount of USFA and the production of aldehydes and ketones during storage.
