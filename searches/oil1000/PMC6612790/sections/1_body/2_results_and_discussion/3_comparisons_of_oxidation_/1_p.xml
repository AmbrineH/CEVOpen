<p class="p">Quality characteristics of oil and fat are affected by multiple factors, including fatty acid composition, extraction methods, thermal treatment, and the presence of transition metals, pigments, and antioxidants (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Choe and Min, 2006</xref>). In particular, high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids may result in the rapid oxidation of fats (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Resende et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the oxidative stability of animal skin fats was evaluated during the 90-day storage period at 60°C (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>. The AV is generated by the hydrolysis and oxidation of triacylglycerol (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghobadi et al, 2018</xref>). The initial AVs (day 0) ranged from 0.64 to 1.81 mg/g fat and the levels were markedly increased and ranged from 3.43 to 6.21 mg/g after 90 days of storage at 60°C. The initial AVs were relatively lower in duck and chicken skin fats than in swine and bovine skin fats. During 90 days of storage, the AVs were increased in all animal skin fats. Specifically, the values were rapidly increased after day 60, probably due to increased hydrolysis and oxidation of triacylglycerol. Increases in AVs also occur in other foods, such as peanuts, during storage. AV levels were increased in raw peanuts stored at room temperature for 720 days (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). At the end of the storage period in this study, the AV levels were higher in duck and chicken skin fats than in swine and bovine skin fats. This may have been due to higher concentrations of USFA in the duck and chicken skin fats. USFAs are more susceptible to oxidation and hydrolysis than SFAs (
