<p class="p">Analyzing TBARS is a common technique for measuring lipid peroxidation, particularly the levels of malondialdehyde. In our data, the TBARS value was significantly higher at the beginning of the storage period (at 10 to 40 days) in duck skin fat (

These results imply that the higher lipid peroxidation in duck and chicken skin fats was due to higher levels of USFA which were more susceptible to oxidation. SFA is less vulnerable to lipid oxidation and that resulted in the lower TBARS value observed in bovine skin fats. Also, higher levels of PV (primary oxidation products) in duck, chicken, and swine fat might have caused the higher TBARS values. In fact, the unstable peroxides can be the result of the decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (
