<p class="p">This study evaluated four different animal skin fats (duck, chicken, swine, and bovine fats) extracted with an identical fat extraction method, PHWE. The oxidative stability and quality characteristics of the fats were evaluated under accelerated storage conditions (at 60Â°C, for 90 days). The data demonstrated that duck skin contained more USFA than other animal skin fats, indicating that duck fat is a healthier edible oil for human consumption. However, duck skin fat was more susceptible to oxidation than other animal skin fats in hot storage conditions. This was probably due to the higher level of USFA in duck skin fats. Supplementation of duck fat with antioxidants might be a reasonable way to prevent oxidation during long-term storage. Further studies on the effects of antioxidant supplementation in duck fat and specific health effects in the human body are needed.</p>
