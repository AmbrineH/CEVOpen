<p class="p">The percentage compositions (area %) of the identified volatile compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seeds are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00118-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In total, twenty-eight compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species to the library of GC-MS. The characteristic total ion chromatograms of different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The major peaks were numbered, and the names of these peaks are annotated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. All of these compounds and their percentage compositions are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00118-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The major volatile compounds in the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species are determined as 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexanal (present in seven samples), sabinene (present in three samples), α-pinene (present in 13 samples), α-thujone (present in four samples), borneol (present in 11 samples), linalyl acetate (present in 10 samples), β-pinene (present in 13 samples), camphene (present in 13 samples), α-thujene (present in four samples), 2,4(10)-thujadien (present in two samples), β-myrcene (present in seven samples), limonen (present in 12 samples), 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (present in 13 samples) and camphor (present in nine samples). The most abundant (%) volatile compounds among all were detected as α-pinene, camphene, β-pinene and eucalyptol. All of the detected volatile compounds are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00118-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Important studies were carried out for determination of the chemical composition of common sage essential oils. In particular, the bioactive properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species were evaluated in some of the studies [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In an important study, camphor, thujone, 1,8 cineole, borneol, -pinen and thujone were determined as the major constituents of sage essential oil [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Quite similar results to those found previously were obtained in our study as seen in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00118-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. A previous study determined the fingerprints of selected 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species by using the HS-GC/MS technique, and according to their findings, the major volatile compounds were α,β pinene, thujol and camphor β. Additionally, they found β-myrcene and β-phellandrene in some species and caryophyllene in 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Our results were quite compatible with the findings of Rzepa et al. (2009); in particular, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene was observed in both samples of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> species. In another study, 1,8-cineole, borneol, camphor and thujone were listed as the known constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Distinctive volatile profiles were observed between 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species in that they contained volatile compounds in different percentages. In our study, while the highest amounts of α-pinene were observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. microstegia,</italic> the lowest amounts were observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. nemorosa</italic>. The highest amount for β-pinene was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic>. The camphene compound was detected in all 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> samples, and the highest amounts were observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic>. Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) was detected in all 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> samples, and the highest amounts of eucalyptol were observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. triloba</italic> seeds. Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) may be considered to be one of the main components of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. α-humulene was observed in all 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species except for 
 <italic class="italic">S. microstegia</italic>. In total, twenty-eight compounds were identified by comparison to the mass spectra libraries NIST27 and WILEY7. Most of the determined compounds were in relatively small quantities (percentage). For instance, α-thujone, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-pinocarveol, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-sabinen hydrate, α-fenchyl acetate and bornyl acetate were determined to be in low amounts (%). In previous studies, β-phellandrene, thujenone, γ-terpinene and caryophyllene were reported to be rare among different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The results of our study were quite compatible with the literature. The headspace content of 
 <italic class="italic">S. nemorosa</italic> was the richest in volatile compounds. By interpretation of the GC-MS peak area, it is possible to argue that the volatile compound content (area %) of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species should be arranged in the following order: 
 <italic class="italic">S. nemorosa &gt; S. officinalis &gt; S. microstegia &gt; S. triloba &gt; S. sclarea ≥ S. virgate.</italic>
