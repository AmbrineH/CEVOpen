<p class="p">FTIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate methods such as HCA and PCA are used for arranging inspected elements into groups based on their similarities [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. HCA and PCA analyses were performed with the aim of revealing the hidden relationships (similarities and dissimilarities) between different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. The FTIR spectrum of a food or any material contains very specific and characteristic information about the sample. An IR spectrum reflects the global chemical composition of the sample and can be used in the identification, characterization and quantification of the samples [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. When we process the FTIR data using chemometrics, it becomes possible to observe hidden relationships between different samples. It is possible to build a hierarchical relationship between the samples by using HCA through algorithms. Additionally, PCA analysis was successfully performed to obtain three-dimensional (3D) score plots which presented the spectral diversity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species visually. Classification of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species was accomplished by utilizing the spectral diversity among samples through multivariate chemometric techniques. In this operation, the averaged FTIR spectra of all samples were used for chemometrics. A representative FTIR spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A. In the chemometric analysis, fat-related regions (3036–2986 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1782–1707 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 2980–2831 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in the FTIR spectra were used to obtain a classification of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. Additionally, selected regions are presented on overlapped spectra of all samples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B. Classification and discrimination of all samples were accomplished using the software OPUS version 7.2 (Bruker, Germany). The chemometrics of HCA and PCA analysis is used for the arrangement of spectral data into inherent groups based on their resemblances [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is an algorithmic approach that aims to construct a hierarchy of clusters. In HCA, clusters and sub-clusters are visualized in dendrogram graphs. Known as the minimum variance method, the Ward’s method joins at each stage of the cluster pair whose merger minimizes the increase in the total within-group error sum of squares, based on the normal to reprolevel spectral distance [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Normal to reprolevel algorithms separately calculate the spectral distances for each frequency range. The results of the HCA classification analysis of the evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A. As seen in the figure, two well-separated clusters were observed on the HCA dendrogram. While 
 <italic class="italic">S. microstegia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. virgata</italic> clustered on the left side of the dendrogram, 
 <italic class="italic">S. nemorosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. triloba</italic> scattered on the right side of the dendrogram. As seen on the dendrogram, a high heterogeneity value was obtained (40). As a result, the HCA dendrogram revealed that the species on the same side of the dendrogram had similar fat compositions, since classification was performed on the basis of fat-related spectral bands.
