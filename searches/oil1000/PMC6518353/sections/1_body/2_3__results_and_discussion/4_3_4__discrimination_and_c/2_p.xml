 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>B. PCA was employed to display the classification (distribution) of samples as two or three-dimensional graphs. The first derivatized and vector normalized (nine smoothing points) versions of all spectra were included in classification model and a factorization algorithm was employed for calculating the spectral distances in the PCA. As shown, differently shaped and colored symbols were assigned by the chemometric model for each different species on the basis of the spectral disparities. In other words, samples were not defined as distinct groups in the software; all of the samples were loaded, and classifications and assignments were performed by the software on the basis of the selected algorithms and parameters. The same classification pattern was observed in the PCA analysis. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>B, two well-separated clusters (red circles and green triangles) were observed on the PCA dendrogram. The results that were obtained showed that the two different chemometric techniques perfectly confirmed each other since the same discrimination and classification patterns were obtained in the multivariate techniques that were applied.
