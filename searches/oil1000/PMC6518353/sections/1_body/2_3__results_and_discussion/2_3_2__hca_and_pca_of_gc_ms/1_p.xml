<p class="p">Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for a total of thirteen samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species using the soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). The total ion chromatograms which contained the retention times and abundances of the volatile compounds from the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed samples were used for the cluster analysis. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seeds were distinguished in relation to their volatile compound compositions since the total ion chromatogram contained the fingerprint properties of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B, some 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species were clustered with shorter distances and closer to each other. In the PCA chemometric model, two principal components explained 95% of the variance in the evaluated data. As seen in the PCA plot, 
 <italic class="italic">S. nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> in particular were significantly differentiated. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">S. microstegia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. triloba</italic> were clustered close to each other with relatively lower distinction. A chemometric analysis was performed using all total ion chromatograms of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. According to the PCA plot, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> was significantly distinguished from the other species. In accordance with this, the GC-MS results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> had the lowest volatile compound content (area %) among all species. Principal component analysis is known as an effective tool to build interrelationships between different observations such as similarities and disparities [
