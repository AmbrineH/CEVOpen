<p class="p">Additionally, an HCA analysis was performed for evaluation of the volatile fingerprints of different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species and to evaluate the chromatographic differences of the volatile compound contents from the headspace. Chromatographic fingerprinting has been widely used and accepted by important commissions throughout the world [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. A chromatographic fingerprint of a herb has specific information that may present the chemical characteristics of the herb [

 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Wardâ€™s algorithm was employed in the SIMCA HCA analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is known as a chemometric tool that provides an opportunity to observe hidden relationships between different variables [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Clusters and sub-clusters are visualized precisely in dendrogram plots. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A, two well-separated groups were observed. In accordance with the PCA results, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> was significantly distinguished from the other 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. The first and second samples of the same species generally clustered close to each other. 
 <italic class="italic">S. triloba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> samples could not be discriminated from each other in the HCA analysis. One may conclude that HCA analysis provided a deeper insight into cluster analysis since it clearly illustrated the diversity or contiguity between clusters and each integral part in a dendrogram [
