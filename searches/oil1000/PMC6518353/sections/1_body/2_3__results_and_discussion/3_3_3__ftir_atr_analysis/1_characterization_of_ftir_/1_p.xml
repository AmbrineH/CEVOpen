<p class="p">Previous studies have reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seeds are rich in fats, proteins, dietary fibers, minerals and phenolic compounds. For instance, chia seeds have 42.1 g of carbohydrates, 30.7 g of fats and 16.5 g of proteins per 100 g [

 <xref rid="B10-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The FTIR-ATR technique may be effectively utilized for the determination of unique fingerprint characteristics of materials. Namely, it is possible to interpret the chemical composition of foods by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The FTIR-ATR spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> seeds is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00118-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A as an example. Significant bands were observed at 3293 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 3010 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 2924 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 2853 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1744 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1641 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1539 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1455 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1416 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1315 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1238 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1157 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1057 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 701 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. These spectral bands reflect the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> seeds. In general, the bands between 3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 3600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are mainly due to the OH stretching vibrations of water [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The band around 3010 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> could arise from the stretching vibrations of =C–H double bonds [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Two fat-related bands were observed at high intensity at 2924 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 2853 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> because of the methylene (–CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–) and methyl (–CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) groups, respectively [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Additionally, the carbonyl absorption of the triglyceride ester linkage was observed at 1744 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In general, the Amid I and Amid II bands result from protein-related structures. The bands observed at 1641 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1539 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> correspond to the Amid I and Amid II bands, respectively. The spectral region between 1500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1200 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> includes mixed vibrations arising from the bending modes of the &gt;CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and –CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups in proteins, fatty acids and phosphate-bearing compounds [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The bands from 1220 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 1011 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were due to the vibrations of the –C–O–C glycoside ring bond, C–O stretching in COOH and O–H bending which reveals the presence of carbohydrates and polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] Lastly, the spectral range between 900 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> corresponds to the true fingerprint region, and this region contains very specific spectral properties arising from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides [
