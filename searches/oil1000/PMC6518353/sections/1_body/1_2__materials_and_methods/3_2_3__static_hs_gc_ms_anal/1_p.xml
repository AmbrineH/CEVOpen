<p class="p">Samples were grinded using a spice grinder (Sinbo SCM 2934, Turkey). Then, 3 g of ground sample was transferred into 20 mL headspace vials. Sample loaded vials were heated and agitated for 15 min at 70 °C by the auto sampler system. Headspace autosampler parameters were adjusted to an incubation temperature of 70 °C, incubation time of 15 min; syringe temperature of 70 °C, agitation speed of 500 rpm; injection volume of 500 µL; fill speed of 200 µL/s, pull up delay of 500 ms; injection speed of 350 µL/s; pre-injection delay of 500 ms; and post injection delay of 1500 ms. As mentioned, 0.5 mL of headspace (HS) sample was introduced into the GC-MS system. HS/GC-MS analyses were performed by using a GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) combined with a CTC-Combi-PAL-autosampler (Bender and Hobein, Zurich, Switzerland). In the GC-MS analyses, A Restec (Bellefonte, USA) Rtx-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm (internal diameter) 0.25 μm) was used for chromatographic separation. The carrier gas used was helium. Volatile analyses of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seeds were performed with some modifications in the method of Rzepa et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Gradient analysis was performed using the following temperature program: 40 °C (3 min); 40–176 °C (8 °C/min); and 176 °C (20 min). The temperature of the injector was kept constant at 150 °C. The pressure value and linear velocity were 95.8 kPa and 47.1 cm/s, respectively. The carrier gas flow rate was 1.71 mL/min. The GC–MS interface temperature and ion source temperature were 280 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected ion-monitoring mode with an electron impact ionization voltage of 70 eV and data were collected over a range of m/z 35–550. Analyses were performed in duplicate for each sample. The major volatile compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species were identified by using a library of GC-MS. Identification is provided by comparison of the mass spectra of the detected volatile compounds with the commercial mass spectra libraries (NIST27 and WILEY7). Quantification was performed on the basis of relative area of the total ion chromatogram (TIC) peaks of volatile compounds. Obtained data were used with the aim of identification of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species.
