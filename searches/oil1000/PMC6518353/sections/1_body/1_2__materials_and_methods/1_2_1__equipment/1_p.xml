<p class="p">GC-MS analyses were performed by using a GCMS-QP2010 gas chromatography mass spectrometer system (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). Commercial libraries were used for identification of detected compounds. Instrument control and data collection were provided using the GCMS Solution software (GCMS Real Time Analysis and GCMS Postrun Analysis). FTIR analyses were performed by using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) with a KBr beam splitter and a deuterated l-alanine doped triglycene sulphate (DLaTGS

Instrument control and data acquisition were accomplished by using OPUS version 7.2 for Windows from Bruker Gmbh (Ettlingen, Germany). The retention indices were determined by analyzing an
