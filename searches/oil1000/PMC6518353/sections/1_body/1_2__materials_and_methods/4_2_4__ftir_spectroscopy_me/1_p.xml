 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed samples were directly placed upon the diamond ATR crystal and pressed by the ATR accessory. Attenuated total reflectance spectra of all 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species were scanned with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> and 16 scans were accumulated per spectra. All spectra were obtained in triplicate and the average spectrum of three measurements was calculated for each species. An air background spectrum was obtained prior to each ATR measurement. Spectral acquisitions were gathered by compressing the sample by using the ATR accessory. Ethyl alcohol and warm water were used in the cleaning of ATR cell.
