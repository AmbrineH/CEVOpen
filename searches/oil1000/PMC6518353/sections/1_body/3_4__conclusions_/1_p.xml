<p class="p">Our study investigated the fingerprint properties of the most popular 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species which are grown in Cumra/Konya (Turkey) by using GC-MS and FTIR techniques. Characteristic volatile compound compositions of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species were obtained. Additionally, the characteristic FTIR spectra of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species were gained. HCA and PCA of chemometrics were performed using the GC-MS and FTIR data to reveal the hidden relationships between the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. In this study, for the first time, chemometrics was successfully applied to the GC-MS and FTIR data for classification of the samples in relation to their similarities and differences. In processing the FTIR data, fat-related spectral regions (3036–2986 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1782–1707 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 2980–2831 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were used to generate the dendrogram through Euclidian distance and Ward’s algorithm. In processing the GC-MS data, all total ion chromatograms were used for chemometrics. As a result, the volatile compound compositions of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species were determined with success. Additionally, classification and discrimination of all samples was accomplished by using multivariate techniques.
