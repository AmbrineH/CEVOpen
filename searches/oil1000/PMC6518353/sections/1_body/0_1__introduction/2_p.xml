<p class="p">The primary aim of this paper was to evaluate the chemical fingerprints of different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species by using GC-MS and FTIR. For the first time in this study, the major volatile compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species in Konya (Turkey) were identified by using a library of GC-MS. Additionally, HCA and PCA chemometric analyses of the GC-MS and FTIR data were performed for classification of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> seed species.
