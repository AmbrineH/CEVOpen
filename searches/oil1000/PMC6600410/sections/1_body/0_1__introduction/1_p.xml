<p class="p">In general, new renewable energy such as solar, marine, and wind energy has stochastic volatility and intermittent and thus places high demands on energy storage technology. In recent years, research related to thermal energy storage by sensible heat and latent heat has increased and now plays a major role in practical applications [

Among the many thermal energy storage methods, solidâ€“liquid phase-change materials (PCMs) for melting latent heat are an effective method and have received extensive attention because of their high heat storage density and temperature fluctuation, which is far less than the detectable option [
