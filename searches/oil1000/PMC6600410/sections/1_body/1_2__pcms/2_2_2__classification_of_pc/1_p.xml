<p class="p">Over the last several decades, many studies have been conducted on energy storage materials, including hydrated salts, paraffins, fatty acids, and eutectic mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds (see

These two categories can be further divided into two subcategories based on eutectic and mixed temperature ranges (see
