<p class="p">Beyond the phase-change process temperature region, PCMs behave like typical materials and store sensible heat. The two major application areas of PCMs can be described as follows (see

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. First, temperature control: The PCM can absorb and release thermal energy without significant temperature changes, indicating that PCMs can be used to maintain temperature stability. And second, the temperature change during energy storage and supply is small.
