<p class="p">Solid–liquid PCMs are materials suitable for cold and hot storage and are potential solutions to improve building thermal control because they can store more energy in a latent form than can the typical sensible energy stored by typical building materials [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Sensible heat storage is the most common method (ΔQ) [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] and can be described by the following Equation (1):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">ΔQ = C ΔT = m c·Δ T
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where C is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the material, c is the specific heat of the material, and ΔT is the difference between the final and initial temperatures. Different materials have different heat capacities C, which causes sensible heat to be affected by material properties and application temperatures [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Latent heat is another means of storing thermal energy. This method utilizes a material phase-change process to store thermal energy as potential energy. Usually, PCMs undergo a volume change of less than 10% during the phase change process [
