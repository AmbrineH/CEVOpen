 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02055-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows, in the case of solid–liquid phase changes, when the temperature rises to the melting temperature of the phase-change material, the PCM remains at a constant temperature and the stored heat increases. The latent heat storage (LHS) of the solid–liquid case maintains a constant temperature during the entire phase-change state of the storage material. When the temperature is higher or lower than the phase change that occurs in the temperature range, the heat is stored in the form of sensible heat, and the temperature of the material rises. During the endothermic process, the PCM material transforms from a solid to a liquid phase and absorbs energy, and during the exothermic process, the liquid PCMs transform to the solid phase again [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The heat of storage in the phase-change process can be calculated from the enthalpy difference (ΔH) between the solid and liquid phases, as shows in the following Equation (2):
