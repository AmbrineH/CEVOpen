<p class="p">The PCMs are used in construction to meet the thermal comfort standard, which means that the phase transition temperature of the adsorbed paraffin should be 18 °C and 36 °C. In addition, chemical stability and other properties, fire characteristics, and compatibility with building materials also need to be considered. Phase-change materials latent heat storage technology has been widely used in walls, ceilings, and floors. Solar energy is used for passive solar heating in sunshine hours, which plays an important role in reducing temperature fluctuations. It is also suitable for off-peak heat storage, ventilation, and cooling.</p>
