<p class="p">Recently, latent functional thermal fluids (LFTFs) have attracted people’s attention due to its higher specific heat than that of conventional single-phase heat transfer fluid in the phase-change temperature range. Latent functional thermal fluids can be applied in various applications such as heating, cooling, ventilation, and heat exchange [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] used different PCM to prepare and test solar cooling systems. A high temperature test plant capable of testing different types of thermal energy storage systems and materials was designed and built at the University of Leeds, Spain. The test plant is mainly composed of a heating system, a cooling system, and different storage tanks. The pilot plant uses synthetic heat transfer oil as a heat transfer fluid (expenditure), operating temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 °C.
