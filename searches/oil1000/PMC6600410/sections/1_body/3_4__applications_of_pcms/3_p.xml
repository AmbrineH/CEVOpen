Unlike traditional sensible heat storage methods, PCMs have a higher energy storage density and store and release heat at almost constant temperatures. Phase-change materials are available for both active and passive space heating and cooling systems. Phase-change materials for heating and cooling of water have been developed by many researchers [

 <xref rid="B116-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] analyzed the performance of a sealed salt hydrate as a potential storage tank in a domestic hot water storage tank heat transfer system. The salt is a eutectic mixture of ammonium and magnesium hydrate nitrates with a lower melting temperature. In addition, the discharge process of the PCMs is analyzed and the phase transition is performed with a constant surface temperature. The discharge effects of the materials in three different geometries packaged in flat, cylindrical or spherical polyethylene containers were evaluated. The motion boundary model of phase change material during discharge and its duration are studied. In PCMs of different geometric configurations, it was found that for small spherical capsules with high Jacob number and high thermal conductivity, the complete solidification time was the shortest. Cabeza et al. [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>] added a PCM module on top of the stratified storage tank. Lleida University established an experimental solar test plant to test the behavior of PCM under real conditions. It can work continuously with solar systems or with electric heaters. The geometry of the PCM module used is the use of several cylinders at the top of the tank. Experiments were performed on 2, 4, and 6 PCM modules in the actual installation. In this experiment, a granular PCM graphite composite material of about 90 volts % sodium acetate trihydrate and 10 volts % graphite was used as the PCM material. The experimental results show that integrating the PCM module into the domestic hot water tank is a very promising technology. It will allow long-term use of hot water without an external source of energy, or use a smaller tank to achieve the same goal.
