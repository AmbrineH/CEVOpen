<p class="p">Paraffin wax has received considerable attention in thermal energy storage because of its good thermal physical properties, including a suitable melting temperature, high latent heat energy, negligible supercooling, and stable chemical and thermal performance [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Paraffin wax (C
 <sub class="sub">n</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">2n+2</sub>) generally has a linear, cyclic, or branched structure. The melting point of paraffin wax is between 30 and 90 °C, and its specific melting enthalpies are 180–270 kJ/kg, which is determined by the chain length of the alkane. In general, the melting point of these types of materials increases with increasing average molecular weight, as shown in
