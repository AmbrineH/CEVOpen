<p class="p">Fatty acids (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2n</sub>COOH) are renewable PCMs and are considered potential PCMs for heat storage because of their good thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics such as latent heat of fusion, supercooling, thermal and chemical stability, small volume change, and broad melting point range [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Unlike paraffins, individual fatty acids have distinct properties, but their melting points and heats of fusion increase moderately as the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid molecule increases. The melting point of fatty acids ranges from 5 to 70 Â°C, whereas their latent heats of fusion range from 45 to 210 kJ/kg. Like other organic PCMs, shape-stabilized PCMs increase the likelihood that practical latent heat storage applications can eliminate the obstacles they are experiencing [
