 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] used different sugars and SAT as PCMs, and their thermophysical properties were studied. In addition, the heat transfer performance between the selected PCM and heat transfer oil was also studied. The results show that erythritol has the highest latent heat of 344 kJ/kg at 117 °C and a high decomposition point of 160 °C. It has good chemical stability under repeated phase-change cycles and is the most suitable PCM for practical systems.
