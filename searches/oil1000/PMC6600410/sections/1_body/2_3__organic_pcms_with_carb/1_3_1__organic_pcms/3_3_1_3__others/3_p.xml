With the increase in C atoms in the carboxyl group, the phase transition temperature and enthalpy of hexamethylene dilauroyl, dimyristoyl, and dipalmitamide increased correspondingly, showing a good thermal storage property and prospects for wide application.

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] proposed a novel organic PCM with oleate bio-based materials through a carbonate exchange reaction between C10-C18 fatty alcohol and dimethyl carbonate or diethyl carbonate under the action of a catalyst. Currently, oleochemical carbonates have yet to study in detail regarding their applicability as PCMs, but the experimental results show that they have obvious phase transition and good latent heat performance. They represent a promising candidate as a renewable PCM that complement the use of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty acid esters in energy storage.
