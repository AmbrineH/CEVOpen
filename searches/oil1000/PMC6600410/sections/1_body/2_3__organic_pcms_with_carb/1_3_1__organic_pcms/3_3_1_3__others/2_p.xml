 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] tested the compatibility of SAT with aluminum alloy and copper for 270 days. The results show that the corrosion effect is negligible; aluminum alloy and copper can be used with the SAT for a long time. Sodium acetate trihydrate modified with 2 wt% disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecacarbonate (DHPD) and 2 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as additives has the best performance in reducing supercooling performance. The results show that the thermal charging rate mainly depends on the thermal power level, and the foamed copper/SAT composite PCM with less thermal conductivity enhancer has better heat storage performance. It can be seen from the heat removal process that the subcooling capacity of the thermal storage unit is still greater than the improved SAT.
