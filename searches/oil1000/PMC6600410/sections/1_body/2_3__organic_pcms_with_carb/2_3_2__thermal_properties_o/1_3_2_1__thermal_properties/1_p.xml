<p class="p">Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a lightweight, high-thermal conductivity nanomaterial with broad heat transfer application prospects, which are commonly used as additives to improve the TES of paraffin and soy wax [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Phase-change materials were prepared by melting the waxes and mixing them with different content of CNTs. Experimental results show that CNTs can effectively improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs. In addition, to some extent, the thermal conductivity of PCMs increases with the addition of CNTs. Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] reported a method for producing functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) to enhance thermal conductivity and reduce supercoiling of paraffin PCMs. The carboxylation reaction of n-octadecyl-functionalized f-MWCNTs was conducted by simple H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> mixture, and then salt formation reaction with n-octadecylamine was performed to obtain f-MWCNTs; the MWCNTs improved the thermal conductivity of organic PCMs. It was found that f-MWCNTs can be uniformly dispersed in toluene or paraffin matrix because of the presence of long-chain alkanes in f-MWCNTs. In addition, f-MWCNTs as a nuclear distribution promote heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of paraffin, which reduces the supercooling of paraffin. Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] reported paraffin-based composite PCMs containing short and long multi-walled carbon nanotubes (S-MWCNTs and L-MWCNTs, respectively) and the thermal properties were also investigated. Of the two types of carbon nanotubes, S-MWCNT showed a relatively higher improvement of 63.49% at a loading of 95 wt%. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] reported PCMs containing Cu- and Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O-decorated MWCNTs. Because of the high thermal conductivity of MWCNTs, strong light absorption capacity of Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, and the modification of Cu and Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O on the surface of the nanoparticles, the interfacial thermal resistance between MWCNTs and paraffin is reduced. In their study, the thermal conductivity of each sample was higher than that of pure paraffin. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] studied the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the thermal behavior of a palmitic stearic acid binary eutectic mixture (PA-SA). Four PA-SA/CNTs composite phase-change material samples with CNT mass fraction of 58 wt% and mass fraction of 1 wt% were prepared. The thermal performance test results show that with the addition of CNTs, the heat release rate of the prepared composite PCMs increases, while the storage rate decreases. The PCMs with higher thermal conductivity, heat release rate, high thermal reliability, and proper thermal properties are a convenient material for thermal energy applications. The thermal properties of some of the prepared organic PCMs with carbon nanotube fillers are listed and compared in
