 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Composite PCMs were synthesized through a mixed melting method using CNFs with different mass fractions as raw materials. The results show that CNFs can effectively improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs, and the thermal conductivity of composite PCM increases with the increase in the CNF mass ratio. The thermal properties of a paraffin-based nanocomposite PCM including CNFs were also investigated in another study, in which the CNF-PCM exhibited a thermal conductivity enhancement of up to 25.47% at 95 wt% loading [

 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] used amber and a variety of melons including winter melon and watermelon, and pyrolyzed them at 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere to prepare a carbon aerogel (CA). A black CA/paraffin composite was prepared by impregnating 95% by weight of paraffin wax into a CA substrate. The composites were reported to be desirable, thermally stable, lightweight, and environmentally friendly thermal storage materials with a stable melting–freezing enthalpy (115.2 KJ/Kg). Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] reported the impregnation of octadecanoic acid (OA) into a graphene aerogel (GA) support material that was synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide. Because of the lower bulk density of GA, the weight percent of GA in the composite was lower (approximately 15%). Thus, the composite could provide a high heat storage capacity of 181.8 J/g, which is very close to the OA’s individual heat storage capacity (186.1 J/g). The GA/OA composite had a higher thermal conductivity (2.635 W/mK) at a GA loading fraction of 20 vol%, which was approximately 14 times that of OA (0.184 W/mK).
