<p class="p">Exfoliated graphite nanoplates were also used as a reinforcing agent in a palatinic acid (PA)/polyaniline (PANI)/xGNP composite to form a stable PCM through ultrasonic treatment. Zeng et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] used xGNPs to enhance the structure, energy storage properties, and thermal conductivity of polyaniline (PANI)-based shape-stabilized PCMs. The content of PA in the prepared stabilized PCMs was fixed at 75% by weight. The results show that xGNPs can significantly improve the thermal conductivity of the prepared shape-stable PCMs under the premise of maintaining heat storage capacity. The PA/PANI/xGnP-type stabilized PCM with a mass fraction of 7.87% has a thermal conductivity of 1.08 W/(m K) and a storage capacity of 157.7 J/g. The thermal conductivity is 237.5% higher than that of the PA/PANI type stable PCM. The prepared PA/PANI/xGnP shape-stable PCM is expected to exhibit better performance in solar thermal applications.
