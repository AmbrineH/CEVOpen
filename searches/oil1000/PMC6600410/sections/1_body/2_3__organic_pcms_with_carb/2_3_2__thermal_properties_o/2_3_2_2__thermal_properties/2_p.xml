 <xref rid="B96-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] introduced a novel sebacic acid/expanded graphite (SA/EG) composite phase change material. The optimum mass percentage of SA in the SA/EG composite PCM is about 85%, the composite PCM phase transition temperature is 128 °C, and the latent heat is as high as 187 J/g. The combination of SA and EG effectively prevents the inherent degree of subcooling of the SA to be low. Compared with SA, SA/EG-filled PCM composites show the advantage of negligible supercooling, better thermal reliability and stability. The SA/EG composite PCM can be easily formed into various shapes by dry pressing, and the thermal property loss is small, but the thermal conductivity is remarkably improved. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] used an octanoic acid–myristic acid binary eutectic mixture (OA–MA) as a base liquid. A novel composite PCM having an optimum mass ratio (OA–MA:EG = 93:7) was prepared by uniformly adsorbing OA–MA into the porous structure of expanded graphite (EG). The phase transition temperature of OA–MA/EG was 6.8 °C and the latent heat was 136.3 J/g. The addition of EG not only improves the thermal conductivity of OA–MA, but also increases the nucleation rate of OA–MA. After 100 times of cold storage and discharge comparison experiments, the phase transition temperature and latent heat of OA–MA/EG did not change significantly.
