Composites containing 4 wt% exfoliated graphite exhibited the best thermal performance in the tested SSPCMs, considerably improving the thermal conductivity and thermal cycling stability of 2.06 W/mK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02055-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a). However, the melting point of the composite material was slightly reduced. After multiple melt-coagulation cycles, the initial latent heat of the composite material was the lowest, but the insect-like morphology and porosity of the EG reduced the heat leakage of the composite material (

Expanded graphite (EG) with different interlayer spacing was combined with molten erythritol using a simple mixed impregnation method to form erythritol/EG PCMs. The effect of the additives on the thermal behavior was investigated for various interlayer distances of EG using the thermal equilibrium technique [
