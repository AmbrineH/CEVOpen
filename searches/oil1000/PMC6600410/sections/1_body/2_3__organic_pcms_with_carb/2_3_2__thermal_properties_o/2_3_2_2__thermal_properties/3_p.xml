 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-02055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] produced a new type of synthetic PCM by mixing paraffin and oleic acid with a small amount (0.5 wt%) of nano-graphite as a support material using a simple melt-mixing process. Solar water heaters prepared using these types of materials can produce hot water without nighttime or solar radiation, and the prepared gloves can continue to heat up in a low-temperature environment. The material showed inherent properties such as high thermal conductivity, ultra-fast thermal charging, and fast heat transfer characteristics, without considerably reducing the solar energy harvesting, high photothermal conversion, latent heat, or phase transition temperature.
