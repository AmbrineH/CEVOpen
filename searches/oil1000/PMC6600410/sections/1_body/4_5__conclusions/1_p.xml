<p class="p">Using the latent heat capacity of PCMs as a heat storage system is an effective means of storing heat. Over the years, extensive research has been conducted on this topic and several strategies have been considered to overcome the problems of using PCMs and to broaden the application prospects of this technology. This study reviewed the research progress of using carbon materials as organic PCM fillers to overcome the shortcomings of many organic PCMs materials such as high melting temperature or low thermal conductivity. It also reviewed and summarized current state-of-the-art developments regarding the research and application of organic PCMs filled with various carbon materials for TES applications.</p>
