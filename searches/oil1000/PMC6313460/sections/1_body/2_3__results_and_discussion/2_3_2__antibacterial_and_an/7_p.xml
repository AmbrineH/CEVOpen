<p class="p">It is reported that the potential of fixed oils to act as antibacterial or antibiotic modifiers is in part associated with the detergent property of fatty acids against the amphipathic structure of bacterial cell membranes [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> may be associated with detergent properties of fatty acids. The literature reports that long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and palmitic, demonstrate antibacterial activity and the conjugated use of fatty acids and peptides or antibiotics have potentiated antibiotic activity due to increased membrane permeability [
