<p class="p">This ability to solubilize membrane components (lipids and proteins) creates gaps in this structure that will affect metabolic processes essential for bacterial cell energy acquisition, such as the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Membrane damage can also lead to nutrient absorption difficulties, enzymatic activity inhibition, and toxic peroxidation [

Additionally, the presence of hydrophobic compounds in fixed oils may increase the cellâ€™s permeability to antibiotics resulting in higher efficiency and reducing the minimum concentration required for the antibiotic to act against the bacterium [
