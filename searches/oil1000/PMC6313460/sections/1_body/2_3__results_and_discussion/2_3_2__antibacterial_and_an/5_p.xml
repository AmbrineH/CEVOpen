<p class="p">The synergistic effect of fixed oils from both animals and plants in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics, similar to that observed in the present study, has been shown previously. The fixed “pequi” oil, for example, potentiated the activity of gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, and neomycin in a range of 87.5 to 99.8% against
