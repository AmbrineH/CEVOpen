 <xref rid="pathogens-07-00098-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows the MICs of the antibiotics and the synergic effects of the fixed oil in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics. The MICs of the antibiotics to bacteria strains were in the range of 256 to 20 μg/mL and their MIC decreased in presence of the fixed oil. The fixed oil showed weak antibacterial activity but presented a synergetic effect for antibiotics in association. The synergistic effect expressed was the potentiation of gentamicina and amikacin in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> SA-10 with MIC reductions of 40.00% and 60.55%, respectively. These results were observed for the two antibiotics using subinhibitory concentrations, results which were absent against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> EC-06. Therefore, the oil’s modifying activity over aminoglycoside antibiotics varied according to the antibiotic type associated with the fixed oil and the bacterial strain analyzed.
