<p class="p">For the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, eppendorfs were prepared with 100 μL of the inoculum and 900 μL of the Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) culture medium in a concentration of 10% in 96-well plates that were filled in the numerical sense by adding 100 μL of this solution into each well. Subsequently, serial microdilution with 100 μL of the tested substance was performed, varying in concentrations from 1024 to 1.0 μg/mL. The plates were taken to the incubator for 24 h at 37 °C. To read the bacterial MIC, 20 μL of resazurin was added to each well, and after 1 h, the color change of the wells was observed, where the modification of the blue to red coloration corresponds to microbial growth and the permanence in blue corresponds to the absence of growth, as established by The Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [
