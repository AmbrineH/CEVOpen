<p class="p">The evaluation of the fixed oils as an antibiotic activity modifier was performed according to Coutinho et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-07-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The tests were performed in triplicate. For each eppendorf, 1162 μL of 10% BHI was used, with 150 μL of the inoculum of each strain and the tested substance with a volume corresponding to a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/8 = 128 μg/mL). Controls were prepared with only 1350 μL of BHI (10%) and 150 μL of bacterial suspension. The plates were filled in numerical order and each well received 100 μL of solution. The microdilution was performed with 100 μL of each antibiotic up to the penultimate well and the final volumes were discarded. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and read through the addition of resazurin.
