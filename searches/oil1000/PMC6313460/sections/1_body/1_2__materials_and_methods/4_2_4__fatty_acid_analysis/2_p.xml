<p class="p">The analysis of volatile constituents was carried out in a GC/MS HP model 5971 using the non-polar fused silica column DB-1 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film), eluted with helium gas at 8 mL/min and with split mode. Injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The column temperature was programmed to rise from 35 °C to 180 °C at 4 °C/min, and then from 180 °C to 250 °C at 10 °C/min. Mass spectra were recorded from 30 to 450
