  <italic class="italic">Mauritia flexuosa</italic> (buriti) is a typical Brazilian palm tree found in swampy regions with many plant forms. The fruit has various purposes with the pulps to the seeds being used for ice creams, sweets, creams, jellies, liqueurs, and vitamin production. A physicochemical characterization of the fixed pulp oil and its antibacterial and aminoglycoside antibiotic modifying activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative multiresistant bacterial strains were performed using broth microdilution assays. Physical properties, such as moisture, pH, acidity, peroxide index, relative density, and refractive index, indicated oil stability and chemical quality. In the GC/MS chemical composition analysis, a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (89.81%) in relation to saturated fatty acids (10.19%) was observed. Oleic acid (89.81%) was the main fatty acid identified. In the antibacterial test, the fixed oil obtained the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) ≥ 1024 μg/mL for all standard and multiresistant bacterial strains. The synergic effect of fixed pulp oil combined was observed only in 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> SA–10, with an MIC reduction of the gentamicin and amikacin by 40.00% and 60.55%, respectively. The data indicates the 
  <italic class="italic">M. flexuosa</italic> fixed oil as a valuable source of oleic acid and modulator of aminoglycoside activity.
