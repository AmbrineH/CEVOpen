<p class="p">The films were obtained by casting 50 mL of binary or ternary mixtures in glass Petri dishes (153 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), drying first at 25 °C in a forced-air oven for 24 h and then at 40 °C in a vacuum oven. In all cases, films with relatively uniform thickness of 0.148–0.193 mm were obtained. Prior to analyses, the films were conditioned in desiccators for 2 days at 22 °C, over a saturated solution of NaBr (58% relative humidity). The schematic representation of the encapsulation of rosehip seed oil and C30B into the chitosan matrix by the emulsion/solvent casting method is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. All the films were easily removed from the cast Petri dishes and showed smooth surfaces. As a reference sample, film obtained by casting the chitosan solution containing only Tween 80 (CHM) was used.
