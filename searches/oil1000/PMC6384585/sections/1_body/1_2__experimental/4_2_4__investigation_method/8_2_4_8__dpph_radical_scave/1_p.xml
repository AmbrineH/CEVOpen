<p class="p">The radical scavenging activity (RSA) of CHM/RSO and CHM/RSO/C30B films was measured using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. Free radical scavenging method is the simplest, inexpensive and widely used method to measure the ability of compounds to act as free radical scavengers or hydrogen donors, and to evaluate antioxidant activity of foods [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The DPPH is a stable free radical, which shows a strong absorption band at 517 nm. When the stable DPPH radical accepts an electron from the antioxidant compound, the violet color of the DPPH radical is reduced to yellow colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine radical [
