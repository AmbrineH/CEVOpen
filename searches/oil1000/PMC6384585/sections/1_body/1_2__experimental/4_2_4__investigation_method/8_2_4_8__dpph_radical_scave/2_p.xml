<p class="p">A total of 300 mg of each sample was used to perform the assay. This was placed in a vessel containing 10 mL of chloroform under continuous stirring for 24 h. From each mixture a 1.5 mL volume was extracted, which was mixed with 3 mL of ethanolic DPPH solution (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> mol/L). The control sample was obtained by mixing the same volume of chloroform with 3 mL of DPPH. The reaction mixtures were left to stand for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Afterwards, the scavenging activity of samples was estimated by measuring the absorption of the mixture at 520 nm, using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Cary 60-UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, USA) which reflected the amount of DPPH radicals remaining in the solution.
