<p class="p">Oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability measurements were performed on triplicate samples using a manometric gas permeation tester (Lyssy L100-5000, Systech Illinois, Johnsburg, Illinois, USA), which uses the dynamic measuring principle based on pressure change due to gas transmission through films. The experimental tests were conducted at 23 Â°C, after the samples were conditioned for minimum 4 h. The area of tested film was 10 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained in mL/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per day. The film separates the two compartments of the measuring chamber, the lower one being evacuated down to defined pressure while a continuous flow of gas (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) passes through the upper compartment. Closing the valve on the line to the vacuum pump, the pressure in the lower compartment increases due to migration through the film of the gas from the upper compartment. The instrument measures the time required for the increase of pressure within two pre-defined limits and, comparing with the values measured for a standard film, calculates the permeability of the tested film.
