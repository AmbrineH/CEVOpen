<p class="p">Using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique the samples hydrodynamic radius was determined by a Zetasizer instrument (Nano ZS model, Malvern Instruments, UK), equipped with a red laser 633 nm He/Ne. The device uses technology that reduces the multiple scattering effects, which is based on a non-invasive back scatter (NIBS). The technology used is a non-invasive one, with the optics not being in contact with the sample, and backscattered light being detected. The Mie method was used during measurements over the whole recording range and comprised between 0.6 nm and 6 μm. Samples were diluted in double distilled water, each analysis consisting of three replicates and each determination was analyzed twice. The apparent hydrodynamic diameter (
