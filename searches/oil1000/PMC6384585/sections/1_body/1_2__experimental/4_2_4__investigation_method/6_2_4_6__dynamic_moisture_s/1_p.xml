<p class="p">Dynamic water vapors sorption capacity for the samples was established using a fully mechanized instrument, named IGAsorp, a gravimetric analyzer manufactured by Hiden Analytical, (Warrington, UK). This device has a very sensitive microbalance able to determine the weight change as the relative humidity is varied in the sample compartment, at a constant temperature. The measurements are totally adjusted by a special software. Initially, the samples were dried at 25 Â°C, in a nitrogen flow (250 mL/min) till their masses were kept constant at relative humidity (RH) &lt;1%. After that, the RH was gradually raised from 0% to 90%, in 10% humidity periods, each one having a pre-determined equilibrium time between 40 and 60 min and the sorption equilibrium was realized for each step. Then, the RH was diminished, and sorption/desorption curves were recorded. Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) values represent the average of three different determinations. </p>
