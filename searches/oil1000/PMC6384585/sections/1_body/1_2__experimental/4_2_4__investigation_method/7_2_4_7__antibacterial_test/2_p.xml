<p class="p">The reconstituted cultures were subcultured to obtain replicate reference stock cultures and the reference stock culture was further subcultured to obtain the working stock culture. From this working stock culture bacterial suspensions of 0.5 McF (McFarland units measured with a densitometer) were obtained, which were serial diluted in order to achieve concentrations of about 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>–10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/0.1 mL. These suspensions were used for testing antibacterial activity of the surface of the chitosan films obtained by emulsion method. Sterilization of the polymeric samples was made in an autoclave at 110 °C and 0.5 bars for 20 min. After sterilization, a certain volume of bacteria suspensions was added dropwise to the surface of each 1 × 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> chitosan-based films placed on Petri dishes and thermostated at 37 °C. After 24 h and 48 h, using sterile tampons moistened in peptone water, the specimens from the test surfaces were collected and were seeded on the surface of specific culture media for each food pathogenic bacteria as: XLD (Xylose Lysine Desoxycholate agar) for 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhymurium</italic>; BACARA® (chromogenic media and method for the enumeration of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> in food products, 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> colonies turn pink-orange with an opaque halo); and VRBG (Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar) for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The Petri dishes with inoculated culture media were incubated at 37 °C, and after 24 h the specific colonies of each bacterial species were counted. Antibacterial inhibition was determined by the colonies counting method. Reduction in the number of CFU represented the antibacterial activity by comparison with sterile inert film used as control sample. Each experiment was realized in triplicate.
