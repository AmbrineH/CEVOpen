<p class="p">The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) technique was used to determine the samples molecular structure. Using a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer the background and samples spectra were recorded in absorbance mode in the 600 to 4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> wavenumber range, at a 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resolution, by performing 64 scans and the ATR module being equipped with a 45° ZnSe crystal (penetration thickness is around 100 µm). The processing of spectra was achieved using OPUS and ORIGIN programs. For each sample, the evaluations were made on the average spectrum obtained from three recordings.
