<p class="p">Tensile tests were carried out by means of an Instron testing machine (model 3345) with a loading cell of 5 kN, according to EN ISO 527-2/2012. The tested samples of 1 mm thickness were conditioned at 23 °C and relative humidity of 50%. A loading speed of 10 mm/min and a 40 mm gauge length were used for mechanical testing. The following tensile properties were assessed: Young’s modulus, tensile strength at the break and strain at break. For each measurement, five replicates were used and the average data are presented further.</p>
