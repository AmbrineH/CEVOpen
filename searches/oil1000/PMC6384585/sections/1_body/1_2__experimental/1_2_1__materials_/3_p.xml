<p class="p">Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, T80), also known as Polysorbate 80 is a nonionic surfactant and emulsifier often used in foods and cosmetics, which is a viscous and water-soluble yellow liquid. Tween 80 with Mw of 1310 g/mol and more than 58% oleic acid content, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, was added (0.125 g Tween 80/1 g chitosan) as an emulsifying agent to stabilize the hydrophobic oil droplets into aqueous chitosan solutionâ€”the resulting sample was noted as CHM. </p>
