<p class="p">Cold-pressed rosehip seed oil (RSO), was purchased from S.C Herbavit S.R.L, Oradea, Romania. It was obtained as a cold-pressed (high-pressure) oil of rosehip seeds in small batches. The fruits were collected from wild rose bushes of the common dog-rose (
 <italic class="italic">Rosa canina</italic> L., species belonging to the Rosa genus in the Rosaceae family) growing in Romania. According to the producer’s specifications it has a high content of monounsaturated fatty acids: oleic (10–20%); essential polyunsaturated fatty acids: linoleic (35–50%) and linolenic (25–50%) and also palmitic and stearic acids. In this study, the rosehip seed oil was incorporated into chitosan film in a proportion of 0.75:1 (mL/g) RSO/chitosan. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of RSO was determined by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method (as described below) measuring the percentage radical inhibition vs. different oil concentrations in the range of 0.5–3.5 mg/mL. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> represents the concentration of sample required to obtain a 50% radical inhibition. RSO shows a good antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> as low as 2.3 mg/mL.
