<p class="p">Chitosan solutions (3%, w/v) were prepared by dispersing chitosan powder in acetic acid solution (5%, v/v) under magnetic stirring, at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) for 72 h. To obtain the chitosan/rosehip seed oil (CHM/RSO) emulsion, 2 mL of rosehip seed oil and 0.375 g Tween 80 were added to the 85 mL chitosan solution (3%, w/v). The chitosan/rosehip seed oil/C30B (CHM/RSO/C30B) system was obtained by adding 0.09 g C30B to chitosan/rosehip seed oil/T80 mixture as described above. The obtained solutions were homogenized for 2 min with an ultrasonic processor UP50H (Hielscher—Ultrasound Technology, Teltow, Germany) using a power of 50 W at 30 kHz.</p>
