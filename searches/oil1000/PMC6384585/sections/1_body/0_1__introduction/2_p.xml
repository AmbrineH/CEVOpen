<p class="p">Vegetable oils have received great attention from food scientists due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Rosehip seed oil can be obtained from wild roses (
 <italic class="italic">Rosa moschata</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Rosa rubiginosa</italic> L. or 
 <italic class="italic">Rosa canina Herrm</italic>.) from Rosaceae family, bushes, which grow in various areas around the world. Rosehip seed oil has a subtle woody scent and color that can range from golden yellow to light orange. It has been found that rosehip seed oil is an important and inexpensive source of unsaturated fatty acids, the most abundant being linoleic (54.41–48.64%), followed by linolenic (17.14–18.41%) and oleic acid (14.71–18.42%) [

To confer superior antibacterial and antioxidant activities, barrier and mechanical properties to chitosan films various bioactive compounds and other additives have been incorporated in chitosan matrix by emulsion/casting method [
