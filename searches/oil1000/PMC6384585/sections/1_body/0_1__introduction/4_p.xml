<p class="p">Starting from these considerations, the objective of this research was to analyze the beneficial effect of the addition of rosehip oil to chitosan film properties intended to be used as food packages or edible films. With this aim, new bionanocomposites films based on chitosan, rosehip seed oil and montmorillonite nanoclay are obtained using a simple and original casting emulsion method. The bionanocomposites as films were investigated for their structural, morphological characteristics and, mechanical, barrier, antibacterial and antioxidant properties. All determined characteristics proved that these bionanocomposites are good potential materials for food industry. </p>
