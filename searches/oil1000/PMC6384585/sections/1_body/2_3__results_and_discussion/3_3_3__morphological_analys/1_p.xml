<p class="p">Scanning electron microscopy examination reveals the morphology of the films surface obtained by the incorporation of rosehip seeds oil and nanoclay C30B into chitosan films (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis of the CHM sample reveals a smooth and continuous film structure surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,d). Inspection of CHM/RSO/T80 film surface showed the presence of large spherical cavities, attributed to RSO oil droplets, that are relatively homogenously dispersed into the CHM matrix (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b,e), as revealed by SEM images. Similar surface microstructure, namely discontinuities associated with the formation of two phases, was found for quinoa protein-chitosan-sunflower oil film by Valenzuela et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The average particle size of the RSO globules is 4.7 ± 1.6 µm, with the size of oil droplets varying from 2.1 to 7.2 µm. The good homogeneity of the films and the encapsulation of the oil are assured by the presence of the nonionic surfactant and T80 emulsifier. By C30B nanoclay addition into the emulsion system, the average particle size of the RSO droplets decrease at about 2.6 ± 0.7 µm, the oil droplets being better distributed into the emulsion-cast film (
