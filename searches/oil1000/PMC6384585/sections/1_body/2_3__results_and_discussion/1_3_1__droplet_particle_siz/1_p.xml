 <xref rid="materials-12-00373-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Emulsions without C30B nanoclay (CHM/RSO) had bimodal droplet size distributions. The main population of droplets (that scatter around 81% of the total scattered intensity) presented diameters of 737â€“1250 nm and the second population had a drop average diameter of 136 nm (around 19% of the total scattered intensity). Differently, emulsions containing C30B nanoclay had trimodal droplet size distributions. The averages diameters of the detected droplet populations were 385 nm (85%), 98 nm (7%), and 63 nm (8%), respectively. C30B nanoclay added to the continuous phase of the emulsion conferred its distinct droplet size distribution, the average size diameter of the main population of droplet decrease almost threefold.
