<p class="p">The zeta potential of the obtained emulsions presented positive values due to the presence of cationic polysaccharide (chitosan), as expected. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil–water interface and intercalated between the nonionic surfactant (T80) molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by nonionic surfactant) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed rosehip seed oil droplets in the o/w nano/micro-sized emulsions. The same behavior was noticed also for other o/w chitosan-based emulsions as mentioned by Tamilvanan et al. for castor oil-based chitosan emulsion [
