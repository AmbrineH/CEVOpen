<p class="p">A barrier polymeric material is most commonly used in the packaging industry to stop the passage of small molecules of gases, moisture or flavors. The barrier properties of a polymeric film are important because it is necessary to preserve the quality of food and to estimate its shelf-life [
 <xref rid="B47-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Generally, gas permeability depends on film microstructure (holes or discontinuities in the polymer structure), thickness, the solubility of gases in the corresponding material, and the level of arrangement of the polymer chains [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are the most common permeates studied in food packaging applications. The oxygen diffusion from air into the package should be avoided because the product quality can be modified during prolonged storage due to the oxidation, which leads to changes in organoleptic properties and decreased nutritional value. The oxygen permeation through a material is calculated as the weight or volume of oxygen which is able to pass through a known area of a packaging material in a given time [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Like oxygen, the barrier property to carbon dioxide is also important in food packaging applications, since carbon dioxide can initiate deterioration reactions and should be removed to ensure freshness of food products.
