 <sub class="sub">2</sub> permeability tests of the chitosan emulsion films. The values of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> permeability for reference chitosan film was of 67 mL/m

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>Î‡per day, respectively. These kind of gas barrier features were observed also by other authors, the values of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> permeability of chitosan films being comparable [

 <xref rid="B49-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The increased values of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could be attributed to the plasticization effect of the amorphous biopolymer backbone by the water molecules [
 <xref rid="B50-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The plasticizing effect tends to increase the mobility of the oxygen molecules due to the disruption of hydrogen-bonding, creating additional sites for the dissolution of oxygen [
 <xref rid="B51-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The presence of C30B nanoclay leads to the improvement of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> barrier properties reaching half lower CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> values for films with C30B compared to neat chitosan.
