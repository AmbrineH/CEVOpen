<p class="p">Addition of C30B nanoclay into the chitosan-RSO emulsion film leads to a further slight decrease in equilibrium moisture content. This result indicates that nanoclay affects the water vapor barrier property of biopolymer films, which may be due to the fulfilling of interspaces in the chitosan matrix by nanoclay particles [
