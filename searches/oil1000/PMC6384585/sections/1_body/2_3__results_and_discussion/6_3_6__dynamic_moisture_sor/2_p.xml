 <xref rid="B54-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], the adsorption/desorption isotherms can be associated to type V curves describing adsorption on hydrophobic/low hydrophilic materials with weak sorbent–water interactions. The values of water vapor sorption capacities for all the samples are presented in the

The chitosan-based films showed an improvement of the water vapor barrier property by incorporation of rosehip seed oil and C30B nanoclay in the film matrix (
 <xref rid="materials-12-00373-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The EMC of rosehip seed oil–chitosan films is significantly lower than that corresponding to the reference chitosan film. This may be due to the diminished availability of amino groups of chitosan, determined by the electrostatic neutralization with the carboxylate groups of rosehip seed oil that contributes to the compactness of the film network and may cause limited access of water molecules to the hydrophilic sites of chitosan. Pereda et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] observed the same behavior of EMC for olive oil–chitosan films.
