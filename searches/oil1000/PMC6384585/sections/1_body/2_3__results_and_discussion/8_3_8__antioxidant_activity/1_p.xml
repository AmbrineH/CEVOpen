<p class="p">Antioxidant properties, especially radical scavenging activity, are important because free radicals have a negative effect both on foods and the human body, leading to oxidative stress, which is involved in the development of many human diseases [

 <xref rid="B61-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. As demonstrated by other authors, chitosan itself holds some antioxidant activity, mainly attributed to the capacity of residual free amino groups of chitosan to react with free radicals, forming stable macromolecular radicals and ammonium groups, but its activity is negligible compared to other bioactive compounds [

When rosehip seed oil was added to the chitosan film, the radical scavenging activity (RSA, %) increased up to three-fold (determined after 30 min). The addition of C30B nanoclay into the chitosan/rosehip seed oil films did not significantly affect the antioxidant activity of the samples (
