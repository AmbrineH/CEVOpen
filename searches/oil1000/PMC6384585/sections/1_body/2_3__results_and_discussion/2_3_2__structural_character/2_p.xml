<p class="p">The FTIR spectrum of chitosan presents a broad band between 3680 and 2980 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, with two highlighted peaks at 3355 and 3271 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> attributed to amine N–H stretch and O–H stretch, respectively. The band between 2980 and 2750 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, with maximum at 2923 and 2873 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, is assigned to aliphatic C–H stretching [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The band at 1647 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is assigned to amide C=O stretching from acetylated amino groups in chitosan. Another major absorption band with a maximum at 1549 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> belongs to free primary amino group bending (ν NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) at C
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> position of glucosamine, which is one main group present in chitosan. The bands found in the spectrum at 1405 and 1380 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are attributed to the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> bend. The band at 1323 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is due to –O–H in plane vibration of primary alcohol groups (–CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–OH). The absorption bands at 1152 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (anti-symmetric stretching of the C–O–C bridge), 1064 and 1023 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (skeletal vibration involving the C–O stretching overlapped with C–N stretching vibration) are characteristics of the saccharide units of the chitosan structure [
