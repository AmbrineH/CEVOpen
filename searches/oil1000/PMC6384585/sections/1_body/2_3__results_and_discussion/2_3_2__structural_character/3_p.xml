<p class="p">FTIR spectrum of C30B clay reveals typical vibration bands responsible for stretching vibrations of the Si–O bond at 1116 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, bending vibrations of AlAlOH at 919 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and AlMgOH bonds at 885–849 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Other absorptions bands are found at 1012 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, assigned to stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si, and at 3631 and 3538 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, ascribed to the free –OH stretching and the hydrogen-bonded –OH stretching, respectively. The band located at 1643 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for C30B organoclay is caused by the hydrogen free carbonyl, and the bands at 1467 and 1369 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are associated with the –CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> group. Bands characteristic to –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> stretching of methylene group are found in the region located at 2924 and 2850 cm
