<p class="p">The FTIR spectra of CHM/RSO and CHM/RSO/C30B sample reveals some characteristic bands of rosehip seeds oil incorporated into chitosan-based film, namely at 3006, 2858, 1741, and 1450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> that are assigned to ν (=CH), symmetrical ν (C–H) from methyl group, ν (C=O) from RC=OOR structure and to δ (C–H) deformation. Significant modifications are observed in FTIR spectra of chitosan by rosehip seed oil incorporation into emulsion-based films. The vibration absorption band given by the free O–H bond valence occurs in the region of 3590–3650 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and the association through polymer hydrogen bonds leads to wide bands in the region 3200–3600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. By rosehip seed oil addition into chitosan-based films. the band associated with free bonded O–H group of chitosan is shifted to a lower wavenumber, from 3355 to 3343 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, indicating interaction by hydrogen bonds between chitosan and rosehip seed oil. The band ascribed to primary amino group bending (ν NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) of chitosan is shifted to higher wavenumbers by RSO incorporation (from 1549 to 1554 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Most vibration bands of chitosan are shifted to higher wavenumbers by RSO incorporation and this may be due to the fact that the added components can inhibit the inter/intra molecular hydrogen bonding which existed in the neat chitosan film [
