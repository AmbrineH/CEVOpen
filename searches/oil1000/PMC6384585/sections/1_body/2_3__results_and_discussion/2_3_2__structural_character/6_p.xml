<p class="p">The FTIR spectroscopy has demonstrated the RSO and C30B clay successful incorporation into chitosan-based film. The formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions that appear on the phase boundaries, indicated by the band shift in FTIR spectra, influences the mechanical properties of the materials. Addition of the C30B nano-filler to the liquid system of chitosan dissolved in acetic acid solution facilitated formation of hydrogen bonds between functional groups of the chitosan matrix, mainly with amine and hydroxyl groups, and the Si–O bonds existing within the silicate layers of the nanoclay. Moreover, both hydroxyl and amine groups of chitosan may bond with Si–O–Si groups of the silicate layer of C30B clay [
