<p class="p">From the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, it can be observed that chitosan film is an effective antimicrobial agent against the tested bacteria. The results showed bacteria inhibition at 24 h, with 65% reduction for 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>, 73% reduction for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli,</italic> and 82% reduction for 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus.</italic> Addition of rosehip seed oil resulted in the decrease of the antibacterial action against 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus.</italic> On the other hand, all tested chitosan emulsion films showed pronounced antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Addition of rosehip seed oil and C30B nanoclay resulted in the increase of antibacterial activity of the chitosan film against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. These results are in accordance with those reported by Kamarasamy et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], where a weak antibacterial effect of rosehip seed oil was demonstrated, and only against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Additionally, is important to mention that addition of C30B nanoclay resulted in an increase of antibacterial activity of the chitosan emulsion films against all tested bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Similar results regarding the antibacterial property of C30B nanoclay were also reported by various authors [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> indicates a synergism between chitosan, rosehip seed oil and C30B nanoclay, and that by mixing them a material with strong antibacterial property resulted.
