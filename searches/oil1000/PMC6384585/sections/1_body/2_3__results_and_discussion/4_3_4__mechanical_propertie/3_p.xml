<p class="p">Chitosan control film (containing T80) had the strength at break of 59.9 MPa, Young Modulus value of 7282.0 MPa and 1.05% elongation at break. Incorporation of rosehip seed oil and C30B nanoclay into chitosan films significantly increased elongation at break from 1.05% to 11.7% in case of RSO incorporation and 11.40% for RSO/C30B. The nanofiller does not change elongation at break. A high value of Young modulus was registered for the reference chitosan film, which means that it is a rigid material. On the other hand, an increase of tensile strength and a decrease of elastic modulus after the incorporation of the rosehip seed oil and C30B nanoclay can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00373-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The strength at break values for the chitosan based-films containing RSO and C30B nanoclay, are 60.1 and 70.7 MPa, respectively and Young modulus values determined for the same samples were 3232.3 and 4110.9 MPs, respectively. This behavior could be attributed to the oil components, which act like plasticizers for the chitosan film. The role of plasticizers is to weaken the inter/intra molecular forces between polymer chains, and thereby increasing the flexibility of the films [

 <xref rid="B45-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The authors attributed this behavior to the presence of structural discontinuities in the chitosan matrix caused by the oil-dispersed phase. The C30B further improved the strength at break of the films. According to Krochta and De-Mulder-Johnstonâ€™s [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-12-00373" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] film classification, values of tensile strength below 10 MPa indicate poor mechanical properties. Therefore, chitosan based-films containing RSO and C30B nanoclay show good and satisfactory mechanical properties; and the strength at break values can be considered acceptable for materials proposed for applications in bioactive food packaging.
