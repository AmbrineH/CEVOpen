<p class="p">Films based on chitosan, rosehip seed oil and C30B montmorillonite were successfully prepared and characterized by the encapsulation emulsion method. The addition of rosehip seed oil, which acts also as antioxidant, antibacterial and plasticizer, was found also responsible for improving the flexibility of chitosan-based films, whereas addition of the C30B nanoclay improved the strength at break of the biocomposites. The inter/intra molecular hydrogen bonding between components, confirmed by FTIR analysis, assures the excellent integrity of the films and, as a consequence, superior gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and water vapor barrier properties. The results of the present study show that the chitosan emulsion films exhibited potent antibacterial and antioxidant activity, and can be considered acceptable for materials proposed for applications in bioactive food packaging. </p>
