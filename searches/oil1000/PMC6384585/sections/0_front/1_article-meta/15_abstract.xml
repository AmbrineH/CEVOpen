 <p class="p">Biopolymer nanocomposite films were prepared by casting film-forming emulsions based on chitosan/Tween 80/rosehip seed oil and dispersed montmorillonite nanoclay C30B. The effect of composition on structural, morphological characteristics and, mechanical, barrier, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties was studied. The presence of rosehip seed oil in chitosan films led to the formation of flexible films with improved mechanical, gas and water vapour barrier properties and antioxidant activity. The in vitro antibacterial tests against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhymurium, and Bacillus cereus showed that the chitosan/rosehip seed oil/montmorillonite nanoclay composites effectively inhibited all the three microorganisms.</p>
