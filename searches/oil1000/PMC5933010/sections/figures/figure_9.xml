  <p class="p">Representive p53 immunohistochemistry in liver tissues of the different experimental groups (Ã—400). (a and d) The normal control and MPEO control very weak immunopositive reaction. (b) Liver fibrosis control (group 2) showing intense immunostaining in most of the hepatic cells. (c) MPEO-treated (group 3) showing immunopositive reaction in some hepatic cells. (e) Bar chart represents the p53 immunohistochemistry in liver tissues expressed as area %. Mean values with different superscripts are significantly different (
