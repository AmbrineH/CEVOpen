 <p> Quantitative real-time PCR of Tp53 and CYP2E1 mRNA in liver tissues of the different experimental groups. Values are expressed as means ± SD. GAPDH was used as an invariant housekeeping control gene for calculating the fold changes (RQ) in mRNA levels. Mean values having different letters are significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>
