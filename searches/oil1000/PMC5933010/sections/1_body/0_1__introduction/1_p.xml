<p class="p">Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the ultimate consequences of chronic hepatic injury induced by various etiological agents [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The mechanism of liver fibrosis has been extensively studied. However, effective antifibrotic therapies are lacking [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis is generally based on the activation of HSCs and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Oxidative stress plays a central role in triggering these inflammatory and fibrotic responses [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Among the various signaling pathways involved in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1/SMAD is considered the most significant signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Therefore, inhibiting TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 was found to be efficient in attenuating liver fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The tumor suppressor p53 is another important cell signal primarily stimulated in response to oxidative damage and oncogene activation [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Accumulating evidences suggested the involvement of p53 in the pathophysiology of various nontumoral fibrotic liver diseases in both human and animals [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. These data suggest that p53 regulation could serve as an important therapeutic target for fibrotic liver diseases.
