<p class="p">MPEO was reported to have a wide range of components, including menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and methyl acetate, and other pharmacologically active compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, and caffeic acid [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In the current study, the chemical profile of MPEO, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, is characterized by the dominant presence of the oxygenated monoterpenes menthol (46.7%) and menthone (18.3%). A high percentage of carvone (15%) was observed compared to that of the composition previously reported by Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Different chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> were reported in other countries in which the major constituent in MPEO is linalool as in 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> collected from Brazil [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] or limonene as in 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> collected from India [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This diversity in the chemical composition may be attributed to geographical and soil condition, biosynthetic factors, and collection time [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. However, the composition of MPEO presented in the current study still maintains a certain level of chemosimilarity with some previously reported MPEO compositions [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Mentha species are known for their ability to exhibit strong antioxidant and radical scavenging activities owing to the presence of valuable secondary metabolites in the essential oil and phenolic substances [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Previous studies showed that the radical scavenging activity of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> species is attributed to the presence of menthone and menthol, with the presence of the hydroxyl radical (
 <sup class="sup">â€¢</sup>OH). The vast majority of these antioxidants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) have the ability to trap the free radicals and interrupt the chain reaction due to the presence of at least one aromatic ring in their structures [
