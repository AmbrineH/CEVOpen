<p class="p">LPO is thought to be the initiation step of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> hepatotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Lipid hydroperoxides are unstable and so degrade rapidly into a variety of secondary metabolites such as MDA, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and other conjugated dienes [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. MDA serves as a main biomarker to assess the level of lipoperoxidative tissue damage [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In accordance with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], a significant increase in liver MDA content was observed in the CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> group, suggesting an enhanced LPO (
