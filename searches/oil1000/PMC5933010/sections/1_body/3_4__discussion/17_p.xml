 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B by altering the DNA binding sites or by oxidizing the cysteine residues of such proteins resulting in conformational change of their tertiary structure with subsequent protein degradation activation or inhibition. Activated p53 plays a crucial role in inducing apoptosis to prevent the propagation of DNA damage [
