<p id="Par30" class="p">In the present investigation, the total concentration of toxic metals in the Ahvaz surface soils was examined. Lead isotope ratios were analysed to identify the major source of Pb in the Ahvaz surface soil. Mean concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and As were higher their corresponding baseline levels. Coefficient correlation, principle component and cluster analysis indicated that distinct types of toxic metals from anthropogenic sources can be separated. Specifically, the As value which may be controlled by different sources from one of the other metals, whereas the level of Pb, Zn and Cu in Ahvaz soils mostly originate from common anthropogenic contaminations such as vehicle emissions and industrial sources. Pollution index values indicated that there was no significant pollution for As, but 68, 32 and 34% of the analysed urban soil samples were highly polluted with Pb, Zn and Cu, respectively. The NPI of the four potentially toxic metals also demonstrated that soil samples in Ahvaz show moderate to high levels of pollution. More than 44 and 38% of soil samples had a 2 &lt; NPI &lt; 3 and NPI ≥ 3, indicating moderate and high level pollution, particularly in the areas with high traffic volumes and industrial zones. Calculated four-end member model of Pb isotopic ratios suggested that industrial emission, vehicle exhaust and dust storm with the mean contributions of 47, 15 and 7% are the main source of Pb in Ahvaz surface soil.</p>
