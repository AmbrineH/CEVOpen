  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. The anthropogenic origins of potentially toxic metals including lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and arsenic (As) are mainly attributed to traffic, vehicle emission, brake and tyre wear and street industrial activities. In addition, industrial discharge of potentially toxic metals into the urban environment can include: power and desalination plants, oil well drilling activities, fuel combustion, local industrial zones, metallurgical industry, household release, weathering of asphalt and roadside material, atmospheric and dust deposition

 </sup>. The common applied toxic metal pollution indices in soils and sediments can be defined in two main categories: single and integrated indices

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. Firstly, single methods include the enrichment factor (EF), index of geo-accumulation (Igeo) and pollution index (PI), which which provide a measure of single metals and distinguish background from threshold pollution level

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. Secondly, integrated indices such as the integrated pollution index (IPI), Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and risk index (RI) are applied to more than one metal and is an integration of toxic metal pollution values for every sampling point and can be composed by each of the single indices
