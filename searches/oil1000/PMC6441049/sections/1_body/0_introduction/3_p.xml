<p id="Par4" class="p">Ahvaz as a major industrialised center is one of the fastest developing metropolises in Iran. In this current study, we present the first comprehensive report on the spatial distribution, pollution level and source identification of main anthropogenic sources of toxic metals (Pb, Zn, Cu and As) by a systematic sampling strategy in urban topsoils in Ahvaz City. Previous reports have applied a geographical information sysytem (GIS) survey to study the distribution and hot-spot identification of potentially toxic metal pollution assesment in urban soils

 </sup>. However, GIS-based work in soil environmental quality has never been reported in Ahvaz. The current study aims are: (1) to present the spatial distributions of potentially toxic metals in surface soils in Ahvaz city; (2) to identify the co-sources of pollutants with the application of robust multivariate analysis (principle component) and Pb isotopic signature; (3) to explore the degree of toxic metal pollution in the soils by applying pollution indices to provide a metric for hazard to human health; (4) application of Pb isotope tracing method to identify the source of metal pollution in surface soils.
