<p id="Par8" class="p">Two hundred twenty-seven (227) topsoil samples from (0–10 cm) were collected in July 2015 (dry season), to prevent rain/flood washing out the potentially toxic metals. A regular grid sampling plan was implemented to specify a systematic sampling system (240 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The study area was divided into 227 grid nodes of 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Each soil sample was carefully obtained from a composite of five sub-samples (0–10 cm), with a plastic trowel and mixed samples sieved through a 2 mm nylon mesh, air-dried and stored in polyethylene bags. Deionised water was used to clean the trowel before and after sample collection. Sampling sites are displayed in Fig. (
