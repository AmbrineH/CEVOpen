 </sup>. Digested samples were passed through an 8μm membrane filter and diluted with Milli-Q water. Selected toxic metals (Pb, Zn, Cu and As) were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (PG990 Model). Quality control and quality assessment (QC/QA) included analytical duplicates samples, a reagent blank, standard reference materials (SRM- Montana I SRM-2710) (multi-element soil standard OREAS45EA and OREAS24P) and procedural blanks provided a measure of analytical performance. The average of recovery values ± SD in SRMs for selected metals were Pb (99 ± 3.23, Zn (102 ± 10.25), Cu (99 ± 4.58) and As (99 ± 4.87), which indicating a good agreement between measured and certified value. Detection limits for selected metals in AAS was calculated by using 3 × SD (standard deviation) of concentration of ten blank samples. Detection limit were 0.05 mg.kg
