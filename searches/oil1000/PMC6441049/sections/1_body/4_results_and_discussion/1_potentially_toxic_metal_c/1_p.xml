<p id="Par14" class="p">Results of analytical data indicated that the coefficient of skewness for Pb, Zn, Cu and As were extensively higher than zero, showing a right skewed distribution (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). It shows that samples with high value of Pb, Zn, and Cu occurred in the collected samples and indicated the non-similar distribution of concentration values. In contrast, As with close to zero skewness coefficients demonstrate a normal distributions. High standard deviation (SD) were observed in all potentially toxic metals except As, revealing the large variation of toxic metals in Ahvaz topsoils. The mean values of Pb, Zn, Cu and As in Ahvaz topsoils were noticeably greater than the corresponding baseline concentrations, demonstrating the pollution from anthropogenic sources and considerable contamination level in the Ahvaz city. Findings achieved for studied toxic metals are reviewed in the following sections:
