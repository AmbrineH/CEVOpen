 </sup>. PC1 with 82% of total variance was the most important component and high loadings dominated by Pb (0.723), Zn (0.602) and Cu (0.874) had a significant positive correlation. PC2 with 11% with variance loading was dominated by As (0.641) seperated from other toxic metals thay may indicate different sources or different geochemical behavior of As

 </sup>. In addition, the correlation of PC1 and PC2 achieved from the biplot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) indicates that the PC1 scores show a positive relationship between Pb, Zn and Cu, with eigen values greater than 0.6, confirm that these metals originate from common sources, markedly emission sources as reported in earlier studies
