Even though, Pb isotopic ratios of vehicle exhaust were reasonably scattered as leaded and unleaded samples, the Pb isotopic ratios in studied soil samples were clearly in adjacent to the vehicle exhaust samples (Leaded and unleaded gasoline), industrial waste, and chemical fertilizer

Therefore, it can be concluded that vehicle exhaust/emission and dust deposition were the main contributors of Pb deposition in the soil environment. According to the above results, we can conclude that the Pb concentration in the studied soil samples could be the consequence of natural sources including geogenic process and anthropogenic activities.
