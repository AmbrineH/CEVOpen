 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). According to the integration end-member model the values of natural background, industrial release, vehicle emission and dust storm are 42–51%, 12–49%, 5–45% and 5–12%, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). It is indicated that, in the Ahvaz city, industrial activities including oil well waste, not well defined land use planning companies, such as the Carbon Black Company, steel companies and local industrial zones are the main anthropogenic lead sources in surface soil of Ahvaz city.
