<p id="Par23" class="p">The pollution index (PI) was evaluated using the baseline values of potentially toxic metals in the urban surface soils of Ahvaz. Pollution index (PI) ranges for Pb were from 0.3 to 4.2 with an average value of 2.3. Approximately, 68% of the analysed soil samples indicating moderate to high PI values for Pb. The PI value for Cu and Zn represent moderate to high levels of pollution, with a range of 0.3 and 5.9 for Cu and 0.15 and 2.3 for Zn. The moderate to high PI values were obtained in 34 and 32% of soil samples for Cu and Zn, respectively.</p>
