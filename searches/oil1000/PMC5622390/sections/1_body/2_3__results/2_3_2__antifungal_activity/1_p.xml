<p class="p">The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. brasiliense</italic> presented clear inhibition zones corresponding to antifungal activity in the limit of detection against 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium cladosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. sphaerospermum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Female flowers presented the strongest activity for both fungi from 200 μg until 25 μg of essential oil tested, but the other oils presented weaker inhibition, up to 50 μg against 
 <italic class="italic">C. sphaerospermum</italic> and to 25 μg against
