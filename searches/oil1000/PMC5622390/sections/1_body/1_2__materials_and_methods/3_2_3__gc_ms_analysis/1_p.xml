 <italic class="italic">v</italic> (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Chemical analysis of the essential oils was performed on an Agilent 6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), interfaced with a 5973 Series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm) (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatography conditions were as follows; oven temperature program: 40 °C for 1 min with subsequent temperature increase of 3 °C/min up to 240 °C, keeping it at this temperature for 10 min.; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature of 250 °C; electron ionization: 70 eV. The component abundances were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the triplicates. The essential oil components were identified by comparing the retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those reported in the literature [
