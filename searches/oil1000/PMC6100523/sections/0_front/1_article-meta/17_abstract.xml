 <p class="p">The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and functional properties of the essential oils from the plants 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra grandiflora</italic> (Wall.) Hook. f. et Thoms, 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra rubriflora</italic> (Franch). Rehd. et Wils., 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra sphenanthera</italic> Rehd. et Wils., and 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra propinqua</italic> (Wall.) Baill var. 
  <italic class="italic">sinensis</italic> Oliv. collected in the Qinling Mountains. Under the optimum conditions of the ultrasonic-assisted extraction method, the extraction yields were 7.51% (
  <italic class="italic">S. grandiflora</italic>), 6.91% (
  <italic class="italic">S. rubriflora</italic>), 6.11% (
  <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>), and 5.88% (
  <italic class="italic">S. propinqua</italic>). A total of 86 components were identified from four species of 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> and 16 components were shared among the essential oils of all samples with different contents. However, some components were identified only in a certain plant, for example, 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllen (
  <italic class="italic">S. grandiflora</italic>), 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bulnesene (
  <italic class="italic">S. rubriflora</italic>), and 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Chamigrene (
  <italic class="italic">S. propinqua</italic>). Terpenoids (sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes), accounting for 73.87–82.08% of the total compounds, were the main components. Meanwhile, the antioxidant activities of the essential oils were evaluated through three free radical scavenging assays and a reducing power assay, which were related to the contents of the individual bioactive composition. These results provide a phytochemical foundation for the use of four species, and for the further study of the identification of 
  <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species.
