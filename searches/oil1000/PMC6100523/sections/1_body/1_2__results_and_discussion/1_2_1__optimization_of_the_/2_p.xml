<p class="p">Four independent variables with three variation levels are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S2</xref> shows the experimental conditions and extraction yields for each test. The highest extraction yield was obtained in test 8 at a 1:10 ratio, 30 min, 30 Â°C, and 240 W. As laid out in the table below, the extraction yields were significantly different when we changed the operating conditions. According to the results of the analysis of variance table (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S3</xref>), we found that the effect of ultrasonic power on essential oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> was extremely significant but the effects of the other factors were not significant. The factors influenced the yield (%) of essential oils in the following order: ultrasonic power &gt; ultrasonic temperature &gt; ultrasonic time &gt; ratio of material to solvent. In confirmation tests, the content of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> by the optimum extracting technology reached 6.07%, which was the average value of the triplicate experiments.
