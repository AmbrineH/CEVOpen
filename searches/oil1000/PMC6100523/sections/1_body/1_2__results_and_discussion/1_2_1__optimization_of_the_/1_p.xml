<p class="p">It is well known that various parameters play an important role in the optimization of the experimental conditions for the development of the ultrasonic-assisted extraction method. Raw material to solvent ratio, ultrasonic time, ultrasonic temperature, and ultrasonic power are generally considered to be the most important factors that affect the yield (%) of essential oils. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01645-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the experimental results of the single-factor experiment, which is applied to better understand the effects of parameters. As shown in the graph, ultrasonic power and the raw material to solvent ratio were the most significant parameters.
