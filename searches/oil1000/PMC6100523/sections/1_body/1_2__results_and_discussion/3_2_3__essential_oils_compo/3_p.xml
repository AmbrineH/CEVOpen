<p class="p">In this study, the essential oils extracted from the fruits of four species had some identical components to those reported previously in the literature. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-cadinene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-chamigrene, and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-muurolene were also found in 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> purchased from Shanghai Pharmacy Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Muurolene, caryophyllene, and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-elemene were also the major components in 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic> purchased from Chinese medicine market, Zunyi, Guizhou, China [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, in previous studies, research into the essential oils in 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic> was not mentioned, and our study is the first to research the essential oils of two of the species.
