<p class="p">To evaluate the biodiversity of the essential oils in the four species, the identified components were classified by their chemical structure with the help of literature data and reference components [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S4</xref>, we list six chemical groups of components in the essential oils from four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic>. The four species had similar chemical groups: sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the principal components, accounting for 30.43–59.64% and 15.82–51.65%, respectively. However, there were many differences in the kinds and numbers of components between the two groups. This situation was caused by the stable genotypes and different levels of gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species. The results of our study were consistent with previous studies in that sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were major chemical groups in the 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> extracts [
