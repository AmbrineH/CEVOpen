<p class="p">The biological activities of the essential oils are related to the major components. For the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">SG,</italic> isocaryophyllene and ylangene were the dominant components. Ylangene showed significant inhibitory activities against protein—tyrosine phosphatase 1B [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Isocaryophyllene was the precursor of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, which was known for its anti-inflammatory, local anesthetic, and repellent activity against the adult form of 
 <italic class="italic">Lasioderma serricorne</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Elemol was the major component of 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic>, and as a fragrance ingredient it was used in cosmetics, fine fragrances, shampoos, toilet soaps, and other toiletries as well as in non-cosmetic products [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. There were three more prominent components of essential oils from the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>. Isospathulenol was the isomer of spathulenol, which had an immune-inhibitory effect on activated lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], longiverbenone was classified as an active toxic compound [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and the use of cedrenol had similar effects to that of elemol [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. However, the functions of the dominant components of 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic> were various: 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-muurolene was the enantiomer of (+)-
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-cadinene, which played an important role in the biosynthesis of gossypol [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and caryophyllene was a metabolite of both plants and fungi, and was also biologically active as an immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal agent [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
