 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01645-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows a comparative chromatogram of essential oils from the fruits of four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic>, and detailed components are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S4</xref>. The components of essential oils from all samples with low content (&lt;0.1%) are not listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01645" class="xref">Table S4</xref>. A total of 86 components were identified from all samples, and 16 components were shared among the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species, with different contents. The major shared components of essential oils from four species belonged to the sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-himachalene and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol. However, some components were identified only in a certain plant (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01645-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For example, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene was a characteristic component of 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Bulnesene was only found in 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic>. Longiverbenone was only identified in 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-chamigrene only in 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic>.
