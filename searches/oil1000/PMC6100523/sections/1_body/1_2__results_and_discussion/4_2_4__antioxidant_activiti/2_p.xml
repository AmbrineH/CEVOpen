<p class="p">The scavenging capacities of the essential oils from all samples on DPPH radical were much lower than VC, which achieved a maximum value of 93% when the concentration increased to 100 μg/mL. The capacity of scavenging activity on superoxide anion free radical was in the same descending order (EC
