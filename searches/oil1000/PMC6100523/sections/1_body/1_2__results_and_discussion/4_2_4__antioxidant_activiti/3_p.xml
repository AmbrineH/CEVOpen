<p class="p">The results of the reducing power assay of essential oils from the four species in comparison with VC and VE as the reference antioxidant are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01645-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The reducing ability increased with increasing oil concentrations and the value of absorbance revealed the reducing power. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01645-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the capacities of the reducing power of the essential oils were quite a bit lower than the reference antioxidant.
