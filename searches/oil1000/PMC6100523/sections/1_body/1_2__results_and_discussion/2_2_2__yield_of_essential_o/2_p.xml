<p class="p">The essential oils, which were extracted from aromatic plants, had a wide range of medicinal and industrial applications [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. According to our literature survey, many factors influenced the yields of essential oils, such as harvest time [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], developmental stage [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], different parts [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. To reduce the influences of the factors in the present study, we selected the same parts (fruits) of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species, and sampled them at the same time. Consequently, the influences of different parts, harvesting time, and technical parameters were considered negligible. In our study, the three wild 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species (
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic>) were sampled in Taibai, grown in the same environmental conditions, and 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic> were sampled in Pingli (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01645-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The differences in the yield and composition of essential oils could mainly be attributed to the genotypes of different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic>, but for 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic>, we also need to consider the effect of the environment.
