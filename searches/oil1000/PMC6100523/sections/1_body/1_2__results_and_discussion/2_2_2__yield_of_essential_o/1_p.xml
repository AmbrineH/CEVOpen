<p class="p">In this study, we examined the colors and yields (%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of essential oils from the fruits of four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic>. All the samples studied were fragrant and had different colors: milk white for 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic>, yellow for 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>, saffron yellow for 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic>, and wheat for 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic>. The yield of fruit essential oil ranged from 5.88% to 7.51% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>). The highest yield of essential oils was 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic> (7.51%), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic> (6.91%), 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> (6.11%), and 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic> (5.88%). The yields of essential oils from the fruits of four species far exceeded the yield of the essential oils from the fruits of
