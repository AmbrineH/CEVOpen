<p class="p">In this work, we investigated the chemical components and antioxidant activities of the essential oils in four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> through GC-MS and antioxidant assay. It is clear that the essential oils of all samples are mainly composed of sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, which have good biological activity. Moreover, there are obvious differences between the kinds and contents of essential oils from the fruits of four species. Meanwhile, the antioxidant activity of the essential oils is affected by the bioactive composition. The results of our study could be considered the first to provide a direct comparison of the chemical components of the essential oils for these important traditional medicines, and could provide data for the further exploitation of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species.
