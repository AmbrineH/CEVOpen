<p class="p">The free radical scavenging capacity of the essential oils was measured using the stable DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical, superoxide anion radical (pyrogallol autoxidation), and hydroxyl radical (Fenton reaction), according to the method of Blois 1958 [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], Xu et al. 2013 [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], and Harminder et al. 2010 [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], respectively. Every method was used with a slight modification. The essential oil solutions were diluted to different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 20 mg/mL) by petroleum ether. VC (Vitamin C) and VE (Vitamin E) were used as standards and were subjected to the same procedure for comparison. The capability to scavenge the free radical was calculated using the following equation: (%) = [
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − (
 <italic class="italic">A
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>
 </italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">A
  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic>)]/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> × 100, where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> was the absorbance value of the blank, 
 <italic class="italic">A
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>
 </italic> was the absorbance in the presence of the sample and the free radical, and 
 <italic class="italic">A
  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic> was the absorbance of the sample without free radical. All determinations were done in triplicate and the concentration of essential oils that reduced the absorption of free radical solution by 50% (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was obtained from a linear regression analysis.
