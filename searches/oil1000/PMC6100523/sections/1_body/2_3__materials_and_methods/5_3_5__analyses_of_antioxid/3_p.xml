<p class="p">Three milliliters of Tris-HCL buffer solution (pH 8.2) were incubated in a water bath at 25 Â°C for 20 min, and this solution was added to 2.0 mL of essential oil solutions at different concentrations. One milliliter of pyrogallol solution (70 mM) was added to the mixture. Absorbance measurements were made at 420 nm after 4 min of reaction at room temperature.</p>
