<p class="p">The reducing power of essential oils was determined by the method of Oyaizu 1986 [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], with minor modifications. An aliquot of essential oils at various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 20 mg/mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL potassium ferricyanide (1%
