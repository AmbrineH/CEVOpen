<p class="p">Through comparing the retention time (RT) and retention indices (RI) with the analysis done under the same temperature and the same chromatographic conditions, the essential oils from four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> were preliminarily identified. Further identification of components was based on matching their recorded mass spectra with those from the NIST05.LIB and NIST05s.LIB library data (National Institute of Standards and Technology) provided by the software of GC-MS data systems [
