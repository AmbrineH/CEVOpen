 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> was the dependent variable, which was calculated as the content of essential oils divided by the dried pre-treated sample weight. Nine experiments were performed in order to estimate the best conditions for the extraction of essential oils, and it was repeated three times to avoid errors.
