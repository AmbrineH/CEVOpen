<p class="p">Analyses of essential oils were carried out on a Shimadzu (Japan) GC-MS-QP 2010 system using a chromatographic column, Rtx-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness, 5% diphenyl—95% dimethyl polysiloxane) [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-01645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The oven column temperature was programmed as follows: the initial temperature was 50 °C for 2 min, then increased at a rate of 4 °C/min to 180 °C and held isothermally at 180 °C for 2 min, and finally increased to 240 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, which was maintained for 2 min. Then, 1.0 µL of the sample was injected at an injection port temperature of 230 °C. The ionizing voltage was 70 eV and the mass spectra were obtained by automatic scanning at
