<p class="p">Plant materials were collected from different regions of the Qinling Mountains (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01645-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and air-dried in the shade at room temperature. All of the samples were identified by Professor Yi Ren (Professor of Plant Taxonomy, Shaanxi Normal University) and a voucher specimen was kept in the College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University. Every species included at least 10 individuals as one sample. The fruits of all plant materials were comminuted to dried powders separately (screen size 40 meshes) in a pharmaceutical disintegrator, which was used for each extraction to determine the content of the essential oils. Each dried powder sample was extracted with petroleum ether at a designed time, temperature, power and raw material to solvent ratio through the ultrasonic-assisted extraction method [
