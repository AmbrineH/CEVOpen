Essential oils are complex mixtures of terpenoids, aromatics, esters, alcohols, and ketones obtained from plant material. The analysis of essential oils is a significant and growing area, as the components of essential oils present in plant materials are increasingly recognized to possess aromatic, antibacterial, insecticidal, and biological properties [
