<p class="p">Phytopathogenic species of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> are found in nature in the heterothallic and homothallic forms. Distinctive heterothallic strains create a fluffy and airy mycelium with colouring from white to yellow or light brown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium and occur mostly in Australia and California. In contrast, homothallic strains, which are located in Europe, including Poland, and the eastern part of the United States, create a sparser airy mycelium of pink carmine colour with a shade of yellow [

 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> genus to essential oils may already vary within the species and may depend on both the strain and the chemical composition, as well as on the concentration of essential oils. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the active substance contained in the raw material decides the biological activity and efficacy of essential oils [
