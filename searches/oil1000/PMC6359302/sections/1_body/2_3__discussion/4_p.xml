<p class="p">Other tested oils showed the desired effect at higher concentrations. The highest biocidal activity of the rosemary oil on the studied strains (
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 and 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 339) was observed for a concentration higher than 0.5%. The fungicidal properties of rosemary oil with respect to 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> are confirmed by the studies of Dimitra et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and Surviliené et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Dimitra et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] suggested that borneol, not eucalyptol (the major component of this oil), is likely to be responsible for its fungistatic activity. However, Ćosić et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] have shown that rosemary oil, as well as cinnamon, sage, pine, bitter orange, anise, cumin and lavender oils, did not inhibit the growth of an 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> strain. Only a strong biocidal effect in relation to this fungus was observed in thyme oil, and a weak one in peppermint oil. It is likely that the obtained results depended on the methods used, the concentrations of essential oils and the form of the occurring strains (heterothallic and homothallic).
