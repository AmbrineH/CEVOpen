<p class="p">In our studies, we found that all tested essential oils had fungicidal activity, including the total inhibition of mycelial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 and 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 339, regardless of the concentration of the used geranium and rosewood oil. A high fungistatic activity of these oils was also exhibited by other researchers [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00311" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These oils worked similarly despite clear differences in their chemical composition. The active substances of geranium oil are citronellol and geraniol, while linalool is active in rosewood oil. For this reason, they can be the basis for constructing biofungicides.
