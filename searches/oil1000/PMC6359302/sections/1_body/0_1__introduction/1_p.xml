<p class="p">In Poland, since January 2014, there has been an obligation to apply the principles of integrated cropping systems in agriculture, resulting from the provisions of Art. 14 of Directive 2009/128/EC and Regulation No. 1107/2009. These principles involve a reduction in the consumption of chemical pesticides and fertilisers. Instead, appropriate agricultural practices, organic fertilisation, and biological methods, which use microbial activity as well as biologically active substances, should be applied.</p>
