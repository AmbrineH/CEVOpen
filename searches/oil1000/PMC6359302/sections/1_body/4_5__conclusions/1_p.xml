<p class="p">The growth index of 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 and 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 339 varied and depended on the used oil and its concentration. The highest fungicidal activity with respect to both 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> strains, regardless of the concentration, was shown by the geranium oil and the rosewood oil, which contain about 88â€“97% monoterpenoids. The development of the 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 strain was inhibited by the rosemary and lemon oils at concentrations from 0.5% to 2.0%, and 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 339 by a 1.0% concentration of lemon oil. All tested oils, compared to the control, reduced the rate of mycelial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> and showed fungistatic activity.
