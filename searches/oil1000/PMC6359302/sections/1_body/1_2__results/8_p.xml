<p class="p">In contrast, the index of linear growth of the test strains in the presence of lemon oil varied and depended on the concentration used. The oil at a concentration of 0.125% showed little effect on the inhibition of linear growth of the tested fungi. The increase of lemon oil concentration, depending on the strains, inhibited the growth of these fungi in different ways. The development of the mycelium
