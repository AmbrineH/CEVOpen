 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00311-f0A4" class="xref">Figure A4</xref>. The rosemary and geranium oils contained mainly monoterpenoid (over 96% and over 88%, respectively), whereas lemon oil contained mainly monoterpenes (less than 86%) and only 13.8% monoterpenoids. The most varied in terms of chemical composition turned out to be rosemary oil, which contained both monoterpenoids (52.8%) and monoterpenes (35.3%) as well as sesquiterpenes (11.5%).
