 <p class="p">The aim of the study was to determine the chemical composition of lemon, rosewood, geranium and rosemary oils, and compare their effect on the sensitivity of 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 and 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> ZALF 339 isolated from infected cereals. The tested oils were added to Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium at concentrations of 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%. The activity of the oils on inhibition of the linear growth of mycelium was evaluated by measuring the growth of fungal colonies (growth index), while the fungistatic activity was evaluated on the basis of the percentage growth inhibition of a fungal colony and calculated according to Abbottâ€™s formula. The sensitivity of the test strains was variable and depended on the type and concentration of the tested oils. Geranium and rosewood oils in all of the concentrations completely inhibited the growth of the used isolates. In contrast, lemon oil relative to 
  <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 339 showed the highest activity at a concentration of 1.0% and rosemary oil, 0.5%. The highest activity against 
  <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> ZALF 24 was shown by the oils of rosemary and lemon at concentrations from 1.0% to 2.0%. The susceptibility of 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> isolates was differentiated and depended on the type and concentration of tested oils.
