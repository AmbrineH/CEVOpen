 <p class="p">The strawberry is a fruit appreciated in the food industry for its high content of bioactive compounds. However, it is considered a highly perishable fruit, generally attacked by pests of phytopathogenic origin, which decreases its shelf-life. Normally, to diminish the losses caused by pathogenic microbes, coatings of polysaccharides in combination with natural products like essential oils are applied. In this work, we describe the effect of edible coatings from chitosan (CT) incorporating 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> essential oil (TCEO), applied to strawberries stored under refrigeration conditions (5 ± 0.5 °C). Different concentrations of TCEO were applied to chitosan coatings, with different effects on the physical and microbiological properties of the strawberries. All the products had greater acceptance and quality than the controls, being more effective those with essential oil incorporation. It is noteworthy that all the essential oil treatments lead to an increase in the shelf-life of strawberries of up to 15 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the microstructure showed a decrease in compactness with TCEO introduction, but without compromising food preservation after 15 days. In addition, treated strawberries delayed the loss of physicochemical and antioxidant properties, due to protection against the microbial development of aerobic mesophylls, molds, and yeasts.
