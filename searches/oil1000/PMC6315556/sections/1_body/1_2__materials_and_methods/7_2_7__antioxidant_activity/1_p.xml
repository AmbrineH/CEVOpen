<p class="p">To evaluate the evolution of the antioxidant activity of the strawberry treatments during a period of time of 15 days, the methods of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (during 30 min of reaction) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (during 7 min of reaction) were evaluated on days 0, 5, 10, and 15 of cold storage. These methods analyze the ability to trap radicals after treatment with coatings applied to strawberries (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%). For the preparation of strawberry extracts, samples of 2.5 mg in 10 mL of methanol were homogenized. The homogenate was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered on Whatman paper No. 1 [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. With the obtained extract, the samples were prepared, in which 5, 10, 20, 40, and 70 μL of the solution were taken and mixed with absolute methanol until 1 mL was completed.
