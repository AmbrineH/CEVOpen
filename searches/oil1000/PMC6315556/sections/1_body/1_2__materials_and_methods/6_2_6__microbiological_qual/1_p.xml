<p class="p">These analyzes were carried out in duplicate, for the count of aerobic mesophylls, molds, and yeasts, on days 0, 5, 10, and 15 of the treatments. During these days, strawberries of approximately 10 g of mass were taken; subsequently, they were homogenized for 10 min in 90 mL of peptonized water. The homogenate was serially diluted from 10–1 to 10–6, and after that 1 mL of each solution was poured into plates on the surface of the medium containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) with 10% tartaric acid (p/v) for the test of molds and yeasts, and Plate Count Agar (PCA) for aerobic mesophyll, and was grown for a period of 3 days.</p>
