<p class="p">The strawberries were submerged in each of the treatments for 120 s, corresponding to T1 = CT, T2 = CT + 0.5% TCEO, T3 = CT + 1.0% of TCEO, T4 = CT + 1.5% TCEO, and T5 = control. Subsequently, they were air-dried for one hour at 23 °C. After the coating process was completed, the strawberries were packed in polyethylene terephthalate boxes (15 fruits/box) and refrigerated at 5 °C ± 0.5 °C for 15 days [
