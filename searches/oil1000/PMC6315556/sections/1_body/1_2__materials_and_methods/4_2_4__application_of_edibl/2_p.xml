<p class="p">A full factorial design with two manipulated variables, type of treatment and time of storage, was employed in this work. Five treatments were employed in all the experiments, but the number of levels of the time of storage was different for each response variable: for physicochemical variables (pH, total soluble solids, acidity, maturation index, weight loss, and decay index) there were eight levels, except for respiration rate, for which four levels were studied; for microbiological variables (count of aerobic mesophylls, and molds and yeasts) there were four levels; for antioxidant activity, four levels; and for sensorial analysis, two time levels. All tests were run in duplicate.</p>
