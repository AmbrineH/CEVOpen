<p class="p">The antimicrobial coatings were prepared according to the procedure reported by [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], which consisted of adding a specific amount of chitosan (CT) (degree of deacetylation = 85%; Mw = 190.000â€“310.000 Da, Sigma Milwaukee, WI, USA) to a 1% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) solution of acetic acid to obtain a final concentration of 2% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), with constant agitation. Subsequently, glycerol (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was added at a level of 0.75 mL/g of chitosan as a plasticizer and stirred for 30 min. Then, 0.2% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, with respect to the volume of essential oil) of Tween 80 (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was added as an emulsifier to the above solution. After one hour, TCEO (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was added to the mixture, to reach the final concentration required (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, with respect to the chitosan solution), and stirred using an IKA T25-Digital Ultraturrax (Staufen, Germany) at 7000 rpm until homogeneity of the dispersion was obtained. The CT-TCEO solution was left standing for 24 h until gas bubbles were not observed.
