<p class="p">Essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> was acquired from Sigma, and its composition was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) according to the methodology reported by [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Briefly, the composition was determined on an AT 6890 Series plus gas chromatography spectrometer, with a mass selective detector (full scan). The analysis was carried out using a DB-5MS fused silica capillary column. The temperature program was 60 °C for 10 min, then heating at 5 °C/min to 250 °C, and maintained for 10 min. Other operating conditions were the following: helium (99.99%) as the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min; injection volume of 2:1 and split ratio 1:30; and on the other side, 0.1 μL of the samples were injected manually in split mode. The identification of the components was performed using electron ionization (EI, 70 eV), with a mass range from

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 50–550. The constituents were identified by comparing their RI (retention index) with those provided in the literature and comparing the mass spectra with those recorded by Adams database (Wiley, 138 and NIST05, for Agilent, Santa Clara, California, USA).
