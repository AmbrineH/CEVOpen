<p class="p">To test the cross-sectional area of the films, they were fractured by immersion in liquid nitrogen and then placed on the sample holder and surface coated with a layer of gold on Denton Vacuum Model Desk IV equipment, to produce a conductive surface. Subsequently, the JEOL Model JSM 6490 LV microscope was used in secondary electron mode by an acceleration voltage of 20 KV. The micrographs of the cross-section were analyzed by SEM at 1000 × and 150× magnification, respectively. </p>
