<p class="p">Apparent viscosity measurements were run according to the “Gardner methodology” [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Standard tubes with different viscosities were compared with the sample. One test tube was filled with the dispersions. The sample and standard tubes (Cat. No. VG-9100) were placed in a holder. The support was turned over, and it was observed which of the standard tubes coincided better with the bubble rise-time of the test tube containing the sample.
