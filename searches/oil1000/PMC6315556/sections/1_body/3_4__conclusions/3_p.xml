<p class="p">The treatments CT-TCEO positively impacted the physicochemical composition of the fruit, so that they comply with the attributes established by NTC 4103. Besides, they can delay the microbial development of aerobic mesophylls, molds, and yeasts, in comparison with samples without treatment or treated only with chitosan by one logarithmic unit. All these observations demonstrated a positive effect in decreasing the microbial population and extending the shelf-life of strawberries. The treatment with the highest content of TCEO (T4) was the most effective; however, at a sensory level, the coating did not have acceptance due to the strange flavors that conferred to strawberry fruits, implicating future investigation to encapsulate or mask the taste of oil.</p>
