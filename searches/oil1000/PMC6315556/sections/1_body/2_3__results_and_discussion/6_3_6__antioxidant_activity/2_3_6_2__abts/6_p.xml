<p class="p">Usually, in ABTS and DPPH methods, colored persistent radicals are used as probes. They are reduced by the antioxidant, and the color change in the solution is measured by UV−vis spectrophotometry. However, these tests use probes that are chemically very different from the radicals responsible for the autoxidation of real systems. The result indicates a “radical trapping power” rather than true antioxidant activity [
