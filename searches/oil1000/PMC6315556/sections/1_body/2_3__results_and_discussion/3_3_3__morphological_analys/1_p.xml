<p class="p">From the cross-section analysis of pure chitosan control films (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-08-00155-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A,B), it can be observed that they are homogeneous, thin, and continuous, without porous defects or ruptures. The films incorporated with TCEO presented lower homogeneity in the structure, with the presence of porosity, in a sponge structure, presumably caused by the evaporation of the oil and accompanied by an increase in the roughness of the structure (C-H). With the increase of the essential oil content, an increase in the appearance of holes and defects in the microstructure was found, although the films continued to be resistant without loss of functionality. It is known that the loss of the structure of the films with incorporated TCEO is due to the essential oil components that interrupt the association of the chitosan chains between them, due to their hydrophobic nature, which is generated during the evaporation gaps between polymer chains. Similar results were observed in previous studies [
