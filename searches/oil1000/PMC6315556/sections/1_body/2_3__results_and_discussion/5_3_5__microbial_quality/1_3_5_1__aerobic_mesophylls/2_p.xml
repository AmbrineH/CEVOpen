<p class="p">The statistical analysis indicated that there are significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in relation to the parameter of aerobic mesophylls in the storage time and between the treatments applied in strawberry. It can be observed that all coatings from chitosan (CT) incorporating essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> (TCEO) showed an increase in only one logarithmic unit of the total mesoaerobic population (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) compared to the control, in which these counts increased two logarithmic units. This could be the result of synergy generated by the combination of essential oil and chitosan, mainly due to the presence of terpenoid compounds that could have an antibacterial effect such as carvacrol, thymol, linalool, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene, β-myrcene, and trans-β-caryophyllene. In general, chitosan by itself is capable of reducing microbial growth.
