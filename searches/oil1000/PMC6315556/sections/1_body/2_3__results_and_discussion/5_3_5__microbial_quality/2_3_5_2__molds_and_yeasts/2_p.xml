<p class="p">The statistical analysis indicated that there are significant differences (

 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> was of only one logarithmic unit; on the contrary, in the control treatment, this increase was of two logarithmic units. Different studies have shown that films and coatings based on chitosan and essential oils improved fruit quality and shelf-life due to the inhibitory properties of essential oils against pathogenic, food-related fungi [

In fruit-life studies, the aim is to maintain the population of molds and yeasts below values of 7 log CFU/g, as was achieved with the treatments used here throughout 15 days of testing. However, in the production and supply chain, many factors influence the concentration of the initial microbiota, which is why this methodology is useful if it is applied in the early stages of fruit harvesting.
