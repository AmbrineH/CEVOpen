<p class="p">Statistical analysis indicates significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) changes in pH with treatments and storage time. Compared to the control, the pH of fruits coated with TCEO, [T2 (3.53 to 3.69), T3 (3.54 to 3.67), and T4 (3.55 to 3.67)] presented significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-08-00155-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, it can be observed that treatments with TCEO delay the pH increment, and this effect is more pronounced as the TCEO content increases. The final result is the extension of the shelf-life of strawberries and the diminishment of the effect of the maturation of the fruit through the consumption of organic acids.
