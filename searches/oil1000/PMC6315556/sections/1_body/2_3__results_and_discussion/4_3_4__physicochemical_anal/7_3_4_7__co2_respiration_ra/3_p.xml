<p class="p">Coatings are typically applied over the fresh fruits and vegetable surfaces, for slowing down respiration, preventing the loss of food aroma and flavor compounds, and delaying the ripening process. However, the modification of the internal atmosphere by the use of coatings can develop ethanol and alcoholic flavors as a result of anaerobic fermentation associated with excessively high carbon dioxide or excessively low oxygen concentrations [
 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. For that reason, it is necessary to control the ethanol production or alcoholic flavors in sensorial panels. In our case, no alcoholic flavors were perceived by the panel.
