<p class="p">The statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in relation to the respiration rate between fruits with treatments, but not with time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> â‰¥ 0.05). Among all the treatments designated, CT-TCEO 1.5% showed the best barrier properties against the evolution of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which could be related to lower weight loss and lower fruit-decay, as previously shown. The results indicate that the use of essential oil in the coatings caused a progressive reduction of the respiration rate. This is similar to the chitosan treatments with lemon essential oil, which decreased the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> generation compared to the pure chitosan coating after 12 days of storage. As previously observed, the obtained results suggest that CT reduces the gas permeability in the fruit surface, thus affecting the gas exchange during fruit respiration, but with the introduction of the essential oil content, the barrier effect also increased. However, the introduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> in the coatings might be affecting the metabolic pattern of strawberries, an effect that is also observed in the increasing of the maturation index, pH, and solid soluble content, affecting the respiration of the fruits [
