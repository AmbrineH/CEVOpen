<p class="p">Decay index in strawberry fruit increased during storage time for all treatments, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-08-00155-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. The statistical analysis indicates significant changes (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the percentage of decay during storage time and treatments. The decay index in coating fruits after 15 days was lower than that in control: 14.17% for T1, 5.83% for T2, 7.50% for T3, 9.17% for T4, and 45.0% for T5, respectively. The coatings were more efficient at preserving the quality of strawberries for 15 days, since the decomposition decreased in comparison with the untreated samples (

It should be noticed that the treatments with TCEO were the most efficient at reducing the fungal decomposition (35% to 39%) and could be considered an effective antifungal of the species that causes the deterioration of the strawberries in refrigeration. The growth of fungi on the surface of the strawberries under refrigeration conditions decreased the number of purchases by consumers, and the edible coatings used here allowed one to increase the shelf life in refrigeration conditions. This result is in accordance with expectations, considering that one of the functions of edible coatings is to act as a barrier between the fruit and the environment, which retards external microbial growth.
