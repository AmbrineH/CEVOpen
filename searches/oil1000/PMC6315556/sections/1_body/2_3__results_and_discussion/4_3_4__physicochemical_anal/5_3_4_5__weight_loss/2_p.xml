<p class="p">The statistical analysis shows significant differences (

The coating application of chitosan and CT-TCEO shows a reduction in the weight loss percentage. Notably, on day 15 the treatment that showed better behavior was T3, with a weight loss of 0.14%. Commonly, it is believed that the environment migration of water from the fruit to the environment is the main cause of the weight loss of the fruit. A careful observation of

 <xref rid="B63-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] demonstrated that until day 9, the samples that lost less weight were those that included more essential oil (only 1.5%, since 1.0%, and 0.5% remain almost in the same value). However, after that day, treatments with 1.0% and 1.5% seemed to lose more weight, presumably due to the excess of the essential oil that could volatilize after longer periods of time, when the strawberries texture and molecular structure could change, due to the high volatility of the TCEO. This fact has also been observed before by [
