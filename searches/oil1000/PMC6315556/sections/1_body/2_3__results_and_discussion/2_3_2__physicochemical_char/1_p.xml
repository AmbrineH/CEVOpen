<p class="p">The percentage of total solids (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-08-00155-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) accounts for the fraction of the sample that does not evaporate at 105 Â°C, which is mainly constituted by the polymeric matrix and essential oil. The coatings that presented the highest total solid contents were those with 1.5% of TCEO, as expected, since a 2% solution of chitosan and 1.5% of essential oil should account for 3.5% of theoretical solids, which corresponds with the value measured (3.27%), suggesting that most of the oil components were retained in the polymer matrix during the analysis.
