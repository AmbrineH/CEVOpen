<p class="p">The analysis of the particle size offers a parameter related to the stability of the emulsion, since a smaller particle size implies greater stability, because it increases the barrier properties of the coatings against moisture and gases [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]; therefore, it is expected that all the solution of essential oil presents good stability based on the particle size and that no separations were observed between the preparation and the time taken to use it for the coating experiments.
