<p class="p">On the other hand, the incorporation of the essential oil had a substantial effect on the apparent viscosity of the emulsions. The apparent viscosity decreases when the percentage of the essential oil increases. This behavior can be explained by considering two opposite effects: the increase in the concentration of the dispersed phase (oil) tends to increase the apparent viscosity of the system, while the adsorption of the polymer on the droplet surface induces a decrease of its effective thickening concentration in the aqueous phase [
