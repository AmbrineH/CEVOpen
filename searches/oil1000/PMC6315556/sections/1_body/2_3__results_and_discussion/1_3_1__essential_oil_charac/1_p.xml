<p class="p">During the GC-MS analysis of the essential oil, 25 compounds were identified (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-08-00155-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The compounds corresponded to 23 monoterpenes (99.7%), a sesquiterpene (0.2%), and an unidentified compound corresponding to the remaining percentage. In several papers, it has been reported that the monoterpenes exert antimicrobial, antiviral [

 <xref rid="B57-biomolecules-08-00155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. However, a sesquiterpene was also present in the essential oil and could be responsible for the biological activities. In addition, some investigations have been published on essential oils that provide sesquiterpenes as their main components [
