<p class="p">Another technology employed to reduce the postharvest decay of fruit is the use of the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) chemicals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): peracetic acid, K-sorb, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium salts. However, despite good results at the lab-scale level, these chemicals lack large-scale application, since they have low persistence and inconsistent activity [

Another treatment to reduce the postharvest decay of fruits is the application of electrolyzed water using sodium chloride as an electrolyte, to generate chlorine in situ as a sanitizer. The production of organic chlorinated compounds, such as chloramine, dichloramine, and trichloromethanes, is also reported, together with several drawbacks and concerns from consumers [
