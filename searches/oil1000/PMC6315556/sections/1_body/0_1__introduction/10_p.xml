A study combining cold storage and chitosan treatments to increase the postharvest quality of fruit was also reported. The authors concluded that chitosan-coated fruit exhibited a slower rate of deterioration compared to uncoated fruit in all tested cultivars, based on the antioxidant enzymatic responses from strawberries [
