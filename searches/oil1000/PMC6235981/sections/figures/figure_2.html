 <p> Extracellular matrixes of the membrane-attached biofilms. Cyan and Yellow indicate polysaccharides and lipids probed by ConA-FITC and FM4-64, respectively. Gray indicates the physical body reflected by light. The panels show the biofilms formed in RO system to treat the MBR effluent of the SWW ( A– D) and heavy oil-containing SWW ( E– H). The fluorescent images of same region are also shown ( B, D, F, H). At least 6 microscopic images at random points were taken per a sample and the representative images are shown. </p>
