 <p> Comparison and compositional changes of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. ( A) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) scatter plot of 16S rRNA genes obtained from Illumina sequencing. The weighted UniFrac distances were calculated based on an equal number (n = 25,894) of sequences. Open and closed circles indicate the microbiomes of feed water collected on 0.22-µm and 0.05-µm filters, respectively. The closed diamonds indicate the membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. The blue and red colors of symbols show those for the MBR effluents of the SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, respectively. ( B) Class-level distribution of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. The relative abundances of each bacterial class are shown. All data were based on the average of 3 replicates. </p>
