 <p> The three-dimensional structures of membrane-attached biofilms. The gray areas indicate the physical body reflected by light, while green and red indicate living and dead microbial cells, respectively. The panels show the biofilms formed in RO system to treat the MBR effluents of the SWW ( A– D) and heavy oil-containing SWW ( E– H). The fluorescent images of same region are also shown ( B, D, F, H). At least 6 microscopic images at random points were taken per a sample and the representative images are shown. </p>
