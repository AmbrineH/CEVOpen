  <p class="p">Comparison and compositional changes of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) scatter plot of 16S rRNA genes obtained from Illumina sequencing. The weighted UniFrac distances were calculated based on an equal number (n = 25,894) of sequences. Open and closed circles indicate the microbiomes of feed water collected on 0.22-µm and 0.05-µm filters, respectively. The closed diamonds indicate the membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. The blue and red colors of symbols show those for the MBR effluents of the SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Class-level distribution of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes. The relative abundances of each bacterial class are shown. All data were based on the average of 3 replicates.
