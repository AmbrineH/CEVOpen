 <p> Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) spectra of the feed water and membrane attached-biofilms. The small letters indicate the main peaks. The panels show the spectra of the feed water ( A, B) and membrane-attached biofilms ( Câ€“ F). The measurements of each samples were performed 3 times and the representative spectra are shown. </p>
