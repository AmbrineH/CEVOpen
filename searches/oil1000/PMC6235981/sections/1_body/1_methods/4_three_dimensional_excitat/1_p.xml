<p id="Par8" class="p">Three milliliter of feed water and 200-mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> piece of fouled RO membranes were analyzed by three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy. The measurement of each sample were performed three times and the representative spectrum is shown. The RO membranes were immersed in 0.1 M citric acid or NaOH solution (pH 12.0) for 24 hours to extract foulants, and then the citric-acid extract and neutralized NaOH extract were centrifuged to separate the solid and liquid fractions. The supernatants of the acid and alkali extracts were subjected to the spectroscopy. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrixes (3D-EEMs) of the feed water and foulants were obtained using a spectrofluorometer (AquaLog; Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) with a 10 mm quartz cell. The details of 3D-EEM measurement using AquaLog was described in a technical report of Horiba Jobin Yvon

 </sup>. Briefly, the experimental set up of 3D-EEM measurement is as follows: integration time 0.5 sec, 220–800 nm excitation spectra at 3 nm increments, 245.21–827.61 nm emission spectra, 8-pixel (4.6 nm) emission increment and medium CCD gain. The Raman scatter influences were eliminated by subtracting the EEM of ultrapure water (18.2 Ωcm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) from that of the samples. To reduce scatter from the water Raman peak, all EEMs were corrected through the blank (ultrapure water) subtraction according to the emission and excitation correction factors provided by the manufacturer. The signal intensities in regions where first and second order Rayleigh scattering appeared were also nullified by the AquaLog software (Horiba). The primary and secondary inner filter effects were corrected using the UV-vis absorbance spectra.
