<p id="Par9" class="p">In order to collect the planktonic microorganisms being present in the feed water of RO system, the feed water was filtered through nitrocellulose membranes with pore sizes of 0.22 and 0.05 µm (MF-millipore, Merck). In each collection, 0.7 to 1.0 L of the feed water was filtered, and the membrane was subjected to DNA extraction. For the fouled RO membrane, approximately 100-mm

Total DNA was extracted from the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm samples according to a direct-lysis protocol that included bead-beating

 </sup>. Briefly, the PCR products were purified with an AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and then with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). The concentrations of purified PCR products were quantified with a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and a NanoDrop 3300 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An appropriate amount of the purified fragment and an internal control (PhiX Control V3; Illumina, CA, USA) was subjected to paired-end sequencing with a 300-cycle MiSeq reagent kit (Illumina) and a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). The removal of the PhiX control, chimeric and low-quality (Q &lt; 30) sequences and the assembling of the paired-end reads were performed following the procedure reported previously

Alpha-diversity indices (i.e., Chao1, Shannon and Simpson reciprocal) and the weighted UniFrac distances for the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were calculated based on an equal number (n = 25,894) of sequences using the QIIME software
