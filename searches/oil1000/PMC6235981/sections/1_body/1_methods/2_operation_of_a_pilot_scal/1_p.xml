<p id="Par6" class="p">A pilot-scale RO system (Membrane master RUW-5CH; Nitto Denko Matex, Aichi, Japan) with a membrane module (Nitto denko, Osaka, Japan) equipping spiral membrane element (LFC3-LD-D2, Nitto denko) was operated. The membrane element was made by composite polyamide, and the membrane active area was 37.1 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The schematic view of RO system is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The system was assembled with unused and/or clean parts, although the whole system was not sterilized. There is a possibility that some of microorganisms inhabited the component parts of system. Each operation was started with an outflow rate of 0.165 L/min. In order to accelerate the RO membrane fouling, the brine water was returned to the feed water storage tank. The RO membrane treatment continued until the amount of outflow fell below the set value and the decreased outflow rate did not recover by the increase in pump pressure. The ammonium ion (NH

 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) concentrations, in addition to the TOC concentration, of the feed and RO treated waters were monitored throughout the operation by a capillary electrophoresis system (CE; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Furthermore, the concentrations of sulfate ion (SO

 <sup class="sup">2−</sup>) and chloride ion (Cl
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) of the feed water were determined at the start and end points of the operation by the capillary electrophoresis system, while those of sodium, magnesium and calcium were determined at the same time points by an inductive coupled plasma spectrometer (SPS 3000S, Seiko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrations of salts in the feed water are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The salinity levels of the feed water were similar as those of brackish water (0.05–3%). At the end of the operation, the fouled RO membrane element was dismounted from the membrane module and stored at 4 °C before the microscopic observation, fluorescence spectroscopy and high-throughput sequencing.
