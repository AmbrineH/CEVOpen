 </sup>. Briefly, the pilot scale (230-L) MBRs were started up with an inoculum of activated sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Kinu aqua-station, Ibaraki, Japan). The flow rates of both the SWW input and effluent output were 115 L/day, resulting in the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days. The excess sludge was not produced and MLSS showed ranges of 5,100–8,000 and 6,450–12,300 mg/L during the treatments of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, respectively. An SWW with the following composition was fed continuously to the reactor: CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COONa (2.65 g/L), NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Cl (0.376 g/L), KH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (0.109 g/L), peptone (0.706 g/L), FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> 6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (0.782 mg/L), CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1.56 mg/L), MgSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (1.56 mg/L), KCl (1.56 mg/L) and NaCl (1.56 mg/L). As for the heavy oil-containing SWW treatment, a commercially available heavy oil (Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) number K2205) was added at a flowing rate of 2.3 g/day using a syringe pump (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, US). The amounts of the residual organic compounds in the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW were measured. Briefly, the total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in the MBR effluents were analyzed using a TOC analyzer (TOC-L; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The average TOC concentrations of the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW during the RO system operation showed 11.3 and 20.7 mg/L, respectively, indicating the organic carbon was effectively removed during the MBR treatment. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that some of microorganisms passed through the MF membrane (pore size: 0.07 μm) installed in the MBR. Each MBR effluent was stored in a tank at room temperature, which suggested the potential that the passing and indigenous microorganisms grew during the storage. The MBR effluents were used as the feed water of RO system.
