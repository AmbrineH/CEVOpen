<p id="Par4" class="p">The objective in this study was to investigate the microbiomes and chemical components of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm in a pilot-scale RO system. Before the RO membrane treatment, the synthesized wastewater (SWW) and heavy oil-containing SWW were treated by MBR and the resultant effluents served as the feed water of RO system. A combined approach of microscopy, spectroscopy and high-throughput sequencing was firstly implemented to better understand the microbiological and chemical mechanisms of RO membrane fouling. The three-dimensional structure and component of the membrane-attached biofilm were clarified by non-destructive confocal reflection microscopy. The types of chemical components were identified by excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, the feed water microbiome and the membrane-attached biofilm microbiome revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were directly compared to identify the microorganisms associated with membrane fouling of RO system.</p>
