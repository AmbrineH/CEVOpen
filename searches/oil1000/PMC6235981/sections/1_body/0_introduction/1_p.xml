<p id="Par2" class="p">Wastewater reclamation is one of the most common and serious issues in the world. A dual-membrane treatment system combining the microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF) membrane and the reverse osmosis (RO) membrane is a wastewater reclamation technology that attracts attention due to its high treatment efficiency and high economic benefit
