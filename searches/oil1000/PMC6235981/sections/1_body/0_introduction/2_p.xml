 </sup>. A causative factor of membrane fouling is the biocake build-up or biofilm formation. A laboratory experiment using model bacteria showed that biofilm formation on RO membrane caused the decrease in the RO permeate flux

 </sup>. The specific localization and proliferation of microorganisms on RO membrane should be one criterion for their involvement in membrane fouling. Thus, direct comparison of microbiomes of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm in RO system allows the identification of the membrane fouling-causing microorganisms.
