<p id="Par18" class="p">A class-level phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data was performed to determine the microbiome compositions of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref>). For the MBR effluent of SWW, the classes 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacteriia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">α-</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">β-</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">γ-Proteobacteira</italic> were the main members of the feed water microbiomes collected with the 0.22- and 0.05-µm filters. For the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW, the class 
 <italic class="italic">γ-Proteobacteria</italic> was the most abundant, accounting for more than half of the total, in the 0.22- and 0.05-µm filter-collected feed water microbiomes. The class 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteriia</italic> was more abundant than that for SWW. Nevertheless, the feed water microbiomes were similar for both the MBR effluents, and the cell size separation apparently not affected the microbiome compositions. Concerning the membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes, for both the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, the class 
 <italic class="italic">α-Proteobacteria</italic> was the most abundant member, accounting for more than 40% of the total. The abundances of the class 
 <italic class="italic">γ-Proteobacteria</italic> was much smaller than those of the feed water microbiome. Moreover, especially for the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW, the class 
 <italic class="italic">β-Proteobacteria</italic> showed higher relative abundances in the biofilm microbiome than in the feed water microbiome. The compositions of the feed water and biofilm microbiomes were notably different, and the high dominances of 
 <italic class="italic">α-</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">β-Proteobacteria</italic> of the biofilm microbiomes suggested their significant contribution to membrane fouling of RO system.
