<p id="Par10" class="p">Physicochemical profiles of the feed water and RO membrane-treated water are shown in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>. At the beginning of the operation of RO system, the TOC concentrations of the RO membrane-treated water showed 5.5 mg/L for the MBR effluent of SWW and 9.0 mg/L for the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW. In order to facilitate the membrane fouling, the brine water of the RO treatment was recirculated to the feed water storage tank. Due to this reason, the concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in the feed water increased with time. The changes in operating pressure during the RO treatment are also shown in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>. At the final phase of each operation, the flow rates of the RO membrane-treated water were not recovered by increasing the inlet pressure. Simultaneously with the decrease in the treated water volume, the diminished quality of the treated water was observed, indicating that the serious fouling occurred in RO system.
