<p id="Par12" class="p">On the other hand, employing the MBR effluent of the heavy oil-containing SWW as the feed water, both of living and dead microbial cells were observed in the biofilm, and their amounts were much larger than those in the biofilm for SWW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1E–H</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In this regard, the lipid signals possibly derived from microbial cells showed higher amounts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2E–H</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The extracellular polysaccharides showed lower amounts compared to that for SWW, but still, they were one of the main components of the biofilm, whereas the proteins were detected at the similarly high levels for SWW (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Consequently, the results of microscopic visualization indicated that the accumulation of living microbial cells and microbially produced substances, especially polysaccharides and proteins, on RO membrane was the primary factor for the decreases in the quality and quantity of the RO membrane-treated water and the incidence of membrane fouling in RO system.
