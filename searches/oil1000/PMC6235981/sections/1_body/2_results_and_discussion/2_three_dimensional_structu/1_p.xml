<p id="Par11" class="p">The CRM was applied for non-destructive visualization of the biofilm formed on the fouled RO membrane. When the MBR effluent of SWW was used as the feed water, the SYTO9 and PI staining and quantitative image analysis indicated that most of microbial cells on RO membrane were alive (living cell rate; 81.6 ± 11.7%), but the major part of the biofilm was non-cell region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A–D</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Subsequently, the ConA-FITC and FM4-64 imaging showed that the non-cell region was mainly composed of polysaccharides, whereas lipids were rather small constituent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B,D</xref>). The FM4-64 dye is a probe for the selective detection of lipid bilayer (plasma membrane) of microbial cells. Its signals mostly overlap with signals of the SYTO9 dye (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B,D</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B,D</xref>) and the amounts of the lipids and microbial cells were comparable (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Therefore, the lipid signals observed in the biofilm was most likely originated from microbial cells. The SYPRO Ruby dye imaging further indicated that proteins colonized highly in the biofilms (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). This dye generally does not stain microbial cells, thus the extracellular proteins also accumulated on the membranes, contributing to the membrane fouling.
