<p id="Par13" class="p">EEM fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted to investigate what kinds of chemical compounds were present in the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm of the system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In the feed water including MBR effluents, six main peaks were observed. Peak a (Ex/Em of 300–375/375–450 nm) and peak b (Ex/Em of 225–250/370–425 nm) appeared in the MBR effluent of SWW. It has been reported that the peaks a and b were estimated to be humic and fulvic acid-like substances, respectively

 </sup>. In the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW, there found to be peaks at the Ex/Em wavelengthes of 300–375/380–460 nm (designated peak c), 250–300/300–350 nm (peak d), 275–300/380–450 nm (peak e) and 225–240/330–370 nm (peak f). The peaks c and e were reported to belong to the humic acid-like and marine humic acid-like fractions, respectively
