<p id="Par14" class="p">Meanwhile, it is vital to point out the specific appearance of some peaks only in the membrane-attached biofilms not in the feed water. In the membrane-attached biofilm for the MBR effluent of SWW, peak g was found at the Ex/Em wavelength of 260–280/310–330 nm, which was estimated to be the tryptophan protein-like substance

 </sup>. Peak h (Ex/Em 290–325/380–425 nm) and peak i (Ex/Em 225–250/325–400 nm) were appeared specifically in the biofilm for the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW. It has been reported that the peak h was defined as marine humic acid-like substance and peak i was defined as aromatic protein-like or hydrophobic acid-like substance

 </sup>. Remarkably, the 3D-EEM spectral analysis showed that the humic and/or fulvic acid-like substances (i.e., the peaks a, b and h) existed abundantly in the membrane-attached biofilms. Humic and fulvic acids are the polymeric substances containing sugar moieties and their accumulation is known to provoke membrane fouling in membrane filtration processes

 </sup>. Moreover, the number of detected peaks was larger in the biofilm of heavy oil-containing SWW than that of SWW. It has been previously reported that the presence of oils and their degradative intermediates caused the loss of membrane flux and the severe fouling of membrane filtration processes

 </sup>. The spectroscopic result is consistent with the microscopic result, i.e., the primary presence of the ConA-FITC signals that could represent the sugar moieties of humic and fulvic acids, as well as polysaccharides, in the biofilms. In addition, the fluorescence spectroscopy detected protein-like substances (e.g., the peaks g and i) from the biofilms, which is also agreed with the microscopic result (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). These results certified the effectiveness of a complementary use of the microscopic and spectroscopic methods to detect broad range of chemical compounds at high sensitivity and with high accuracy. Together, the fluorescence spectroscopy highlighted that the accumulation of humic and fulvic acid-like substances and protein-like substances on RO membrane is essential for membrane fouling of RO system.
