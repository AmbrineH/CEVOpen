<p id="Par20" class="p">With respect to the OTUs of the membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes, it is noteworthy that the OTU 35813 identified as an autotrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava</italic> (KY393035, 100% similarity)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup> exhibited quite high relative abundances (5.3–22.9% of the total) for both the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, although it was quite minor (only 0.9–1.8% of the total) in the feed water microbiomes (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). The relative abundances of this OTU in the biofilm microbiomes were 4.3–6.0 times and 13.0–49.5 times significantly higher than those in the feed water microbiomes for SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, respectively. Although 
 <italic class="italic">Hydrogenophaga</italic> spp. are not well known as the fouling-related bacteria, they have been frequently found from biofilm on RO membrane and RO feed water

 </sup>. It is most likely that the OTU 35813 grew autotrophically on RO membrane, thereby being directly responsible for the accumulation of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in the biofilm (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Apart from this autotrophic OTU, the OTU 138854 was phylogenetically assigned as 
 <italic class="italic">Blastochloris viridis</italic> (LN907867, 96% similarity) (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) that is able to produce proteins during the autotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, which corroborated the critical involvement of the autotrophic bacteria in the RO membrane fouling.
