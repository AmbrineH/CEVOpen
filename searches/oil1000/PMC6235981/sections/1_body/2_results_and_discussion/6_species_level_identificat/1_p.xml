<p id="Par19" class="p">To determine the dominant bacterial species in the feed water and biofilm microbiomes, the 10 most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). The abundant OTUs of the feed water microbiomes for both the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW were focused. The OTUs affiliated within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> were the predominant member, accounted for more than 30% of the total (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). It has been reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. were isolated from the surface of RO membrane installed in the MF-RO system treating municipal wastewater

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup> and they were detected from the fouling layer of RO membrane
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. The OTU 102009 (
 <italic class="italic">Pedobacter composti</italic> [accession no. NR041506, 100% sequence similarity]) was the most abundant in the MBR effluent of SWW, and also it was one of the 5 most abundant OTUs in the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW. 
 <italic class="italic">Pedobacetr</italic> spp. have been detected from water reclamation system and bottled mineral water
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that the OTU 102009 could grow under the oligotrophic conditions. Microbial species within the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Brevundimons</italic> (OTU 83690) and 
 <italic class="italic">Caulobacter</italic> (OTU 119287) were also detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), and both of them have been detected from RO membrane
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>. The OTU-level identification revealed that the heterotrophic bacteria were abundant in the feed water microbiomes.
