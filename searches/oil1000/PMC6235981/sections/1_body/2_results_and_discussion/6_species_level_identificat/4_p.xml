<p id="Par22" class="p">Identifying the key microorganisms that cause membrane fouling of RO system to treat MBR effluents is difficult, because the microbiomes on RO membrane are significantly influenced by the quality and volume of the feed water. The direct comparison of microbiomes of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm indicated that microbial species affiliated within the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Hyphomicrobium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobium</italic> were found specifically on the fouled RO membrane, emphasizing that these oligotrophic bacteria were involved in membrane fouling of RO system. Most importantly, the autotrophic bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Blastochloris viridis</italic>, the minor microbial species in the feed water, were newly identified as the abundant member on the fouled membrane. These autotrophic bacteria contributed to the formation of polysaccharide- and protein-rich biofilm on RO membrane, thereby causing membrane fouling of RO system.
