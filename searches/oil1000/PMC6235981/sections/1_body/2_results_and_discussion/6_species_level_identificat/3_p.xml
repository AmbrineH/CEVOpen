Most of these OTUs exhibited much low relative abundances in the feed water microbiomes, strongly suggesting the specific proliferation of these oligotrophic bacteria in the biofilm on RO membrane. In the RO system, the feed water was already purified by MBR and the nutrients for microbial growth have been limited considerably. Small amounts of the residual recalcitrant compounds in the MBR effluents and/or the nutrients synthesized by the co-existed autotrophic bacteria

 <italic class="italic">Blastochloris viridis</italic> (OTU 138854) may have served as the growth substrate for these oligotrophic bacteria of the membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes.
