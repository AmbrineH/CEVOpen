<p id="Par17" class="p">PCoA of the Illumina sequence data based on weighted UniFrac distances was used to compare the whole structures of the microbiomes of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>). For the MBR effluent of SWW, there was little difference in the cell size-separated feed water microbiomes, although the microbiomes collected on the 0.05-µm filter scattered slightly right area from the plots of those on the 0.22-µm filter. For the MBR effluent of heavy oil-containing SWW, the similar trend was found. In addition, the examination at the starting day of the RO treatment indicated that the microbiomes little changed during the periods of the treatment (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Intriguingly, for both the MBR effluents of SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW, the membrane attached-biofilm microbiomes scattered the right area of the PCoA plot and they were located distantly from the feed water microbiomes. In accordance with the data of the α-diversity indices, the PCoA results indicated that microbiomes of the feed water and membrane attached-biofilm were remarkably different from each other.
