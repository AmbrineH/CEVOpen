<p id="Par15" class="p">With the microscopic and spectroscopic results to indicate that membrane fouling of RO system was mainly caused by the accumulation of living microbial cells and microbially produced polysaccharides and proteins, the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm microbiomes were next evaluated by high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The summary of Illumina sequencing data is shown in Supplementary TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. A total of 1,909,526 sequences were obtained in 40 libraries, corresponding to an average of 47,738 sequences per library (minimum: 23,742; maximum: 126,963).
