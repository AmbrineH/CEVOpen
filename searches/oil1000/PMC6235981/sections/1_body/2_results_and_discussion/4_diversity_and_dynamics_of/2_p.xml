<p id="Par16" class="p">The α-diversity indices of the feed water microbiomes were not notably different between the pore sizes (i.e., 0.22 and 0.05 µm) of cell collection filters, and this trend was common in both the MBR effluents of the SWW and heavy oil-containing SWW. Contrastingly, microbiomes of the membrane-attached biofilms were more diverse than the feed water microbiomes for both the MBR effluents, suggesting the membrane-attached lifestyle, or biofilm, more highly increased the microbiome diversity rather than the planktonic lifestyle.</p>
