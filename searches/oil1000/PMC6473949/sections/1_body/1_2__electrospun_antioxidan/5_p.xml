<p class="p">Silver nanoparticles exhibit the capability to interact with bacteria. This allows the size of silver nanoparticles 1â€“10 nm in diameter. The smaller size provides better antibacterial activity. Scientific research has proven the antibacterial activity of electrospun nanofibers containing polylactic acid and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against Staphylococcus aureus and

 <xref rid="B105-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Antimicrobial efficacy increases with an increase in the concentration of silver. The activity can also be increased by reducing silver nanoparticles. Smaller silver nanoparticles have the ability to disperse the bacterial membrane and inhibit bacterial growth. Antimicrobial activity of electrospun nanofibers results from the distribution of silver nanoparticles to electrospun nanofibers. Increased access of silver nanoparticles to electrospun nanofibers increases microbial capacity [
