<p class="p">The polymeric solution stream flows towards the metal manifold with simultaneous evaporation of the solvent and then the nanofibers are deposited on the collector surface. When nanoparticles are deposited instead of nanofibers, the process takes place using electrospray [

 <xref rid="B96-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Electrospinning is a fiber production process with a diameter of 0.01 to 10 μm by using electrostatic forces. In the electrospinning technique, a syringe filled with a polymer solution has a high potential source from 10 to 30 kV. The electrical voltage produces free electrons, ions or pairs of ions attracted to the electric field [

The drive between similar charges in the electric space acts against the surface tension and fluid elasticity in the polymer solution, distorting the drop to the shape of the cone structure. In addition to the critical charge density, the Taylor taper becomes unstable and the liquid stream is released from the tip of the cone. Then, in the presence of the electric field, the polymer stream is formed, creating a light continuous form of the fiber. The fluid stream through continuous stretching becomes unstable because the number of spiral paths accumulated on the collector electrode increases [
 <xref rid="B98-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. This area is called whipping region. Polarized electrospun nanofibers move down to collision with less collector plate potential. The collector’s morphology affects the straightening of the fiber. Different collectors are used, such as drum rotary collector, movable belt collector and straight mesh collector. To produce nanofibers with controlled morphology, parameters such as molecular weight of the polymer, surface tension, solution viscosity, solution conductivity, flow rate, temperature, collector morphology and distance of the collector apex are optimized [
 <xref rid="B99-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. It has been found that the diameter of the fibers increases with increasing concentration and viscosity. Increasing the molecular weight reduces the risk of interference on fibers such as balls and drops. It was determined that nanofibers can be formed with a variety of secondary structures. Thus, nanofibers with a core-shell structure, with an empty interior or with a porous structure may be formed [

As a drug delivery system, a mesh made of nanofibres produced by the electrospinning method offers a number of advantages. This is an attractive method due to its ability to produce nanoscale materials and structures of exceptional quality [
 <xref rid="B101-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. This allows substances to be encapsulated and drugs and biologically active substances placed on polymer nanofibers [
 <xref rid="B102-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. Biologically active substances can be attached to nanofibers like a mesh in the electrospinning process. In this way, antibacterial and antioxidant materials are created for medical applications [
