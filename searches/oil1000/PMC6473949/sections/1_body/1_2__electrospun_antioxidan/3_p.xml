<p class="p">By choosing a base mesh polymer, it can be easily designed to have improved mechanical properties, biocompatibility and cellular response, which makes mesh a good medical product in the nanocomposite materials sector. The electrospinning creates a macroporous scaffolding containing randomly oriented or aligned nanofibres on which the drug is placed. Electrospun nanofiber scaffolds provide the optimal environment for vaccinated cells [
