The drug enclosed in the nanofiber mesh is released by various mechanisms when the nanofibrils mesh is swollen, biodegradable or absorbed by the human body. As an effective dressing, it inhibits bacterial growth during wound healing. The lower drug release rate allows for non-wound healing of wounds from a few days to several weeks [

 <xref rid="B105-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Polymer after electrospinning acts as a barrier controlling the release of loaded molecules. The advantage of this method is the ability to close almost all drugs (especially hydrophobic) in the core, regardless of the drug-polymer interaction. Drugs, proteins, uptake factors and genes can be included in nanofibers [
