<p class="p">Sodium alginate based nanofibers were also synthesized using polyethylene oxide (PEO) as “carrier polymer” [
 <xref rid="B121-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. It was concluded from the study that the sodium alginate on its own could not be electrospun. However, with the addition of a suitable polymer, it can be easily electrospun [
 <xref rid="B121-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>] and the PEO–PEO interactions with high molecular-weight entangled PEO were the key to “carrying” the alginate from the prepared solution to synthesise the fibers using electrospinning (
