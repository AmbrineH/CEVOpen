Nanofibers can be coated with biocompatible polymers (hydrolysed collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate). In this way, the electrospun fibers are coated with pure polyurethane to use the substance to improve the antibacterial effect of urinary catheters. The membranes thus obtained, have good antimicrobial activity on
