<p class="p">Other synthetic polymers such as polyurethane, polyacrylonitrile, poly (acrylamide), poly (nitrilesulfonic acid sodium salt, poly (sulphobetaine methacrylate) were also used to develop wound dressings. Fluoroquinolones and norfloxacin were attached to polyphosphates by chemical modification using amino acid esters (alanine, glycine, and phenylalanine) as chain extenders, and these components were then used to create nanofibers by electrospinning [
