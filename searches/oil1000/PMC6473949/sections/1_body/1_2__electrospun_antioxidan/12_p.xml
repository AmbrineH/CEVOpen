<p class="p">Antimicrobial biodegradable multilayer systems were developed using electrospinning, especially the active multilayer structures based on natural polymers [
 <xref rid="B126-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. The system was developed in such a way that it consisted of different layers; for example, alginate-based film as outer layer; using a PHBV8 film as outer layer or no outer layer. Different characterizations such as oxygen and water vapour permeabilities, intermolecular arrangement, transparency and thermal properties were evaluated. In addition the antimicrobial activity was also evaluated. Alginate based coatings for Food Packaging Applications have been recently reviewed by Tugce et al. [
