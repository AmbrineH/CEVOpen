<p class="p">Electrospinning is one of the most prominent techniques currently being used in the development of a number of products for biomedical applications, as discussed in the preceding section [

 <xref rid="B88-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. The electrospun creates ultrathin fibers collected in a random pattern. The mats produced in this way are used as filters, catalytic carriers, dressings and drug delivery systems [
 <xref rid="B89-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Currently, scientific research focuses on the use of nanofiber properties and the focus on determining the parameters of electrospinning of biopolymers for medical and pharmaceutical applications [

 <xref rid="B91-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. In this technique, varying electrified fields are applied to produce polymer filaments, which can then be embedded in various device platforms (briefed in introduction section). The basic device for electrospinning consists of four parts: a syringe containing a polymer solution, a metallic needle, a power source and a metal collector (with variable construction) [
 <xref rid="B93-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The polymer solution is extruded through the tip of the needle by forming a polymer stream that is leached out of the needle and expands as a result of deflection and dissipation of the electric charge voltage of the solution surface. The basic set for electrospun fibers is shown in

 <xref rid="B94-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Electrospinning of anisotropic fiber yarns (Biohybrid) was carried out via the extraction of microfibrils from bacterial cellulose networks [
 <xref rid="B94-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. In the equipment, a plastic syringe of 5 mL was used as the polymer reservoir in the continuous feed system. An aluminum reservoir that was filled with water was used and the fibers were subsequently collected on the surface of the water 120 mm from the needle tippet [
