<p class="p">The treatment of disease states with the help of biologically active materials created with the help of electrospun nanofibers is part of modern regenerative medicine. The use of natural materials such as plant oils and extracts means that the nonwovens created in the electrospinning process find many applications with safety of use. It is of great importance that it is possible to optimize process conditions and create nanofibers that meet specific requirements. Among the various materials studied, alginate has very high potential for packaging applications and is being seen as the future of packaging materials. However, a very limited study has been carried out on the use of Alginate based electrospun mats for packing application, and to realize its real potential an extensive study in this direction is needed.</p>
