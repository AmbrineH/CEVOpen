 <xref rid="B161-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. They are used in biomedicine and tissue engineering. Intelligent biopolymers have been reported to play an important role in drug delivery [

 <xref rid="B162-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>,
 <xref rid="B163-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>]. They are easy to produce, are a good carrier of nutrients and maintain the stability of the drug [

 <xref rid="B164-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>]. It is possible to inject them in vitro as a liquid and they can form a gel at body temperature. Thermosensitive polymers are used to solubilize hydrophobic drugs and are used in the production of preparations with low solubility drugs as a drug carrier. The use of intelligent polymers for drug delivery is promising in view of the mechanism of drug release observed [
 <xref rid="B165-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. External and internal stimuli that affect the mechanism include temperature, light irradiation, electric current and intelligent hydrogels that can immobilize enzymes have the ability to gel by phase transition [
 <xref rid="B165-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. The chemical signal translates into a mechanical signal causing shrinking or swelling of the gel. This phenomenon is used for the controlled release of the drug. The diffusion of the drug from the beads depends on the condition of the gel [
 <xref rid="B166-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>]. The intelligent polymer is generally integrated with a wall microcapsule or a liposome lipid bilayer. The conformational transition of the polymer affects the integrity of the microcapsule or liposome and allows controlled release of the drug incorporated into the microcapsule or liposome [
