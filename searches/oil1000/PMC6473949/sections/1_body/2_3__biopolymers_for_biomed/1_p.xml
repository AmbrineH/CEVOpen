 <xref rid="B144-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. Ionic gelation was used to develop a new class of nanoparticles that consists of sodium alginate (SA) and 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl-octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TSA). The ratio of SA/TSA was found to exhibit a significant effect on the average size of the SA–TSA nanoparticles. Nanoparticles having an average size of 99 nm were selected for the study and, after using a pad-dry-cure method, were loaded onto cotton fabrics. Different characterization techniques were used to analyse the treated fabrics. It was concluded from the study that the SA–TSA nanoparticles exhibit high potential to be used as a non-leaching agent imparting robust antimicrobial characteristics to the studied cotton fabrics [
