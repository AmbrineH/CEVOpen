<p class="p">One of the organisms that is produced as a structural component of silk protein is Bombyx mori [
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The protein it produces, silk fibroin, is a large crystalline macromolecule consisting of repeating units of amino acids, mainly alanine (A), glycine (G) and serine (S). The fibers that are formed with its participation exhibit good mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Researchers have also demonstrated that electrospinning of biopolymer blends of chitin and silk fibroin is possible [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In this process, nanofibrous membranes of blended chitosan and silk fibroin were successfully prepared using electrospinning in a HFIP/TFA spinning solvent. With the increment in the content of silk fibroin, the typical diameter of the as-prepared nanofibers was found to increase. The incorporation of silk fibroin was also found to contribute to the enhancement in the mechanical properties of nanofibrous membranes. Furthermore, with the increment in the chitosan content, the antibacterial activity became significantly suitable for wound dressings [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Electrospun collagen–chitosan nanofiber having a typical fiber diameter of 434–691 nm was also prepared as a biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) for endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Different characterization techniques such as FTIR spectra analysis, XRD analysis, DSC and tensile testing were carried out to analyse the developed materials [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Double-network (DN) agarose/polyacrylamide nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The DN of agarose/polyacrylamide (PAAm) nano fibers developed using simultaneous photo-polymerization and electrospinning. Different characterization techniques were used to confirm the realization of a crosslinked double-network. In comparison to the pristine agarose, the electrospun fibrous agarose/PAAm demonstrated 66.66% enhancement in the strength [

 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Alginate is an important biopolymer with vast potential [
