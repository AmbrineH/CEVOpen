 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Polyethylene and polyurethanes are used to create tubes. Tubes of positronic pumps are usually made of silicone [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Hemodialysis membranes are produced as bundles of hollow fibers with a surface in contact with blood. The technical requirements concern mainly the permeability for substances smaller than albumin, preventing the passage of impurities from the dialysate to the blood, and the compatibility of the membrane with blood. Previously, dialysis membranes were made of cellulose [

 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The hydroxyl groups were replaced with acetylene derivatives or other modified additives, preventing the activation of the complement system and the associated leukocyte activation and leukocyte sequestration in the lungs [

 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Synthetic membranes consist of a hydrophobic base material and hydrophilic components. The polyaryl sulfone co-precipitation membranes, polysulfone (PSf) and polyvinylprolidone (PVP) membranes are the most popular for a number of applications [
 <xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In addition, other membrane materials such as polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), PMMA, polyester polymer alloy (PEPA), ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL), and molecular thin nanoporous silicon diaphragms are also used. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is used in membranes to improve compatibility with blood [
 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Polymer stents used in the upper sections of the ureter are designed to overcome the problems of sperm infection. Silicone is the best biocompatible material with the lowest incrustation tendency. Its use is limited by low mechanical stiffness and high resistance. Therefore, polyurethane products with better mechanical properties than silicone were optimized [
