<p class="p">Different types of polymers ranging from natural to synthetic are rapidly becoming the most interesting subject of research in the sector of the biomedical industry [
 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. They are often used in the packaging of medicines [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], as well as in the development of flexible ampoule/syringes that are more easy to use. However, adsorption and migration of the bioactive substance to the polymer changes in pH, permeability of oxygen, optical properties and the release of leached components affect their use and should be taken into account [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Interaction of the different outer components not only affects the drug but also the function of the polymeric container. Polyolefins, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene (PP) are some of the most common polymers used for the production of vials. Often, multilayer containers are developed to achieve such requirements as inertia, oxygen or UV protection. Polycyclic and olefinic polymers and copolymers (Daikyo Crystal Zeniths) have been used for filling polymer syringes [

 <xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Devices such as PVC tubes containing di-2- ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer are used in dialysis for blood supply or extracorporeal oxygenation. The bags containing the polymer are used to donate blood and store blood products. Due to lipophilicity, the plasticizer is transferred from the polymer surface to lipids and red blood cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. It has been found that the plasticizer in blood bags reduces haemolysis of red blood cells by about 50% compared to blood stored in non-plastic containers, which improves the quality of the blood product [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Tubes for extracorporeal circulation are often heparinized to reduce the coagulation, which causes intense contact with PVC and increases thrombogenicity [
