<p class="p">Recently, there has been a great thrust on the usage of biopolymers for a number of applications, especially in the biomedical and pharmaceutical [

 <xref rid="B65-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. The functional efficiency of the biopolymer molecules depends on the composition, physicochemical properties and structural features [
 <xref rid="B66-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. It is possible to rationally design the composition and structure of the biopolymer to obtain the appropriate functional attributes [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The internal structure of the polymer molecule determines many functional characteristics such as permeability, chargeability and integrity [
 <xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The stability of the biopolymer particles and their ability to aggregate is influenced by the electrical characteristics. Biopolymer particles with a high electric charge will repel and prevent aggregation. Molecules of biopolymers and their electrical properties influence the interaction with other molecules present in the surrounding environment [
 <xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Among natural biopolymers, alginate is one of the most popular and intensely studied [
 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. It is an anionic biopolymer consisting of units of mannuronic acid and guluronic acid in irregular blocks [
 <xref rid="B72-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Mannuronic acid and guluronic acid are linked by glycosidic linkages [

 <xref rid="B75-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Mannuronic acid forms β (1 → 4) bonds and α bonds (1 → 4) with guluronic acid [
 <xref rid="B76-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The stiffness of molecular chains is ensured by the rigid and bent conformations of guluronic acid [

 <xref rid="B78-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Hadas and Simcha have recently reported their interesting work on the characterization of sodium alginate and calcium alginate with particular emphasis on their structure [
 <xref rid="B79-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Different properties and applications of alginate have also been reviewed [
 <xref rid="B80-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The properties of alginates used in biomedicine can be shaped by modifying the availability of their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups [
 <xref rid="B81-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. It affects the properties of alginates, such as solubility, hydrophobicity and their biological activity. Alginate hydrogels were created by crosslinking polymer chains [
 <xref rid="B82-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The chemical properties of alginate hydrogels were found to depend on the cross-linking density of the chain [
 <xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. One of the methods used in the design of alginate hydrogels is intermolecular cross-linking, in which only the alginate guluron groups react with the divalent cation most often the calcium used to gel the alginate [
 <xref rid="B84-nanomaterials-09-00404" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. Marguerite has summarized the applications of alginate especially for packaging in an excellent review article, so we won’t go into detail [
