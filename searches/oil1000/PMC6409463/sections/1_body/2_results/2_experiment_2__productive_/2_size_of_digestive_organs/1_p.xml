<p class="p">The relative weight of proventriculus, gizzard and pancreas was affected (p&lt;0.05) by the diet. The broilers that received the MLE diet had higher (p&lt;0.05) relative weights of proventriculus and gizzard than the broilers that were fed the MS and MSE diets. The relative length of small intestine was longer (p&lt;0.05) in broilers fed the MLE diet than in broilers fed the MSE diet but similar (p&gt;0.05) to in broilers on the MS diet. With exception of relative spleen weight, age affected (p&lt;0.05) all parameters of digestive organ size (
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). It was found that the older the broilers, the lower the relative weights and lengths of organs. The diet√óage interaction was significant (p&lt;0.05) only for relative pancreas weight (
