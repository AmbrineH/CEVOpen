<p class="p">The SAS software was used to analyze the data. FI, BW, BWG, and FC were analyzed as repeated measures, considering the pen as the experimental unit, using the MIXED procedure. AME and AMEn were analyzed with a completely random design of three treatments with eight replicates each, using the general linear model (GLM) procedure. For data on relative weights and lengths of organs, TiBS and TeBS; GS and VAng; and LLD, a completely randomized experimental design in a 3×2 (diets and ages) factorial arrangement model, considering each killed broiler as the observational unit, was used and analyzed with GLM, FREQ and GLIMMIX, and MIXED procedures, respectively. Statistical difference was set at p&lt;0.05 and means were separated by using the Tukey’s test.</p>
