<p class="p">AME was determined using the classical total excreta collection method. From day 38 to 42 of age, FI and excreta output were measured quantitatively per cage. Feathers, scales, and feed scraps were removed from the excreta. To minimize feed waste, over-filling the feeders was avoided. For AME determination a pooled sample of excreta from each cage was taken and stored at −20°C for subsequent lyophilization (Labconco, Labconco Corporation, Kansas City, MO, USA). Dried excreta and diet samples were ground to pass through a 0.5 mm sieve and stored in sealed plastic containers for DM, gross energy (GE) and nitrogen content analysis. The GE was determined using an isoperibol bomb calorimeter (PARR 1266, Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL, USA). Nitrogen content was measured by the Kjeldahl method [
