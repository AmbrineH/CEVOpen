<p class="p">The LLD was evaluated according to the technique described by Berg and Sanotra [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], which is based on the body contact of the broiler with water, which is an aversive experience for broilers. The broilers were placed in plastic containers with 3 cm water at 32Â°C, and the time elapsed in seconds was measured until the moment the broiler sat down. If the broiler remained standing after 600 seconds, the test was suspended; all tests were carried out by the same person. The broilers were evaluated individually without visual contact between them.
