<p class="p">The AngV was evaluated with the scale described by Le terrier and Nys [
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Depending on the angle size of tibia-metatarsus, four scores (0 to 3) were defined: 0, broilers that show no tibia-metatarsus angulation evident to the naked eye (tibia-metatarsus angle less than 10°) and 3, broilers with severe angulation (angle greater than 45°).
