 <xref rid="b11-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] by cervical dislocation to assess tibia breaking strength (TiBS) and tendon breaking strength (TeBS). Tibia and calcaneus tendon were dissected from the left leg and subjected to a breaking strength test using a Vernier Force Plate (Vernier Software &amp; Technology, Beaverton, OR, USA). The tibia was placed on an adjustable three-point loading system with a distance bone support of 60 mm, and a vertical force was applied at midpoint by a 2.54 cm fulcrum. The proximal and distal portion of each tendon were fastened with sandpaper and attached to the mounting brackets of the Vernier Force Plate. Breaking strength was recorded as the force in newtons (N) required to break the tibia or tendon.
