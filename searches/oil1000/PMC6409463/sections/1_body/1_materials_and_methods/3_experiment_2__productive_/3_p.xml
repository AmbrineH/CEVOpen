A lighting program of 23 h light:1 h dark (23 L:1 D) was used during the first four weeks, and from 29 until 44 days of age, the lighting program was 12 L:12 D. During the first week, the temperature in the poultry house was 33°C to 35°C and was reduced successively 3°C per week. The experimental diets were divided into two phases: starter diet (1 to 27 days of age) containing 21% CP, 12.55 MJ ME/kg, 1.0% Ca, and 0.50 available P; and finisher diet (28 to 44 days of age) containing 19% CP, 12.76 MJ ME/kg, 0.90% Ca, and 0.45% available P.
