<p class="p">A total of two hundred eighty-eight one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were used. Eight groups of twelve broilers were fed one of three experimental diets (8 replicates per diet). The experimental diets were MS, maize-soybean meal with enzymes (MSE), and maize-dehulled lupine seed with enzymes (MLE). The MLE diet was formulated using the chemical composition and AME values obtained in Experiment 1. 
 <xref rid="t2-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the composition of the experimental diets. Enzymes were added following the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations (DuPont-Danisco, Mexico City, Mexico). The enzyme mixture (Axtra XAP 101 TPT, Cedar Rapids, IA, USA) was derived from
