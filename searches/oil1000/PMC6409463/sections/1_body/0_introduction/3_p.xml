<p class="p">Whole lupine seed cannot be used as a single source of protein in diets for broilers due to its high level of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), which increase viscosity of intestinal content and affect feed intake (FI) and utilization [
 <xref rid="b5-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Total NSP content ranges from 43.2% to 49.6% in whole seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolius</italic> cultivars [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Evans et al [
 <xref rid="b7-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] found 29% to 31% NSP in the cotyledons and 86% to 89% in the hull. Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] suggested that it is possible to include high levels of lupine in diets for broilers by removing the hull and/or by using enzymes to degrade NSP. The use of exogenous enzymes such as xylanases and proteases in diets for broilers to attenuate nutrient encapsulation by NSP, such as arabinoxylans, and to increase protein degradation has recently been investigated [
 <xref rid="b8-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. We hypothesized that inclusion of dehulled lupine seed as the main protein source plus enzymes in broiler diets does not affect productive performance, size of digestive organs or welfare-related variables. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of the dehulling process of lupine seed on its chemical composition and AME and to evaluate the inclusion of dehulled lupine seed as the main protein source in diets supplemented with enzymes, on productive performance, size of digestive organs and welfare-related variables in broilers.
