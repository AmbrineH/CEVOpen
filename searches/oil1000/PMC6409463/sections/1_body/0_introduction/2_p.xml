 <xref rid="b3-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The chemical composition of lupine seed varies depending on the cultivar. Vecerek et al [
 <xref rid="b4-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] showed that, while chemical composition of lupine seed varies among cultivars, dehulling improves seed nutritional value, increasing protein and oil contents and decreasing fiber concentration. These results are of interest for non-ruminants that cannot digest fiber. However, there are few reports about chemical composition and AME of dehulled lupine seed.
