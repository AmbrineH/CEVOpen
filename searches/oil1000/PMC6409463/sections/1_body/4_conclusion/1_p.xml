<p class="p">The dehulling process of lupine seed improves the content of protein and AME and reduces fiber content. Therefore, it is possible completely replace soybean meal by dehulled lupine seed with enzymes in broiler diets and obtain similar BWs. However, it increases FC (a higher FI is required) and deteriorates welfare-related variables. In further studies, evaluating increased enzyme concentrations and types is recommended to improve the results obtained in this study.</p>
