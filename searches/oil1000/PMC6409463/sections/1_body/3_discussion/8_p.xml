<p class="p">An increment in relative weight of proventriculus (19% and 22%) and gizzard (18% and 17%) was observed in broilers on the MLE diet with respect to those on the MS and MSE diets. The greater relative weight of proventriculus and gizzard in broilers fed the MLE diet may be related to effects of the NSP of the lupine seed. Similar results have also been reported in other studies. Brenes et al [
