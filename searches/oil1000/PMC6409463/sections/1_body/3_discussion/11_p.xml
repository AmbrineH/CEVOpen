<p class="p">The greater relative liver weight found by Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] in broilers fed diets containing 20% of whole 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolius</italic> seed was not observed in our study when higher levels of dehulled seed were included. Rubio et al [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] observed greater relative liver weight in broilers fed diets with 40% lupine seed, compared with a control diet (wheat-soybean), but that difference was eliminated by enzyme supplementation. JÃ³zefiak et al [
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] suggested that liver size is dependent on gastrointestinal microflora and/or its fermentation products. Thus, it is possible that enzyme supplementation modulates microbial activity; this, however, should be tested.
