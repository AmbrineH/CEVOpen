<p class="p">Welfare-related variables (poor walking ability, less LLD and more leg angulation) observed in broilers fed the MLE diet may have been due to higher cumulative FI and FC, which increase the excreta output and consequently causes the presence of wet cakey litter in their pens. Wet litter has been linked to poor walking ability [

 <xref rid="b28-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The wet cakey litter observed in pens of broilers fed MLE diet may have been caused by the NSP in the lupine seed. Caprita et al [
 <xref rid="b29-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] point out that the main NSP of lupine seeds is a complex branched chain structure containing long β-(1–4)-D-galactose side chains attached to a pectin-like main chain of rhamnose and galacturonic acid linked by β-(1–4) and α-(1–2) bonds, respectively, and α-(l-5)-L-arabinose side chains. Banch Knudsen [
 <xref rid="b30-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] indicates that seeds with high pectin content have higher water retention capacity. Therefore, in future research it is highly recommended to include pectinases, among other enzymes, to improve the litter conditions and welfare-related variables. Results of this study indicate that the enzyme mixture added to the MLE diet did not improve animal welfare-related variables.
