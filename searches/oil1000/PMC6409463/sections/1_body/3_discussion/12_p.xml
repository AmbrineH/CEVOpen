<p class="p">The lower relative pancreas weight of broilers fed MLE diet is possibly linked to the negligible level of trypsin inhibitor activity, which has been reported in seeds of

 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. A similar decrease in the relative pancreas weight of 21-day-old broilers was reported by Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] in broilers fed diets containing 20% whole 
 <italic class="italic">L. albus</italic> cultivar Kiev mutant seed. In our study, however, at 44 days of age broilers fed the MLE diet had relative pancreas weight similar to that of broilers fed the MS and MSE diets. The meaning of this finding is unclear.
