<p class="p">It is important to point out that in the MLE diet the soybean meal was completely substituted by dehulled lupine seed. Accordingly, the results obtained in this study suggest that it is possible to completely replace the soybean meal by dehulled lupine seed in broiler diets, which resulted in final weights of 93.4% with respect to the MSE diet and similar (p&gt;0.05) to the MS diet. In agreement with the above results, FC increased around 0.13 to 0.14 g of feed per g of BWG in broilers fed the MLE diet with respect to those fed the other diets. The higher cumulative FI and FC observed in the broilers fed the MLE diet was possibly because the energy value of the dehulled lupine seed used in Experiment 2 was lower than that estimated in Experiment 1 since there was a difference in dehulling process efficiency (100% in the Experiment 1 vs 95% in the Experiment 2). It has also been reported that enzyme supplementation of lupine diets improves FI [
