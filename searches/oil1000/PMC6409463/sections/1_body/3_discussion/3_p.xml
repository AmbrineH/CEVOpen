<p class="p">Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] evaluated whole seeds of three varieties of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolius</italic> and found amino acid contents similar to those of our study for isoleucine, phenylalanine and valine and slightly higher for arginine, histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine and threonine. In our study, arginine was the essential amino acid found in greater quantity in the lupine seed, a result that coincides with other studies. Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] found that arginine is the most abundant essential amino acid in seeds of this species. The high content of arginine may be of interest for reducing pulmonary hypertension in broilers raised at high altitude, through synthesis of nitric oxide (potent vasodilator produced from L-arginine). The central etiology in pulmonary arterial hypertension (ascites syndrome), a hypoxemic condition, is the consequence of vasoconstriction and reduction of the vascular lumen which decreases blood flow. It has been suggested that the decrease in nitric oxide synthesis is responsible for vasoconstriction [

 <xref rid="b15-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] indicate that glutamic acid, aspartic acid and arginine are the main amino acids in all proteins isolated from lupine. In our study, methionine and cystine were found in smaller amounts in lupine seed; according to Nadal et al [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], legume proteins are usually low in sulfur amino acids.
