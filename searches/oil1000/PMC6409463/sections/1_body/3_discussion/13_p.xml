 <xref rid="b26-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported 26.8% to 36.7% increases in the length of the different sections of the small intestine in broilers fed diets with 35% dehulled lupine seed. These authors explain the enlargement of the gastrointestinal tract in birds as an adaptive mechanism. The ancestors of domestic chickens included in their diet seeds containing high levels of indigestible material, such as NSP. For this reason, they speculate that chickens may have developed mechanisms to extract maximum nutritional benefit from a poor quality diet by increasing the intestine size to increase its absorption capacity.
