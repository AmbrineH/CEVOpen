<p class="p">The AME and AMEn values of whole seed were lower than those reported by Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] for other varieties of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolius</italic>. The AMEn content in dehulled seed of our study was higher than that reported by Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b19-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] for dehulled seed of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolius</italic> Wallan variety. The dehulling process increased values of AME and AMEn by 48.4% and 52.7%, respectively. Based on these results, the nutritionist can increase the level of inclusion of dehulled lupine seed in diets for broilers when high-energy diets are needed. Nalle et al [
 <xref rid="b19-ajas-18-0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] report that dehulling reduces the content of NSP and improves AME values.
