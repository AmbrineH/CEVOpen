<p class="p"> Nowadays, emulsifiers are widely used in the food and drug industry. Therefore, using emulsifiers derived from natural resources are preferred to synthetic emulsifiers because of their nutritional benefits. As a result, using bioemulsifiers derived from microbial sources are beneficial and may be a significant alternative for synthesized emulsifiers. Thus, they can be used efficiently in the food and drug industry in acceptable and recommended quantities.</p>
