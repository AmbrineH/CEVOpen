<p class="p"> Emulsan is an extracellular poly-anionic bioemulsifier produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG 1</italic> bacteria. In fact, emulsan is a lipoheteropolysaccharide polymer containing D-galactose-amine produced during the stationary phase. This bioemulsifier is a poly-anionic and amphiphilic compound which is able to stabilize the hydrocarbon emulsion in water by creating a very thin layer between the hydrocarbon droplets and water. Maximum concentration is obtained when culture media containing 12 carbon-based fatty acids are used as the carbon source. Emulsan production is possible with fermentation methods such as batch, chemo-stat, immobilized cell system and self-cycling fermentation (SCF). Based on SCF methods, bioemulsifier production could increase about 50 times compared to the batch method. Another type of emulsan considered as bio-emulsion is produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic>, which is used in the formulation and production of soft cheese and ice creams as well as creams and skin-protecting materials. Different types of emulsions produced from these bacteria include alpha-amyloemulsan, Apo-alpha-oleo-emulsan, and beta-emulsan, which are used for treating skin infections are widely used in the food industry. These compounds are mostly poly-anionic lipoheteropolysaccharides that are produced by different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter venetianus rag-1t</italic> ATCC 31012- and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptomyces</italic> NRRL.B- 15615, NRRL.B-15847 or ATCC 31926 and few other species.
