<p class="p"> This bioemulsifier which in terms of molecular characteristics, is considered as a mixture of glycolic acid, is produced after 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas cepacia</italic> bacteria growth and propagation on sunflower oil (as the carbon source) medium. The production of this bioemulsifier is carried out by 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas cepacia</italic> bacteria by adding 1.7 % of sunflower oil per liter of culture medium when oxygen and nitrogen levels are controlled. This bioemulsifier is used as a natural source of disintegrating agents used for decomposing and neutralizing polychlorinated biphenyls, especially polychlorinated biphenyls. Polychlorinated biphenyls are toxic and with carcinogenic compounds produced by pesticides during various chemical processes which are able to contaminate industrial wastewater and cultivated soils.
