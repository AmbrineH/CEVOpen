<p class="p"> Liposan bioemulsifier is a water-soluble emulsifier obtained from extracting organic solvents fermented by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida lipolytica</italic> yeast. Liposan is produced in the extracellular layer and consists of 83% carbohydrate and 17% protein. The presence of protein fractions in the bioemulsifier polymer molecule is essential for its emulsifying properties. The carbohydrate part is a heteropolysaccharide, composed of glucose, galactose, galactose-amine and galacturonic acid molecules. The maximum liposomal properties of liposan are observed at pH = 2-5. Liposan is resistant to temperatures less than 70 °C, but after heating at 100 °C for one hour, 60% of its emulsifiable strength reduces. Liposan causes the stability of various types of emulsions in oil, such as hydrocarbons, vegetable oils including cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, corn, ground, safflower and olive oil.
