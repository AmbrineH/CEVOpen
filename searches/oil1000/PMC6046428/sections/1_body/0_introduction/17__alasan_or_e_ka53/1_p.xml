<p class="p"> Alasan is a biomolecular bacterium produced by the 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter radioresistant</italic> bacteria. The molecular composition of this complex bioemulsifier consists of polysaccharides and proteins with high molecular weight (100,000 - 230,000 Daltons). If the protein portion is damaged and digested using proteolytic enzymes, the bioemulsifier polymer turns into a thick polysaccharide and loses its emulsifying properties. Heating with alcohol at 50 °C may lead to 2.5 times increase in polysaccharide concentration, while the protein portion and the emulsifying properties of the molecule remain unchanged. Heating at 60-90 °C reduces viscosity and increases emulsifying activity as much as 5.8 times than the initial value. The emulsifying properties of alasan are affected by pH and magnesium ion concentrations. This bioemulsifier is an extracellular product and is used extensively in the food industry. Alasan is produced during 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> bacterium fermentation in a fed-batch fermentation system. The ultimate product consists of 2.2 g of emulsifier per liter of culture fluid. Alcohols stabilize a wide range of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, such as n-alkanes, alkaline compounds, liquid paraffin, soybean oil, coconut oil and raw oils. The emulsifying activity of alasan increase approximately 2-3 times, when heated at 100 °C under neutral or alkaline conditions. This bioemulsifier is completely active in pH = 3.3-9.2 and its maximum emulsifier activity is at pH = 5. Magnesium ions increase the activity of emulsifiers both at lower (3.3-4.5) and higher pH (5.5-9.3) than that of the optimal pH. Alasan activity is higher in an environment containing 20 mL citrate than that of same concentrations of acetate or Tris-HCl. According to studies, we can indicate that this bioemulsifier is a high molecular weight anion heteropolysaccharide combined with a protein component such as alanine.
