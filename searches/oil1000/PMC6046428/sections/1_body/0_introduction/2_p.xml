<p class="p"> Bioemulsifiers are higher in molecular weight compared to biosurfactants since they are complex mixtures of heteropolysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins and proteins.

 </sup> Emulsifiers have double lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. On the other hand, emulsions are either oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O). In oil emulsions, small droplets of oil form the dispersed phase and discrete in water, while in water emulsions, they are distrebuted as small droplets of water in oil.

 </sup> Adding an emulsifier to an unmixable compound, reduces surface tension between the two phases and prevents it from separating. Therefore, the two liquids are able to form an emulsion. Since an emulsion consists of water-soluble and oil-soluble fragments, an emulsifier is placed on the surface of the area where the two liquids (water and oil) are connected. The water-soluble fragment ambulates towards the water fragment and the fat-soluble fragment places near the oil.
