 <italic class="italic">Phaffia rhodozyma</italic> is a 
 <italic class="italic">basidiomycetous</italic> pink yeast. It has been known as a natural source of astaxanthin and many other nutrients. Also, it is currently being used as an ingredient in feeds. It grows on carbohydrate, hydrocarbon and a mixture of carbohydrate and lipid polymers. Fermentation is accomplished in a culture medium chain with sucrose as the carbon source for 3 days at 22 Â°C and centrifuged at 150 rpm. Experiments have shown that adding sodium citrate, stimulates bioemulsifiers production.
