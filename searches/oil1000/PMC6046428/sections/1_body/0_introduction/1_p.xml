<p class="p"> As it is clear, oil and water are incompatible. The mixture of oil and water lead to the production of an emulsion. When an emulsion stays still for a while, oil droplets begin to separate from water. In this regards, emulsifiers are used to stop this process. In fact, emulsifiers are used to prevent the emulsion from breaking. Examples of emulsions currently used in the food industry include milk, butter, margarine, mayonnaise and ice cream. Emulsifiers are a large category of compounds also known as surface active agents or surfactants. The word surfactant is used for molecules that migrate to the surface between phases.
