<p class="p"> Presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in water resources due to their low solubility, is somewhat problematic. When the molecular weight of these compounds (PAH) are reduced, available microorganisms metabolize them. A number of degrading bacteria have been isolated from multi‏-ring aromatic hydrocarbons of contaminated soils, which produce bioemulsifiers and active compounds, most notably strain No. 107 of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingomonas</italic> bacteria. This bacterium grows on culture media containing a variety of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and create clear spots on the medium.‏ Also in liquid culture media, this bacterium uses aromatic hydrocarbons as the main source of energy and carbon. Notably, this bioemulsifier has emulsifying properties similar to high molecular weighting polycyclic hydrocarbons.
