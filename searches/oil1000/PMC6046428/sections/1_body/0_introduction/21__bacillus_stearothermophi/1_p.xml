<p class="p"> During growth,
 <italic class="italic"> Bacillus stearothermophilus VR-8</italic> produces an extracellular bioemulsifier on a medium containing 4% crude oil. The optimum temperature for producing this bioemulsifier is 50 °C, which at this temperature, 0.6 gr/L bioemulsifier is produced. This emulsifier is purified by acetone and dialysis and contains 46% protein, 16% carbohydrate and 10% fat. Its emulsifier activity is stable over a wide range of temperatures, i.e. 50-80 °C, and pH = 2-8, and salt concentrations (5% chlorine, 5% calcium chloride or 1% chlorine magnesium). The emulsifying properties of this bioemulsifier are related to its stability in a wide range of pH (liposomal at pH = 2-5 and a maximum of 70 °C) and temperatures. This emulsifier is used for removing crude oil from reservoirs and eliminating the remaining oil of crude oil tanks. Hereby, recovery of crude oil, increases by complete scouring of oil remained on storage chamber.
