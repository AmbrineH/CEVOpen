<p class="p"> During the fed-batch process, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> yeast species produce an extracellular bioemulsifier. This bioemulsifier is very effective in fixing emulsions of many types of hydrocarbons, especially aromatic compounds. The amount of emulsifier produced and its activity increases during fermentation by limiting nitrogen (N) source. Extracting this bioemulsifier from 
 <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic> cells using hot water shows better results in terms of increasing emulsion strength.
