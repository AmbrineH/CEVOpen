<p class="p"> Mannoprotein bioemulsifier is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 14,000 to 15,800 Dalton. Within the cellular wall of 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces spp.</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic> of yeast, mannoprotein molecules are present in glucan, networks, and released from the cell wall of yeast using pressurized heat treatments. This bioemulsifier is able to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions (O/W). According to researchers, bioemulsifiers can be used for producing mayonnaise along with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), instead of using expensive ingredients such as ginseng for mayonnaise formulation. Bakery's yeast (
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) is an affordable, inexpensive and non-toxic source used for producing this bioemulsifier. Mannoprotein is stable in pH = 3-11. Removing mannoprotein molecules from bakery yeast cell is possible using thermal and enzymatic processes (Î²
 <italic class="italic">-</italic>1 and 3 glucanases). Mannoprotein molecules are formed from a polypeptide chain with short and long mannose links. When the protein portion of the mannoprotein molecule is detached by the protease enzyme, the mannoprotein emulsifier disappears. In an industrial scale, this bioemulsifier is active at concentrations equal to or greater than 5% sodium chloride.
