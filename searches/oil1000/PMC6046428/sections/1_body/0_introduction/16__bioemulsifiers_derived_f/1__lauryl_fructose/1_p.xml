  <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup> in a culture media containing dry pyridine. This bioemulsifier has emulsification properties for a variety of hydrocarbons, edible oils, and oil based oils such as margarine and shortening. In a water-containing environment, Laura fructose reduces surface tension from 72 to 29 (MN / m). Also, it reduces the intermolecular reaction of water and hydrocarbons from 50 to 6 when combined with water-insoluble oil compounds.
