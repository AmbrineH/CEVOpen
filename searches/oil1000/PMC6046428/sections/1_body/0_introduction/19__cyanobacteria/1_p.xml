<p class="p"> A variety of 
 <italic class="italic">cyanobacteria</italic> (Genus phormidium, ATCC 39161) (Oscillatoriales) bacterium produce bioemulsifiers that can be used for producing hydrocarbon and oil emulsions in a fluid environment such as water. This bacterium is obtained from using precise separation methods from riverside water, which subsequently grow on a suitable culture medium under favorable conditions and produce an extracellular bioemulsifier sphincter. The molecular weight of this polymeric bioemulsifier is more than 200,000 Dalton. According to chemical tests, it contains sugars, fatty acids, and a protein fractions. Also, more accurate tests using IR spectrophotometry have shown that it is contains amide, carboxylic and amino groups. This bioemulsifier is used for producing various types of oil-in-water emulsions (O/W).
