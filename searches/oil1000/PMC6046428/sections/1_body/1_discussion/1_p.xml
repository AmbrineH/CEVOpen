<p class="p"> Biosurfactants have received great attention due to their safety and biodegradable properties. Although biosurfactants have various functions,their practical application is limited. Biosurfactants worldwide production was approximately 17 million tons in 2000 and is expected to have a growth rates of 3-4% per year globally. Biosurfactants have many advantages in comparison to synthesized components, such as, biodegradability (easily decomposed by microorganism), low toxicity (Effective Concentration =50), availability of raw materials (produced from cheap materials), physical factors (components which are not affected by temperature, pH and ionic strength tolerances), surface and interface activity (lower surface tension) ,biocompatibility and digestibility, commercial laundry detergents, bio pesticide, medical function (antimicrobial activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-adhesive agents, immunological adjuvants, antiviral activity, gene delivery), food processing industry, cosmetic industry and increasing oil recovery. Considering, biosurfactants applications and their affect on nutrient, micronutrient and environmental factors, their production still remains a challeng. It is expected that in the near future, a new strain of microorganisms will be developed for using as biosurfactants in industries.</p>
