 <p class="p">Emulsifiers are a large category of compounds considered as surface active agents or surfactants. An emulsifier acts by reducing the speed of chemical reactions, and enhancing its stability. Bioemulsifiers are known as surface active biomolecule materials, due to their unique features over chemical surfactants, such as non-toxicity, biodegradability, foaming, biocompatibility, efficiency at low concentrations, high selectivity in different pH, temperatures and salinities. Emulsifiers are found in various natural resources and are synthesized by Bacteria, Fungi and Yeast. Bioemulsifier’s molecular weight is higher than that of biosurfactants. Emulsion’s function is closely related to their chemical structure. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to study the various bioemulsifiers derived from microorganisms used in the drug and food industry. In this manuscript, we studied organisms with biosurfactant producing abilities. These inexpensive substrates could be used in environmental remediation and in the petroleum industry.</p>
