 <p class="p">A.P. developed the concept of AFM-IR characterization of shale samples, J.Y. conceived and designed the experiments, and P.H. conceived the approach of sample evaluation across thermal gradients. J.H. and P.H. polished and prepared the New Albany shale sample, measured the bulk chemistry with TOC and Rock-Eval, and identified and imaged maceral types using optical microscopy. J.Y. performed the AFM-IR imaging and localized IR experiments and together with A.P. developed spectral analysis. All authors discussed the data. J.Y. wrote the manuscript with support from P.H. and A.P.</p>
