 <p> Correlative imaging of distinct inertinite and solid bitumen. a Photomicrograph (white incident light, oil immersion) of organic matter in polished, low maturity (BR o, 0.25%) New Albany Shale sample, showing bright reflectance inertinite surrounded by solid bitumen in an scanned area of 30 × 30 μm 2. b Topographic image of same field, showing a smoothly polished surface, with no relief between organic and inorganic phases. c Same field showing IR absorption mapping of aliphatic C–H stretching (2920 cm −1). d Mechanical stiffness mapping of same field at 2920 cm −1 </p>
