 <p> Compositional trends in the maturation of individual macerals. a Average localized infrared (IR) spectra from three or more different solid bitumen particles in untreated and artificially matured New Albany Shale samples, with solid bitumen reflectance (BR o) ranging from 0.25% to 1.17%. b Average localized IR spectra from different locations in 1–2 inertinite particles in samples with BR o of 0.25 and 0.90%. c Average localized IR spectra from different locations in 1–2 Tasmanites particles in samples with BR o of 0.25 and 0.65%. d Pseudo van Krevelen diagram, constructed by plotting the IR proxy for H/C and O/C atomic ratios of Tasmanites, solid bitumen, and inertinite at different maturities. Solid bitumen reflectance values are indicated adjacent to calculated IR ratios (T, Tasmanites; B, solid bitumen; and I, inertinite) </p>
