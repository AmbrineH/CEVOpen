<p id="Par14" class="p">Maturation is the process under which petroleum is generated by thermal cracking of OM at elevated temperature. The combination of organic petrography with AFM-IR allows the maturation process to be followed on a maceral-by-maceral basis, supplementing the traditional analysis of bulk chemical changes in OM

 </sup>. Here the New Albany Shale is artificially matured by hydrous pyrolysis to various stages in the petroleum generation process, and the evolution in the abundance of individual macerals is measured by petrography while the evolution in the composition of individual macerals is measured by AFM-IR.
