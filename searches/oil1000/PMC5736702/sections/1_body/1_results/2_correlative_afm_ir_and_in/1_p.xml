<p id="Par9" class="p">Macerals of interest in the New Albany Shale are imaged and identified by incident light microscopy and then registered and imaged by AFM-IR. In the unpyrolyzed (immature) sample, abundant solid bitumen (gray solid hydrocarbon residue from amorphous organic matter conversion) and

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> shows the incident white light microscopy image, illustrating discrete solid bitumen and inertinite macerals from the unpyrolyzed immature New Albany Shale sample. The field of view in this image is 30 × 30 µm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, comparable to a single pixel in a traditional micro-FTIR instrument. The AFM-IR measurements are performed in the same area, including images of high-resolution topography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), IR absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>), and mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>), all acquired with pixel size of 100 × 100 nm

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>,

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) shows relatively little contrast, indicating a smooth surface after mechanical polishing, such that OM cannot be identified. Instead, the discrete macerals are readily identified as having intense 2920 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) and low mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>) relative to the surrounding mineral matter. The closely matching spatial distributions seen in the white light microscopy image and AFM-IR images confirm accurate registration.
