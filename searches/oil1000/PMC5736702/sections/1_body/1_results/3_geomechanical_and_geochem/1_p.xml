<p id="Par11" class="p">Geomechanical heterogeneity can be estimated by analyzing the distribution of contact resonance (CR) frequencies measured on each maceral, as CR frequency is positively correlated with sample stiffness. Inertinite, solid bitumen, and 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> are highlighted in stiffness images Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a–c, respectively. Prior to the AFM-IR imaging, the AFM probes are carefully selected to have nearly the same contact resonance frequency when measured on a polystyrene thin film sample. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref> displays the distribution of CR frequencies from pixels assigned as inertinite (highlighted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), where each pixel (100 × 100 nm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) contributes one data point. Inertinite accounts for an area of 130.74 μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, with 13,074 measured points yielding an average CR frequency of 182.1 kHz ± 1.7 kHz (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e, f</xref> displays the resulting CR frequency distributions of solid bitumen (178.8 kHz ± 3.6 kHz) and 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> (177.2 kHz ± 4.3 kHz), indicating the average mechanical stiffnesses of 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> is slightly less than solid bitumen and much lower than inertinite.
