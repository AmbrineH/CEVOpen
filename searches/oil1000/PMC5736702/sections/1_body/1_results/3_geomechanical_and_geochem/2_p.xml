<p id="Par12" class="p">Geochemical heterogeneity can be probed by measuring the IR spectra collected at different locations corresponding to different macerals. Localized IR spectra are obtained for inertinite, solid bitumen, and 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic>, as indicated by the colored dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a-c. Because the absolute intensities of localized IR spectra are affected by absorbing material thickness, all spectra are normalized for comparison. All localized spectra illustrate the characteristic bands of IR absorption in OM: aliphatic absorption at 2920 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 2850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and 1375 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; aromatic absorption at 3100–3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; and carboxyl absorption at ~1710 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (details of band assignments for IR spectra of OM are described in the “Methods” section). Different locations within a maceral present nearly identical IR spectra, as observed for the inertinite (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g</xref>), solid bitumen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3h</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3i</xref>) macerals. These results indicate compositional homogeneity within a maceral type. However, large variations exist between maceral types in immature shale (see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Inertinite displays a strong aromatic character, exhibiting a distinct aromatic absorbance band at 3000–3100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, strong aromatic absorbance at 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and relatively low oxygenated group stretching at ~1710 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> shows intense C=O absorption at ~1710 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and low aromatic absorption at 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Solid bitumen shows no aromatic C–H absorbance at 3000–3100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, modest aromatic C=C ring stretching at 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and modest C=O stretching at ~1710 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
