<p id="Par22" class="p">The topography, IR absorption, and contact resonance frequency image (stiffness map) are collected simultaneously at a fixed wavenumber of interest. All images are acquired in contact mode using probes (Model: PR-EX-NIR2, Anasys Instruments) with a resonance frequency of 13 ± 4 kHz and a spring constant of 0.07−0.4 N m

 </sup>. Here, the second mode of cantilever oscillation is selected by applying a bandpass filter centered at 180 kHz with 50 kHz window. The images are acquired at a scan rate of 0.2 Hz and averaged over 8 pulses, with a 100 nm × 100 nm spatial resolution. The image acquisition time is ~25 min for a 30 × 30 μm area or 11 min for a 20 × 20 μm area. The spatial resolution of IR absorption imaging is affected by sample thermomechanical properties such as thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity

 </sup>. The typical spatial resolution of IR images is around 100 nm. Stiffness mapping offers enhanced resolution limited by the tip radius of the cantilever, typically in the range of 10 s of nanometers.
