<p class="p">This study confirms that sunflower yield is still greatly dependent on cross-pollination events, with even self-fertile cultivars showing a yield increase due to insect mediated cross-fertilisation. These events are exclusively driven by insect visitors (mainly honey bees). Therefore, in order to guarantee the productivity of currently used sunflower cultivars, it seems essential to ensure a pollinator community that is able to fulfil such cross-pollination needs. On the other hand, oil quality does not vary when cross-pollination events occur.</p>
