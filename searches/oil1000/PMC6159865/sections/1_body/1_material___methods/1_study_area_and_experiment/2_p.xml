 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. During the first season, 18 commercial sunflower fields (hereafter ‘focal fields’) were chosen in order to obtain a balanced design and avoid confounding effects between local and landscape variables in terms of (i) typology of their adjacent semi-natural element (located at one of the field sides, named the ‘focal side’), and (ii) complexity of the surrounding landscape. The 6 fields per focal side typology [‘herbaceous linear SNH’ (n = 6), ‘woody linear SNH’ (n = 6) and ‘no SNH/other crop’ (n = 6)] were selected to cover a broad range of landscape complexity (considering landscape complexity as the percentage of SNHs in a landscape sector of 1 km radius around each focal field, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203990.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The selected adjacent elements were classified in accordance to Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> (‘herbaceous linear SNH’: any type of linear element (1.5 to 25 m wide) with less than 30% tree/shrub canopy cover; ‘woody linear SNH’: any type of linear element (1.5 to 25 m wide) with more than 30% tree/shrub canopy cover; and ‘no SNH/other crop’: another crop, either perennial or annual, adjacent to the focal field). Each focal field was planted with one of the common cultivars used for oil production in the study area and managed by farmers according to their standard agronomic practices (see Tables A-C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for details about sunflower varieties and focal field management; selected fields were either organic or conventional). Focal fields had an average size of 7.14 ha with a SD of 5.19 ha. The minimum and the average distances between fields were respectively 1.95 and 17.28 km for 2014 and 1.48 and 18.51 km for 2015. Overlapping among the selected landscape sectors was negligible, with only two sectors having a 0.5% areal overlap.
