<p class="p">In order to test for a distance effect in insect visitation and seed set within each focal field, especially for less mobile small wild bees as reported by Saez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], samples were taken at four distances (2, 16, 30, 44 m) from the focal side, ensuring that the distance to the other (non focal) margins was never less than 55 m. In this way, in case other SNHs were surrounding the field, they were at least 1.25 times further than the focal SNH. At each distance, 12 sunflower heads were selected: eight were left open for natural cross-pollination (‘Open pollination’), two were isolated from any pollinator using fine mesh fibreglass nets (‘Pollinator-excluded’), and the remaining two were subjected to supplemented hand pollination (‘Pollen supplemented’) (further information in Section B in

These three treatments were fundamental for the estimation of the cross-pollination dependence, the pollination deficit and the actual level of pollination. The experiment was repeated in 2015 with modifications to the sampling design according to the results obtained in the first year. Eight fields were selected based on the same criteria as the previous year and in each field only two samples were taken; one at 22 m from the focal side, and one at the field’s furthest point from any border. At each distance 12 plants were subjected to the same three pollination treatments used in the previous year. Since the study was carried out on private land, permission was acquired from the landowners to conduct the study on their land.
