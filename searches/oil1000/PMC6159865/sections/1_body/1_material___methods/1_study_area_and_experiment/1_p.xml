<p class="p">This study was conducted during two consecutive seasons (2014 and 2015) in the region of Pisa, Italy (43° 39’ N, 10° 28’ E, see Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>), an alluvial plain characterized by medium-scale patches of arable crops (mean patch size ± S.D.: 2.0 ± 2.2 ha) and a Mediterranean climate with dry and hot summers and cool and rainy winters (mean annual temperature 14.8°C, August is the hottest month with 24.6°C; mean annual precipitation 866 mm, November is the rainiest month with 137 mm). Elevation ranged from 4 to 75 m a.s.l. Focal fields were selected in a matrix of Mediterranean wood and shrubland, channel banks (often hosting trees and shrubs), herbaceous patches and grassy tracks, with urban agglomerations also present in the area (see Tables D and E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for further information). In this area, sunflower is not irrigated, being an occasional crop in a wheat-based crop rotation where various summer crops follow winter wheat. Often this rotation is broken by a 3 or 4 year alfalfa crop. Bee-keepers commonly place their hives near fields of mass-flowering crops such as sunflower and alfalfa. The maximum hive density in the area is regulated by regional Tuscan law: nomadic apiaries with 50 or more beehives need to be at least 200 m apart.
