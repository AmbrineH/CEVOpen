<p class="p">Additionally, to determine whether pollination level affected the chemical composition of sunflower oil, only for 2014 fields, flour samples of each treatment-field combination were pooled and fatty acid methyl esters determined with a gas chromatograph. Nowadays, breeding programs have led to two main groups of oilseed sunflower hybrids depending on their oil quality: high-oleic and linoleic. In order to take this into account, all cultivars were classified into these two groups (hereafter coded as ‘High-oleic’ and ‘Linoleic’) based on the technical brochures provided by the seed companies.</p>
