<p class="p">In order to calculate the effect of pollinator visitation rates on seed set and oil content, a two-step analysis was implemented. In the first step, the cross-pollination dependence (CPD), defined as the difference between ‘Pollinator-excluded’ and ‘Pollen supplemented’ plants of each cultivar, was determined through two generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a beta error distribution, using seed set and oil content as response variables; pollination treatment, cultivar, year and the interaction between treatment and cultivar as fixed effects; and plots nested within fields as random effects. The predicted CPD for each cultivar was computed from the GLMM models by calculating the least square means (lsmeans) of ‘Pollen supplemented’ and ‘Pollinator-excluded’ plants within each cultivar. CPD estimates for each cultivar were then used to model the effect of visitation rates and the effect of landscape metrics on sunflower seed set and oil content. To verify that there was no spatial autocorrelation among focal fields in terms of cross-pollination dependence, a Mantel test was performed using the 
 <monospace class="monospace">mantel.rtest</monospace> function of the package ade4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] with 9999 random permutations taking into account two distance matrices: one containing the spatial distances between the focal fields, and one containing the distances between the computed CPD values of the cultivars present in those fields.
