<p class="p">In the second step, the effect of visitation rates on seed set and oil content was tested by comparing ‘Pollinator-excluded’ and ‘Open pollination’ plants. Zero visits were associated to the ‘Pollinator-excluded’ plants. Effect of visitation rates was modelled through GLMMs with a beta error distribution with log-transformed visitation rates, CPD of each cultivar and year as fixed effects and plots nested within fields as random effects.</p>
