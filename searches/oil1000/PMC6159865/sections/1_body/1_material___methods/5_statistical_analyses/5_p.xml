<p class="p">To test which of the local and landscape variables affected seed set, a two-step selection process was applied based on data from 2014. A GLMM with a beta error distribution was performed using field as random term (to account for plots being nested within fields) and seed set increment as response variable. Seed set increments were calculated as the difference between the average actual seed set value of ‘Open pollination’ plants per plot and the baseline level due to within-head selfing of that specific cultivar (previously estimated based on ‘Pollinator-excluded’ plants). The predictor variables used in the GLMMs were: type of adjacent SNH, distance from the focal side, CPD, influence of apiaries in the surrounding landscape extracted from the heatmaps and landscape proportion of the following classes: cereals, grassy forage crops, legumes, other annual crops, sunflower, urban areas, woody areal SNH (WA), woody linear SNH (WL), herbaceous areal SNH (HA), herbaceous linear SNH (HL). Firstly, to identify the relevant landscape predictors, we performed an automated model selection (

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]) based on Akaike’s information criterion for small sample sizes (AICc), with adjacent SNH, distance and CPD of each cultivar coerced to be present in all models as covariates, and the proportions of each land use type and the beehives heatmap value as fixed factors. From all the possible combinations of landscape parameters, we excluded those with collinear predictors (Section G.A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). Only those landscape variables with a relative importance greater than 0.2 in the subset of models with ΔAICc &lt; 5 were taken into account (see Section G.B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for details). Secondly, a standard model selection procedure was performed, including adjacent field border typology, the CPD of each cultivar and the previously selected landscape variables as fixed effects, and field as random term.
