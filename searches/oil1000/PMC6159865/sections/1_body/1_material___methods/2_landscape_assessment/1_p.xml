<p class="p">All land use types in the 1 km landscape sector around the 18 focal fields of 2014 were mapped based on aerial photographs (resolution: 2m) [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] using QGIS [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] and later ground validated through field inspections. Mapped elements had a minimum area of 75 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; elements such as woodlands, hedgerows, abandoned fields, agricultural grassy tracks and fallows were considered as SNHs (see Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). The area covered by each land use category was calculated and expressed as a proportion of the total area (see Table E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203990.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for descriptive statistics). Negligible or unevenly represented land uses were omitted from the analysis. Omitted land uses covered altogether 17.3% of the overall evaluated area. In order to take into account the potential influence of managed beehives on the pollination service, during the crop blooming season, all apiaries (groups of beehives) within a range of 1.5 km from the focal fields were identified through ground inspection, interviews of bee-keepers, bee-keepers association and the aid of the local health administration unit who monitors the apiaries in the territory. Though honey bees can have much larger foraging ranges [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], we assumed that the pollination service exerted by these beehives would be inversely proportional to the distance. We therefore used the collected data to build a density map of apiaries (‘heatmap’) adopting an Epanechnikov (quadratic) Kernel with a search radius of 1.5 km, weighted by the number of beehives at each location. The value of the heatmap at the centre of the landscape sector was then considered as a proxy for density of apiaries around each focal field.
