<p class="p">As soon as half of the sunflower plants in a focal field ranged between the reproductive stages R5.3 and R5.6 (from 30 to 60% of head’s florets open), two observation plots per sampling distance, each one with four plants, were simultaneously observed for 10 minutes by two independent observers recording all visits by pollinators. A visit was registered once the visitor touched the flower reproductive structures, regardless of visit duration and number of florets touched. Visitors were identified in the field. When identification was not possible, the visitor was collected for later identification. All bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) were identified at species or morphospecies level; hoverflies and butterflies were classified at family and order level respectively (Syrphidae and Lepidoptera). Subsequently, visitors were grouped into four groups: honey bees (

 <italic class="italic">Bombus</italic> spp), other wild bees (remaining Apiformes) and other pollinators (Syrphidae and Lepidoptera). All surveys were carried once per field between 08:35 and 18:35 in the period 19th June to 2nd August in both years following focal fields’ sunflower bloom, and ensuring that weather standards established by Pollard &amp; Yates [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] were fulfilled (temperature: 31.9 ± 1.9°C; wind: 3 ± 2.9 km/h). Visitation rates, expressed as number of pollinator visits per plant and hour, were derived from the total number of observed visits. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.
