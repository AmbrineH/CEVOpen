<p class="p">For the visitation rate model, the visitation data previously presented were used. The low values of wild pollinators impeded a separate analysis for wild and managed pollinators nor could the existence of an interaction between the two groups be tested. In total, 792 sunflower heads were included in the analysis. Year of sampling was not significant for any of the response variables and thus removed from the final models (seed set model:

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.36, df = 1,
