<p class="p">Since 20 plants were found damaged, in total, 189 ‘Pollinator-excluded’ heads and 191 ‘Pollen supplemented’ heads were included in the analysis to assess the CPD of cultivars. Seed set and oil content were strongly affected by pollination treatments: percentage of fully developed achenes and oil content of ‘Pollinator-excluded’ heads were significantly lower than those of ‘Pollen supplemented’ heads (seed set: z = -10.133,
