<p class="p">The obtained results demonstrate that cross-pollination improves seed set and oil content of sunflower, resulting in higher yields per ha. The degree of CPD varies among cultivars, suggesting that breeding programs have succeeded (at least partially) in raising the level of self-fertility. These findings are in line with previous studies, which state that cross-pollination exerts a direct [
