<p class="p">Our model indicates that visitation rates can enhance both seed set and oil content. Sunflower cultivars having lower levels of self-fertility benefit from increased seed set compared to self-fertile cultivars when they receive over ∼ 25 visits per head per hour, and produce higher oil content when they receive over ∼ 7.5 visits per head per hour. In fact, the level of seed set and oil content of varieties with a high level of self-fertility is never as high as properly pollinated varieties with a lower level of self-fertility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203990.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). This trend poses the dilemma of either ensuring pollination service and taking advantage of it using dependent cultivars, or continuing to develop cultivars with a high self-pollinating ability at the price of losing a bit of the maximum potential productivity of sunflower. At least from an agronomic perspective, both strategies are reasonable and not exclusive.
