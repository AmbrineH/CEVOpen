<p class="p">In the Mediterranean cropping system under study, there was evidence of a pollination deficit which reduced crop productivity. On average, the seed set was 2.4% below its maximum. This pollination deficit may be considered marginal, but any short-term effect (e.g. bad weather, competitive bloom) that lowers visit densities may actually lead to a more severe pollen limitation. In order to ameliorate sunflower pollination in the area, two strategies could be pursued: (i) enhance the presence of managed honey bees in sunflower fields; and (ii) manage the surrounding landscape, and especially SNHs, in order to increase the visits of wild bees in sunflower fields. The first strategy further enhances the reliance on a single species (honey bee), and poses the risk of an insufficient pollination level if this species faces important declines. Therefore, the second strategy may be more rewarding, provided that future research is able to determine the efficacy of individual wild pollinators (field scale) and their overall crop pollination potential (landscape scale) in order to clarify whether they can increase sunflower pollination to its upper limit. In any case, the selection among the different strategies to maintain/ameliorate crop pollination needs to be carefully evaluated based on ecological, economical and agronomical considerations.</p>
