<p class="p">These bees, due to their high resource requirements, are especially sensitive to discontinuity of floral resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Several studies have shown that SNHs (like grasslands, hedgerows, fallows) enhance bumble bee densities [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], whereas other studies stated that these were more related to early mass-flowering crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] or a combination of both SNHs and early mass-flowering crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Likewise, domestic gardens present in urban areas, especially if they are embedded in a matrix of intensively managed agricultural patches, may also positively affect abundance and richness of wild bees due to their high floral density and diversity together with greater nesting sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. In line with these studies, we found that the proportion of woody linear SNHs, other annual crops (e.g. oilseed rape) and urban areas enhanced the pollination service. In the study region, woody linear elements are mainly composed by early flowering species (e.g.

 <italic class="italic">Acer</italic> spp, 
 <italic class="italic">Ulmus</italic> spp, 
 <italic class="italic">Rubus</italic> spp or 
 <italic class="italic">Crataegus</italic> spp [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]), which may increase colony size of social bees by offering key floral resources during the beginning of colony development. On the contrary, our results also indicate that the presence of woody areal SNH does not affect sunflower pollination. This is in line with Hannon et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] who reported that other habitats (such as agricultural areas and hedgerows) can be considered as better foraging areas than woodlots because they provide more accessible floral resources throughout the year.
