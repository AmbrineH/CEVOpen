 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The overall effect of the ‘woody SNH’ on total yield of the adjacent field will depend on the field size and hedgerow height (higher competition for taller lines of trees). The larger the field, the smaller the relative hedgerow effect. Since the fields in the study region are relatively small, the edge effect of hedgerows visible in the first sampling point (2 m distance from the focal SNH) may have had a non-negligible effect on the overall yield.
