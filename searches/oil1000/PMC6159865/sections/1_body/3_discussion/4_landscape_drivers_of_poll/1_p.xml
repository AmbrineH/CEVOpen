<p class="p">From a landscape perspective, pollination service is the result of the interactions between land use patterns, local pollinator community and managed pollinators. Landscape patches may support pollinators by providing nesting opportunities, floral resources or shelter [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], but they may also compete with each other for pollinators if they have overlapping flowering periods. On the one hand, late mass-flowering crops that are to some extent self-incompatible (as sunflower) need to fulfil their cross-pollination requirements with high densities of pollinators, but these high numbers can only be sustained in the agroecosystem if there are enough early-flowering resources (e.g. oilseed rape or natural trees) at the beginning of the season. On the other hand, SNHs can provide suitable nesting sites and continuous floral resources preventing gaps in food supply in-between crop blooms thus increasing the abundance of pollinators, but that, as a drawback, may reduce pollination service delivery by diluting pollinator densities if they co-flower with the crop of interest. Sunflower and other mass-flowering crops generate huge pollination demands during short periods, forcing them to mainly rely on social pollinator species such as bumble bees and honey bees.
