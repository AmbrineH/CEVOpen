 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and ongoing nomadism conducted by local bee-keepers to produce sunflower honey, which is a common practice in Central Italy. On the other hand, the very low visitation rates by wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies might have been caused by: (i) the observation plot method, which commonly underestimates bee species richness in agricultural habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], but, in the case of the present work, may also have introduced a possible bias in bee abundance; (ii) a truly scarce presence of these groups in the study area; or (iii) a shifting due to competition with honey bees. The concern about these presumably under-sampled groups is based on findings from other studies which demonstrated that they may have a greater pollination efficiency or may improve the efficacy of pollination by honey bees [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, the great prevalence of honey bees and the good fit of the data with the measured visitation rates, leads us to believe that the contribution of wild pollinators is rather limited in case honey bees are present. In spite of everything, since flower visitation may be a poor proxy for pollination effectiveness [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] and we did not measure pollinatorsâ€™ visiting time, number of florets touched, or single visit pollen deposition, caution is needed in data interpretation.
