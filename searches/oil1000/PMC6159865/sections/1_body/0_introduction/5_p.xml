<p class="p">Sunflower has historically been an important crop in Central Italy, so that during the 1970s several studies were performed to identify its key pollinators. In these studies, the most abundant visitors were honey bees, which is not surprising since the activity of bee-keepers has also been traditionally linked to this crop for honey production [

However, following the introduction of new sunflower cultivars which are often highly self-fertile, the relevance of insect pollination in sunflower may have decreased. On the other hand, since the market prefers high-quality oil for human consumption, high oleic sunflower varieties have been recently introduced in the area. As a result, the request for high-quality oil could stress the importance of pollinating agents, which may increase the sunflower oil quality, as demonstrated for other pollinator-dependent crops [
