<p class="p">Proximity of SNH patches is usually a factor which positively affects visitation rates and crop yield [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, SNHs have often been related to crop pollination independently of their shape (linear or areal patches) and cover typology (grassy or woody patches), which are known to be two key factors in shaping vegetation communities [
