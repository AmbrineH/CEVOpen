<p class="p">One of the main challenges when developing innovative and sustainable cropping systems is to maximise ecosystem service provisioning while securing food production for the future. Crop pollination is a frequently discussed issue in this regard, but the complexity of crop-pollinator interactions does not allow for an unequivocal interpretation of results and simple management guidelines for all pollinator-dependent crops. Analysing data from 1961 to 2008, Garibaldi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] showed that average yield increased while yield variability decreased with decreasing dependence on pollinators. In the meantime, crop cultivar selection has greatly modified crop characteristics towards higher levels of self-fertility and higher quality products for human consumption, which may alter the relationship between crops and pollinators and consequently the effect of cross-pollination on yield quantity and quality.
