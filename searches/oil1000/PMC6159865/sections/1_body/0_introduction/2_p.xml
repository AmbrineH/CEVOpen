 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] raises the need to examine the delivery of pollination services [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], as well as to determine whether crop yield is already being compromised by pollination deficits [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Notwithstanding an increase in the global stock of commercial honey bee colonies by ∼ 45% from 1961 to 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], consistent declines in colony numbers were simultaneously registered in central European countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and in the U.S.A. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The main causes for worldwide pollinator declines are habitat loss or fragmentation, land use changes and modern agricultural practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These declines may result in global risks of food security and ecosystem stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] (nonetheless, some controversy has arisen around this issue, e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]) and have caused concern among scientists, policy makers and the general public about possible imbalances between the pollination levels that are needed and those actually supplied [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. To prevent an ecologically and agronomically risky situation, several strategies have been proposed, such as: (i) diversification of the available crop pollinators via the protection or domestication of other bee species [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], (ii) conservation or incorporation of semi-natural habitat patches (hereafter SNH) into the agricultural matrix [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], or (iii) reduction in pesticide use [
