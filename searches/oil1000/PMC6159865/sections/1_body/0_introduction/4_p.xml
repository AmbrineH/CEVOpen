<p class="p">Sunflower (
 <italic class="italic">Helianthus annuus</italic> L.) is an economically important oilseed crop in the European Union. From 2006 to 2016 its cultivated area increased by ∼ 26% [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] with an average production of 7.6 million tonnes per year. Since this crop depends, at least partially, on insect mediated pollination, the role of managed honey bees (
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera</italic> L.) and wild bees has long been investigated [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The positive yield response of sunflower to honey bee visits has been demonstrated by many authors [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], although others have noted that their behaviour is not adequate to guarantee a sufficient cross-pollination on hybrid cultivars [
 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. These contrasting results suggest that, despite not being the most efficient pollinators, they may be effective enough given their high numbers. On the contrary, the role of wild bees in sustaining sunflower pollination is less clear, since it appears more context dependent as a result of the wide diversity of wild bee species with, very often, important behavioural differences. In the native area of sunflower, North America, many different wild bees visit commercial sunflower [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], while wild 
 <italic class="italic">Helianthus</italic> species are visited by up to 400 native wild bee species, including many oligolectic bees [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In addition, wild pollinators may indirectly increase sunflower pollination by affecting honey bee behaviour during sunflower visits [

 <xref rid="pone.0203990.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], even if this hypothesis is not supported by data in other regions [
