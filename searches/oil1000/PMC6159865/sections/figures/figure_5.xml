  <title class="title">Effect of landscape variables on pollination success.</title>
  <p class="p">Pollination success (expressed as mean increment of seed set) is modelled in relation to (A) beehives heatmap, (B) proportion of herbaceous areal SNHs, (C) proportion of herbaceous linear SNHs, (D) proportion of woody linear SNHs, (E) proportion of urban areas, (F) proportion of other annual crops. Results are based on GLMM. Solid lines show predicted values, grey ribbons are upper and lower confidence intervals at the 95% level. Plots are constructed holding all other variables constant in their median value for numeric variables and most common category for factors.</p>
