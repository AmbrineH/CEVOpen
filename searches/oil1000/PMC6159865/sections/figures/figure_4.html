 <p> Effect on seed set (% of fully developed achenes) of (A) pollination treatment, (B) year. Dots represent the predicted least-squares means of the GLMM averaged over (A) years and (B) pollination treatments. Bars represent the confidence intervals at the 95% level (back-transformed from the logit scale). Letters indicate statistically different groups at the 0.05 significance level. Tests were performed on the log odds ratio scale. </p>
