 <p> Digitalized maps of a subset of the sampled landscape sectors are here shown to illustrate the adopted design: for each of the three focal side typologies (no SNH, grassy SNH and woody SNH; columns in the figure) fields were chosen so that a gradient of landscape complexity (percentage of SNHs) was represented in a 1 km-radius buffer, ranging from simplified ones (bottom row) to more complex ones (top row). </p>
