 <p> Effect of visitation rates and CPD on seed set and oil content. (A) Effect of visitation rates on seed set over three unique values of ‘CPD seed set’ (‘Low’: 15% CPD; ‘Medium’: 45% CPD; ‘High’: 75% CPD) chosen to represent this continuous variable in two dimensions; (B) Effect of visitation rates on seed set over three unique values of ‘CPD oil content’ (‘Low’: 5% CPD; ‘Medium’: 10% CPD; ‘High’: 15% CPD) chosen to represent this continuous variable in two dimensions. Results are based on GLMM. Solid lines show predicted values, grey ribbons are upper and lower confidence intervals at the 95% level. </p>
