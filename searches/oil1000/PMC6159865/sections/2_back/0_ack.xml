 <p class="p">We are very grateful to all QuESSA partners, who actively collaborated in the development of the common protocols. We thank Massimo Sbrana, Giacomo Nardi, Fernando Pellegrini and all the workers of Centro di Ricerche Agro-Ambientali ‘Enrico Avanzi’ for their contribution to the fieldwork. This study would not have been possible without the collaboration of all farmers. We especially thank them for sharing their visions and knowledge with us. Lastly, we want to thank Marino Quaranta for his help in bee identification.</p>
