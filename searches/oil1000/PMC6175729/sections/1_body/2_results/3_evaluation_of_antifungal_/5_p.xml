<p id="par0125" class="p">Regarding the antifungal activity of the two nanoemulsion formulations at the MIC, they did not demonstrate the expected effects (with respect to the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assays) when applied on cheese slices, as fungal growth was higher than on the control slices. Such a result may be due to the high water activity, as slices were immersed for 30Â min in the nanoemulsions.
