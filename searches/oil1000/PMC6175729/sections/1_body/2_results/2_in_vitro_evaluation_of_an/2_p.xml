<p id="par0095" class="p">Regarding the antifungal activity of nanoemulsions, for formulation A the MICs obtained were 0.26 μg/ml for 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp., 0.113 μg/ml for 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp., and 1.62 μg/ml for 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. As for formulation B, the values of MIC were 0.32 μg/ml, 0.1 μg/ml, and 0.8 μg/ml for 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp., respectively. The MICs found for nanoemulsion A were thus higher than those for nanoemulsion B, for the three evaluated fungi. Such a result was probably due to the higher oil of oregano content in formulation B (5%) compared with formulation A (3.25%).
