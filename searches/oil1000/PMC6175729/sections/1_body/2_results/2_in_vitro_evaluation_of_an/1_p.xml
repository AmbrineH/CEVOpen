<p id="par0090" class="p">The MIC of non-encapsulated oregano essential oil was determined for each fungus. For 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp., the MIC values were 0.2 μg/ml and 0.3 μg/ml, respectively. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp., it was noticed that the fungus did not grow at all, even at the lowest concentration of oregano essential oil tested. Such a result may indicate that this genus of fungus was very susceptible to the inhibitory effect of oregano oil when compared with the inhibitory effect of oregano essential oil on 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. (
