<p id="par0085" class="p">As expected, fungal growth occurred mainly on the surface of the cheese samples (56% of the contaminated samples), as Minas Padr√£o cheese is often exposed to the environment when it is submitted to the maturation process. The genera of fungi with the highest occurrence on the surface were 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp., followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Scopulariopsis</italic> sp., with percentages of 67%, 18%, and 5% of total, respectively. However, in the interior of the cheeses 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp. occurred at a higher percentage (33%) in terms of contaminated area, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Scopulariopsis</italic> sp. (both with 14%), and finally by 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. with 12%.
