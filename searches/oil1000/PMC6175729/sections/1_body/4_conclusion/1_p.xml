<p id="par0170" class="p">The data obtained in this study proved the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antifungal activity of nanoemulsions encapsulating oregano essential oil, against the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. The antifungal activity was verified on Minas Padr√£o cheese slices inoculated with the same fungal genera. In both types of assays (
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and cheese slices), 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. presented higher resistance to the antifungal effect of oregano essential oil than 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp.
