<p id="par0025" class="p">Among the nanostructures which can be produced, there are the nanoemulsions, which are emulsions with mean droplet size of 20–200 nm. Nanoemulsions exhibit high kinetic stability and are therefore stable for a long period of storage.

 </xref> Among the production methods used to obtain nanoemulsions with average droplet sizes smaller than 50 nm, there are low-energy methods, such as the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method. Such methods are based on the change in solubility of non-ionic polyethoxylated surfactants with temperature.
