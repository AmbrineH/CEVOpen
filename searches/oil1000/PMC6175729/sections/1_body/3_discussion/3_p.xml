 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref> In this study, when the inhibitory effect of the non-encapsulated oregano essential oil was compared with those of the two nanoemulsion formulations (A and B), it was found that for 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp., the encapsulation of the essential oil improved its antifungal effect, whereas for 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp., the use of oregano essential oil encapsulation diminished its inhibitory effect against this genus.
