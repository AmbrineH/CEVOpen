<p id="par0055" class="p">Eighteen samples of fungi-contaminated Minas Padrão cheese were obtained. The fungi were isolated from both the surface and interior of the cheese. A mass of 10 g of each contaminated cheese sample (surface and interior), previously homogenized and diluted, were inoculated on DRBC agar and incubated at 25 °C for 7 days. The colonies of different morphological types were isolated in potato dextrose + chloramphenicol (PDA + C) agar, and after identification by the microculture technique, the fungi were classified by genera.
