 </xref>. The components of the nanoemulsions (sunflower oil, surfactants, deionized water, and oregano essential oil) were mixed and magnetically stirred at 1350 rpm, and this mixture was heated to 65 °C. The two formulations of nanoemulsions produced are described in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Afterwards, this mixture was cooled rapidly by placing the dispersion in jacketed vessels cooled by water at 3 °C, under magnetic stirring, until it reached room temperature (cooling rate: 10 °C/min). The heating/cooling cycles were repeated twice.
