 <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic> subjected to nutrient deprivation shows growth retardation except under P- limitation. Nitrogen and phosphorous limitation played a major role in lipid accumulation. The qualitative metabolomics showed a variable shift in the metabolite flux in response to different stress conditions. A crosstalk between metabolites, namely citric acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid and trehalose, can be hypothesized to have greater impact on the production of biomass and lipid accumulation. To our knowledge, this report in the marine microalgae 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> is a new paradigm to elucidate the molecular changes in the basis of metabolite redistribution subjected to nutrient-limiting conditions leading to insights on the production of biomass, biofuels and bioproducts (B
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) in non-model systems. In conclusion, marine strain 
 <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic> with high biomass and higher lipid productivity was analysed where shuffling of certain metabolites when subjected to stress will dictate the profile changes that may prove to be a benchmark for over-expression of lipids without compromising growth. Further characterization of this strain may be a critical step towards making algae-derived biofuels economically competitive for industrial production.
