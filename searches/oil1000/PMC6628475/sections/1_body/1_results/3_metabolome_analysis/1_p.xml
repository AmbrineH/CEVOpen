<p id="Par35" class="p">Metabolite levels are tightly controlled during the starvation condition to enhance the chances of survival. A number of changes were observed in terms of growth and biochemical profiles under different nutrient starvation conditions. Therefore, to understand the molecular profiling, we have employed qualitative metabolomics tool to evaluate the changes occurring during stress which will provide new insights for enhancing the lipid production. The metabolite extraction and derivatization were carried out in all the samples of

 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref>” section. A total number of ~ 62 metabolite peaks were obtained after manual curation and analysis of raw data. The most common phenomenon observed in the raw data files is the repetition of same metabolite as a result of alternate derivatization [
