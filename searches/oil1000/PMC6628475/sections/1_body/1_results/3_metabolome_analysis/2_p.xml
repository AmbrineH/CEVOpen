<p id="Par36" class="p">Certain metabolites were common in all stress conditions, while certain were common in two conditions, as discussed later. The fold change for all the metabolites subjected to stress conditions either upregulated or downregulated as compared to the control is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a–c. (The list for metabolites with their representative numeric code is included.) In N- cells, many metabolites such as valine, trehalose, citric acid, mannose, linoleic acid, trans-9-octadecanoic acid, talose were found to increase &gt; twofold, while malic acid, myo-inositol, glucose, polyunsaturated fats were predominantly decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). In P- cells, upregulated metabolites include citric acid, galactose, mannose, threose, while myo-inositol, glucose, azelaic acid, sorbose, a-tocopherol were decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). In S- cells, metabolites such as trehalose, mannitol, galactose, mannose were increased, while malic acid, glutamic acid, citric acid, myo-inositol decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c).
