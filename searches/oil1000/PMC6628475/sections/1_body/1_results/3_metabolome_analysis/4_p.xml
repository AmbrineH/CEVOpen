<p id="Par38" class="p">An essential metabolite of interest, citric acid, was found to be upregulated nearly by fivefold in only N- and P- conditions. It seems to be an important metabolite in upregulating the FA biosynthesis as it increased in both N- and P- conditions where lipid accumulation has also increased, while it decreased in S- where lipid accumulation is much lower as compared to other two conditions. Also, 2-ketoglutaric acid was found to increase in the similar conditions by twofold, both together assume to divert flux towards FA biosynthesis [

Another metabolite of importance is trehalose that was found enhanced fivefold in N- and S- but not in P- conditions that may presumably play a significant role in cell growth regulation. Significant metabolite changes occur when subjected to nutrient depletion (N-, P- and S-) conditions, and each of these changes will affect cell growth and lipid productivities. Henceforth, our metabolomic data provide us with the schematic model to understand flux diversion that leads to changes in lipid productivity and growth rate under different nutrient stresses (Fig.Â
