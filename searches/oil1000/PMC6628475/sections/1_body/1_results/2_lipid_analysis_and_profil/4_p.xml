<p id="Par34" class="p">On initial day (control) of inoculation, FAME profiling patterns showed highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) than monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). Under N- conditions, 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> exhibits an increase in MUFAs (up to 41% of total FAME) with considerable decrease in SFAs (to ~ 35%) and PUFAs (to ~ 24%) by the end of the tenth day. This can be a result of the oxidative damage to PUFAs under stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] or recycling of membrane lipids towards TAGs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Although P- limitation induced lipid biosynthesis, at the end of deprivation period, the FAME pattern suggests decrease in SFAs (to ~ 32.5%) and considerable increase in MUFAs (to ~ 24.5%) and PUFAs (to ~ 43%). In S- depleted cells, SFAs increased (to ~ 52%) with a little upregulation in MUFAs (to ~ 20%) while PUFAs decreased (Fig.
