<p id="Par31" class="p">Lipid accumulation in algae is induced normally due to environmental stress, particularly when deprived of certain nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, sulphur or certain metals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. In microalgae, nutrient deprivation to enhance the production of lipids is a well-observed phenomenon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. During stress-induced lipid accumulation, the lack of essential nutrients such as N, P and S restricts the capacity of cellular division as a result of which the organism shifts towards alternative pathways for inorganic carbon assimilation, thus shuffling the carbon towards the storage biomolecules, i.e. TAGs. To demonstrate the effect of different nutrient deprivation on the synthesis of TAGs, total lipid was extracted from cells and analysed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) as described in “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref>”. The TLC plate loaded with extracted lipids from samples of the three stress conditions (N-, P- and S-) led to a sharp increase in the TAG content in 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic>, where TAG seems to increase with the progression of duration of starvation (data not shown). Further, the samples were quantified using GC–MS analysis to evaluate the lipid productivity subjected to nutrient stress. Sulphur (S-) depletion induced TAG formation to a much lesser extent as compared to other nutrient-deprived conditions. The increase in TAG content can be observed from the second day itself in N- condition, whereas in P- and S- depletion TAG accumulation was observed after the fourth day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). In P- depletion, a gradual increase in TAG content was observed without compromising cell growth. Under N- stress, the TAG production has been initiated on day 2 itself and reached maximum by the tenth day, but also lead to severe growth inhibition depicting metabolic changes within the cells. In marine microalgae 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic>, S- depletion lead to inhibition in growth after day 6 but in comparison with N- and P-, the increase in lipid content was not very significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a).
