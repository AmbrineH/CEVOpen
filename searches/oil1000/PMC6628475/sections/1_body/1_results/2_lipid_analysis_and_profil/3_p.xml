<p id="Par33" class="p">The FAME content per cell seems to be higher in N- stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a), where a constant increase in lipid accumulation was observed, i.e. reaching up to &gt; 40% of dry cell weight, while in P- the lipid content per cell remains low as compared to N- cells but is considerably higher than control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a inset). Overall, the time-dependent changes in lipid content for 10 days in different stress conditions are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a (inset). In the present study, 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> subjected to N- has shown enhanced neutral lipid content, whereas P- tends to have a steady increase (Fig.
