Several studies have shown that microalgae growth depends on an adequate supply of essential macronutrient elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon), major ions (Mg

 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> was grown under continuous photoautotrophic conditions. The results demonstrated that this strain had severe effect on growth in nitrogen (N-) deprivation, i.e. growth was shunted within 4 days of deprivation after which no change in biomass was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). In sulphur (S-) deprivation and phosphorous (P-) deprivation, no significant change in growth rate was observed till the sixth day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). In 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri,</italic> the effect of sulphur (S-) depletion on growth was delayed as compared to nitrogen deprivation. Inset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a) demonstrates the cultures in different deprivation conditions which show growth retardation as well as loss in pigmentation (indicated by pale green colour). The nitrogen concentration in the same medium deficit in N-, P- and S- during the microalgae culture was also estimated. In P- and S- conditions, the nitrogen utilization was slower when compared to the control. Most of the nitrogen was utilized by microalgae at the end of the sixth day in the control, whereas in P- and S- conditions it was completely consumed by the end of the tenth day. This pattern is also observed in the growth profile as the cell growth slows down and shifts towards stationary phase.
