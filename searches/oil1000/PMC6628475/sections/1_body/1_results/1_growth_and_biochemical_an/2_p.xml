 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b–d shows the pigment (total chlorophyll), protein and carbohydrate profiles subjected to different nutrient deprivation conditions. The total chlorophyll content was severely reduced under N- stress, while S- deprivation leads to a steady loss of pigments over time. Phosphorus (P-) deprived cells maintained their net chlorophyll levels up to 4–6 days followed by decline in prolonged stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). During N- stress, the chlorophyll content was severely deteriorated within 2–4 days of starvation, while P- and S- cells showed a slow decrease. Photosynthetic machinery is the primary component to be affected by severe nutrient deprivation, especially in case of nitrogen deprivation as reported in most of the microalgal strains [
