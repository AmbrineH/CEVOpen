<p id="Par30" class="p">The total protein content was also decreased rapidly in case of nitrogen-deprived cells and reached the minimum by the end of the second day. In case of S- deprivation, the decrease was steady over time, whereas in P- stress the protein content started declining after the fourth day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). During P- and S- conditions, the protein content in the cells declined slowly, but the initial impact on protein machinery was not adverse as seen during N- starvation. When algae are subjected to nutrient deprivation, the cells start to reduce the protein build up and catabolize proteins to use the carbon skeleton to synthesize storage molecules. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d demonstrates the changes occurring during nutrient stress in the carbohydrate content. Under N- deprived cells, an initial rise in the total carbohydrate content was observed on day 2 (~ onefold), after which it has declined rapidly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d). Our presumption predicts that 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> isolated from marine waters may certainly not be a predominant carbohydrate producing strain. Under P- and S- deprivation, an increase in the carbohydrate content was observed till the fourth day. Increase in carbohydrate as a storage molecule has been observed in many algal species, mainly fresh water species, when the cells are subjected to nutrient deprivation.
