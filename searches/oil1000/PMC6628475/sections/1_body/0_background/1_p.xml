<p id="Par24" class="p">The global energy demand is increasing day by day as the energy consumption is rising and is expected to increase by 53% within the next two decades. The fossil-derived diesel has been an important source of transportation fuel, but a significant need has come up to look for alternate sources of energy as the conventional source is non-regenerable and costs a lot to the environmental sustainability. The fossil fuel reserves are limited, and as their sources perish, the world will face a huge hike in fuel prices. Since the food and fuel prices are interdependent, the increase in fuel prices will ultimately influence the cost of food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The rapid increase in energy consumption globally has raised the requirement for the development of sustainable renewable energy sources. In the need of current scenario, the production of biodiesel has increased considerably in the recent past with annual production reaching over billions of litres. Mostly waste cooking oil, soybean oil, palm oil, etc. have been used for the production of biodiesel. However, this conventional mode of production, perhaps in the near future, will lead to competition for land usage in terms of fuel and food. Hence, microalgae are being looked upon as a potential source for biodiesel production and have gained considerable attention because of their capability to utilize sunlight and water to convert atmospheric CO
