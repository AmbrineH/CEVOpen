<p id="Par27" class="p">Despite the significance of various metabolic products in regulating the cellular dynamics, and mechanisms that control the partitioning of these metabolites into distinct carbon-storing molecules in algae, their role in algal physiology and biofuel precursors production is poorly illustrated. In the present work, we have focused on understanding the phenomenon of nutrient deprivation as a tool to enhance lipid productivity as well as the associated changes in the metabolic profiles and biochemical composition of indigenous marine microalga 
 <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic> (I) under three different nutrient limitations, viz. nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur. Previous studies on 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> revealed its potential as a suitable candidate for biofuel production, with lipid content around 40–60% of dry cell weight [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The significance of selecting this indigenous marine microalgae 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> (I) is mainly due to its better biomass productivity and higher lipid content as reported earlier [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Our rationale highlights up on building a crosstalk between the metabolomic changes and cellular dynamics in terms of biomass and lipid productivities, when this marine microalgae is subjected to nutrient deprivation.
