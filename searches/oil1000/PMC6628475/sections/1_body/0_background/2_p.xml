<p id="Par25" class="p">Microalgae can produce biomass along with the accumulation of large quantities of lipids/triacylglycerols (TAGs) for biodiesel production. The major advantage for the production of biodiesel from microalgae is their ability to produce large amount of biomass and lipid photosynthetically, and their ability to grow on non-arable land using saline and/or waste waters that make them free from any competition with resources required for growing food [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Other advantages include their capability to sequester greenhouse gas, a major environmental benefit as the world is facing huge climatic change manifested with conventional fuel utilization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]; their ability to absorb nutrients from waste waters helping in bioremediation, which is both economical and environment friendly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]; and their ability to synthesize certain high-value co-products such as OMEGAs, astaxanthin, lutein, tocopherols that are essential for industrial production in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. One important lead with microalgal-TAG-based biodiesel-derived fuels is their easy integration into the current infrastructure of transportation fuels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Some microalgae can produce TAGs when grown under heterotrophic mode [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], and under autotrophic mode of growth, numerous factors tend to stimulate lipid production such as nutrient availability, light, temperature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Even through microalgae hold potential feedstock for the production of lipids, the accumulation of oil tends to amplify under stress conditions but perhaps the major concern is inhibition of growth, thus simultaneously hampering biomass [
