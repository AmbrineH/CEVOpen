<p id="Par26" class="p">Despite such a huge potential microalgae hold for a sustainable source of renewable energy, a number of challenges exist in way for their commercialization as biofuel source. Few microalgal species have been identified as a promising source for industrial-level biofuel, nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical productions, but various research efforts are still being carried out to make microalgal biofuels cost-effective and sustainable. The diverse genera of algae lead to their exceptionally wide range of lipid and metabolic profile which is a result of their dynamic environmental condition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Hence, detailed study on selection, culturing condition optimization, large-scale bioreactor development, bioengineering for better biomass and biofuel, improvement in biomass harvesting and other downstream processing is being carried out to reduce the production cost [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Several attempts have been made to improve strain performance, harvesting, extraction and culture systems to bring down the economic input for large-scale production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. The lipid composition among microalgae varies between 10 and 60% (dw) because of the wide range of strains as well as the environmental conditions in which they occur and/or are cultivated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. The primary requirement for industrial production of microalgae-based biodiesel is the screening for conditions that induce high lipid productivity in fast-growing microalgae that can fulfil the criteria for sustainable biofuels. Henceforth, in-depth understanding of such phenomenon might also provide deeper insights into the bioengineering of industrially feasible strains. A number of biochemical strategies have been used in this direction to enhance lipid and biomass production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Various environmental factors affect the microalgal cultivation, altering its biomass and biochemical composition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Menon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] showed that generation of specific intracellular reactive oxygen species (siROS) during stress acts as a common signal that affects various metabolic pathways including lipid biosynthesis. The availability of nutrients affects the microalgal growth as well as their lipid and metabolic compositions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Hence, limiting nutrient availability in the media to induce metabolic variations and lipid accumulation in microalgae is an important alternative strategy to understand the initiation and storage of TAGs in the system.
