<p id="Par44" class="p">Trehalose was found to be upregulated in nitrogen- and sulphur-deprived cells. Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide that performs a variety of functions, from carbon storage to carbon metabolism, protection from osmotic stress, stabilization of membranes and proteins, removal of aberrant storage material, protection from oxygen radicals, induction of autophagy [

Although sulphur deprivation does not show growth inhibition initially, later growth shunts probably because of increase in trehalose accumulation. This seems interesting as the presence of citric acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid in nitrogen and phosphorous starvation might induce lipid accumulation, while trehalose presence in nitrogen and sulphur depletion might result in growth retardation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). As a result, a crosstalk between these metabolites such as citric acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid and trehalose might be important for the production of biomass as well as lipid accumulation in marine microalgae
