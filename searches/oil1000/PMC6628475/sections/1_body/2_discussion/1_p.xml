<p id="Par39" class="p">Growing bioenergy needs demand urgent action to generate renewable fuels at feasible cost. Algae seem to be a promising bioresource in terms of economically feasible bioenergy producer, yet the information regarding cellular dynamics of microalgal cells is fairly poor. The primary focus in algal research has been the enhancement of lipid production employing nutrient stress while biomass productivities are essentially compromised. A number of strategies, such as nutrient deprivation, light intensity, temperature variation, carbon dioxide have been employed to reach specific goals, but the cellular behaviour under these conditions is yet not well established. Under the adequate supply of nutrients including C, N, P, S and light, depending on the strain selection, the biomass productivity can be high but the lipid content seems to be as low as 5% w/w or even less [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. During unfavourable conditions, the microalgal growth and photosynthetic activity cease, while the excess energy gets assimilated as lipids and/or carbohydrates. Metabolically, there is always a competition between biomass and storage molecule assimilation, which governs and channelizes the carbon flux either towards biomass accumulation or towards lipid and carbohydrate synthesis. Depending on the requirement, a metabolic shift can switch the photosynthetic assimilation of inorganic carbon from biomass synthesis to energy storage metabolism [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Changes in the environmental conditions such as light intensity, nutrient limitation, salinity, temperature, pH, and culture age invariably affect the lipid content of microalgae [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. Oleaginous microalgae can utilize their lipid metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis and accumulation of lipids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. Some of these oleaginous microalgae can even store TAGs up to 40% to 70% of their dry weight [

Henceforth, the competition in terms of biomass (or) lipid accumulation depends upon the different levels of perturbation [

 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> were demonstrated under different nutrient deprivations. While growth was severely hampered under N- deprivation, the cells were able to withstand phosphorus or sulphur absence fairly well, although after 6 days the S- cells showed high decline in growth. Perhaps the nutrient deprivation can be attributed to the evolutionary behaviour of microalgae, for example in marine waters the phosphorous availability is quite dynamic, and hence, these photosynthetic organisms do have specialized responses to maintain their growth under certain nutrient depletion conditions [
