<p id="Par42" class="p">A number of studies on 
 <italic class="italic">Chlamydomonas</italic> have shown a strict metabolite regulatory network balancing the cellular processes under stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>]. Various chromatographic techniques are used for the identification and analysis of metabolites from biological samples. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) has become a popular technique to analyse metabolomic phenotypes, where GC separates the volatile compounds depending on their mass and polarity, while MS enables reproducible analyte fragmentation and identification [

The metabolomic analysis of the cells subjected to nutrient starvation has shown a number of metabolites, which had low match scores and/or duplicated because of the varying degree of sialylation. A total number of 62 metabolites were screened and analysed on the basis of their relative peak areas from deprived conditions. Since different conditions gave different metabolic profiles, we tried to explore those that can give a probable crosstalk among the various stresses. Overall, the downregulated metabolites were more or less common among all conditions, such as malic acid, sorbose, glucose, myo-inositol (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Also, sugar molecules obtained from polysaccharide degradation usually increased in starved cells, indicating a cut down of stored carbohydrates to provide carbon skeleton for lipid synthesis. In all stress conditions, two metabolites, i.e. 1-propionyl proline and mannose, were found to be upregulated compared to the control. Martel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>] reported increase in mannose, a C-2 epimer of glucose, which can be derived from the digestion of polysaccharides and glycoproteins under the nitrogen-deprived condition in 
 <italic class="italic">Isochrysis galbana</italic>. However, in the present study increase in mannose seems to be higher in the N- condition due to cumulative breakdown of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, whereas in P- and S- stresses it may be due to glycoprotein metabolism alone. The predominant fatty acids depicted in the analysis are hexadecanoic acid, eicosanoic acid (arachidic acid) and trans-9 octadecanoic acid (elaidic acid) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Myo-inositol, a sugar alcohol, has also been reduced many folds under all the stress conditions. Inositol is an important component of structural lipids and may get disrupted during stress. In plants, the hexophosphate of inositol serves as a phosphate reserve [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>] and the same mechanism may also be present in these microalgae as well because of the decreased content of myo-inositol in P- cells as compared to N- or S- cells. Henceforth, phosphate derivatives of myo-inositol might be broken down to provide phosphorous for cellular activities under P- deprivation. Also, sorbose, another monosaccharide, and azelaic acid also seem to be utilized for cell survival in 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic>. Malic acid, an intermediate of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is decreased during stress and predicts the downplay of the Calvin cycle. The decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate leads to the generation of NAD(P)H, and both the pyruvate and NAD(P)H can be utilized for FA biosynthesis leading to lipid accumulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>]. During C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> carbon fixation in plants, malate provides CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to Calvin cycle and such similar mechanism may co-exist in some marine diatoms and algae [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic>, the reduced photosynthetic machinery might also lead to the break down of malate as it will not be required to transport CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>] and also involved in the regulation of photosynthesis and macronutrient uptake and utilization [
