<p id="Par48" class="p">The samples were analysed for changes in the biochemical constituents [pigments (total chlorophyll), proteins, carbohydrates] subjected to the nutrient stress. For estimation of pigments, 1 mL of culture was pellet down and resuspended in 1 mL of absolute methanol. The suspension was vortexed briefly and incubated at 4 °C for an hour to extract the pigments completely. The debris was pellet down, and the suspension was used to measure absorbance at 665, 652 and 470 nm to calculate total chlorophyll content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>]. Protein estimation was done using modified biuret method. Total soluble proteins were extracted using 1 N NaOH in 25% methanol as extraction buffer. 1–2 mL of culture was pellet down and resuspended in 1 mL of extraction buffer and incubated at 80 °C for 15 min. The sample was cooled down to room temperature and centrifuged at high speed to remove debris. One hundred microlitres of extract was mixed with 50 µL of CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution (0.21% CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in 30% NaOH), incubated at RT for 10 min and its absorbance was measured at 310 nm [
