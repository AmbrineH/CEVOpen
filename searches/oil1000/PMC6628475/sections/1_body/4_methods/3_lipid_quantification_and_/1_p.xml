 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and visualized as TAGs by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on a silica gel plate. Briefly, ~ 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells were collected in a glass tube with Teflon-lined screw cap. Lipid extraction was done using methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v) containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Two millilitres of methanol/chloroform mix was added to the cell pellet and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with shaking. Thereafter, chloroform (1 mL) and water (1.8 mL) were added to the tubes, mixed vigorously, and centrifuged at 3000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> to separate the mix into two phases. The lower organic phase containing the extracted lipids was transferred to a new glass tube with the help of a Pasteur pipette. Extracted organic phase was dried at 50 °C under stream of nitrogen (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) to evaporate the solvent completely and resuspended in CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/MeOH (100 µL, 6:1 v/v). Fifty microlitres of this extract was applied to a silica 60 thin-layer chromatography plate (Sigma-Aldrich) and run with a solvent system of heptane/ethanol/acetone (70:30:1, v/v/v) to resolve the neutral lipids. The TAG band was identified by staining co-migrated TAG standard with iodine vapours [

 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells were acid-hydrolysed and methyl-esterified using 2% sulphuric acid in methanol (300 µL) for 2 h at 80 °C. Prior to the reaction, 50 µg of heptadecanoic acid (Alfa Aesar) was added as internal standard. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted using 300 µL of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution and 300 µL of hexane. The mixture was vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 3000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 3 min to separate the phases. One microlitre of hexane layer was injected into a 7890A gas chromatography (GC) mass spectrometry (MS) system equipped with a 7000 GC/MS triple quadrupole system (Agilent) [
