 <sup class="sup">9</sup> cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min and immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen. Metabolites were extracted using methanol, chloroform and water by repeated freezing and thawing. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold methanol/chloroform/water (10:3:1) and vortexed briefly. The cells were frozen again in liquid nitrogen for 1–2 min and thawed on ice for 4–5 min. Freezing and thawing cycles were repeated five times with intermittent vortexing. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 3 min at 4 °C to get rid of cell debris. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.2-µm filter. One hundred microlitres of supernatant was taken and vacuum-dried at 4 °C. The dried leftover was dissolved in 10 µL of freshly prepared methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (40 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in pyridine) and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with shaking. To the above solution, 90 µL of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 3 min, and the supernatant was taken for the GC/MS analysis. The samples were run on GC–MS/MS, and the data were analysed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (
