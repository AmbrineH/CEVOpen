<p class="p">To summarize, it appears that postprandial lipemia increases more markedly with fructose than with glucose added to a single meal and in relation with the glycemic index of the carbohydrates. Acutely, a biphasic postprandial lipidemic response was described depending on the glycemic index of the carbohydrates. The chronic hypercaloric intake of fructose shows consistent results enhancing postprandial lipemia, but despite numerous studies, isocaloric chronic consumption of carbohydrates (fructose, glucose or starch) in mixed meals has led to discrepancies resulting in unclear divergent effects increasing or decreasing postprandial lipemia.</p>
