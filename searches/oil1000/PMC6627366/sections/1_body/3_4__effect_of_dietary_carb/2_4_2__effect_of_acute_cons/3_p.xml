<p class="p">In healthy individuals, physiological ranges of postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia as generated by starchy foods (white bread, pasta, beans) did not induce noticeable alterations in the overall postprandial TG response but delays and exacerbates postprandial accumulation of CM-apoB-48 in plasma [

Likewise, in healthy individuals, the intake of a standard fat dose meal (0.5 g/kg body weight) accompanied by either low-carbohydrate meal (17 g as lactose) or a high-carbohydrate meal (136 g of which 60 g was sucrose) did not show a difference in plasma TG or TRL-TG postprandial concentrations but a biphasic plasma TG response seen with the high-carbohydrate meal largely reflected the TRL-TG or CM fraction, which would tend to suggest a biphasic pattern of absorption. Higher insulin and GIP responses were seen with the high-carbohydrate meal [

Moreover, in obese, insulin-resistant subjects, the consumption of a high-glycemic index mixed meal, compared with a low-glycemic index one, increased the postprandial rise in plasma insulin and the accumulation of TRL-apoB-48 and TRL-apoB-100 thus increasing postprandial TG concentration as well as modifying the kinetics of peak occurrence. Thus, adding various digestible carbohydrates to a test meal can elicit a biphasic response of postprandial lipemia [
