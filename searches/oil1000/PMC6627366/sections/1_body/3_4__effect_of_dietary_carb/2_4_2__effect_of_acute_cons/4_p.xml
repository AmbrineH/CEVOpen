 <xref rid="B94-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], their effects on intestinal CM metabolism remain to be clarified, but have been reviewed in a recent paper pointing out the intestine as a contributor to carbohydrate-induced hyperlipidemia [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Oral fructose in a mixed meal can stimulate hepatic but also intestinal de novo lipogenesis, thereby increasing TG availability for CM and VLDL synthesis. This mechanism was increased for CM but not VLDL when glucose was added to the meal with a concomitant decrease in fructose oxidation and gluconeogenesis from fructose, suggesting the addition of glucose to the meal committed more fructose towards intestinal de novo lipogenesis [
 <xref rid="B96-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. In a lipoprotein kinetic study performed in healthy individuals, TRL-apoB-48 (CM) and TRL-apoB-100 (VLDL) metabolism was assessed after intraduodenal infusion (to avoid change in gastric emptying) of intralipid plus saline or glucose or fructose under pancreatic clamp conditions. Glucose markedly stimulated CM-PR with a moderate increase in CM-FCR resulting in net elevation of CM concentration but no effect on VLDL metabolism. Fructose significantly stimulated CM-PR and VLDL-PR but no effect on FCR [

The same team performed another lipoprotein kinetic study in healthy individuals to assess the effect of intravenous infusion of either 20% glucose or normal saline as control in a constant fed state. Compared with saline infusion; glucose infusion induced both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (despite pancreatic clamp conditions), FFA decrease and increased plasma TG, CM concentrations and CM-PR without affecting CM-FCR or VLDL metabolism [
 <xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Several studies have shown that a fructose-rich diet induced less insulin secretion than a glucose-rich diet, which could explain the lower postprandial LPL activity and the reduction in TG clearance after fructose compared to glucose [
