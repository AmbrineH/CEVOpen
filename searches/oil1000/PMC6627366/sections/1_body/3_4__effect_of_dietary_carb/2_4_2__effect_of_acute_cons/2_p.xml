<p class="p">In healthy individuals, a high-fat/low-carbohydrate meal yielded a postprandial TG iAUC increase and an apoB-48 plasma iAUC reduction compared to a low-fat/high carbohydrate meal. This suggests difference in size and composition of CM depending on the meal composition [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. In healthy individuals, the addition of 50 g or 100 g oral glucose to a fatty test meal diminished postprandial lipemia in a dose dependent manner compared to the meal containing fat alone. This effect was not due to increased clearance of TG from the circulation but appeared to reflect delayed gastric emptying and decreased hepatic secretion of TG. Starch ingestion had no discernible effect on postprandial lipemia [

Likewise, the addition of 75 g oral glucose to an oral fat meal delayed the gastric emptying and postponed the CM response compared to the fat meal in healthy individuals. The postprandial iAUC of serum TG and VLDL-TG were reduced but the CM-TG iAUC remained unchanged. The postprandial reduction of VLDL-TG iAUC may be due to the pronounced FFA depression during the glucose-induced rise in insulin [
