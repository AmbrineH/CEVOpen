<p class="p">At a cellular level, both luminal and basolateral glucose enhanced CM secretion with a greater effect of luminal glucose and a greater effect of luminal glucose than fructose [

In Caco-2/15 cells, basolateral exposure to glucose increased apical cholesterol uptake with increased expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1. This elevation of cholesterol uptake was associated with an increase in the transcription factors SREBP-2, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) and liver X receptor (LXR)-β along with a fall in retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α [

Moreover, in Caco-2 cells, the incubation with glucose or fructose increased expression and protein abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and fructose, but not glucose, activated SREBP-1 and ChREBP. These results show the link between carbohydrate and lipid pathways and suggest that these monosaccharides may play a role in enhancing TG synthesis and CM assembly [

Furthermore, several studies have shown that oral glucose compared to oral water can mobilize TG stored in cytosolic lipid droplets of enterocytes. This storage of droplets could contribute to CM appearance up to 16 h after the last meal. Moreover, the contractile activity of mesenteric lymphatics able to activate the secretion of extracellular CM, that reside between enterocytes, in lamina propria, lacteals and the mesenteric lymphatic system, was reduced with chronic high-fat and high-fructose feeding in rats [
