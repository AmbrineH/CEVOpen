<p class="p">The monosaccharides have been extensively studied. As described by Livesey et al. in a meta-analysis, effect of fructose consumption on lipid profile was different depending on daily ingested amount: significant effect on postprandial TG was not evident unless &gt; 50 g fructose/day was consumed, and no significant effect was seen for fasting TG with intakes of â‰¤ 100 g fructose/day [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. In 66 overweight or obese men, the consumption of fructose sweetened beverages containing 75 g fructose per day for 12 weeks while continuing usual lifestyle and diet increased significantly fasting plasma TG and postprandial TG (AUC and iAUC) response after a mixed meal but did not impair glycemic control or incretin hormone responses during oral glucose or mixed meal challenge [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. In contrast, another meta-analysis on the replacement of glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages by fructose (11 trials; length from 2 to 10 weeks; doses of fructose between 40 and 150 g/day) found no difference in fasting TG when fructose replaced glucose but a slight significant reduction when fructose replaced sucrose [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of 10-week to 26-week randomized trials of sugar-containing soft drinks, Bray concluded that plasma TG increase was due to fructose rather than glucose in sugar-containing soft drinks [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. However, in a randomized control clinical study, Campos et al. showed in overweight subjects that substitution of high sugar-sweetened beverages providing large amounts of mono- or di-saccharides by artificially sweetened beverages during 12 weeks did not decrease postprandial TG despite of lower energy and fructose content of the meals [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Stanhope et al. showed, in overweight and obese subjects, that the consumption (eight weeks) of fructose-sweetened beverages significantly lowered glucose and insulin postmeal peaks and the AUC compared with the baseline diet (energy balanced diet containing 55% of energy as complex carbohydrates for 2 weeks) and with the consumption of glucose-sweetened beverages. Only fructose sweetened beverages diet consumption resulted in increased postprandial TG suggesting that the specific effect of fructose, but not of glucose and insulin excursions, contribute to the adverse effects of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages on lipids and insulin sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Glucose supplementation had no effect on postprandial TG response as confirmed in 2 other studies of the same authors in young men and women [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] or in overweight or obese subjects [
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] but a specific increase in fasting plasma TG concentration [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Despland et al. found a slightly decrease in postprandial blood glucose but no difference in postprandial TG plasma nor in hepatic insulin sensitivity in eight healthy male consuming a diet containing 25% energy as honey or pure fructose-glucose compared to an isocaloric starch diet [
 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that isocaloric inclusion of fructose in mixed meal has inconsistent effects on postprandial TG despite its greater stimulation of de novo lipogenesis than other monosaccharides such as glucose [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. However, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials, Wang et al. showed no significant postprandial TG increase when fructose was exchanged isocalorically for other carbohydrates in the diet but a significant postprandial TG raising-effect of fructose in studies in which fructose supplemented the background diet with excess energy from high-dose fructose compared with the background diet alone (without the excess energy) [
