<p class="p">High carbohydrate diets and especially highly digestible carbohydrate enriched diets have commonly been shown to alter lipid postprandial metabolism and to increase fasting plasma TG as a result of both intestinal CM and hepatic VLDL TRL and their remnants accumulation [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In 2 groups of normolipidemic and moderately hypertriglyceridemic subjects, Parks et al. compared the effects of two isoenergetic diets: a control (35% fat) diet for one week followed by a low-fat (15% fat) and high-carbohydrate diet for 5 weeks. Low fat/high-carbohydrate diet resulted in increased fasting TG concentration and decreased VLDL-TG clearance rate in both groups and increased fasting TRL-apoB-48 and TRL-apoB-100 concentrations in the hypertriglyceridemic group [
