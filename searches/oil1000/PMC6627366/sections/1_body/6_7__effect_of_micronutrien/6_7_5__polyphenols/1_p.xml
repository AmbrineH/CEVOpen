<p class="p">The story on the effect of polyphenols on postprandial lipemia unusually started with a clinical study that found no significant effect of acute dealcoholized red wine, which is rich in polyphenols, on postprandial lipid metabolism in dyslipidemic postmenopausal women [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>], suggesting that these polyphenols, at the tested dose, do not significantly affect lipid absorption and CM metabolism. However, a study performed in human Caco-2 cells led to an opposite conclusion by showing that red wine polyphenols significantly impaired the secretion of apoB-48 by these cells [
 <xref rid="B168-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">168</xref>]. Conversely, in the same cell model, Vidal et al. did not find that wine polyphenols decreased the secretion of lipoproteins, contrarily to apple polyphenols that decreased it [

 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>] and in men with mild or borderline hyperTG [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. It was suggested that this was due to a decrease in TG absorption via an inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity [
 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>]. However, as observed in mice, this could also be due to the fact that tea polyphenols decrease bile acid reabsorption, which results in lower intestinal bile acid levels, which might further decrease lipid absorption [
 <xref rid="B173-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>]. Interestingly, coffee polyphenols also inhibited pancreatic lipase activity, resulting in a lower postprandial increase in blood TG concentration. A study in mice suggested that this effect was apparently due mainly to one species of polyphenols among the 9 species that are recovered in coffee, i.e., di-cafeoylquinic acids [
 <xref rid="B174-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>]. Cinnamon extract, which is rich in polyphenols, was also able to diminish the secretion of apo-B48 and TRL in a fat load test performed in hamsters. Furthermore, it was observed that cinnamon extract reversed the expression of the impaired Insulin Receptor (IR), Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS2 and AKT serine/threonin Kinase 1 (Akt1) mRNA levels and inhibited the overexpression of MTP and SREBP-1cin rodent enterocytes [

 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. In another study, an anthocyanin-rich extract purified from a Haskap fruit significantly reduced the postprandial TG response measured in rats after a fat load [
 <xref rid="B177-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Finally, a clinical study performed in overweight/obese subjects and components of the metabolic syndrome showed that subjects submitted to eight-week supplementation with a diet rich in polyphenols had lower postprandial TG response to a fat load than subjects who consumed a diet poor in polyphenols [
