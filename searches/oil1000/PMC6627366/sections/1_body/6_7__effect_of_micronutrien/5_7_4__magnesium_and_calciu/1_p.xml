<p class="p">A pioneer study performed in inverted hamster intestine showed that a very low concentration of Mg in the intestinal lumen impairs the normal secretion of CM by the intestine [

Conversely, a clinical study performed in healthy individuals found that both the CM-TG response and the postprandial blood concentration of apoB-48 after a fat load were significantly lower after a meal that contained a Mg supplement (500 mg) than after a control meal [

Thus, as for Cu, further clinical studies are required to conclude on the effect of Mg status or Mg supplementation on postprandial lipemia. Concerning Calcium (Ca), a clinical study has suggested that dairy Ca, but not supplementary Ca carbonate, can attenuate postprandial lipemia in healthy moderately overweighted men [
 <xref rid="B166-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>]. It was suggested that this was due to impaired fat absorption because high Ca intake increases fecal fat excretion. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to explain the different effect of these two chemical forms of Ca.
