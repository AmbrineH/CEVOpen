<p class="p">Although there are few studies on the effect of copper (Cu) on CM metabolism, the two available studies performed in rats suggest an effect of Cu deficiency. In the first study, it was observed that Cu deficiency significantly diminished the activities of both endothelial LPL and hepatic lipase. This might explain the lower clearance rate of CM, which was observed in the beginning of the postprandial period in the Cu deficient rats [

The authors suggested that these modifications could affect the metabolism of these lipoproteins. Thus, dedicated clinical studies are required to assess the effect of Cu deficiency on postprandial lipemia.
