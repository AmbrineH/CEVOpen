<p class="p">The pioneering studies on the effect of Zinc (Zn) on postprandial lipemia in rats were published in 1977 by Koo and Turk [
 <xref rid="B150-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B151-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. These researchers described in detail the consequences of Zn deficiency on lipid absorption in the rat. They notably found that the rate of TG absorption markedly decreased, with a huge accumulation of TG droplets in the mucosa and that these droplets were unstable and coalesced. They also observed that cell cytoplasm exhibited prominent cellular changes. They deduced that the enterocytes were not able, by an unknown mechanism, to secrete lipid droplets. They suggested that this was due to the failure of these cells to synthesize proteins required for the formation of CM, i.e., apolipoproteins. Later, it was found that marginal Zn depletion significantly diminished apo-C and -E concentrations in CM [
 <xref rid="B152-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. The nascent CM were also irregular and larger in shape and size. The same team further showed in rats that the CM from marginally Zn-deficient rats were less efficiently taken up by the liver [
 <xref rid="B153-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. This likely explained their delayed clearance from the blood. One year later, the same team showed, also in rats, that marginal Zn deficiency also significantly diminished CM-apo-B concentration [
 <xref rid="B154-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. About ten years later, Reaves et al. showed that the plasma ratio of apoB-48 to total apoB protein was significantly lower in Zn-deficient rats than in Zn-adequate rats [
 <xref rid="B155-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. They suggested that this is due to the editing of apoBmRNA that was impaired by Zn deficiency. Indeed, apoB mRNA editing is performed by a Zn-containing cytidine deaminase [
 <xref rid="B156-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>] and this enzyme determines whether apoB-48 or apoB-100 is synthesized. The same team later focused on the intestine and found that Zn deficiency modestly, but significantly, diminished intestinal apoB mRNA editing in hamsters [
 <xref rid="B157-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Nevertheless, another team did not observe significant modification of apoB mRNA editing in rats upon zinc deficiency [
 <xref rid="B158-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. This suggests that this effect, if existing, is not very important. Nevertheless, the demonstrated inhibitory effect of Zn deficiency on the intestinal synthesis of CM in rats and hamsters has also been observed in Mongolian Gerbils [
 <xref rid="B159-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>], suggesting that this is a general phenomenon in rodents and, we assume, in mammals. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no data in human. Zn deficiency has apparently also another effect on CM metabolism via a reduction of their lipolysis efficiency by LPL. Indeed, Zn-deficient rats exhibited a reduced LPL activity in postheparin serum and adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. Koo and Lee suggested that this was not due to changes in the enzyme activity per se, but to Zn-deficiency-induced compositional alterations in CM, which modulate LPL activity. The key role of CM composition on LPL activity likely explains why the effect of Zn deficiency on LPL activity was observed in rats fed coconut oil, but not in rats fed fish oil [
