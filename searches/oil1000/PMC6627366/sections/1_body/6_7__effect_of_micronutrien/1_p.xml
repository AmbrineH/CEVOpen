<p class="p">Some micronutrients, e.g., vitamins or trace elements, as well as polyphenols have been shown to modulate postprandial lipemia. However, mechanisms underlying these effects have not been fully elucidated and it is possible that not yet studied vitamins or trace metals, e.g., fat-soluble vitamins or selenium, or phytochemicals other than polyphenols, e.g., carotenoids, might modulate postprandial lipemia as well.</p>
