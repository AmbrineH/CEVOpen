<p class="p">In a recent study, Dias et al. investigated the effect of three meals differing in their structure and form, namely solid, semi-solid and liquid, while having the same nutrient composition, on lipid digestion and postprandial TG concentration using an 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> approach and a randomized, cross-over, dietary intervention trial in 26 healthy adults [
 <xref rid="B202-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>]. They showed that the liquid food elicited significantly higher postprandial TG concentration compared to the solid food, while the semi-solid food displayed an intermediate figure though not reaching statistical significance. This effect was partly attributed to the larger oil droplet size exhibited by the solid food compared to semi-solid and liquid food before and in the earlier stages of in vitro digestions as well as to the fact that solid food showed phase separation during gastric digestion together with a lower release of FA during intestinal digestion.
