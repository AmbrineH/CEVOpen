<p class="p">To summarize, food structure, whether native or manipulated, can significantly affect postprandial TG concentrations and can even override the effects of macronutrient composition. Lipid emulsification, particularly with a smaller droplet size, interesterification leading to TG with lower melting points or lower meal viscosity all elicit higher postprandial TG. Additional research is warranted to better characterize how manipulation of food structure can impact on postprandial TG concentration, e.g., effects of emulsifier type on the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Nonetheless, consumption of foods with specific food structure, e.g., nuts, or technological modification of food structure certainly constitute relevant approaches in the prevention and management of elevated postprandial TG concentrations.</p>
