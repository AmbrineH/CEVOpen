<p class="p">Fats and oils in processed foods are mostly found as emulsions, and usually as oil-in-water emulsions. The initial oil droplet size has a major impact on lipid digestion, with smaller droplet size leading to faster digestion rate due to increased surface area. Armand et al. fed 8 healthy individuals with either a fine (surface-weighted mean diameter = 0.7 µm) or a coarse (surface-weighted mean diameter = 10 µm) emulsion and they observed a higher gastric and duodenal lipolysis, a slower gastric emptying, confirmed in [

Fifteen healthy Chinese males received a test meal containing olive oil as non-emulsified, finely emulsified (surface-weighted mean diameter = 0.7 µm) or coarsely emulsified (surface-weighted mean diameter = 10 µm). The meal with non-emulsified oil elicited the lowest iAUC of the postprandial plasma TG concentrations (although only with a trend against the coarse emulsion,

Moreover, a higher iAUC of the postprandial plasma TG concentration was observed following consumption of the test meal containing the fine emulsion compared to that containing the coarse emulsion (similar surface-weighted mean diameters as in Armand et al.)
