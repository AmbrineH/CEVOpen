<p class="p">Fats and oils in foods can be present either as a continuous phase or as emulsions, i.e., two immiscible phases dispersed as droplets, but they are also characterized by their crystallized/liquid TG ratio, which varies with temperature. Vors et al. provided nine normal weight and nine obese subjects with an identical breakfast containing 40 g milk fat either emulsified or non-emulsified [
 <xref rid="B186-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Importantly, the two fats used had similar melting temperatures. The emulsified fat led to an earlier and greater CM-TG peak concentration, greater apoB-48 concentrations in all subjects, as well as larger CM size and iAUC of the CM-TG concentrations in obese subjects. Garaiova et al. also observed a 60% greater iAUC of the postprandial plasma TG concentrations following consumption by 24 healthy volunteers of a standardized meal comprising 30ml of an emulsified

 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>) oil mixture compared to the same meal but with a non-emulsified oil mixture [
 <xref rid="B187-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>]. Nevertheless, only the postprandial AUC for plasma 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA concentrations was affected by the emulsification, i.e., AUC for postprandial plasma SFA, MUFA and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA concentrations were not significantly different, strongly suggesting an increase in the absorption efficiency of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA with emulsification rather than a modification of postprandial CM metabolism.
