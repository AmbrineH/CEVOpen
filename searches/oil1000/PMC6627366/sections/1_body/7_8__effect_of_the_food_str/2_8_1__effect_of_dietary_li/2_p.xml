<p class="p">Clemente et al. investigated postprandial TG concentrations in 8 T2D overweight patients after they received three test meals, identical in volume and macronutrient composition, but with fat originating from different sources, namely milk, butter and mozzarella cheese. No significant difference was observed in the increase in plasma TG concentration over the 6 h following the meal although the meal containing butter elicited a significantly delayed plasma TG peak time, not due to differences in gastric emptying rate. Unfortunately, it is not possible to conclude from the study design if this was due to the dispersion state of lipids (relatively small native milk fat globules in milk, aggregated milk fat globules dispersed in a protein matrix for mozzarella cheese, relatively larger fat droplets for butter) or to differences in viscosity (butter, mozzarella cheese and milk being respectively solid, semi-solid and liquid) [
