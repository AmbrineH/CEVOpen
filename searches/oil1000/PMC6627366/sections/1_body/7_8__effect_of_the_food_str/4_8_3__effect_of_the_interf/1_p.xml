<p class="p">The formation and stability of oil-in-water emulsions in the gastro-intestinal tract is influenced by the presence of emulsifiers, such as proteins, polysaccharides or phospholipids, which can in turn modulate oil droplet coalescence and hence fat digestion rate. Proteins differ in their emulsifying and stabilizing capacities, depending partly on their solubility, their hydrolysis rate by proteases and their displacement from the interfacial film by bile salts (see [
 <xref rid="B193-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">193</xref>] for review). These characteristics could explain some of the differences observed in studies comparing the effect of protein sources on postprandial TG concentration but this has usually not been evaluated, with the exception of Mariotti et al. who observed in vitro a phase separation with the casein meal used in their clinical intervention study which they suggest could partly explain the associated lower increase in postprandial TG concentration [
 <xref rid="B116-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. Keogh et al. fed 10 men and 10 women (mean age = 59 years) two emulsions (iso-viscous, iso-caloric and same mean droplet size), containing 30 g of fat, differing in their emulsifier composition (namely sodium sterol lactylate or sodium caseinate/monoglycerides) [
 <xref rid="B194-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>]. Emulsions stabilized by sodium caseinate/monoglycerides elicited lower postprandial TG concentrations at 90 and 120 min compared to sodium sterol lactylate (no AUC calculated), with a concomitant faster gastric emptying and lower secretion of the gut hormones cholecystokinin, GLP-1 and peptide YY.
