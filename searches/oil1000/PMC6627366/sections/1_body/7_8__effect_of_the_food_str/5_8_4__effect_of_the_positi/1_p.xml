<p class="p">Dietary TG can vary in FA chain length, degree of unsaturation but also in the distribution of FA on the glycerol backbone (stereospecificity), whether in naturally occurring TG or from technological processing by food industries, a technique termed interesterification. The isomers thus formed can lead to TG molecules with different physical properties, including melting temperature [
 <xref rid="B195-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>], digestion rates and biological effects, including postprandial TG concentrations. Dedicated reviews on the effects of interesterification on lipid metabolism have previously been published [
 <xref rid="B196-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>]. Berry reviewed 10 cross-over studies investigating the postprandial effects of stearic and palmitic acid-rich fats, the two major SFA in human diets, where test meals only differed from control meals by the stereospecificity of the TG sources and not by the FA composition. No conclusion could be drawn when only the positional distribution of FA was considered but she suggested that interesterified TG with higher melting points, i.e., crystalline at body temperature, led to a decrease in postprandial TG concentration, due to a slower assembling of micelles, leading to a slower rate of lipolysis in the gastro-intestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B196-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>]. This hypothesis has been confirmed in two subsequent studies by Berry’s group where fat test meals containing interesterified palm olein led to lower postprandial plasma TG concentration compared to palm olein in healthy men and women [
 <xref rid="B198-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">198</xref>] and in men aged 40–70 years with fasting plasma TG concentration &gt; 1.2 mmol/L [
 <xref rid="B199-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. In these two studies, interesterified palm olein was characterized by a higher proportion of palmitic acid in the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position and a higher melting point (4.7% solid fat content at 37 °C whereas palm olein was fully melted at 37 °C).
