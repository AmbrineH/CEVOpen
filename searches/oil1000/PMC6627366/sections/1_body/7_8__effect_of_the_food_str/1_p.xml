<p class="p">Although the study of the effects of single nutrients on postprandial lipemia is paramount in our understanding of the mechanisms involved, this approach bears limitations since human beings consume foods and not isolated nutrients. Indeed, most foods are complex, heterogeneous matrices and are defined not only by their qualitative and quantitative molecular composition but also by the organization of their molecules at multiple spatial length scales [
 <xref rid="B179-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>]. Moreover, the initial structure of a food is greatly modified by digestive processes, be it physical (e.g., mastication, antral grinding) or chemical (e.g., digestive enzymes, pH) ones. Hence, numerous interactions exist between the different components of each food and with other components from co-consumed foods. Jenkins and colleagues have long acknowledged this complexity in the case of postprandial glycaemia with the introduction of the glycemic index in 1981, which considered the postprandial effect of both nutrients, such as mono- or di-saccharides, as well as that of foods [
 <xref rid="B180-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>]. To date, such an approach has not been developed in the case of postprandial TG although guidelines have been proposed to assess postprandial TG concentrations in a standardized fashion [

 <xref rid="B184-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>], and thus advocate to switch the focus from nutrients to foods, for easier translation to the public but also to take into account the inherent complexity of food matrices. Numerous studies have shown that the distribution of FA in TG, the organization of lipids as oil droplet emulsions differing in their size and interfacial composition, the degree of crystallized fat or the permeability of the food matrix to digestive enzymes can influence lipid digestion and metabolism [
