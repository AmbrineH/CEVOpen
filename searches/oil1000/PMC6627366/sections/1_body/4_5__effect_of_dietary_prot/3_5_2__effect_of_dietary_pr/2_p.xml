<p class="p">Mariotti et al. provided 10 healthy overweight men a high-fat meal plus 45 g casein, whey protein, or Î±-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein and observed a lower increase in postprandial plasma TG concentration following the meal that provided casein (AUC decreased by 22%), with no effect on FFA or insulin. As supported by their in vitro observations at pH values similar to those observed in the stomach during digestion, the authors hypothesized that this difference was due to the low solubility of casein at low pH leading to potential phase separation in the stomach, hence slowing down the digestion and absorption of fat [

Mariotti et al. put forward that they studied healthy individuals and that the components of the meals they used were pre-mixed, therefore allowing more interaction between the nutrients. When providing a pre-meal consisting of 17.6 g proteins (whey, casein or gluten) 15 to 30 min before a fat-rich meal to 16 subjects with metabolic syndrome, Bjornshave et al. did not observe any difference with regard to postprandial TG or FFA concentrations [

The authors hypothesized that the lower protein dose used compared to Mariotti et al. may explain the discrepancy between the results of the two studies. The same group also provided 12 matched subjects with and without T2D with 17.6 g whey proteins 15 min before a fat-rich meal or during the main meal. Although the whey protein pre-meal led to an increase in insulin, glucagon and GIP concentrations in both groups of subjects and a decrease in gastric emptying rates, the authors did not observe any effect on postprandial TG, apoB-48 or FFA concentrations [
