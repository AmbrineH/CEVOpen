<p class="p">Early work by Cohen et al. showed that the addition of 23 g casein to a meal containing 40 g fat did not have any effect on postprandial lipemia in a group of 15 healthy adults [

In a group of 24 healthy adults, the addition of 50 g sodium caseinate to a fat meal (1 g fat/kg body weight as whipping cream) did not have any effect on the AUC of postprandial serum-, CM- or VLDL-TG concentrations, although a delay in serum-, CM- and VLDL-TG peak concentrations was observed, without any difference in gastric emptying rates. However, addition of casein led to a 20% reduction in FFA concentration over 8 h, together with a 30% increase in insulin release [

In contrast, in a group of 16 healthy adults, the addition of 50 g sodium caseinate or soy protein to a fat meal (1 g fat/kg body weight as whipping cream) led to a decrease in postprandial TG concentration (significant decrease at early time points but AUC was not calculated), with a 1 h delay in the peak time, together with a decrease in FFA associated with an increase in insulin secretion [
