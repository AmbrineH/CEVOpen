<p class="p">To summarize, although the effects of dietary proteins on gastric emptying and FFA release seem well established, their effect on postprandial TG concentrations remains unclear. Nonetheless, at least three studies have pointed at a greater decrease in postprandial TG caused by the acute consumption of whey proteins compared to casein, the two most studied protein sources. Of note, one study has observed an opposite effect but it was the only one where food components were pre-mixed, and therefore not physically separated from the fat source, thereby underlining the potential effect of food structure on postprandial TG concentrations, as further discussed in chapter eight of the present review. Long-term studies that investigated dietary protein consumption suggest a possible decreasing effect on CM production, in particular by whey proteins.</p>
