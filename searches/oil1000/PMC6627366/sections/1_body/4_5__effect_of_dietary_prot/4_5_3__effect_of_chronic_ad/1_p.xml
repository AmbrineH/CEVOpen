Twenty moderately hypertriglyceridemic but otherwise healthy individuals consumed for six weeks two isocaloric diets (14%, 53% and 30% energy from proteins, carbohydrates and fats respectively vs. 25%, 30% and 35%) and then received a fat tolerance test meal. The protein-enriched diet led to a decrease in CM production, with a lower postprandial apoB-48 concentration, but no difference in fasting plasma or postprandial lipemia was observed. In a group of 52 patients with abdominal obesity, Bohl et al. did not observe any long-term effect of the addition of 60 g whey compared with casein to a high-fat test meal consumed daily for 12 weeks on postprandial TG or FFA concentrations but whey addition led to a decrease in CM production compared to casein addition, with a lower postprandial apoB-48 concentration [
