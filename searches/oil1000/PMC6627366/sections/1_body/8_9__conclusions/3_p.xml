<p class="p">Postprandial lipemia increases dose-dependently with the amount of dietary fat or cholesterol after a single meal, over a certain-amount threshold. However, due to interactions between long-chain fatty acid species and physico-chemical properties of fat structures, especially fat droplet characteristics, it is difficult to identify the acute effect of FA species on postprandial lipemia. Despite some conflicting results, studies of habitual diet show postprandial lipidemic responses in the order SFA &gt; MUFA &gt;
