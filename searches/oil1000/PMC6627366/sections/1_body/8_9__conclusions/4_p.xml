<p class="p">Although dietary fat has received the most attention, other nutrients and micronutrients can modulate postprandial lipemia. Dietary proteins could apparently display some effect but it depends on their nature and the few studies available do not allow us to conclude on their effect on postprandial lipemia. Carbohydrate sources added to a meal have been shown to modulate postprandial lipemia in relation with their glycemic index. Added to a fat-meal, glucose, and more markedly fructose, can noticeably increase postprandial lipemia. Chronic hypercaloric intake of fructose but not isocaloric consumption of carbohydrates (fructose, glucose or starch) resulted in constant increase postprandial lipemia. Some minerals (Ca, Zn, Cu) and some polyphenols, e.g., tea polyphenols, have also been shown to modulate postprandial lipemia but the number of studies is limited and the mechanisms suggested deserve more investigations. Dietary fibers, especially soluble fibers from various origins, can lower postprandial lipemia when added to a fatty meal in sufficient amount. Mechanisms involved are not fully understood and new studies should thus be performed to evaluate the possible interaction between the gut microbiota with the effect of fiber consumption on postprandial lipemia. Finally, nutrient composition alone cannot explain the effect of foods on postprandial lipemia and it is now clear that the food matrix is a key factor influencing fat digestion and hence postprandial lipemia. </p>
