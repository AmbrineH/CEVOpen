<p class="p">During the last decades, many clinical studies have highlighted the fact that healthy humans spend most of their time in a hyperlipidemic postprandial state due to the repetitive consumption of fat-containing meals and that this process is exacerbated in hyperlipidemic patients. Postprandial lipemia is characterized by the accumulation of both hepatic apoB-100 and intestinally-derived apoB-48 TRL in the circulation, which participate in atherosclerotic plaque progression. Accordingly, postprandial lipemia, in both its magnitude and duration, has been shown to constitute an independent risk factor for CVD, which confirms the central role of dietary modifications in the treatment and prevention of CVD. </p>
