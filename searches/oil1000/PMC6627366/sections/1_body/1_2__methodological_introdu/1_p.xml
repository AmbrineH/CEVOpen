<p class="p">A large number of studies have assessed the effects of acute or chronic ingestion of meals containing different types of fat or other nutrients on postprandial lipemia but have yielded conflicting results. A number of potentially confounding factors reflecting the lack of standardization among studies could explain this: population, amount of fat, type of fat, amount and types of other nutrients, physicochemical composition of the meal and fatty acid (FA) or other nutrients, composition of habitual chronic food intake. Moreover, the measurement of postprandial plasma triglyceride (TG) response may provide only a limited evaluation of the true impact of meals and nutrients on postprandial lipoprotein metabolism. Studies have analyzed TG or retinyl-palmitate in a variety of sample types, including whole blood, plasma, serum, lipoproteins and their remnants, over a wide range from two up to 12 h postprandially [
