<p class="p">In contrast, some studies have shown no effect or even an increase in postprandial TG concentrations following acute consumption of fibers. For example, Bourdon et al. observed no effect of a barley pasta meal enriched with beta-glucan (15.7 g fibers versus 5 g fibers) on postprandial plasma or TRL-TG or -cholesterol concentrations or postprandial TRL-apoB-48 concentration in 11 healthy men [

Likewise, Ulmius et al. observed an increase in postprandial plasma TG concentration following consumption of meals enriched with fibers from oats, rye bran, sugar beet fibers or a mixture of these three fibers versus a low-fiber test meal in 13 healthy adults [

The meals providing fibers not only differed in their soluble fiber content but also in their insoluble fiber content and they were mixed with a blackcurrant beverage, hereby raising the question whether the way fibers are added to the food matrix can influence the postprandial response measured.
