<p class="p">Kristensen et al. showed that addition of flaxseed fibers to a test meal containing 50 g fat led to a decrease in postprandial plasma TG concentration in 18 healthy male adults (with 22 &lt; body mass index &lt; 30 kg/mÂ²) [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. The difference (7 g dietary fibers) with the control meal was more marked with the meal that provided a high dose (17 g) of flaxseed fibers from mucilage than with the meals that provided 12 g dietary fibers from whole flaxseeds or low dose flaxseed mucilage. The addition of mucilage also led to a decrease in postprandial insulin secretion. Khossoussi et al. showed that addition of 12 g dietary fibers from psyllium husk to a standard meal (total fiber content = 15 g) led to a 21% decrease in postprandial serum TG concentration in 10 overweight and obese mean [

Moreover, apoB-48 concentration was lower 1h after consumption of the meal high in fibers compared to the meal low in fibers but the difference was not significant over a 6 h period. Resistant maltodextrin (5 or 10 g added to a test meal containing 50 g fat) has also been shown to elicit a decreased postprandial serum TG concentration in 13 healthy adults [

 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. Ingestion of fibers led to a 15% decrease in postprandial serum TG concentration and a 23% decrease in postprandial remnant-like lipoprotein particle cholesterol concentration.
