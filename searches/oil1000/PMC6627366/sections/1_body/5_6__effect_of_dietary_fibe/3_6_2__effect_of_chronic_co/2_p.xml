<p class="p">To summarize, most studies show that acute addition of soluble fibers to the meal leads to lower postprandial TG concentrations. Several interrelated mechanisms linked to lipid digestion have been implicated (see [
 <xref rid="B121-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>] for review). However, studies on this matter are relatively old and have thus not taken into consideration the possible effect of the interaction between the gut microbiota and fiber consumption on postprandial lipemia and more research is therefore needed to investigate if some strains of bacteria are associated with altered postprandial TG concentrations or lipoprotein profiles, as has been for example shown recently in the case of postprandial glucose concentrations [
