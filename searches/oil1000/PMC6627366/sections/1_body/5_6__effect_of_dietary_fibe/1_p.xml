 <xref rid="B121-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>] showing that some sources of fibers, particularly soluble fibers, at the level of 4â€“10 g/meal, can decrease postprandial TG and cholesterol concentrations following a mixed meal. Several interrelated mechanisms have been put forward, including slowed gastric emptying, alteration of TG hydrolysis, through increased viscosity decreasing the rate of hydrolysis or inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity, alteration of mixed micelle formation, and possibly that of intestinal secretion of CM [
