<p class="p">First, it should be remembered that dietary short- or medium-chain FA have limited effect on postprandial lipemia because they directly enter the general circulation via portal route instead of CM secretion. It is probably why studies using dairy fats, which contain significant amount of short- and medium-chain FA, as the only source of saturated fatty acids (SFA), generally report a lower postprandial TG response compared to other sources of SFA or other types of fats [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In healthy individuals, a recent randomized, cross-over, single-blinded design study, showed that a medium-chain SFA-rich meal (coconut biscuit) resulted in a significant lower postprandial whole blood TG response (concentration and net area under the curve (AUC)) compared to a short-chain SFA-rich meal (butter biscuit) and a long-chain SFA-rich meal (lard biscuit) despite identical fat and caloric content [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In healthy men, a study showed an increase in CM-TG concentration after an SFA-rich meal compared to an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich meal but no difference with the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich meal [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The postprandial lipemic response to a SFA-rich meal was comparable to that of a 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA-rich meal when consumed with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA in one study conducted in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] whereas, the increase of the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA content of a SFA-rich meal fat meal did not acutely change postprandial TG concentration in another study performed in subjects with a metabolic syndrome [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In overweight men, a difference in the postprandial serum TG concentrations between an SFA-rich meal and an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA-rich meal was only seen in the late postprandial phase [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Four studies showed different effects of SFA compared to MUFA consumption on postprandial lipemia showing either an increase [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] or a decrease in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] or in overweight and obese subjects [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and one no change in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In healthy individuals, another study showed a decrease in postprandial lipemia following a stearic acid-rich fat meal compared to other SFA (palmitic acid) or a high-oleic acid sunflower oil [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] but there was no difference between a high-oleic acid sunflower oil and a stearic acid-rich fat meal using cocoa butter [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Consumption of six different test meals rich in stearic, palmitic, palmitic plus myristic, oleic, elaidic or linoleic acids by healthy individuals resulted in a relatively lower postprandial lipemia response with long-chain SFA than did the intake of the unsaturated FA. The significant differences in LPL activities between groups did not explain the postprandial response that could be due to slower or less-efficient absorption of long-chain SFA [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Moreover, no difference in postprandial lipemia was observed following an oleate-rich meal (cis isomer) and an elaidate-rich meal (the trans isomer of oleic acid) [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, most studies have shown that meals enriched with different proportion of SFA, MUFA or 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA do not elicit marked differences in postprandial lipemia [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In healthy individuals, an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA-rich fat meal (fish oil) lowered postprandial lipemia compared to an SFA-rich fat meal (palm and coconut oils) [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, two other studies did not show a difference in the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) plasma-TG after an SFA-rich meal compared to an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA-rich meal [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>].
