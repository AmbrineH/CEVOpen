<p class="p">Postprandial lipemia may be influenced by the habitual diet [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. A short-term consumption (25 days) of isocaloric diets rich in SFA, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA or 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA in healthy individuals resulted in greater TG and CM concentrations following SFA compared to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA, with intermediate concentrations with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA. CM from subjects on 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA diets were more susceptible to lipolysis in vitro [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. After 15 and 29 days of dietary intervention (SFA-rich or 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA-rich diet in healthy young men), postprandial response analysis suggested no change in the clearance of CM remnants but a prolonged accumulation of VLDL in individuals fed with the SFA-rich diet [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Two other short-term studies (six or four weeks) showed that 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation (2.7 g/day or 4 g/day) in healthy subjects resulted in a significant reduction in postprandial TG compared with the control diet without supplementation [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In the second study, the supplementation with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA suppressed the increase in TG content in CM as well as in VLDL [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In contrast, consumption of a low-fat diet with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA (fish oil) supplementation for 16 weeks in healthy individuals led to a significant increase in postprandial TG concentration following a fat-rich test meal compared to chronic consumption of a low-fat diet alone [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and another study did not show an effect of a six month 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation in fasting or postprandial lipids compared to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA supplementation in moderately hyperlipidemic subjects [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In healthy individuals, an eight-week study of diet rich in SFA or MUFA (olive oil) showed a significant reduction in plasma total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations but a higher postprandial plasma TG and TRL-apoB-48 concentrations with the MUFA diet [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In contrast, a 16-week moderate-MUFA diet or high-MUFA diet following an eight-week SFA-rich diet (reference diet) in healthy individuals resulted in the reduction of postprandial apoB-48 response without change in plasma TG concentration, suggesting that the CM formed carry larger amounts of dietary lipids per particle [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Similarly, a three-month SFA-rich diet compared to a MUFA-rich diet in healthy individuals did not show a difference in postprandial TG concentration but a reduction in both groups receiving a 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation (3.6 g/day) versus placebo [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In this study, neither type of diet nor 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation affected serum LDL size, but this parameter was measured in fasting state. Furthermore, in a cohort of 1048 subjects, hypertriglyceridemic (fasting serum TG &gt; 150 mg/dL) participants had higher number of LDL particles, higher concentrations of small LDL particles and lower large LDL particles in baseline compared to normotriglyceridemic (fasting serum TG ≤ 150 mg/dL) participants. Following a high-fat meal challenge, both groups displayed similar patterns of change in LDL particle size concentrations with a small decrease in total LDL particle number, an increase in large LDL particle concentration, a decrease in small LDL particle concentration and no change in LDL particle size [
 <xref rid="B45-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In another study, healthy individuals consumed three different diets for four weeks: a Western diet (38% fat of which 22% SFA), Mediterranean diet (38% fat, 24% MUFA) and a high carbohydrates diet with α-linolenic acid (ALA) (&lt; 30% fat of which 8% PUFA). Consumption of the Mediterranean diet led to a decrease in the postprandial number of TRL compared with the other meals and also an increase in TRL particle size compared to the high carbohydrates with α-linolenic acid diet [
 <xref rid="B46-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In the Medi-Rivage intervention study, a postprandial test was performed in individuals after either a three-month low fat or a Mediterranean-type diet (with SFA intake reduced by about half whereas MUFA increased). The consumption of the Mediterranean diet only lowered fasting TG concentration and both diets reduced TG and apoB-48 levels 5 h after the test meal. The overall 5 h postprandial apoB-48 response (AUC and iAUC) was lowered after both diets but this effect was more marked after the Mediterranean diet intervention [
