<p class="p">Concerning the mechanisms, the reduction of postprandial lipemia following 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation could be due to a decrease in CM synthesis/secretion and/or an increase in clearance. Several studies have shown an increase in LPL activity [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] and hepatic lipase activity [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] following supplementation with 3–5 g/day 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 long-chain PUFA suggesting an effect on CM clearance. On the other hand, some studies are more in favor of an effect on CM production [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. It is important not to forget that the reducing effect of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA on VLDL production [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] could also influence postprandial lipemia by the major link with CM metabolism. A lipoprotein kinetic study has examined the effect of the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 FA ethyl esters (4 g/day: 46% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 38% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) to a weight-loss program for 12 weeks on postprandial apoB-48 kinetics in obese subjects after ingestion of an oral load. Compared with weight loss alone, weight loss plus 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 supplementation significantly decreased fasting TG, apoB-48 concentrations, postprandial TG and apoB-48 total AUCs as well as postprandial TG iAUCs. This improvement of the postprandial profile was due to a decreased apoB-48 secretion in the basal state in the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 supplementation group without a significant effect during the postprandial period (3–6 hours) and no change in the clearance rate compared to the weight loss alone group [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. A crossover study (but without a lipoprotein kinetic analysis) conducted by the same team showed a significant improvement of the postprandial lipemia after a fat load in a group of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation (8 weeks; 4 g/day: 46% eicosapentaenoic acid and 38% docosahexaenoic acid) compared to no supplementation [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. A review mainly focused on stable isotope tracer methodologies and compartmental modeling studies examined the mechanisms of action of dietary FA on lipoprotein metabolism [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Concerning n-3 PUFA, their effect on TG concentration reduction can be explained by several mechanisms: inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, FA synthase and acetyl CoA carboxylase enzymes; increase of FA β-oxydation via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) mediated pathway; inhibition of de novo lipogenesis by suppressing transcription of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) gene; degradation of newly synthesized apolipoprotein B by stimulating the post-endoplasmic reticulum presecretory proteolysis pathway. In vivo studies have confirmed that 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA decrease the pool size (PS), the production rate (PR) of TRL-apoB-48 and VLDL-apoB-100, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of TRL-apoB-48 and increase the FCR of VLDL-apoB-100. Regarding 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA, one lipoprotein kinetic study has shown after three weeks of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA supplementation a decrease in the PS of VLDL-apoB-100 due to an increase in FCR compared to a medium-chain FA supplementation. This effect could be due to an up-regulation of LPL activity and hepatic uptake of VLDL consequently to PPAR-activation by 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Lipoprotein kinetic studies on the impact of SFA on lipoprotein metabolism are lacking. One study did not show any effect of a four-week supplementation of medium-chain TG on TRL-apoB-48 and VLDL-apoB-100 metabolism in obese, insulin-resistant men [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. For MUFA, one study conducted in twelve adults, has shown a decrease in PS and PR and an increase in FCR of VLDL-apoB-100 after a three-week MUFA-rich diet compared to a carbohydrate-rich diet [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Only one study has examined the impact of trans-FA on lipoprotein metabolism with no effect, in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, on TRL-apoB-48 or TRL-apoB-100 metabolism [
 <xref rid="B62-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>].
