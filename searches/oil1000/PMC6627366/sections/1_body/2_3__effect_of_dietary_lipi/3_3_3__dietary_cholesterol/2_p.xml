<p class="p">To summarize, it appears that postprandial lipemia increases dose-dependently with the amount of dietary fat or cholesterol (at least above 15â€“20 g of fat and 140 mg of cholesterol) after a single meal. Acute test meals enriched with SFA, MUFA or PUFA do not generally elicit markedly different postprandial lipemia. Despite conflicting results, habitual diet studies show postprandial lipidemic responses to be in the order SFA &gt; MUFA &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA.
