<p class="p">The data available on the impact of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia are limited. In healthy individuals, one single meal containing 0 or 140 mg cholesterol with a fixed amount of fat (45 g) elicited comparable postprandial lipemia whereas important doses of dietary cholesterol (280 or 710 mg) significantly increased postprandial lipemia compared to the lower amount [

A cholesterol-rich meal (1 g) compared to a cholesterol-free meal elicited increased postprandial CM-cholesterol and CM-TG in T2D patients and in matched non-diabetic control subjects. The increase in the postprandial VLDL-apoB-48 concentration was significantly higher in the diabetic patients (10-fold) compared to control individuals (three-fold) but the postprandial VLDL-apoB-100 concentration was not affected by dietary cholesterol, suggesting that intestinal CM production rather than their clearance explained these results [
