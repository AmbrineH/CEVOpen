<p class="p">A study performed in healthy men showed an increase in postprandial lipemia (plasma-TG peak concentration) following an 80 g fat meal compared to a 20 g fat meal with an intermediate result following a 40 g fat meal. A parallel elevation of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentration and postheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity with a trend but no significant change in the increase of insulin response were seen following the 80 g fat meal compared to the 20 g fat meal [

Another study in healthy men individuals did not report any effect of a 15 g low-fat meal on postprandial lipemia compared to a nonfat meal and confirmed the dose-dependent increased postprandial serum-TG and CM-TG concentrations for moderate doses of fat per meal (30 to 50 g). The serum insulin response was significantly higher only following the 50 g fat meal compared to the nonfat and 15 g fat meal [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. These results were confirmed in normal-weight and obese individuals with an increase in CM-TG concentration following a 40 g fat meal compared to a 10 g fat meal [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and in obese boys with an increase in postprandial plasma-TG concentration following a 33 g fat meal compared to a 18 g fat meal. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration was significantly higher after the high-fat meal in the latter study [

This stepwise increase in the postprandial lipemia seen with the increase amount of fat intake suggests that the clearance capacity of the individuals is overloaded proportionally to the amount of fat assimilated. Moreover, consecutive meals containing fat appear to enhance postprandial lipemia [
