Atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD), which is mainly characterized by plasma fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (postprandial hyperlipemia), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and an increase of small and dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL), is frequently seen in individuals at high cardiovascular risk such as obese or overweight patients, type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients and subjects with a metabolic syndrome who share an insulin resistant state [

 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The pathophysiology of the AD is widely explained by the blood accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) synthesized by the liver (very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)) [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and the intestine (chylomicrons (CM)) [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This accumulation has been attributed to the overproduction of both VLDL and CM and to a defective TRL removal process [

 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Elevated fasting and postprandial blood TRL concentrations, which are mainly related to the increase in CM production, are now considered a causal risk factor for low-grade inflammation, atherosclerotic CVD and all-cause mortality [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-01299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. It is now well known that CM production is highly regulated by many factors such as endogenous factors: circulating factors such as hormones or free fatty acids (FFA), genetic variants, circadian rhythms, or exogenous factors: food components, nutraceuticals and therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will focus on the effect of nutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals but also on food structure on CM production and postprandial lipemia (TRL metabolism only) in humans [
