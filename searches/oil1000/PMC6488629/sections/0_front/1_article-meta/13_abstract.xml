 <p id="Par1" class="p">Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (CME) is an infectious disease caused by the rickettsia organism 
  <italic class="italic">Ehrlichia canis</italic> which is transmitted mainly the ixodid brown dog tick 
  <italic class="italic">Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>. The prevalence of 
  <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic> infection has been increasing in recent years. The World Health Organization has been warned about antibiotics resistance and one of the way to prevent this situation is found new compound with this property. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for this tick-borne disease. Adverse effects are noted in dogs that are sensitive to this drug. Antibiotic resistance may also occur. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-
  <italic class="italic">Ehrlichia</italic> properties of the essential oil of the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. in infected DH82 cells, as well as its anti-
  <italic class="italic">Ehrlichia</italic> activity associated with doxycycline using the checkerboard assay. 
  <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> is a native plant from northeast Brazil with many reports of ethnopharmacological applications. The essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> was extracted from the aerial parts of the plant using the hydrodistillation method. 
  <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic>-infected DH82 cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium), maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and standardized at a 70% infection rate for the initiation of treatment protocols. The tests were first carried out with the aim of defining the IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>. The combined effect of doxycycline and 
  <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> essential oil was then determined using the checkerboard dilution technique (checkerboard method) in which the IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 200 µg/mL. The doxycycline reduction index from the combined effect was 4.90 times resulting in a synergistic effect. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first alternative treatment (alternative therapy) based on bioactive molecules that have antibacterial activity against 
  <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic>.
