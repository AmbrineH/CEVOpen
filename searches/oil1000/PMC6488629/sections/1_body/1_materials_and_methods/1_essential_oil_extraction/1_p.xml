 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> collected in the early morning of July of 2017 at the Horto Berta Langes de Morretes, Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA), located in the municipality of São Luís, State of Maranhão (MA), northeast Brazil, Lat. 2°33′13.5″S 44°18′20.8″W. Samples were taxonomically identified and desiccated (voucher) specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Maranhão—UFMA under the ID number Nº. 9.099. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> was extracted from by hydrodistillation in a clevenger apparatus coupled to a Quimis ultrathermostatic bath with a temperature less than 12 °C. The aerial parts of the plant were crushed and placed in a conical flask added with ultrapure distilled water. After 2 h of distillation, the oil was removed from the water surface, centrifuged, and carefully separated from the water added with anhydrous sodium sulfate (JT Baker Chemical Co.), stored in an amber glass ampoule, hermetically sealed, and then stored in a cooled 4 °C for further analysis (Coutinho et al.
