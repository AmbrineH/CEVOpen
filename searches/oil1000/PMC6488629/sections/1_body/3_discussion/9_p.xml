 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> oil collected in São Luís, MA, northeast Brazil was 1.7%. Castro et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2004</xref>) evaluated 5 different types of accessions of 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> and obtained contents between 0.48% and 0.70%. Other authors including Lima et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2014</xref>) and Barros et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2016</xref>) found yields of 0.46% and 0.08%, respectively. This is mainly due to climate, incident solar radiation, relative humidity, and different soil type as previously reported.
