<p id="Par39" class="p">The main mechanism of action of doxycycline consists of the inhibition of protein synthesis. It acts effectively in the treatment of canine ehrlichiosis. There are some restrictions though. We suggest that possibly the mechanism of action of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> against this rickettsia consists of similar biochemical interactions. The bacteriostatic activity and/or the bactericidal activity of EOs are mainly exerted by terpenoid compounds. In general, the main compound present in the essential oil is responsible for the biological activity. However, the combination of these substances may increase the activity of the essential oil since the compounds may interact with each other resulting in a synergistic effect (Feitosa-Alcantara et al.
