 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> may have caused a disturbance in cell membranes. In addition, these compounds may also have disrupted the proton motive force, the electron flow, and the active transport. As a result, there is coagulation of the cellular contents. EOs also appear to act on membrane proteins—enzymes such as ATPases which are surrounded by lipid molecules—suggesting two possible mechanisms: (i) cyclic, lipophilic hydrocarbons that would accumulate in the lipid bilayer distorting lipid–protein interaction, and (ii) direct interaction of the lipophilic compounds with the hydrophobic parts of the proteins. In previous studies, a number of researchers reported that the presence of essential oils also interferes with the repair mechanism necessary for the cellular division of microorganisms as these oils act on bacterial membranes thus promoting their rupture (Farias and Lima
