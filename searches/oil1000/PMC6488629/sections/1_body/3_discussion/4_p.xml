<p id="Par40" class="p">In the present study, a synergistic action was observed in the evaluation of the effects of the associations between doxycycline and the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L., resulting in a reduction of up to 4.89 times the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of DOX (see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The confirmation of the synergistic effects of the essential oil was obtained with the construction of the isobolograms type graphs which show a curve close to the axes for the studied specimen. This assessment suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. is a plant with important and significant antimicrobial activity.
