<p id="Par44" class="p">A number of compounds were found during the chemical characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> L. by GC/MS. These compounds may act in different manners against the microorganisms, e.g. terpenes such as the caryophyllene which are able to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane as suggested by Sartori (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2005</xref>). Its mechanism of action may be associated with its lipophilic character. The accumulation of these compounds within the cell membrane of the microorganism, would result in loss of energy by these cells (Duarte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>). Greay and Hammer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2015</xref>) claim that monoterpenes interfere with the integrity and function of the cell membrane of bacteria by changes in membrane potential, loss of cytoplasmic material, and inhibition of the respiratory chain. In addition, the expression of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins has been implicated in the expression of genes encoding virulence factors (Qiu et al.
