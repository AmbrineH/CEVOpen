 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. (popular names: billygoat-weed, mentrasto) is a native plant from northeast Brazil with many reports of ethnopharmacological applications (Zucchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2013</xref>). It has anti-inflammatory (Mello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2016</xref>) and antiparasitic activities (Narender et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2004</xref>) among other properties that have been reported in the literature. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-
 <italic class="italic">Ehrlichia</italic> properties of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. on DH82 cells in view of the comprehensiveness of this species in northeast Brazil and its proven antimicrobial and antiprotozoal action. In addition, the anti-ehrlichial activity of this hydrophobic liquid in association with doxycycline was assessed using the checkerboard assay.
