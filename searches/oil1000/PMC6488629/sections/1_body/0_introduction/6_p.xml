<p id="Par7" class="p">Essential oils (EO) are complex heterogeneous mixtures consisting of a great diversity of hydrophobic molecules which diffuse easily through all cell membranes showing advantages in interactions with intracellular targets. Properties of essential oils include low density and rapid diffusion through cell membranes due to its liposolubility. In addition, it can also improve the intracellular insertion of the active components into their targets (Santos et al.
