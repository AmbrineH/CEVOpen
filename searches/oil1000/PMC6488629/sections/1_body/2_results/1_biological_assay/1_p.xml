 <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the percentage of inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic> infection in cells after 18 h and 36 h of treatment with the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic>. It is noted that at the concentration of 200 µg/mL at 36 h this hydrophobic liquid inhibited a percentage greater than 50% of 
 <italic class="italic">E. canis</italic> morulae formation. This result demonstrates the in vitro efficacy of this oil.
