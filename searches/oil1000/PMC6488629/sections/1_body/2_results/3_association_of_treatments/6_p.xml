<p id="Par32" class="p">Similarly to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c, the combination sites that were less than 1 indicate a synergistic effect between the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">A. conyzoides</italic> and doxycycline. The fact that the compounds show synergism means that their concentration in combination produces an effect that is stronger than when the treatments are used individually in a similar or greater concentration. For this synergistic property the inhibitors can be evaluated by calculating the drug dose reduction index (DRI, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>) for each treatment of each combination, and is plotted with the log (DRI) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e).
