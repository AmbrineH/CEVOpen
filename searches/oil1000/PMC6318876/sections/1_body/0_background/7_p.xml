 <italic class="italic">S. marcescens</italic> UCP 1549 in low-cost fermentative medium containing cassava flour wastewater (CWW). The effect of the medium components was investigated by full factorial design (FFD) and the best condition was selected and used for kinetics of microbial growth and biosurfactant production. The isolation and characterization of biosurfactant were carried out, as well as studies of its stability, phytotocity and application in removal burned engine oil.
