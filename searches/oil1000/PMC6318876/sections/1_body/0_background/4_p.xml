However, the characteristics of the non-biodegradability, ability to accumulate and toxicity of some of the chemical petroleum based product to the environment suggest to find replacement surfactants to the chemically synthesized compounds with ecofriendly products as biosurfactant or bioemulsifier [

Among them, the use of low-cost raw materials such as agro-industrial wastes is a sustainable alternative since the utilization of these residues contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution [
