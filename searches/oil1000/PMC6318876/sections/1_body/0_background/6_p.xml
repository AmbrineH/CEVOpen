 <italic class="italic">Serratia marcescens</italic>, a facultative bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, produces biosurfactant such as serrawetins that present enormous potential of application in pharmaceutical industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Over the last years, several studies have reported the production of biosurfactants by 
 <italic class="italic">S. marcescens</italic> strains using a variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. However, researches focusing on the use of agro-industrial waste are still few and they have been carried out by our research group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition, the toxicity of this secondary metabolite has only been tested in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>], and considering its potential for environmental application, further studies are needed.
