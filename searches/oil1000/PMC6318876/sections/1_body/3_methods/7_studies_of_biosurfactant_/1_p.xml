<p id="Par44" class="p">Studies of stability of biosurfactant were carried out using 25 mL of cell-free metabolic liquid at different temperatures (0, 5, 28, 70, 100 and 121 °C), for 1 h, and cooled to room temperature, after which the surface tension was measured. The effect of pH on surface tension was evaluated after adjustment of the metabolic liquid pH to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 with 2 M HCl or NaOH. The effect of NaCl concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12%, w/v) on the activity of the biosurfactant were also determined [
