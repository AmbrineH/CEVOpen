<p id="Par46" class="p">The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of biosurfactant isolated after 72 h of cultivation was determined in aqueous solution. The surface tension was measured on an automatic tensiometer (model Sigma 70 KSV Ltd., Finland) using a platinum-iridium ring. The sample of the isolated biosurfactant was diluted at different concentrations, starting with a minimum concentration of 0.001 mg/mL, until up to reaching a constant value of surface tension. The CMC was seen to have produced a surface tension of a constant value. The value of CMC was obtained by plotting surface tension against percentage concentration of biosurfactant (%) [
