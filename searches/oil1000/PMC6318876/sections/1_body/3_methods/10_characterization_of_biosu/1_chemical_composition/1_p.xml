 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. The lipids were extracted with chloroform (1:1) three times, after separate the organic phase with the solvent system chloroform/methanol (1:2), the organic phase rotatory evaporator and then weigh the flask, the difference is the amount of lipids [
