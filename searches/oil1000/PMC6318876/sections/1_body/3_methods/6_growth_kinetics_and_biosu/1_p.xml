<p id="Par43" class="p">To determine the growth kinetics, samples were collected every 4 h during the first 12 h, then every 12 h until 120 h of fermentation. Microbial growth was evaluated by “pour plate” technique, inoculating aliquots of 0.1 mL of each sample on Petri plates containing medium LB and incubating at 28 °C for 24 h. Then, each plate was subjected to counting of viable colonies and growth was expressed in CFU/mL. Samples were also subjected to determination of pH and surface tension.</p>
