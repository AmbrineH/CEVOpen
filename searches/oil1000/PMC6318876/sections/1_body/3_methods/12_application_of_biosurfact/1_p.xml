<p id="Par52" class="p">Biosurfactant suitability for removing hydrophobic pollutants was determined using artificially contaminated sand containing 5% burned motor oil. Twenty-gram samples of contaminated sand were transferred to 250 Erlenmeyer flask and submitted to the following treatments: (A) addition of 50 mL of distilled water (control), (B) addition of 50 mL of cell-free metabolic liquid and (C) addition of 50 mL of aqueous solution of the isolated biosurfactant at concentration of 1000 mg/L. The flasks were subjected to 150 rpm for 48 h at 28 °C and then, centrifuged at 5000×
