 <italic class="italic">Serratia marcescens</italic> UCP 1549, originally isolated and identified by Araujo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>] was kindly provided by the Culture Collection of the Catholic University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil, registered in the World Federation for Culture Collection (WFCC). The bacterium was maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) solid medium (tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, NaCl 10 g/L and agar 15 g/L) at 5 °C. Stored cultures were transferred first to LB medium and incubated for 18 h at 28 °C. Then, two colonies were transferred to 50 mL of LB broth and incubated at 28 °C and 150 rpm in an orbital shaker. Once the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8–1.0, this culture was used as inoculum.
