 <italic class="italic">S. marcescens</italic> UCP 1549. The feasibility of utilization of agro-industrial wastes in combination with the application of a full-factorial design proved to be efficient strategies to obtain low-cost biosurfactant and becomes viable its industrial-scale production. The polymeric and non-toxic biomolecule exhibited not only its excellent properties to reduce surface tension, but also its high stability at wide range of pH, temperature and NaCl concentrations. In addition, it showed higher potential for breaking the dormancy in cabbage seeds and removing burned motor oil from beach sand, suggesting its application in agriculture and environmental processes.
