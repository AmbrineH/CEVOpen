<p id="Par20" class="p">As can be observed, the exponential phase of microorganism occurred in the first 24 h, after a very short phase of adaptation to physico-chemical composition of medium. Simultaneously, the surface tension began to decrease, indicating that the new substrates promote the biosynthesis of essential compounds to the microbial growth and the production of biomolecules with surface active properties. The start of growth stationary phase occurred at 36 h when the value of surface tension was lower to 30 mN/m. Similar profile was observed when

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). However, the maximum production of biosurfactant was detected at 72 h, with lower value of surface tension (25.9 mN/m).
