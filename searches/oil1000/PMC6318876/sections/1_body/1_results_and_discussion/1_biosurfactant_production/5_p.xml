<p id="Par15" class="p">The predicted versus the actual plot for surface tension determined by the model equation demonstrated that observed values were distributed near the straight line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), which indicates that such values were close to the predicted values. The ANOVA showed that the regression model had a high coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.963), indicating that 96.3% of the variation in the process efficiency was explained by the independent variables and that only 3.7% was not explained by the model. Reproducibility of the experimental data was confirmed by the low pure error (0.051) and value of the adjusted determination coefficient (Adj. R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.897). Hence, the model proved to be suitable for the prediction of biosurfactant production under the experimental conditions.
