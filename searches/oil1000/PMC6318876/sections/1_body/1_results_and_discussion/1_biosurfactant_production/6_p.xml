 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. In this study, surface tension was used as response variable, and the effects of independent variables (lactose, CWW and CO concentrations) as well as the interactions of them, were analyzed by estimated effects represented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. It can be concluded that although the three variables were significant, the increase of all of them led to increment of surface tension. However, the increment of CWW and diminution of CO and lactose allowed the lower value of surface tension, as verified in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, in condition 3 of the FFD.
