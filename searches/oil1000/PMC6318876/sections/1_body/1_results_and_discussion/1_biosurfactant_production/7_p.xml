<p id="Par17" class="p">Previously, Araújo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>] used the same substrates and FFD for the production of biosurfactant by 
 <italic class="italic">S. marcescens</italic> UCP 1549, but in static conditions, and they found the best results in condition 8, with reduction on surface tension to 30.60 mN/m. Highest tensioactive activity detected in current study in flasks with agitation can be linked to the physiological function of the biosurfactants. It has been suggested that their production can increase the solubility of hydrophobic substrates in water and, consequently, facilitate the transport of nutrients to microorganisms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore, the shear stress caused by agitation can induce larger biosurfactant excretion since the contact between the organic phase drops, dispersed in water, and the microorganisms becomes more difficult [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. In addition, several researchers have indicated that an increase in agitation speed favored the production of biosurfactant, since that it influences the mass transfer efficiency of both oxygen molecules and medium components [
