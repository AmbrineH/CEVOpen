<p id="Par32" class="p">Considering that a GI value of 80% has been used as an indicator of the disappearance of phytotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>], the results obtained here indicated that the biosurfactant solutions tested did not show inhibitory effects on seed germination and root elongation of cabbage, after 5 days of incubation. GI of 134,108, 111, 100, 83 and 81 were found for biosurfactant solutions of 10, 50, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L, respectively. Similar results were observed by Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>] who investigated the phytotoxic potential of biosurfactant from 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> UCP 0992 cultivated in glycerol and found that the compound was innocuous with regard to cabbage. Recently, biosurfactant produced by
