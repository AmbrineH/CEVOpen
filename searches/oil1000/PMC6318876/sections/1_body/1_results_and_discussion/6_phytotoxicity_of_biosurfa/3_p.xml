 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>], the process of germination begins when the seed coat allows the entrance of water in the seed, which activates metabolism and leads to growth of the embryonic axis. For this process to take place, it is necessary that wrapping embryonic tissues be permeable to water. In this sense, biosurfactants, due to their amphipathic structure, probably acted on external wrapping tissue, increasing the permeability of seeds and thereby facilitating germination, as reported by Hameed et al.
