<p id="Par28" class="p">The FT-IR spectrum showed a significant absorbance peak at 3141 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> ranging from 2700 to 3700 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This feature typically is attributed to the presence of carbon and amino groups and caused due to stretching vibrations of C–H and N–H bonds, present in the peptide moiety. A sharp band at 1400.2 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> correspond to C–H stretching mode, suggesting the presence of aliphatic chain of fatty acids, whereas the absorption peak, located at 1128.9 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showed the presence of ester carbonyl groups (–CO bond), indicating the ester linkage between the polysaccharides-forming monomers. At last a sharp peak at 675.2 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> represented –CH bending of alkenes [
