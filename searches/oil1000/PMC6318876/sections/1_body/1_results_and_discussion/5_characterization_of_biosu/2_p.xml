<p id="Par27" class="p">Biosurfactants are generally macromolecules and it is not easy to determine their chemical structure, especially when they are produced from industrial wastes. However, the determination of the structural formula of these compounds is fundamental to study and better understand their properties, as well as to propose the most appropriate field of its application [
