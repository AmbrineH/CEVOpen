 <italic class="italic">S. marcescens</italic> UCP 1549 was able to use lactose and corn oil, probably as carbon source because they are carbohydrates and fatty acids respectively, proving the ability of microorganisms to utilize some carbohydrates and oils as carbon source in the induction of production of secondary metabolites [

Studies show that to obtain high production of biopolymer, one should better define the relationship between sources of carbon and nitrogen in the medium. The balanced medium can contain ten times more carbon than nitrogen ensuring high protein content, while a ratio greater than 50:1 promotes the accumulation of extracellular secondary metabolites [
