 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR metabolomics approach was carried out to explore the composition of new aquaculture feeds compared to a plant-based feed. In the quest for sustainable feed, we focused on INS, YST and SPI. Thanks to an approach based on untargeted feed characterization, numerous free soluble compounds were highlighted. Several of these compounds are known to have an impact on fish metabolism and could thus potentially help to explain differences in growth performances. Growth and FCR were significantly impacted by several alternative diets compared to PB. Our findings indicate that INS or YST feedstuff inclusion in these plant-based feeds can improve growth performances of trout. Insect meal and yeast are already known to be good candidates for FM substitution in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon (Ã˜verland et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, the price of each of these feedstuffs is higher than that of fish meal so far, especially for insect meal as insect production chains are still emerging. Our results confirm the interest of complementing PB feeds with insect or yeast feedstuffs.
