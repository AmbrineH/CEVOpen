<p id="Par45" class="p">Similar soluble compounds were found in YST and PB feed. The yeast feedstuff used was a yeast parietal fraction. Yeast cell walls are widely composed of non-soluble polysaccharides, mainly β-glucans, mannan-oligosaccharides and proteins. This probably explains why so few of the soluble compounds of YST and PB feed are significantly different (Lesage and Bussey

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2008</xref>). Therefore, the higher growth performance of YST feed compared to PB feed cannot be attributed to a direct effect of soluble compounds. However, it could be reasonably ascribed to other demonstrated effects such as changes in gut health and the immune effect of yeast cell walls, which could offset the negative effect of pathogens or enhance nutrient digestibility (Jørgensen et al.
