<p id="Par49" class="p">Similarly, higher relative intensities of trehalose were detected in SPI compared to PB feed. This higher intensity may directly result from trehalose presence in the SPI feedstuff, and suggests that the spirulina culture conditions may have been sub-optimal as

Trehalose in rainbow trout can be hydrolyzed into glucose by brush border trehalase in gastrointestinal mucosa, but the regulation of its enzymatic activity by carbohydrates in diets is unclear as contradictory results were found with other disaccharide enzymes (Buddington and Hilton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">1987</xref>; Krogdahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2004</xref>). To check this hypothesis, the production of glucose from trehalose should be monitored in trout.
