<p id="Par50" class="p">Other mechanisms such as the effect of microbiota or differences in the digestibility of diets are probably involved in the growth performances of alternative feeds. Apparent digestibility of alternative feedstuffs should not be the main cause of growth performance differences as it seems quite high in yeast protein fraction (92.1% of protein, unpublished data) and in published data on similar feeds including spirulina biomass and
