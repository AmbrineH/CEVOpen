<p id="Par47" class="p">Glycerol relative intensities were higher in INS feed than in PB. Some insect larvae are known to produce glycerol, which protects insects from extreme cold temperatures (Storey and Storey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moreover, the analysis of the insect raw material used in the present study confirmed that the glycerol originated from this feedstuff. In fish nutrition, glycerol is primarily a substrate of lipid metabolism for the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids. However, this substrate is not limiting due to the large dietary supply of lipids. Glycerol seems to act as an energetic substrate in herbivorous species such as Nile tilapia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1986</xref>) reported that glycerol is not an effective energy supplier because its conversion into glucose exceeds the glucose requirement of such fish (Neu et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2018</xref>). In addition, microbiota plays a key role in glycerol degradation in human (Weirdt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, our data are too limited to support this hypothesis.
