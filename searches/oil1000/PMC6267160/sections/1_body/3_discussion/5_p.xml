<p id="Par48" class="p">The dried spirulina biomass used in the present study contained a complete set of the micro-organism metabolites. Indeed, the higher fold change with SPI feed corresponded to 3-hydroxybutyrate. Like several micro-organisms, 
 <italic class="italic">S. platensis</italic> is known to synthesize poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and activate depolymerization to use monomers as carbon source under nitrogen-starved conditions (Jau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2005</xref>). Moderate inclusion levels of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) enhance growth in the carnivorous fish European sea bass and Siberian sturgeon, but there are still no data on 3-hydroxybutyrate supplied in the free form as in SPI feed (Schryver et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2010</xref>; Najdegerami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>). As a ketone body, 3-hydroxybutyrate could be used as energy substrate in the event of glucose depletion during fasting for specific tissues such as brain and heart in mammals (Newman and Verdin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2017</xref>). Moreover, 3-hydroxybutyrate could act as an epimetabolite (Showalter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2017</xref>) by inducing lysine histone methylation (Newman and Verdin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, little is known about its utilization in fish.
