<p id="Par35" class="p">Fish final body weight and FCR of juvenile rainbow trout fed control and experimental feeds for 84 days are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Feeds had a significant impact on final body weight (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.023). Fish fed INS and YST feeds had a significantly higher body weight than fish fed PB feed (Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.004 and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.010, respectively). Final body weight of the SPI and COM groups did not significantly differ from that of the PB group (Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.219 and P = 0.0625, respectively). However, the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.065) for the COM group was close to the defined threshold, indicating a trend in higher body weight. Final body weight in the COM group was not significantly different from that of the other groups. FCR differed significantly between the feeds (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.002). INS, YST and COM diets were significantly more efficient than PB (Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test). On the other hand, SPI feed did not differ from COM or PB feeds.
