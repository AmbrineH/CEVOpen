<p id="Par39" class="p">Volcano plot analyses on the 473 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR CPMG spectral bins of feed extracts were used to assess which spectral regions and corresponding compounds differentiated INS, SPI or YST alternative feeds from the PB control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Online Resources 3 and 4). In INS feed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a), 119 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectral bins were significantly higher and 19 bins were significantly lower than in PB feed with the chosen thresholds. The highest significant log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(FC) reached almost 5 and the lowest was almost − 4. For SPI diet (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b), 93 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectral bins were significantly higher, whereas 6 bins were significantly lower than in PB feed with the chosen thresholds. The highest significant log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(FC) reached about 4.5 and the lowest was about − 2.5. For YST feed (Online Resource 2), only one 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR bin was significantly higher, while none was lower than in PB feed. The log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(FC) associated of this bin was 1.5. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectral bins highlighted with the volcano plots were tentatively annotated.
