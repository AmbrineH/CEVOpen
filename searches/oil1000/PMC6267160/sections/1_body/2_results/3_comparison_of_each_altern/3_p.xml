 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR CPMG spectrum for INS or for SPI compared to one representative spectrum of PB feed extract, respectively. Signals were well superimposed within each feed, which demonstrated a good reproducibility. The annotated signals—16 in INS and 12 in SPI—correspond to spectral bins that fulfilled the volcano plot thresholds (Online Resources 3 and 4). INS feed exhibited higher relative intensities of four essential free amino acids—isoleucine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine—compared to PB feed. Similarly, the relative intensities of free non-essential and other free amino acids, alanine, proline, tyrosine and pyroglutamate, were higher in INS feed compared to PB. The relative intensities of the organic acids lactate and succinate were also higher in INS feed compared to PB. Finally, glucose, glycerol (showing the highest fold change of 31), phosphocholine, ethanolamine, uridine, hypoxanthine and carnitine were identified, and their relative intensities were also higher in INS than in PB feed. We verified the presence of glycerol in the INS feedstuff polar extract, as it presented the highest fold change in the corresponding feed (Online Resource 6A). For SPI feed, the relative intensities of four essential free amino acids, isoleucine, leucine, valine and phenylalanine, were higher than in PB feed. The non-essential free amino acids ornithine, alanine and glutamate, the organic acids lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate (showing the highest fold change of 22) as well as AMP and trehalose were also identified in SPI feed and their relative intensities were higher than in PB feed. We verified the presence of 3-hydroxybutyrate in an SPI feedstuff polar extract as it presented the highest fold change in the corresponding diet (Online Resource 6B).
