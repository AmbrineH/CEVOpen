<p id="Par37" class="p">A PCA was performed on the 473 spectral bins of the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR CPMG feed profiles (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The first two principal components (PCs) explained 82% of the total variance. Feed extract samples were well clustered and clearly separated depending on the feedstuff composition, except for YST feed samples which overlapped PB ones. INS and COM feeds were both on the positive side of PC1, compared to PB and YST feeds on the negative side, and they clearly separated along PC2. SPI, PB and COM samples were clearly separated. SPI samples had an intermediary position between PB and COM feeds.
