<p id="Par32" class="p">Free induction decay (FID), spectra processing, signal-to-noise ratio determination and spectral data reduction (binning) were processed using the NMRProcFlow tool (Jacob et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2017</xref>). Prior to Fourier transformation, each FID was zero-filled to 256K data points and multiplied by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz. Spectra were then automatically zero-order phased and manually calibrated on –CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups of TSP-d4 (δ 0 ppm) before manual baseline correction and resonance alignments. Residual water signal (δ 4.768–4.789 ppm) was excluded. Binning was performed by the adaptive intelligent binning method of Meyer et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>) on the spectral area δ 0.896–9.134 ppm. Binning consists in dividing spectra into smaller spectral regions or “bins” to isolate and integrate the area under the signal curve to obtain extracted bin intensities. The total intensity of each spectrum was kept constant and each spectral bin intensity was normalized to this constant sum before exporting the resulting table of relative bin intensities for statistical analyses. Spectral bins with a signal-to-noise ratio under 3 were removed. Thereafter, relative bin intensities will be referred as “relative intensities”.
