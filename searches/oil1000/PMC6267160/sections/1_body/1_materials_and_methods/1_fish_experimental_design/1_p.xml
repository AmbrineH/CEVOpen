<p id="Par24" class="p">The experiment was carried out in the INRA experimental facilities (UMR1419 Nutrition, Métabolisme, Aquaculture, Donzacq, France) authorized for animal experimentation by the French veterinary service, which is the competent authority (A 64-495-1). The experiment was in strict accordance with EU legal frameworks concerning the protection of animals used for scientific research (Directive 2010/63/EU) and according to the National Guidelines for Animal Care of the French Ministry of Research (decree n°2013-118, February 1st, 2013). The scientists in charge of the experimentation received training and personal authorization (N°B64 10 005). In agreement with the ethical committee “Comité d’Ethique Aquitaine Poissons Oiseaux” (C2EA-73), the experiment reported here did not need approval by a specific ethical committee since it involved only classical rearing practices with all diets used in the experiment formulated to cover the nutritional requirements of rainbow trout. During the experiment, fish were monitored daily. If any clinical symptoms (i.e. morphological abnormality, restlessness or uncoordinated movements) were observed, fish were sedated by immersion in 10 mg/l benzocaine solution and then euthanized by immersion in a 60 mg/l benzocaine solution (anesthetic overdose) for 3 min.</p>
