<p id="Par25" class="p">Fifteen groups of thirty juvenile rainbow trout (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) were randomly constituted (five diets in triplicates). The mean initial body weight was 48.98 ± 1.00 g (n = 450 fish) and it was not significantly different between the tanks. Fish were reared in 100 L tanks in a flow-through system supplied with natural spring water at 17 ± 1 °C. Fish were fed twice daily until visual satiety. The duration of the experiment was 84 days. Mortality was recorded daily. The total biomass and the amount of feed distributed per tank were recorded every 3 weeks. The mean body weight per tank was calculated by dividing the total biomass by the number of fish alive in the tank. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) per tank was calculated by dividing the biomass gain by the amount of feed distributed.
