<p id="Par26" class="p">Five different feeds were tested: a commercial-like (COM) feed containing FM and FO, a totally plant-based feed (PB) and plant-based feeds with 15% insect meal (INS), spirulina biomass (SPI) or yeast protein fraction (YST), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). A fraction of plant proteins and vegetable oils were substituted with each alternative feedstuff depending on their composition to get isoenergetic, isolipidic and isoproteic diets (proximate compositions are detailed in Online Resource 1). The insect meal was prepared as for a fish protein concentrate: live larvae were frozen, then successively minced, ground and sieved. The mixture was defatted by centrifugation and the supernatant which contained most of the lipid fraction was removed. The residue which contained the protein-enriched fraction was collected and dried. The spirulina meal was prepared from whole spirulina which was dried then ground. The yeast protein fraction was produced from autolyzed yeast, then separated to obtain the parietal fraction which was further dried. The feeds were produced at the INRA experimental fish facility (Donzacq, France). Pellets were obtained using an extrusion cooking process (CLEXTRAL BC45 extruder with double screw, Firminy, France) with a 44.5 bar pressure and a 52 °C mean temperature then dried at 40 °C with an air flux for a minimum of 2 h. A sample of pellets was collected just after production and stored at − 20 °C until extraction. Approximately 1 g of frozen pellets of each diet was cryo-ground (6750 Freezer/Mill, Spex SamplePrep, Metuchen, USA) before freeze-drying.
