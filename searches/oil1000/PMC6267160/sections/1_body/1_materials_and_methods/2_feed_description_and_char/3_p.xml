<p id="Par28" class="p">Extraction was performed on five randomized replicates of 50.0 ± 0.5 mg of freeze-dried powder as previously published by Moing et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2004</xref>). Briefly, lyophilized powdered samples were successively extracted with 2 ml of 80/20 (v/v) ethanol (Absolute, Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France) and MilliQ water (Millipore, Molsheim, France), 2 ml of 50/50 ethanol and MilliQ water and 3 ml of 0/100 ethanol and MilliQ water at 80 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were combined, dried under vacuum (SpeedVac Savant, Asheville, USA) and freeze-dried. Extracts were then solubilized in 300 µl of a deuterated solution [200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution, 2 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid disodium salt (EDTA)] at apparent pH 6. EDTA was added to chelate paramagnetic cations in order to improve the spectrum resolution, especially in the citrate area. The pH was adjusted to apparent pH 6.00 ± 0.02 using NaOD or DCl by means of a titration robot (BTpH, Bruker, Kalrsruhe, Germany). Adjusted extracts were frozen and freeze-dried. The dried pH-adjusted extracts were stored in obscurity under vacuum at room temperature until
