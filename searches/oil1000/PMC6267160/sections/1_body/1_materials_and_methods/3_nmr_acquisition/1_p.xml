<p id="Par29" class="p">NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) operating at 500.16 MHz at 300 K using a 5 mm ATMA broadband inverse probe flushed with nitrogen gas. 1D spectra were acquired using a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) sequence with a T2 filter to remove macromolecule signals and pre-saturation to remove the water signal. CPMG acquisition sequence does not give quantitative information because it reduces signal intensities of compounds based on their spin–spin (T2) relaxation times, and signal intensity is no longer correlated to absolute concentration only. Moreover, the short recycle delay (2 s) may truncate FID of long spin–lattice (T1) resonances. However, comparisons of a selected bin intensity between samples remained possible as acquisition parameters were kept constant. Sixteen scans of 64K data points were recorded with a 90° pulse angle, a 6000 Hz spectral width, a 5.46 s acquisition time, a 2 s recycle delay, 200 µs echo time and 400 loops, preceded by 16 dummy scans.</p>
