 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR metabolomics profiling revealed differences in the soluble compounds of new aquaculture feeds, except for YST feed that could not be discriminated from PB feed due to the low solubility of the cell wall fraction of the yeast feedstuff. Numerous soluble compounds in INS and SPI feeds differed from those in PB feed. Some of these compounds are specific to the insect or to the microalgae. This metabolomic approach to feed characterization could prove relevant in revealing unsuspected compounds that potentially impact fish metabolism. Future trends in the untargeted analysis of aquaculture feeds should also focus on the characterization of alternative feedstuffs themselves to assess their potential values and limits.
