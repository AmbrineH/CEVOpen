<p id="Par23" class="p">Using 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR metabolomics, we analyzed soluble compounds of selected plant-based feeds supplemented either by insect larvae (
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic>) meal, microalgae (
 <italic class="italic">S. platensis</italic>) biomass or yeast (
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) protein fraction. A trial was implemented in rainbow trout to investigate the effect of each experimental feed on growth compared with trout fed plant-based feed or FM- and FO-based feed as a reference. Our results show that some of the feeds supplemented with alternative feedstuffs presented higher intensities of specific compounds compared to the plant-based feed. Some of these compounds are discussed for their potential impact on fish metabolism.
