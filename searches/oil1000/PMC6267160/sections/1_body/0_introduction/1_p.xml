<p id="Par19" class="p">The global aquaculture sector has developed constantly over the last two decades (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>). Fish feed has evolved considerably to support such trends, moving progressively from traditional fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) based feeds to plant-based (PB) feeds. The difficulty of supplying all aquaculture sectors with marine resources has been the main reason for replacing FM, which is now largely substituted by cereals and grain legumes (National Research Council (U.S.) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2011</xref>). In salmonids, including rainbow trout, FO can be substituted almost exclusively by vegetable oil, which provides essential fatty acid precursors of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Oliva-Teles et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2015</xref>). The total replacement of FM for carnivorous species by PB feedstuffs, however, leads to reduced growth performances, mainly due to numerous anti-nutritional factors and unbalanced amino acid profiles (Geay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2011</xref>; Collins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>; Lazzarotto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2018</xref>). Furthermore, the exclusive use of PB feedstuffs for aquaculture is no longer sustainable. For example, the land used for PB feedstuff production is the same as that used for other livestock feeds and human nutrition (Troell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need of alternatives to FM and PB products, either other animal protein feedstuffs such as insects, or micro-organisms such as microalgae and yeast.
