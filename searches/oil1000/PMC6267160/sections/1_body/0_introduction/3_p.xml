<p id="Par21" class="p">Commercial fish feeds are usually characterized by their feedstuff composition and their chemical proximate composition, which indicates the protein, lipid and carbohydrate content, as well as amino acids and fatty acids profile of the feed (Jobling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>). It is possible to predict the nutritional value of a feed based on its chemical nutritional profile. However, this does not guarantee that feed will be well tolerated by fish because of the possible presence of antinutritional factors or other compounds. Large differences in feedstuff quality, as revealed by their severe impact on fish growth and metabolism, appear to be related to compounds other than macro-nutrients such as anti-nutritional factors and derivative compounds produced by poor processing conditions (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2016</xref>). Thus, the numerous soluble compounds in feeds and feedstuffs originating either from feedstuff itself or from their processing need to be characterized.
