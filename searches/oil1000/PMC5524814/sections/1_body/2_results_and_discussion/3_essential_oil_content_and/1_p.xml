<p class="p">In order to contribute to the chemical characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic>, the essential oil contents of the air-dried aerial parts of seven samples of this taxon have been determined and compared with those obtained for samples of other sages used in the region (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>). The essential oil content (% v/w) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> was in general higher than 2% (1.8–4.5%), even for a sample collected in winter (SB7), which yielded 3.8% of oil. Only one sample (SB4) gave a lower yield (1.8%). The essential oil contents of the three samples of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic> were always below 2% (1.2–1.3%) and lower than those shown by 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic>. Finally, their hybrid, 
 <italic class="italic">S. x hegelmaieri</italic>, gave a content of 2.5%, which is in between of those shown by the parent taxa.
