<p class="p">In addition to the similarity of the composition of the essential oils of the three taxa investigated, it is noteworthy to remark that they show chromatographic profiles that are mostly in accordance with those prescribed in the current standards for “Spanish sage oil” in the European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) (monograph 1849), for “oil of sage, Spanish” by the International Organization for Standardization (standard ISO 3526) (ISO, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) and for “aceite esencial de salvia de España” by the Spanish Association for Standardization (AENOR, standard UNE 84310) (AENOR, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" class="xref">5</xref>). Minor differences can be observed, that could be due to the fact that the essential oils studied here were hydrodistilled in the laboratory from small amounts of dried plant material, whereas standards are established for essential oils obtained by steam distillation at industrial scale. The species accepted for the preparation of the essential oil in these standards is 
 <italic class="italic">S. lavandulifolia</italic> (referred here as 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>). Nevertheless, according to our results, also 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> should be considered as a possible source of this oil. In fact, this endemic Levantine sage appears in a small mountainous area between northern Alicante and southern Valencia provinces, immersed within the wide distribution area of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>. Therefore, when wildgrowing, these two sages could be collected without any distinction.
