<p class="p">The alcoholic preparation known as “
 <italic class="italic">salvieta”</italic> or “
 <italic class="italic">licor de salvia”</italic> (sage liquor), which is used as digestive, is especially made in 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> distribution area (Martínez-Francés et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). “
 <italic class="italic">Salvieta</italic>” is a homemade anise-flavored alcoholic maceration of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic>, alone or, rarely, mixed with other sages, such as, 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis, S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. microphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">microphylla</italic>. Nowadays this local product has not a great demand outside the zone of preparation, but some small industries of this area are already marketing the raw material for teas or as a kit for a homemade liquor elaboration. However, there is a potential market for this sage liquor, because its consumption in local festivities and annual fairs are consolidating its use among the youngest. To prevent adulterations, a correct identification of the raw material is necessary.
