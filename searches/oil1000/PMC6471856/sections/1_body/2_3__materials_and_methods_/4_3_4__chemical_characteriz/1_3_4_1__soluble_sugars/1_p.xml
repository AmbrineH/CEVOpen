<p class="p">To determine the composition of the soluble sugars, 1 g of each sample (CH and NCH) was mixed with melezitose (internal standard—IS, 25 mg/mL) and extracted with 40 mL of 80% aqueous ethanol at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation and fat removal with consecutive ethyl ether washes as previously described by Pereira et al.

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. High-performance liquid chromatography (Knauer, Smartline system 1000, Berlin, Germany) coupled to a refractive index detector (HPLC-RI) was the chosen methodology and the data were analyzed using Clarity 2.4 Software (DataApex, Prague, Czech Republic). HPLC consisted of integrated equipment with a pump (Knauer, Smartline system 1000, Berlin, Germany), degasser (Smartline manager 5000), auto-sampler (AS-2057 Jasco, Easton, MD, USA), and an RI detector (Knauer Smartline 2300). Data were analyzed using Clarity 2.4 Software (DataApex). The chromatographic separation was achieved with a Eurospher 100-5 NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm, Knauer) operating at 30 °C (7971 R Graceoven). The mobile phase was acetonitrile/deionized water (70:30,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Identification was carried out by comparing authentic standard retention times, while quantification was achieved using the IS method (DataApex, Podohradska, Czech Republic), with calibration curves constructed from authentic standards. Soluble sugars were further expressed in g per 100 g of dry weight (dw).
