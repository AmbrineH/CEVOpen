<p class="p">Fatty acid content was investigated after trans-esterification of the lipid fraction obtained through Soxhlet extraction as previously described by Pinela et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The samples were filtered with a 0.2 µm nylon filter (Whatman) and analyzed by gas–liquid chromatography (DANI 1000, Contone, Switzerland) with flame ionization detection (GC-FID)/capillary column. The analysis was carried out with a split/splitless injector, an FID at 260 °C, and a Zebron-Kame column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.20 µm film thickness, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The oven temperature program was as follows: The initial temperature of the column was 100 °C, held for 2 min, then a 10 °C/min ramp to 140 °C, 3 °C/min ramp to 190 °C, 30 °C/min ramp to 260 °C, held for 2 min. The carrier gas (hydrogen) flow rate was 1.1 mL/min, measured at 100 °C. Split injection (1:50) was carried out at 250 °C. Fatty acid identification and quantification were achieved by comparing the relative retention times of the fatty acids methyl ester peaks with standards. The results were recorded and processed using CSW 1.7 software (DataApex 1.7) and expressed in the relative percentage for each fatty acid.
