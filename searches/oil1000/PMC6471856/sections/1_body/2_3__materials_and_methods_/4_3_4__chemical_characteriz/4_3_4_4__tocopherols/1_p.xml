<p class="p">Hexane solutions of butyl-hydroxy-toluene (10 mg/mL; 100 μL) and tocol (internal standard, 400 μL at 50 μg/mL) were added to 500 mg of the sample prior to extraction, as formerly described by Pinela et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The combination was then homogenized with 4 mL of methanol by vortex mixing (1 min), followed by 4 mL of hexane (by vortex mixing for 1 min). After sample homogenization, a saturated NaCl aqueous solution (2 mL) was added, the mixture was combined (vortex mixed for 1 min), centrifuged (5 min, 4000

The combined extracts (i.e., the clear layer) were dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 2 mL of n-hexane, dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered through a 0.2 µm nylon filter (Whatman), transferred into a dark injection vial, and analyzed by HPLC (Knauer, Smartline system 1000, Berlin, Germany) coupled to a fluorescence detector (FP-2020; Jasco, Easton, MD, USA) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The chromatographic separation was achieved with a Polyamide II (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) normal-phase column from YMC Waters operating at 30 °C. The mobile phase used was a mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate (70:30, 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the injection volume was 20 µL. The fluorescence detector was programmed for excitation at 290 nm and emission at 330 nm. The compounds were identified by chromatographic comparisons with authentic standards. Quantification was based on calibration curves obtained from commercial standards of each compound using the IS methodology. The results were expressed in µg/100 g dw.
