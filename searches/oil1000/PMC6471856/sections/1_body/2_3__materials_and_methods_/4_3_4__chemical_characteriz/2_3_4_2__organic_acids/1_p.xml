<p class="p">Metaphosphoric acid (4.5%) was added to 1 g of the sample; the mixture was then protected from light and incubated (with agitation) for 20 min at room temperature. After sample filtration, organic acids were determined using a Shimadzu 20A series UFLC (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to photodiode array detector (PDA) [

 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column (5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d—internal diameter.) thermostatted at 35 °C. The elution was performed with sulphuric acid (3.6 mM) using a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Detection was carried out in a PDA using 215 and 245 nm (for ascorbic acid) as preferred wavelengths. For the quantitative analysis, calibration curves with known concentrations of commercial standards were constructed, and the organic acids present in the two samples were determined by peak area comparison at 215 nm and 245 nm (for ascorbic acid). The results were expressed in g per 100 g dw.
