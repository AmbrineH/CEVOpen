<p class="p">The proximate composition (i.e., proteins, fat, ash, fiber, and carbohydrates) and energetic value were evaluated in CH and NCH. The crude protein content of the samples was determined following the macro-Kjeldahl method [N × 6.25, AOAC (Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC INTERNATIONAL) 991.02], the total fat using a Soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether as the extraction solvent (AOAC 989.05), and the ash content by sample incineration at 550 ± 15 °C (AOAC 935.42) [

Fiber was determined based on the solubilization of non-cellulosic compounds using sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide solutions (FIWE Fiber Analyzers). Total available carbohydrates were calculated by its difference, using the following equation: Total carbohydrates (g/100 g) = 100 − (g fat + g protein + g ash + g fiber). Total energy was calculated according to the following equation: Energy (kcal/100 g) = 4 × (g proteins + g carbohydrates) + 9 × (g fat) + 2 × (g fiber).
