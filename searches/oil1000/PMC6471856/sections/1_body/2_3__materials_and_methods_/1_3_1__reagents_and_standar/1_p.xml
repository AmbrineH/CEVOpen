 <sc class="sc">d</sc>(–)-fructose, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>(+)-glucose anhydrous, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>(+)-melezitose hydrate, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>(+)-sucrose, and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>(+)-trehalose). All other chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade purity and purchased from common suppliers. Water was treated in a Milli-Q water purification system (TGI Pure Water Systems, Greenville, SC, USA).
