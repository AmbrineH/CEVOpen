<p class="p">Results regarding the fatty acids composition of CH and NCH are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01111-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The fatty acids profile showed 25 compounds for CH and 26 for NCH. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were the major group, followed by saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Humans lack the enzymes required to produce the two essential fatty acids: ω-3 PUFA-α-linolenic and ω-6 PUFA-linoleic. Although the synthesis rate may not be sufficient to meet human requirements, and it is, hence, recommended that good sources of these fatty acids are also included in the diet, humans can elongate dietary α-linolenic acid to the long chain ω-3 PUFAs, namely eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. PUFA corresponds to 46.95% of the fatty acids present in CH and 49% in NCH, mainly due to the high content of linoleic acid in both samples (40.08% and 39.903%, respectively). Linoleic and α-linolenic acids are present in high percentages in some edible flowers (&gt;50%), such as

 <italic class="italic">Trifolium angustifolium</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. CH (42.14%) and NCH (43.62%) stayed just below the 50% cut-off line. Linoleic and α-linolenic acids have important roles in human growth and development, as well as in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery diseases, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. SFA is the second group of fatty acids with similar predominance in CH (35.56%) and NCH (35.36%), largely due to the high content of palmitic acid (24.12 and 24.76%, respectively). Palmitic acid is one of the most common SFA found in edible plants. Although it is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], when consumed with other fatty acids, like PUFAs, SFA are unlikely to have any significant impact on human health [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. A recent review highlighted that further research is needed to unveil the true advantages and disadvantages induced by palmitic acid consumption [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. CH and NCH also contain other saturated fatty acids in lower concentrations, such as stearic (CH: 5.19%, NCH: 4.79%), arachidic (CH: 1.87%, NCH: 1.453%), and behenic acids (CH: 1.86%, NCH: 1.57%). MUFA makes up the smallest contribution to the fatty acids content in CH (17.5%) and NCH (15.31%), mainly due to the presence of oleic acid (CH: 15.4%, NCH: 13.70%). Both samples presented small percentages of palmitoleic (CH: 0.662%, NCH: 0.628%), elaidic (CH: 1.10%, NCH: 0.861%), and eicosanoic acids (CH: 0.366%, NCH: 0.121%). As it has been shown, olive oil induces its hypotensive effects through the action of oleic acid and, according to Fernandes et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], one of the highest percentages of this fatty acid present in edible flowers was found in 
 <italic class="italic">Gundelia tournefortii</italic> L. buds (28.5%) [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. For both samples (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01111-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), PUFA and SFA predominate over MUFA due to the significant contribution of linoleic and palmitic acids, respectively. However, unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) prevail over SFA (64.44% versus 35.56% in CH and 6.9% versus 35.36% in NCH). According to the literature, with the exception observed in calendula flowers (23.3%), unsaturated fatty acids predominate over saturated ones for edible flowers, usually being higher than 53% [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to Fernandes et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], in general all edible flowers studied until now showed high ratios (above 0.45) of PUFA/SFA, which are known to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and the 
 <italic class="italic">Cytinus hypocistis</italic> (L.) L. plant is no exception. The PUFA/SFA ratios for CH and NCH were 1.320 and 1.37, respectively.
