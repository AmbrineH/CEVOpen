<p class="p">The soluble sugar composition of the two samples is also shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01111-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Two reducing (i.e., fructose and glucose) and two non-reducing (i.e., sucrose and trehalose) sugars were detected in both samples. Fructose is known to be the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and was the main sugar present in CH, almost 9-fold higher (6.3 g/100 g dw) than in NCH (0.71 g/100 g dw). Glucose was also almost 9-fold higher in CH (1.92 g/100 g dw) than in NCH (0.22 g/100 g dw). Although sucrose was the main soluble sugar present in NCH, its concentration was almost 2-fold lower (0.85 g/100 g dw) than in CH (1.37 g/100 g dw). Contrary to the other three sugars, trehalose content was similar for both samples, 0.95 g/100 g dw in CH and 0.80 g/100 g dw in NCH. The total sugar content was 4-fold higher in the whole plant (10.5 g/100 g dw versus 2.58 g/100 g dw), mainly due to the contribution of fructose. Nectar is described in the literature as containing a balanced mixture of sugars [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], and NCH was found to have a very similar content of fructose, sucrose, and trehalose, confirming this information.
