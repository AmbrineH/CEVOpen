<p class="p">Three different organic acids were identified in both samples (CH and NCH): oxalic (0.030 g/100 g dw versus traces), malic (0.40 g/100 g dw versus 0.45 g/100 g dw), and citric acids (0.41 g/100 g dw versus 1.48 g/100 g dw). Contrarily, ascorbic acid was only detected in NCH (0.180 g/100 g dw) and traces of shikimic acid were detected in CH. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01111-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the total organic acids content was 2.48-fold higher in NCH (2.11 g/100 g dw) compared to CH (0.85 g/100 g dw). All detected organic acids are of the utmost importance for human metabolism since they are described as beneficial for a healthy diet [
