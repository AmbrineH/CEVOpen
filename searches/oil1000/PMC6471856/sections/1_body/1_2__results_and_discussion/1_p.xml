<p class="p">According to the literature, water is the main constituent (70 to 95%) and carbohydrates are the most abundant macronutrient (42.4 to 90.2 g/100 g dry weight basisâ€”dw) in edible flowers [

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01111-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and were within the range for edible flowers reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The humidity contents of CH and NCH were 78% and 25%, respectively. Protein (9.4 versus 4.90 g/100 g dw) and fat (1.4 versus 0.67 g/100 g dw) values were approximately 2-fold higher in NCH in comparison to CH. Unlike ash (2.87 g/100 g dw for CH and 3.05 g/100 g dw for NCH) and carbohydrates (86.8 g/100 g dw for CH and 85.1 g/100 g dw for NCH), where the content in both samples were very similar, crude fiber was 4.6-fold higher in CH compared to NCH (4.76 versus 1.03 g/100 g dw). Altogether, these factors contributed to a very similar energetic value for both samples (382.4 kcal/100 g dw for CH and 392.9 kcal g/100 g dw for NCH).
