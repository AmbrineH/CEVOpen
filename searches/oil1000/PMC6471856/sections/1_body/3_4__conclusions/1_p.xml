 <italic class="italic">Cytinus hypocistis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">macranthus</italic> Wettst. (L.) L. nectar has proven to be a good and balanced source of sugars and other carbohydrates, ash, proteins, lipids, and organic acids. This was a novel study of the nutritional and chemical characterization of this parasitic edible plant and allowed for a better understanding of the reasons behind the use of this plant in the past as a source of nutritional compounds during famine periods. Further investigation is needed to clarify potential applications of 
 <italic class="italic">C. hypocistis</italic>. Therefore, a phytochemical characterization of the most bioactive molecules, such as phenolic compounds, could be determined and correlated to its biological properties in order to understand attributes given to this plant species.
