<p class="p">According to a semi-quantitative approach that compares the cultural importance of 97 wild edible plant species of the Iberian Peninsula, 
 <italic class="italic">C. hypocistis</italic> occupies position 44 in the ranking [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Despite the cultural relevance of this plant, its chemical characterization is largely unknown [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and to the author’s best knowledge, its nutritional composition is not yet identified. For a comprehensive discussion to help bridge this gap, and since 
 <italic class="italic">C. hypocistis</italic> nectar accounts for 70 ± 0.5% of its flower weight, the authors compared the obtained data with published results from other studies on different edible flowers. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">C. hypocistis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">macranthus</italic> Wettst. was nutritionally characterized based on its protein, fat, ash, fiber, and carbohydrate content, following which we calculated its energetic value. Furthermore, its individual content in sugars, organic acids, and fatty acids was also determined.
