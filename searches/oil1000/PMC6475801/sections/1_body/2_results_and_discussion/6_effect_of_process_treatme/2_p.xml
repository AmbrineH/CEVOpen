<p class="p">As seen in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>, essential amino acids (EAA) showed a significant decrease from untreated frame bone (33.2%) to pressure wash (21.5%) to enzyme treatments (19.4%–19.7%). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) concentration showed a reverse trend with a significant increase from the untreated frame (3.9%) to pressure wash (7.1%) to enzyme treatments (7.7%–8.0%), with both enzyme treatments having no significant difference. Proline also significantly increases from the untreated frame to the three treatments. Almost all other amino acids show a significant decrease from the untreated frame to the three treatments. The most abundant amino acid in the 60‐min enzyme treatment was glycine, alanine, proline, glutamic acid, and hydroxyproline on a mole basis. The high content of hydroxyproline is due in part to the connective tissue in bone. The hydroxyproline content of Cod, Salmon, and Trout bones was reported as 5, 6, and 6 percent (Toppe et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), compared to 8 percent for the enzyme treatments and 7 percent for the pressure wash in this study. The relative amino acid content of the treated Catfish frame bone is very similar to collagen, and therefore if hydrolyzed, may be useful as a dietary supplement or functional food or beverage for the benefit of joint and bone health or enhancement of skin health.
