 <xref rid="fsn3974-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, shows the 30‐ and 60‐min enzyme treatments to be significantly larger than the pressure wash or untreated frame bone. However, sodium was an exception, with the pressure wash being significantly larger than either enzyme treatment. Potassium in the untreated frame bone was significantly larger than any of the three treatments. For iron, there was not a significant difference between untreated or treated samples. The 60‐min enzyme treated frame bone contained 25 percent calcium and a 2.2 ratio for Ca:P. Raw Pollock and Cod frame bone was reported to contain 5.9 and 6.0 percent calcium, respectively (Bechtel &amp; Johnson,
