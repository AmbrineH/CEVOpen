<p class="p">With 29.2 percent lipid, the untreated head was significantly larger than the three enzyme treatments. The 5‐min enzyme treatment was significantly smaller than the 0‐min treatment, and the 30‐min treatment was significantly smaller than the 5‐min treatment, showing a progressive loss of lipid during enzyme treatment. The lipid content of head bone from Pollock, Cod, and Salmon was reported as 6, 4, and 11 percent, respectively (after conversion to 4% moisture; Bechtel,
