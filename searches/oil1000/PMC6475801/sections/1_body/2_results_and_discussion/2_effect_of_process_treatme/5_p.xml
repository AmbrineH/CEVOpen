<p class="p">Percent ash for the 30‐min enzyme treatment of Catfish frame bone meal was not determined. However, the 60‐min treatment yielded the highest value of 62.2 percent, significantly higher than the pressure wash treatment. Both treatments were significantly higher than the untreated frame, with 17 percent. Ash content of the raw frame (17 percent) was larger than that reported (Bechtel et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) in Catfish frame (11 percent). For Tuna frame, ash content was reported to be 44 percent (Abbey et al.,
