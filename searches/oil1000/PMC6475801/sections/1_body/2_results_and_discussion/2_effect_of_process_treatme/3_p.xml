<p class="p">Lipid content was also observed to be the largest in the untreated frames (40.7%), and it was significantly different from the treatments. The pressure wash treatment was significantly higher than the enzyme treatments. Alcalase was noted to be quite efficient in removing lipid from the Catfish frames; however, no significant difference was evidenced between the 30‐ and the 60‐min treatments. The reported lipid content of Catfish frame (Bechtel et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), when converted to similar moisture content, was 42 percent, similar to the 41 percent in this study. Lipid content of tuna frame (prepared similarly to the Catfish raw frame in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) was reported as 11 percent (Abbey, Glover‐Amengor, Atikpo, Atter, &amp; Toppe, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) or 27 percent (Istiqlaal, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and for Pollock and Cod, values of 4 and 3 percent were reported (after conversion to 4 percent moisture; Bechtel, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>)—much lower than the 41 percent in these Catfish samples. In comparison with the treated Catfish frame (1.53 percent lipid), cleaned bones (head and frame) from Cod and Blue whiting had a lipid content of 1.14 and 4.91 percent, respectively, but Salmon and Trout had 38.12 and 34 percent, respectively (Toppe et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
