<p class="p">Protein content of the frame bone showed no significance between the untreated frame and the three treatments, and no significance between the three treatments. However, it was observed that the pressure wash treatment expressed more percent protein than the other treatments in this study. Protein content of the raw frame (33 percent) was very similar to that reported for Catfish frame (converted to a moisture content of 13.8 percent) with 34 percent (Bechtel et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Raw Tuna frame is reported to have 29 percent protein (Abbey et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) or 9 percent (Istiqlaal, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Protein content of cleaned bone (head and frame) of Cod and Blue whiting was reported as 36 and 42 percent, respectively, and Salmon and Trout had 29 and 31 percent, respectively (Toppe et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), compared to the 33 percent found for Catfish in this report.
