<p class="p">From the results in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, with the decrease in lipids corresponding with no change in protein content and a large increase in ash content, it was calculated that the pressure wash percentages correspond to an approximate loss of 93 percent of original lipid and 67 percent of original protein. This calculates to a 1.4:1 lipid/protein mixture that was removed from the frame bone. For the 60‐min enzyme treatment, the material lost from the frame bone calculates as approximately 99 percent total lipid and 73 percent total protein in a similar 1.4:1 ratio. Therefore, the tissue that was attached to the frame, and removed by the treatments, was preferentially lipids. The resulting bone product was low in lipid content and high in protein and mineral (ash) content, ideal for a nutritional supplement or ingredient, and an especially good choice to counter micronutrient‐deficient diets of those who suffer with obesity. Dietary intakes of calcium and iron have been found to below the recommended dietary allowance for individuals preparing for bariatric surgery (Frame‐Peterson, Megill, Carobrese, &amp; Schweitzer,
