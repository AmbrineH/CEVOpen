<p class="p">The general trend for mineral content of head bone for the three enzyme treatments was a significant increase with increasing treatment time from 0 to 5 to 30 min (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). However, sodium, potassium, and nickel did not show a difference between treatment times, and iron showed a reverse direction, with significant decreases with enzyme treatment time. The 30‐min enzyme treated head bone contained 20 percent calcium and a 2.1 ratio for Ca:P. Raw Pollock and Cod head bone was reported to contain 6.6 and 5.6 percent calcium, respectively (Bechtel &amp; Johnson, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), but the 0‐min enzyme treatment in Table
