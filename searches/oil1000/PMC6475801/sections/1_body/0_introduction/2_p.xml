<p class="p">There were 301 million pounds of Catfish produced in 2014 (Hanson &amp; Sites, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Whole, dressed Catfish is further processed into common usable forms, which include regular fillets, shank fillets, fillet strips, and nuggets (Silva &amp; Dean, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). In addition, Catfish by‐product account for 55%–65% of the whole fish mass. Processing of Catfish results in the production of a large amount of fish waste. Depending on what product is being produced, the waste (or by‐product) can account for &gt;60% of the harvested weight of the fish and consist of varying amounts of heads, viscera, frames, skin, and lesser amounts of blood and fins (Crapo &amp; Bechtel, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Yin et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Currently, Catfish by‐product from larger processing operations is combined and sold to rendering plants where by‐products are used to produce protein meals and oils for use as feed ingredients. Some smaller processors chose to dispose of the waste, make fertilizers, or utilize directly as a feed ingredient. Few Catfish processors further process or manufacture other products from their Catfish waste, causing most of the material to be shipped to rendering plants. Little use has been made of individual parts such as skin, or viscera components such as stomachs and livers.
