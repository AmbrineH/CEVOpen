<p class="p">Frames from Channel Catfish account for 18% of the total fish weight (Woodruff, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>) and are produced from the headed and gutted fish as the fillets are cut from the backbone. Frames consist of the backbones and rib bones and attached skeletal muscle, adipose, and connective and nerve tissues remaining after the removal of the fillets from the headed and gutted fish. Typically, Catfish frames are used to make Catfish meal and oil that are used as animal feed ingredients (Lovell, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>). However, an excellent use for Catfish frames would be the development of value‐added products. Specifically, bone meal derived from Catfish frames could be used to develop calcium‐rich mineral supplements for humans or animals. Catfish have large heads which are approximately 20%–25% of the weight of the fish (Bosworth, Wolters, Silva, Chamul, &amp; Park, 
 <xref rid="fsn3974-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) and are a good source of bone.
