<p class="p">Bone from Catfish frames was prepared using two methods: (a) use of a proteolytic enzyme to digest the nonbone tissues and (b) after boiling the frames, removal of the nonbone tissues with high‐pressure water. Both methods produced clean bone products with some differences in ash (62% and 54%) and lipid content (2% and 9%); however, percent protein was similar at 33% and 35% for the two methods, respectively. The amino acid profiles were similar for both methods with high levels of hydroxyproline present, and elemental composition was also similar. Because the enzymatic treatment had significantly larger percent of ash (containing a larger percent of calcium, phosphorus, and zinc) and significantly lower percentage of lipid, the product from this method would be preferred. Bone from Catfish heads was prepared by digestion of the nonbone tissues with a proteolytic enzyme and collection of the bone with a sieve. After the longest digestion period, the dried head bone was 51% mineral, 38% protein, and 7% lipid. The amino acid profile had high levels of hydroxyproline and lower levels of many essential amino acids, consistent with connective tissue proteins. With increase enzymatic hydrolysis time, the percent calcium and phosphorus increased indicating a greater removal of nonbone tissue. Results from this study will be used in the development of new value‐added food and feed ingredients from Catfish bone.</p>
