<p class="p">Catfish heads were acquired from a commercial Catfish processing facility in Mississippi. Heads were held in a −20°C freezer until thawed at 4°C. Catfish heads contained the heart and some of the liver. Heads were ground (model 7548, The Biro Mfg. Co., Marblehead, OH) first through a plate with 1‐inch and then 0.5‐inch‐diameter holes. Ground Catfish head material was separated into 300 g portions, placed in Ziploc bags and held in a −70°C freezer (So Low Environmental, Cincinnati, OH). All enzyme treatments were performed in triplicate using 300 g of semithawed Catfish head that was mixed with 300 g of deionized water and homogenized in a Waring Blender (model 38BL61) for 2 min. For all treatments, the Catfish head homogenate was preheated to 50°C using a microwave (model NN‐SN936B, Panasonic Appliances, Shanghai, CH). After attaining the 50°C temperature, 355 µl of Alcalase (2.4 U/g) was added to the Catfish head homogenate and placed in a shaker (Labline Instruments Inc., Melrose Park, IL) set at 110 rpm for 0, 5, and 30 min at 50°C. At the appropriate time, the hydrolyzed samples were put into a microwave and rapidly brought to 95°C and then placed on a hot plate to maintain a temperature of 95°C for 20 min to inactivate Alcalase.</p>
