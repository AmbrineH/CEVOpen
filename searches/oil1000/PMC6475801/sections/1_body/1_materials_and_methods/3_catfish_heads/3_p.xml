<p class="p">All nonenzyme‐treated samples were subjected to the same procedures except no Alcalase enzyme was added to the homogenates. After the 95°C treatment, homogenates were filtered through a 35 mesh stainless steel sieve screen to separate the bone fragment material from hydrolysate liquids. The separated bone fragments were washed with 200 g of deionized water, and the bone fragments were dried in a Cyclone electric convection oven for 24 hr at 66°C. After drying, bone samples were weighed and freeze milled. All samples were stored in a −70°C freezer until further analyzed.</p>
