<p class="p">Conversion of wet weight proximate percentages to a dry weight percentage was accomplished in Excel. A new set of proximate numbers equal to the wet weight values was created, and a third set of proximate numbers was created equal to the second set multiplied by the ratio of the sum of the original wet weight proximate values to the sum of the second set. Then, the Excel solver function (data tab) was used to change the moisture value of the second set so that the moisture value of the third set equaled the value needed (solver parameters used an objective set so the moisture value of the third set of values was equal to the value being used as the dry weight moisture percentage; set to the moisture value of the treated sample). The results in the second set values were equivalent to the weight of the original sample after drying (only a change in the moisture value). The results in the third set would be the proximate values of the “dry” sample.</p>
