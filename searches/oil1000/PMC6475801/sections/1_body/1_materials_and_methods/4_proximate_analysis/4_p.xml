<p class="p">Calculations of percent loss of lipid or protein content resulting from mechanical or enzymatic treatments were performed in a similar manner to the conversion of wet weight proximate values to dry weight proximate values above. The dry weight raw proximate values (as calculated above) were converted to the treated (mechanical or enzymatic) proximate values through an intermediate set of values (set 2, as described above). Solver parameters were started with an objective set to the ash value in the third set of values, to be equal to the proximate ash value of the treated sample; the moisture value of the third set was restricted to the proximate moisture value of the treated sample; the ash value of the third set was restricted to values less than or equal to the beginning “dried” sample. The solver function was repeated for lipid and protein, and all three repeated until all four numbers in the third set of values equaled the treated proximate values (the sum of differences, between set 3 and treated values, was &lt;0.01). The percent loss of lipid or protein was then calculated by dividing the difference between the “dried” raw sample proximate value and the optimized second set value, divided by the dried raw sample proximate value, times 100. If the solver function was restricted so the third set of values are kept within 5% of the treated proximate values, it produced an optimized set with fewer repetitions.</p>
