<p class="p">Amino acid profiles were determined by the AAA Service Laboratory Inc. (Boring, OR). Samples were hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl and 2% phenol at 110°C for 22 hr. Amino acids were quantified using the Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) with postcolumn ninhydrin derivatization. To minimize, methionine losses oxygen was removed by evacuation of the hydrolysis tubes that contained samples and acid for 10 min prior to putting them in the hydrolysis oven. Cysteine and tryptophan were not determined as separate hydrolysis procedures are required, which increases analysis cost. Two samples of each type of tissue were analyzed for amino acid composition.</p>
