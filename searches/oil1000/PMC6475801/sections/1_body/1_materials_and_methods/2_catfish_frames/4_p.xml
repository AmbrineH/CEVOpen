<p class="p">Catfish frame enzyme treatments consisted of 740 g of Catfish frames grounded with a Hobart grinder with a plate having 0.25‐inch holes. After grinding, approximately 740 g of deionized water was added to the ground frames and heated to 50°C for 15 min. After equilibration, 355 µl of Alcalase (Protease from 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus lichenformis</italic>, 2.4 U/g, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis) was added and the mixture stirred with an overhead propeller for 50°C for 30 or 60 min. The enzyme was inactivated by heating to 95°C for 20 min. The mixture was then permitted to cool down to room temperature, and the bone was separated from the hydrolysate by filtering through a 35 mesh stainless steel wired screen. It was washed three times with DI water, dried in a Cyclone convection oven at 66°C, and freeze milled.
