<p class="p">The pressure wash treatment used 740 g of Catfish frames which were placed in boiling water in a Groen Steam Kettle (Model TDA/1‐40) for 20 min. Catfish frames were then removed from the Groen Kettle and placed on a drying rack and pressure washed (Ryobi, model RY14122, Techtronic Industries, Anderson, SC) for 2 min per side. After pressure washing these frames, they were oven dried for 24 hr at 66°C, freeze milled, and stored at −20°C.</p>
