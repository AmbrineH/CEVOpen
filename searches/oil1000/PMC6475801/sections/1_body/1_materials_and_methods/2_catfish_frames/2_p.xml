<p class="p">Catfish frames were acquired from a commercial Catfish processing facility in Mississippi and held in a −20°C freezer untilled thawed at 4°C. Frames also had some fins and ribs attached. Viscera consisted of the stomach, intestine, internal fat pad, some liver and testes, and egg when present. For the control treatment, 740 g of Catfish frame was weighed and dried in a Cyclone convection oven (model GDCO‐E, Baker's Pride Oven Company, Cheyenne, WY) for 24 hr at 66°C. After drying, Catfish frames were ground using a Waring Pro meat grinder (model WPG200SA, Waring Commercial, Torrington, CT) fitted with a plate having 0.25‐inch‐diameter holes. Catfish frames were then freeze milled using a Spex Sample Prep freezer mill (model 6870D, Spex Sample Prep, Metuchen, NJ) and stored in a −70°C freezer until needed. All treatments were replicated three times.</p>
