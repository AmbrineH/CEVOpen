<p class="p">In conclusion, the investigations of the current study revealed that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii</italic> bark could serve as a potent anti-inflammatory natural candidate as evidenced from the in vivo study. Molecular docking of the major oil components on human glucocorticoid receptors showed affinity to the binding site as compared to the dexamethasone, the highly potent anti-inflammatory agent. This further consolidates its ethnomedicinal value as an anti-inflammatory agent. Its probable mode of action could be partly interpreted by virtue of its agonistic effect on the glucocorticoid receptor and hence could be used as a promising natural anti-inflammatory candidate. Nevertheless, these findings should be supported by further in vitro, in vivo, and finally clinical trials to confirm the claimed activity.
