<p class="p">Mild improvement of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis was demonstrated in the PRO-25 pretreated group, which scored 2.20 ± 0.37, in which the interstitial inflammatory infiltrates (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01384-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), were evident. Marked regression of fibrosis and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates was recorded in the PRO-50 and PRO-100 pretreated groups with lesion scores 1.40 ± 0.24 and 1.20 ± 0.20, respectively. The pulmonary parenchyma of the PRO-50 pretreated group was less distorted with mild interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration (

Masson’s trichrome stain confirmed no collagen deposition in nearly all of the examined sections (
