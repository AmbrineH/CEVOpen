<p class="p">Regarding in vivo anti-inflammatory effect, a potent effect of the essential oil in alleviating oxidative stress markers was observed. There was a significant increase in MDA and NO (nitric oxide) levels. Additionally, a pronounced decrease in SOD and CAT activities in the lung homogenate of BLM-treated group compared to the control group was observed. Administration of PRO significantly reduced the elevated MDA and NO levels by 55.56% and 55.66% compared to the BLM-treated group at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. Meanwhile, SOD and CAT were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with 72% and 108% increase relative to BLM-treated group at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, as recorded in
