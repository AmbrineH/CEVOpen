In contrast, lungs of BLM-treated mice revealed distortion of pulmonary parenchyma with alveolar and interstitial fibrosis scored 2.60 ± 0.24, which is characterized by marked thickening of alveolar walls and interstitial tissue by proliferating mononuclear cells, mostly lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as fibroblastic proliferation (
