<p class="p">The validity of the docking study was confirmed by comparing and alignment of the best docked poses of the lead compound, dexamethasone, with the lead conformer co-crystallized with GR. Results revealed a good alignment between them (RMSD = 0.60 A°), confirming the validity of the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-22-01384" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>). Among all the docked major constituents, palmitic acid exerted the fittest binding to GR as evidenced from its free binding energy that approaches that of dexamethasone, being −60.28 and 61.08 kcal/mol, respectively. Examining the active site of GR, it showed the presence of many hydrophobic residues. Binding of palmitic acid in the active pocket of human glucocorticoid receptors (GR) is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01384-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b. Its firm binding could be explained by virtue of the formation of three hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues of Arg611 and Gly570, in addition to the hydrophobic interaction with the GR as shown in

 <italic class="italic">Pinus roxburghii</italic> could partly act in a manner similar to glucocorticoids, owing to the agonist effect of its major constituents within the active site, similarly to dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids are highly potent in relieving inflammation owing to their pleiotropic effects observed on the glucocorticoid receptor affecting multiple signaling pathways. Unfortunately, this pleiotropic behavior may widely affect many metabolic processes causing growth retardation in children and affecting immune system. In addition, hypertension, suppression of wound healing, and osteoporosis are among the common adverse effects of prolonged glucocorticoid regimen [
