<p class="p">Glucocorticoids have long been used in the alleviation of patients suffering from pulmonary fibrosis via prohibition of procollagen synthesis, both in connective tissues and in fibroblasts, in addition to reduction of pulmonary parenchymal cell proliferation. This was explained in virtue of the reversal of type I procollagen mRNA partitioning in polysomes together with reversing stimulation of procollagen synthesis induced by bleomycin [

Thus, molecular docking of the major essential oil components was done within the active site of human glucocorticoids receptors and showed that most of them have affinity to the binding site as compared to the potent anti-inflammatory GR agonist, dexamethasone, and thus can exert a potent anti-inflammatory activity. The free binding energy of these compounds was chosen as a comparison factor in the docking experiments, as recorded in
