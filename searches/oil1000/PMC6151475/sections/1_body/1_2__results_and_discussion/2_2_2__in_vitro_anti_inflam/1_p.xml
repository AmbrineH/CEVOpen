<p class="p">Concerning the anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil, it was previously reported that an effective anti-inflammatory therapy could be achieved by its concomitant administration with analgesics [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Analgesic agents achieved their targeted effects by acting with plethora of mechanisms on the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. These mechanisms may include the inhibition of prostaglandins synthesis through the interference with the cyclooxygenase and lypoxygenase pathways either peripherally or centrally. Moreover, prohibition of G-protein-mediated signal transduction, induction of endogenous opioid peptides, blockage of 5-hydroxytryptamine release, and inhibition of excitatory amino acids or

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Well-known analgesic drugs comprise paracetamol, NSAIDs exemplified by salicylates, in addition to cannabinoids and opioids, such as morphine. Synthetic anti-inflammatory agents, particularly NSAIDs, that are widely employed for the relief of pain and inflammation provoke a lot of serious side effects. Thus, in vitro analgesic and the anti-inflammatory activities herein were examined via acting on the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 that exists in the central nervous system and CB2 that is present in the peripheral tissues in addition to the opioid receptors [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, the binding percentages of the essential oil on the cannabinoids (CB1 and CB2) and opioids (
 <italic class="italic">mu</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">delta</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">kappa</italic>) receptors were evaluated. Results showed that no binding was observed on CB1 receptors, whereas mild to moderate binding was observed on CB2, 
 <italic class="italic">delta, kappa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">mu</italic> receptors accounting for are 2.9%, 6.9%, 10.9%, and 22% binding respectively as recorded in
