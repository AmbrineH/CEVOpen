<p class="p">Although 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species are highly popular of possessing essential oils with an attractive medicinal value [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], few were found in the current literature concerning the chemical composition and the biological activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus roxburghii</italic> bark growing in Egypt. Thus, the foregoing study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively identify the volatile oil composition isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus roxburghii</italic> bark. Evaluation of its anti-inflammatory properties in vitro through assessing the inhibitory effect on the cannabinoids and opioids receptors was performed for the first time. Additionally, in vivo assessment using bleomycin-induced inflammation in 
 <italic class="italic">albino</italic> mice was first to be adopted to consolidate its ethnopharmacological anti-inflammatory importance. Moreover, an in silico molecular docking study of the major essential oil components was performed on human glucocorticoids receptor (GR) in an effort to verify its potential mode of action.
