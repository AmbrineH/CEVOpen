<p class="p">Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably transfected with human opioid receptor subtypes μ, δ, or κ were used to perform the opioid receptor binding assays. For each assay, non-specific binding was determined using 10μM of a positive control [U-69,593 [phenyl-3,4-3H] (κ), Enkephalin DPDPE [Tyrosyl-3,5-3H(N)] (δ), or DAMGO [Tyrosyl-3,5-3H(N)] (µ). The dissociation constant [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] for ligands for each receptor was established through a membrane evaluation and saturation binding experiment. Total, specific, and non-specific binding were used to calculate the binding percentage of the non-labeled control to receptor. The membrane concentration exhibiting good binding percentage (&gt;90%) and total binding with high signal (thousands of CPM) was used as the optimal membrane concentration for the assay [
