<p class="p">The competitive binding assay was performed using the optimal concentration of membrane with radioligand concentration equal to the Kd, and 12 concentrations of each compound ranging from 0.032 to 10,000 Î¼M. Each compound was tested in triplicate. The assays were performed as stated above. The IC
