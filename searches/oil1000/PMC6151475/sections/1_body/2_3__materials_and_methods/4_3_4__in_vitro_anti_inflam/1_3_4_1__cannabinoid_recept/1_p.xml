<p class="p">For each assay, non-specific binding was determined using 10 Î¼M of CP-55,940 as a positive control. Total, specific, and non-specific binding were used to calculate the binding percentage of the non-labeled control to CB1 and CB2 receptors. The membrane concentration exhibiting good binding percentage (&gt;90%) and total binding with high signal (thousands of CPM) was used as the optimal membrane concentration for the assay [
