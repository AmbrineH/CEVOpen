<p class="p">Mass spectrum was recorded using Shimadzu GC-2010 plus gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer Shimadzu QP-2010 equipped with Rtx-5MS fused bonded column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) equipped with a split-splitless injector. The capillary column was directly coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The initial column temperature was kept at 45 °C for 2 min (isothermal) and programmed to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and kept constant at 300 °C for 5 min (isothermal). Detector and injector temperatures were 300 and 250 °C, respectively. Helium carrier gas flow rate was 2 mL/min. Mass spectra were recorded applying the following condition: (equipment current) filament emission current, 60 mA; ionization voltage, 70 eV; ion source, 200 °C. Diluted samples (0.5%

 <sup class="sup">®</sup> software ver. 2.4 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used for recording and integrating the chromatograms. Volatile components were identified by comparing their retention indices (RI) and mass spectra with those built in libraries (NIST Mass Spectral Library (December 2005), Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 8th edition) and literature [
