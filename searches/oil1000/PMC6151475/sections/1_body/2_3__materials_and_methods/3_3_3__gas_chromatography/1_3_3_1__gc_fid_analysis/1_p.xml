<p class="p">GC/FID analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) supplied with FID detector and a DB-5 fused-bonded cap column (Phenomenex; 29 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm; Torrance, CA, USA). The oven temperature was programmed isothermal at 50 °C for 2 min, then raised from 50 to 300 °C at 7 °C/min, and finally held isothermal at 300 °C for 10 min; injector temp., 250 °C; detector temp., 300 °C; carrier gas, He (1.5 mL/min); with split mode (split ratio, 1:20). The sample 0.1 μL was injected automatically to the chromatograph using AOC-20i auto sampler. Class GC 10
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>software (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used for recording and integrating the chromatograms. Average areas under the peaks of three independent chromatographic runs were used for calculating the % composition of each component (total peak area = 100%).
