<p class="p">Ten lung sections per group were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, washed, and embedded in paraffin blocks. 5 µm thick sections were stained with H&amp;E to demonstrate the pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation, and Masson’s trichrome stains to demonstrate collagen deposition. Semi-quantitative lesion scoring was performed, according to the method described by Okazaki et al., 2001 [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-22-01384" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], to evaluate the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in which: 0, normal lung tissue; 1, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis affecting &lt;25% of the lung; 2, pulmonary lesions affecting 25–50% of the lung; and 3, lesions affecting &gt;50% of the lung. The mean of the lesion scores was estimated for five lung sections per mouse.
