<p class="p">Lung lobes were thawed at 4 °C, homogenized on ice in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 180 mM KCl and 10 mM EDTA, final pH 7.4, and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 30 min. Lung homogenates were centrifuged at 860 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and the resultant supernatant was frozen at −20 °C and used for assays of different oxidative stress markers. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined according to Nishikimi et al., 1972 [
