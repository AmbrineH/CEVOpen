<p class="p">Principal components analysis (PCA) on the free amino acid profiles of the harvestmen specimens yielded four PCs with eigenvalues exceeding 1, which collectively explain 70.6% of the total variation in amino acid composition. PC1 explains 30.2% of the variation and is characterized by positive loading of alanine, valine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and tyrosine, and negative loading of isoleucine and threonine. PC2 accounts for a further 17.7% of the variation and is characterized by positive loading of valine, glutamine, and phenylalanine, and negative loading of glycine, serine, and glutamic acid. PC3 explains 12.7% of the variation and is characterized by positive loading of glutamine and serine, and negative loading of alanine and cysteine. At last, PC4 accounts for 9.98% of the variation and is characterized by positive loading of serine and cysteine, and negative loading of alanine. The sacculate species scores largely overlap with each other but plot almost exclusively within the negative range of PC1, whereas the nonsacculate species plot on the positive half of PC1 (Figure

 <italic class="italic">L. vittatum</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> L. vittatum</italic> predominantly plots on the negative half of PC2 (excluding two outliers), whereas 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">calcar</italic> is more variable across PC2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Sacculate species cluster tighter, indicating less variation in the free amino acids of their nuptial secretions as compared to nonsacculate species (Figure
