<p class="p">Eleven free amino acids were detected in the harvestmen accessory glands and penial sacs examined, with five amino acids making up 91% of the total free amino acid content: alanine, threonine, isoleucine, glutamine, and serine. In order to verify the suitability of frequentist statistics for downstream comparative analysis of nuptial gift profiles, we used two methods to calculate Pagel's lambda. Using the “phylosig” function (Revell, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) yielded a value of 0.0000661 (joint LnL = 9.93). Using the “fitContinuous” function (Harmon, Weir, Brock, Glor, &amp; Challenger, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), we estimated λ = 0 for every amino acid variable, with a mean log‐likelihood of 16.63. With sufficient support for the lack of phylogenetic signal in nuptial gift content, we proceeded with frequentist analytics for comparison and contradistinction of amino acid profiles.
