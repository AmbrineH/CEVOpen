<p class="p">Previous work using Bayesian‐likelihood estimation predicts that the sacculate condition is ancestral within 
 <italic class="italic">Leiobunum</italic> and that the nonsacculate condition evolved twice, separately for each nonsacculate lineage (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Another possible but less parsimonious transitional history requires that the common ancestor of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. vittatum, L. politum,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. calcar</italic> species groups lost penial sacs, which were then regained by the 
 <italic class="italic">L. politum</italic> species group. Both situations involve two separate phenotypic transitions, but the latter is less likely because, in terms of development, it is easier to lose the genetic framework necessary to build a structure than it is to gain said framework (Dollo's Law; Marshall, Raff, &amp; Raff, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Presumably, the similarity in nonsacculate nuptial gifts is also the result of convergent evolution. We found that the nuptial gift of the nonsacculate species 
 <italic class="italic">L. vittatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. calcar</italic> gifts is strikingly similar; for example, they both display novel acquisition of valine and tyrosine. We therefore hypothesize that the evolution of the nonsacculate condition promoted selection for a consistent, specific chemical composition of nuptial gift each time it arose.
