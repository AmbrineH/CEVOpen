<p class="p">The identification and classification of other compounds (e.g., proteins, other small molecules) in the nuptial gift extractions were outside of the scope of this study, but should be investigated further. Large‐scale “‐omic” analyses have received some utility in the study of nuptial gifts, particularly those that contain whole proteins or molecules with known toxicity; Pauchet et al. (
