<p class="p">Within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Leiobunum</italic>, adjustments to the chemistry of the nuptial gift have occurred over the course of its evolutionary history; our data indicate that these adjustments are associated with transitions between sacculate and nonsacculate genital morphotypes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Specifically, we found a significantly greater proportion of essential amino acids in the nuptial gifts of sacculate species as compared to nonsacculate species. Because essential amino acids must be derived from the environment, our results are consistent with a scenario in which evolutionary transitions have occurred between putatively costly and valuable nuptial gifts in sacculate species to less valuable nuptial gifts in nonsacculate species. In addition, we find evidence for not only overall qualitative similarities of nuptial gift within reproductive morphotypes of harvestmen, but componential similarities as well. Principal components analysis revealed that chemical profiles did not cluster based on phylogenetic relationships, but rather by genital morphotype (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). For example, 
 <italic class="italic">L. ventricosum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. aldrichi</italic> (both sacculate) share almost the same multivariate space, but they are not each other's closest evolutionary relatives; 
 <italic class="italic">L. aldrichi</italic> is more closely related to both of the nonsacculate species than it is to 
 <italic class="italic">L. ventricosum</italic>. Similar to that, 
 <italic class="italic">L. vittatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. calcar</italic> (both nonsacculate) overwhelmingly dominate the positive half of PC1, but the latter is more closely related to 
 <italic class="italic">L. politum</italic> (sacculate; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
