 <italic class="italic">L. vittatum</italic> in detail and observed that females often resist males’ advances—consistent with expectations of antagonistic interactions between sexes raised by the nonsacculate condition of males and the females’ sclerotized genital barriers. However, males sometimes struggle to end copulation; the authors suggest that this dynamic is consistent with females’ interest in prolonging access to nuptial gift. In order to test the sensory trap hypothesis, feeding trials are a logical next step; potential experiments might include incorporating amino acids into gels at differing concentrations and compositions and observing feeding behavior in order to confirm which amino acids are attractive in this group. In order to test the paternal investment hypothesis, future research would ideally include observation of the effects of nuptial feeding on female postcopulatory behavior, oviposition, and egg size and number. Radiolabeling studies could be carried out to see how females incorporate these materials into their body tissues.
