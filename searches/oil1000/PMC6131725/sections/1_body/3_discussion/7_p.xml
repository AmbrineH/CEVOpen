<p class="p">The leiobunine harvestmen provide an intriguing and tractable system for the study of nuptial gifts. Differing levels of sexual antagonism are linked to transitions in both genital morphology and, as we have found in the current study, chemical composition of nuptial gifts. Specifically, a more solicitous sexual dynamic is associated with a higher proportion of essential amino acids, and potentially, a more nutritious gift. Our study is the first to investigate the chemical composition of nuptial gifts in harvestmen and the first to investigate the evolution of nuptial gift chemistry in a phylogenetic framework in any group of animals. Our results point to many potential avenues for continued research, both within and across species.</p>
