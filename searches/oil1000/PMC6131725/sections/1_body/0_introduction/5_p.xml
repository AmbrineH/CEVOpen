<p class="p">With few exceptions, females of nonsacculate species have sclerotized pregenital barriers, presumably to aid in resistance against unwanted advances (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Similar correlations exist between nonsacculate condition and the development of specialized male pedipalps hypothesized to improve grasping of the female during the mating embrace (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Burns and Shultz found that the nonsacculate condition correlated strongly with increases in female pregenital closing force, penis length, and muscle forces associated with deformation of the penis that could achieve a crowbar‐like prying motion against the female pregenital opening (Burns &amp; Shultz, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Moreover, penes of nonsacculate species may transmit and resist higher levels of mechanical force (e.g., bending) when interacting with the female's pregenital opening than the sacculate penes, suggesting that there has been selection for more durable penes in sexually antagonistic species (Burns &amp; Shultz, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Taken together, these syndromic morphologies in the eastern North American leiobunine harvestmen suggest an evolutionary transition in mating system has taken place—with a solicitous courtship style marked by greater accessibility to nuptial gift supplanted by a more antagonistic mating system defined by more restricted access to nuptial gift (Figure
