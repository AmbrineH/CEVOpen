<p class="p">Nuptial gifts are transferred from male to female before or during copulation and may come in many forms, including food or prey items, glandular secretions, and chemical cargo such as minerals or toxic defense (Gwynne,

 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Females may derive direct benefits from the gift, as in the case of blister beetles in which males transfer a store of cantharidin toxin to the female which she then apportions to the eggs as chemical defense (Eisner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Males, too, may experience fitness benefits as a result of nuptial gift‐giving; for example, the mating success of the male great gray shrike increases with the quality of the prey item offered (Tryjanowski &amp; Hromada, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). There has been considerable effort to document the behavioral and physiological interactions between male gift‐givers and their female recipients and to determine the function of these interactions. Two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: (a) 
 <italic class="italic">The paternal investment hypothesis</italic> states that males should provide a gift containing some nutritional or other benefit that improves the female condition, thereby increasing the number or quality of offspring, and (b) 
 <italic class="italic">the mating effort hypothesis</italic> proposes that donations support insemination by acting as a sensory trap, preventing the female from terminating copulation, or by prolonging the female remating interval, reducing sperm competition (reviewed by Vahed,
