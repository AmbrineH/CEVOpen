<p class="p">We set out to compare the chemical profiles of the nuptial gifts of five closely related harvestmen species representing the major evolutionary lineages within 
 <italic class="italic">Leiobunum</italic> and both the sacculate condition (
 <italic class="italic">L. aldrichi, L. politum, L. ventricosum</italic>) and the nonsacculate condition (
 <italic class="italic">L. calcar, L. vittatum</italic>) in order to identify how compositional differences varied with genital morphotypes. Whether the nuptial gift provides females with a direct benefit (as in the paternal investment hypothesis) or acts as a sensory trap (as in the mating effort hypothesis), we would expect to see changes in the chemical composition of the gift associated with evolutionary transitions in mating strategy. Therefore, our expectation was that we would find significant compositional differences in the nuptial gift correlated with the sacculate and nonsacculate genital morphotypes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We extracted the free amino acids from the accessory glands of 67 individuals and analyzed them using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS). We used multivariate statistics, including an approach that accounts for data variance due to phylogenetic relatedness, to test for an association between the free amino acid profile of nuptial gift and genital morphology—and therefore level of sexual antagonism. We found evidence of evolutionary convergence in nuptial gift composition correlated with male genital phenotype. Our results set the stage for work that could identify the role of nuptial gift in mating interactions and fecundity in harvestmen.
