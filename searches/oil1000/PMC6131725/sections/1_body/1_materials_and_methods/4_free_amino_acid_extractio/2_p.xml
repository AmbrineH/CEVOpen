 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), using an anion‐exchange resin to separate the free amino acids from proteins and other macromolecules in the harvestman nuptial gift samples. Frozen samples were thawed and 1 ml Milli‐Q water was added. Samples were heated to 100°C for 5 min using a sand bath in order to dissolve all water‐soluble contents completely. The entire volume was passed through an anion‐exchange column (0.6 g Dowex 1X8‐200 in a glass pipette with a Kimwipe plug) into a 5‐ml glass vial. The column was subsequently washed with 2 ml Milli‐Q water, then 1 ml of 1 M ammonium hydroxide into the same glass vial. The samples were stored at −15°C until they were lyophilized. To prepare for lyophilization, the caps were removed from the vials and a layer of Kimwipe was secured to the opening with a small rubber band. The samples were then flash‐frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath. The frozen samples were lyophilized for 24 hr at −40°C under reduced pressure (&lt;0.1 mmHg), after which they were stored at −15°C until derivatization.
