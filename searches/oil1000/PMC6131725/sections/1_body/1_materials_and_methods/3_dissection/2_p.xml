<p class="p">Preserved specimens were placed ventral side up in a clean, dry petri dish. The genital operculum was cut at the lateral sulci, and the inverted genital structure (i.e., penis, glands, muscles/sheath; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34232-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) was dissected and placed in another clean, dry petri dish and allowed to dry for 5–10 s. With a plastic 2‐ml FALCON dropper, 4–5 drops of deionized water were dropped onto the structure. For sacculate penes, any content in the sacs was scraped out and crushed in the water until it dissolved. Accessory glands, found immediately dorsal and deep to the distal penis and typically identified by gland papillae, were removed and combined with the sac content. For nonsacculate penes, only the accessory glands were extracted and prepared. Following dissolution of the sac/gland material, a clean dropper was used to transfer all of the samples to an Eppendorf 1.5‐ml FLEX tube. The samples were stored at −15°C until extraction.
