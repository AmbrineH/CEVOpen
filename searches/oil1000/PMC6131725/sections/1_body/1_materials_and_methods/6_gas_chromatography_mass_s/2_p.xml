<p class="p">Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify the relative amount of each free amino acid in the harvestman nuptial gift samples. Samples were analyzed within 24 hr of derivatization. Derivatized samples were kept at 4°C until they were analyzed on an Agilent 5973/6890N GC‐MS system with an Agilent 19091S‐433 model column. A high molecular weight method was employed (oven temperature ramped from 100 to 280°C over 20 min). Additional detail is provided in Supporting Information Data
