<p class="p">The GC‐MS spectrum of the amino acid analytical standard was used to identify the amino acid peaks, the fragmentation, and retention time of each amino acid. The fragmentation of each peak of the amino acid analytical standard was compared to a GC‐MS spectrum provided by Sigma‐Aldrich (Stenerson, 
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) in order to confirm the identity of each compound. This information was used to classify the peaks derived from each nuptial gift specimen. We calculated the integrals of each amino acid peak and used these data to create an amino acid profile for each individual. Essential amino acid (EAA) proportions were calculated by summing the integrals for all essential amino acids in an individual's profile and dividing by the integral sum of all amino acids for that individual. The amino acids that are considered essential here are the same as in vertebrates, as Davis (
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1975</xref>) demonstrated that this was the case for another arthropod, the yellow mealworm. We recognize that the amino acids that are “essential” in harvestmen could be different, but there is currently no literature on the matter. An ANOVA comparing the EAA contents of both genital morphologies was performed in JMP Pro 13 (SAS Institute Inc.,
