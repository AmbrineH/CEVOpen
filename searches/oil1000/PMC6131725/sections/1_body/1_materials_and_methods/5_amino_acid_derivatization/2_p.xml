<p class="p">In order for GC‐MS to detect a sample, the analyte molecules must be sufficiently volatile enough to be ionized in the gas phase. The volatility of the free amino acids was improved by derivatization following methods from Stenerson (
 <xref rid="ece34232-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). 100 μl of a derivatization mixture (1:1 ratio of

 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>‐butyldimethylsilyl‐
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>‐methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) and acetonitrile) was added to each sample vial after it was thawed. An analytical amino acid standard from Sigma‐Aldrich (AAS18‐5ML) was prepared by adding 10 μl of the standard 100 μl of the derivatization mix. The samples and standard mixture were then heated in an oil bath at 120°C for 30 min, after which they were removed from heat. 1 ml of acetonitrile was added to the sample vial prior to subjecting it to GC‐MS analysis.
