All individuals were hand‐collected from one of two locations: Macalester College's Katharine Ordway Natural History Study Area in Inver Grove Heights, MN (June 1 through August 5, 2016; 56 specimens), or Emmenegger Nature Park in St. Louis, MO (June 13, 2016). They were either immediately preserved or housed at Macalester College for use in the mating trials (12 individuals) of another project, after which they were preserved in either 75% or 95% ethanol and stored in the refrigerator to prevent degradation.
