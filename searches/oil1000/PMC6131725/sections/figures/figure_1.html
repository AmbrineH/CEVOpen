 <p> Dorsal views of the two genital morphotypes that occur within Leiobunum: sacculate and nonsacculate. Sacculate species bear a pair of subterminal cuticular sacs on the distal penis. Internally, papilla of nuptial gift‚Äêproducing accessory glands fill penial sacs. Penes are everted with cuticular fulturae, which support the membranous hematodocha that contains the accessory glands. Upon eversion, papilla are externalized and nuptial gift may be secreted over the hematodocha. Nonsacculate species lack penial sacs, but retain accessory glands </p>
