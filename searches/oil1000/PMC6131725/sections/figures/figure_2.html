 <p> Simplified Bayesian phylogeny of the eastern North American leiobunine harvestmen illustrating evolutionary transitions between sacculate (blue) and nonsacculate (red) genital morphotypes. Names of species used in this study are presented in color. Triangles represent species complexes within which named species are nonmonophyletic. Stars indicate relationships well supported in molecular phylogenetic analyses, that is, 100% support under at least two of three optimality criteria: Bayesian posterior probability, maximum likelihood, parsimony.
