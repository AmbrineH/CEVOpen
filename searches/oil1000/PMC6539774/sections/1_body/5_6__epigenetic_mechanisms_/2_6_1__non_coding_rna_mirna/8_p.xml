<p class="p">Another in vitro experiment used a monocyte/macrophage cell line and an endothelial cell line to evaluate whether PUFAs affect miRNAs’ expression. The two cell lines were supplemented with PUFAs in a bioactive concentration (sufficient to reach a stable incorporation into the plasma membrane) and then exposed to an inflammatory environment. Results clearly showed that PUFAs could modulate miRNAs’ expression of both cell types independently of the presence/absence of an inflammatory trigger. Moreover, some miRNAs already correlated to vascular inflammation were found to be affected by cellular PUFA enrichment. These data suggest that vascular inflammation can be influenced by PUFA through miRNAs synthesized by cells involved in the inflammatory process [
