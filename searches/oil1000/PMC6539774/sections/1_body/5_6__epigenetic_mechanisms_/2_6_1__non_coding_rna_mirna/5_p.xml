<p class="p">Studies about the interaction between PUFAs and miRNAs are limited and focused primarily on tumor cell biology. miRNAs seem to be molecular targets of n-3 LCPUFAs for future cancer therapy, as emerges from the promising results of in vitro studies in colorectal cancer stem-like cells [
