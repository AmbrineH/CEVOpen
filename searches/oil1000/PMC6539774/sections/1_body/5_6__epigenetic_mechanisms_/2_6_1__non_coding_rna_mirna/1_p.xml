<p class="p">Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules transcribed from DNA, but not translated into proteins. Epigenetic-related ncRNAs include miRNA, siRNA, piRNA, and lncRNA. In general, ncRNAsâ€™ function is to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Among ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently the most studied. </p>
