<p class="p">One study focused on the potential interaction between LCPUFAs and miRNAs in adipogenesis. MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) seems to stimulate adipocytes’ differentiation and is correlated with obese condition in mice fed with a high-fat diet. The authors, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, identified that the PPARγ signaling pathway promotes transcriptional activation of miR-143 in adipocytes [
