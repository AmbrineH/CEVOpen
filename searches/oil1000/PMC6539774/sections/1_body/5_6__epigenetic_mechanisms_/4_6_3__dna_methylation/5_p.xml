<p class="p">In another large double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, pregnant mothers consumed a daily dose of 800 mg DHA or placebo from 20 weeks of gestation to delivery. No difference in DNA methylation levels was found between the DHA and control group either at birth or at five years, but differences in 21 DMRs were found at birth, some of which persisted until five years. DMRs identified were located in genes involved in lipid exchange between membranes (
