<p class="p">In adult humans, differences in DNA methylation have been identified between people with high and low n-3 PUFA intakes. The Yup’ik have a traditional diet rich in fish, which is changing with Westernization, allowing for stratification of this population into high and low PUFA consumption. Increased DNA methylation with high PUFAs consumption was observed in 78% of the significant associations, with genomic instability occurring with hypomethylation: the increased methylation observed may, therefore, be beneficial to the stability of the genome [
