<p class="p">Currently, one animal experiment evaluated DHA epigenetic impact on histone acetylation, possibly correlated with MetS pathways. This work reported that n-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on dyslipidemia-induced epigenetic changes in maternal placenta and fetal liver of weanling female Wistar rats fed with control and different high-fat content diets (high-fat lard or high-fat fish oil). Maternal dyslipidemia caused a 4.75-fold increase in fetal liver triacylglycerol accumulation with a 78% decrease in the DNA-binding ability of PPAR-Î±. The combination EPA + DHA had a profound effect on modulating DNA methylation and histone acetylation in placenta and fetal liver [
