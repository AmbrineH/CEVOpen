<p class="p">Chromatin is the ensemble of chromosomal DNA with proteins in the cellular nucleus. DNA in chromatin is enveloped around histone proteins, in units called ‘’nucleosomes’’. A nucleosome has 147 bp of DNA associated with an octameric core of histone proteins, consisting of two H3-H4 histone dimers surrounded by two H2A-H2B dimers. H1 histone associates with the linker DNA located between the nucleosomes. </p>
