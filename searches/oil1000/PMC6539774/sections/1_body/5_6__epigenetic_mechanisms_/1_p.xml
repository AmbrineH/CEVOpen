<p class="p">Recent studies showed that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in a wide range of diseases and also for metabolic syndrome initiation. Epigenetics investigates heritable modifications to the genome, which are independent of the DNA sequence [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-02118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. This recent branch of research deals with heritable changes that modify the activity of genes, independently of the nucleotide coding (genotype), determining different phenotypes [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-20-02118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Given its dynamic nature, epigenetics has been suggestively described as the “interface between the genome and the environment” (Feil and Fraga, 2012). The period during which epigenetic activity is most effective lasts from conception to the second anniversary, underlying the crucial concept of “the first 1000 days” [

Epigenetic modifications can be mediated by three main processes: non-coding RNAs, histone modifications, and DNA methylation [
