<p class="p">In recent years, it has become evident that the adult definition could not be applied to children because of a variety of evolving conditions during growth development. In 2007, meeting the urgency to make early diagnosis and prevention strategies in the pediatric population, the IDF suggested a consensus definition of MetS in children and adolescents. The IDF definition is different according to age-groups: age 6sixyears to younger than 10 years; age 10 years to younger than 16 years; and 16 years or older (children younger than six years were not included due to insufficient data available). In all groups, abdominal obesity is the necessary condition to make the diagnosis. The IDF consensus also recommends not to diagnose metabolic syndrome in children younger than 10 years; while it is strongly suggested to focus all efforts on weight reduction in this age group. </p>
