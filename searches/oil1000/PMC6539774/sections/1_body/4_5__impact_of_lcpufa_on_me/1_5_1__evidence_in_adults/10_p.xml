According to a meta-analysis of 18 prospective cohort studies including 540.184 participants and 25.670 cases of incident type 2 diabetes, there is no significant association between incidence of diabetes and fish/seafood consumption or estimated intake of EPA plus DHA [

 <xref rid="B40-ijms-20-02118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. PPAR is a family of proteins that act as transcriptional factors, belonging to the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily: three isoforms of PPAR are known (PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and PPAR-γ). Among these, the alfa and gamma isoforms are involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [
