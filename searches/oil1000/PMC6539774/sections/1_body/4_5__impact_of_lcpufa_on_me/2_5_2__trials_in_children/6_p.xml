<p class="p">A study evaluated the effect of LCPUFA at high doses on subcutaneous adipose tissue and blood analysis in 26 obese adolescents: five daily doses of EPA + DHA (3 g per day of 944 mg EPA and 2088 mg DHA) for 12 weeks resulted in a reduction of BMI, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides values. Analysis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue through biopsy suggested a LCPUFAs-mediated gene modulation: PPAR-γ and PGC-1a were downregulated, while PPAR-α and SREBP1 were upregulated [
