<p class="p">One double-blind placebo randomized trial recruited 25 pediatric patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Values of TG ranged from 150â€“1000 mg/dL in the study population, who was given a high daily dose of DHA + EPA (3360 mg/die) vs. placebo for six months. There was no significant difference between the two groups in lowering TG levels: similar results were reached by previous studies, which found minimal or no effect of supplementation on TG levels. Statistical analysis showed no difference in weight loss, insulin resistance markers, HDL cholesterol, BMI, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure, suggesting that LCPUFA supplementation could not influence the prevalence of metabolic syndrome [
