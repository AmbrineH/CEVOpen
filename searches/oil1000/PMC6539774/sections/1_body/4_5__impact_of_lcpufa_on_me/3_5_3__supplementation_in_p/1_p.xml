<p class="p">The “gestational programming” hypothesis explains how maternal nutritional status, hormonal balance, and metabolic environment affect gene expression and ultimately metabolism of the offspring [

Support for the addition of LCPUFAs in pregnant mothers or infant formula is based on recent research that demonstrated n-3 LCPUFAs’ importance in the developing brain and retina during the last trimester of pregnancy up to the second year of life [

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-02118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. On the other hand, few studies have focused attention on the potential benefits of LCPUFAs on preventing newborn risk of obesity and its metabolic complications. It is unclear how LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy can affect offspring development and metabolism: numerous clinical trials have been performed with conflicting results.
