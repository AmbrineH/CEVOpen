<p class="p">Until recent times, LCPUFAs were not included in standard formula milk, which contained just their precursors (alpha linolenic acid and linoleic acid). During infancy, LCPUFAs levels inside red blood cells gradually reduce if the child is fed by standard formula milk, because of a limited capacity to synthesize ARA and DHA. This relative deficiency, which can limit the beneficial neurodevelopmental effect of LCPUFAs in the first years of life, as described in many studies, can be overcome with formula milk supplemented with adequate doses of LCPUFAs. For these reasons, currently, many formulas are enriched with LCPUFAs in quantities comparable with breast milk [
