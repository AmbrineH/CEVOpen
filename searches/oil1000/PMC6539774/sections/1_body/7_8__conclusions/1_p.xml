<p class="p">Understanding through nutrigenetic research how diet affects human health, especially in the early phases of life, could be crucial to personalize nutritional intervention in order to prevent the transgenerational risk of obesity and its complications in children. n-3-LCPUFAs are well known for their health benefits in adults, but the beneficial effect of supplementation in children is still debated. The healthy properties associated mainly with DHA might be explained by epigenetic changes, even if the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. Recent literature suggests that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation from diet may impact gene expression by epigenetic changes. This may influence inflammatory and other metabolic pathways and could be a key step to the initiation of metabolic syndrome, giving a chance to treat the disease with more specific strategies. Given the intrinsic limitations of pediatric clinical trials, due to the small population and gaps in follow-up time, further studies are needed to provide more answers about n-3 LCPUFAsâ€™ influence on gene expression and modulation, particularly regarding the benefits for infants and their future health. </p>
