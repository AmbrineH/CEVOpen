<p class="p">The LCPUFAs are synthesized in the liver endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes through desaturase and elongase enzymes. EPA and DHA are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and transported to the liver through triglycerides in chylomicron particles. From the liver, they are brought into blood circulation in lipoproteins such as Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and as plasma phospholipids. In a smaller proportion, they are present as free fatty acids bound to albumin. EPA and DHA are converted into cell membrane phospholipids, especially in the heart, brain, and in adipose tissue as triglycerides.</p>
