<p class="p">DHA is the biologically active end product of alpha-linolenic acid, which is an essential fatty acid because it is exclusively obtained from the diet. ALA is referred to as the essential precursor of n-3 LCPUFAs, while Linoleic Acid (LA) gives rise to n-6 LCPUFAs. ALA is converted into long chain fatty acids by a series of alternating desaturations and elongations. The first step in ALA metabolism is desaturation, catalyzed by delta-6-desaturase. This step is considered rate-limiting. Since the conversion efficiency of ALA to Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosatetraenoic Acid (EPA) is low and limited in humans, looking for dietary sources is essential to achieve adequate provision of DHA. DHA is primarily derived from fish, especially oily fish such as herring, salmon, and tuna, as well as omega-3-fed chickens and their eggs. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) is a precursor of DHA and is metabolized to DHA in the liver [
