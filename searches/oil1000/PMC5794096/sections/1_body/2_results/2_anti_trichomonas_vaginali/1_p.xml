The negative control and DMSO control showed positive motility and did not stain with Trypan blue (0.4%), whereas the positive control stained blue and exhibited negative motility at the 24 h time point in all assays performed. When the kinetic growth curve was analyzed, it was observed that the exposure to 500 μg/mL of EOP reduced the growth of trophozoites by 36% at 12 h and induced complete parasite death at 24 h (
