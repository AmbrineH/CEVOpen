<p class="p">All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Cral
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>). Parasites were seeded at an initial density of 2.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> trophozoites/mL of TYM and incubated in the presence of EOP. Three experimental controls were also performed: parasites only, the vehicle used for solubilization of EOP (0.6% DMSO) and 100 μM MTZ (metronidazole; Sigma-Aldrich) (as a positive control). The microculture plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 24 h. Subsequent to the incubation, a preparation containing trophozoites and trypan blue (0.4%) in a 1:1 ratio was prepared and counted in a Neubauer chamber. Cultures with 95% viability were utilized for the assay.
