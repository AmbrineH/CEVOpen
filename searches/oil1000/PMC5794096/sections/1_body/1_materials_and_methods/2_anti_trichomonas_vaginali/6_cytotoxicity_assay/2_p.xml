<p class="p">The post-treatment proliferation of the CHO-K1 cell line was determined by measuring the reduction of soluble 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) to water-insoluble formazan. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per well in 100 μL volumes and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere for 24 h before they were used in the cell viability assay. The cells were then treated with 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 μg of EOP for 24 h. DMSO was used as vehicle control (VC), untreated cells were used as a negative control and 100 μM of metronidazole (MTZ) was used as a positive control. Following the incubation, 20 μL of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional period of 3 h at 37 °C. Differences in the total cellular metabolism were detected at a wavelength of 492 nm by using a microplate reader. The inhibition (%) of cell proliferation was determined as follows: inhibitory growth = (1 − Abs
 <sub class="sub">492</sub> treated cells / Abs
 <sub class="sub">492</sub> control cells) × 100%. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA). All observations were validated by at least three independent experiments in triplicate.
