<p class="p">On the other hand, studies focusing on essential oils of propolis volatiles are relatively scarce, most of them dealing with antimicrobial properties against fungus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies describing the chemical composition or the biological activities of the essential oil derived from the Brazilian red propolis (EOP). Herein, the chemical composition of the EOP is showed. Still, in vitro trichomonacidal and cytotoxic activities, and the adjuvant action of EOP in a recombinant vaccine are assessed.
