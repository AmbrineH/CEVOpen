<p class="p">There also exist more complex techniques based on carbon isotope ratios which allow the authentication of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> VOCs for the control of adulteration of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils. Thus, the employment of GC hyphenated to carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) can detect compounds of different botanical origin such as, for example, the presence of citral extracted from lemon grass (
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schipilliti et al., 2018</xref>) in lemon EO. Moreover, this technique provides the authenticity assessment to differentiate natural and synthetic compounds in different 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils, to discriminate 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel oils of different geographical origin. Also, GC-C-IRMS is useful to eliminate the environmental influences and to differentiate genuine 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils belonging to different species. However, this technique presents limitations related to chromatographic resolution due to instrumentation engineering. It will be necessary the optimization of the multidimensional GC separations to more effectively establish the ranges of authenticity of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils.
