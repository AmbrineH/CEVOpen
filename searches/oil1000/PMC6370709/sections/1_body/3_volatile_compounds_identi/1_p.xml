<p class="p">We have listed in this review over one thousand volatile and semi-volatile compounds that have been reported during the last two decades in rinds, leaves or flowers (EOs and solvent extracts) of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species cultivated worldwide, although some early studies have also been included (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In this review we have focused on the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> (also named 
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. junos</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>. This study also allowed us to establish which species are more similar or distant to each other according to the rind composition of their volatile and semi-volatile fractions as described in the literature. Finally, the volatile pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> rinds has been compared to those of flowers and leaves.
