<p class="p">Our literature review on VOCs in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species corroborates some commonalities for the 10 most widely used and analyzed 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species. Thus, the EOs obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> rinds always show limonene, a hydrocarbon monoterpene, as the most abundant compound, its concentration generally representing about 60–95% of the oil (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jing et al., 2014</xref>). However, limonene can show lower levels, as in 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, in which it can decrease down to 30% (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jing et al., 2014</xref>), or in 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>, where it can decrease down to 48% (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lota et al., 2002</xref>). The following compounds in abundance are also monoterpenes, usually representing less than 15% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), although γ-terpinene (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fanciullino et al., 2006</xref>) and linalyl acetate (
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Verzera et al., 2003</xref>) can reach an abundance of 23% and 36%, respectively. Non-terpenoid compounds very rarely represent more than 1%, although this does not necessarily mean that these compounds do not have an impact on the EO aroma. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> flowers and leaves show a different volatile profile. In these organs, limonene is not always the major volatile compound. Depending on the species, other monoterpenes such as linalool, β-myrcene or β-citronellol, in the case of flowers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boussaada and Chemli, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jabalpurwala et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sarrou et al., 2013</xref>), or sabinene, in the case of leaves (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tomi et al., 2008</xref>), may be the most prominent compounds.
