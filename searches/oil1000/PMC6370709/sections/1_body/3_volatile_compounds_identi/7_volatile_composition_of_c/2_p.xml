<p class="p">Recently a volatilome of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> leaves about differentially accumulated volatiles has been developed (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lamine et al., 2018</xref>). This study was performed in the leaves of four 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species (
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic>) and these four species were clearly discriminated, especially 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>. The number of taxonomic classifiers was narrow to eight (linalyl acetate, geranyl acetate, neryl acetate, β-
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-ocimene, δ-3-carene, β-myrcene, sabinene and α-terpineol). However, according to our review, it is very risky to establish taxonomic volatile metabolites with a single study, given the great variability of the volatile profile for the same species.
