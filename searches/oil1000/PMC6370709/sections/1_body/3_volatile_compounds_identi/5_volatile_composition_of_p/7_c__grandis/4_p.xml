<p class="p">Finally, it is important to indicate that when 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils are exposed to sunlight, UV radiation or the air, the volatile profile can be modified due to chemical reactions. It has been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> oil that the concentration of several compounds, especially aldehydes such as decanal, dodecanal, neral or geranial, drops dramatically when exposed to these conditions. Instead, other compounds increase their concentration or appear novelly such as β-citronellal, α-humulene, linalool oxides, limonene oxides, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-carveol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-carveol, perilla alcohol, carvone, α-pinene oxide, γ-elemene or caryophyllene oxide (

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2016</xref>). This aldehyde transformation in 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> promoted an increase of strong oily notes and a decrease of fresh notes. Recently, sensory evaluation, GC-MS and GC-O demonstrated the pummelo rind oil co-treated by both oxygen and heating (70°C O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) showed significant differences in both volatile composition and aromatic profile from those of the corresponding fresh, nitrogen-protected (25°C N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), heated (70°C N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and oxygen-exposed (25°C O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) oils (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). This study indicates that oxygen and heating co-treatment increases the content of limonene oxides and carvone in pummelo EO. The first compounds enhanced the sweet and floral notes, while the latter promoted the intensity of the minty note. These results indicate the importance of a correct production and storage of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oil to preserve its original freshness quality.
