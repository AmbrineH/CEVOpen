<p class="p">One of the most relevant features of 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> volatile profile is the absence of some compounds that are typical of other common species of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>, mainly some sesquiterpene compounds. This is the case of the sesquiterpene (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-Î±-bergamotene, which has never been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> peel but frequently identified in all the other common 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species studied (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mondello et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lan Phi et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aliberti et al., 2016</xref>;

 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). As far as we know, neither the compound thymol has been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> nor 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic> nor 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> peel and neither (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-decenal had been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> nor 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic>, but in the rest of the species reviewed.
