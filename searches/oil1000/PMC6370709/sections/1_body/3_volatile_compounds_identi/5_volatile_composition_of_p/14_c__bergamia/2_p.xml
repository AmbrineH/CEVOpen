<p class="p">The major compound in 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> is limonene, but its percentage can decrease down to 33% (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Poiana et al., 2003</xref>). Instead, 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> shows higher percentage of other monoterpene compounds, most notably linalyl acetate, which is sometimes almost as abundant as limonene, which does not happen for any other species of the reviewed, as far as we know (

 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Verzera et al., 2003</xref>). Linalool is also more abundant in

 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> are also increased in 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, when compared to the species of the
