<p class="p">According to our review, the volatile profile most similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> are those of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, whilst C. 
 <italic class="italic">junos</italic> also clusters together in terms of volatile profile similarity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). As in 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. junos</italic> peel, and also in 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic>, many sesquiterpene hydrocarbons have been described in 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The recent study realized by 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aliberti et al. (2016)</xref> has reported some compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> not described, or very rarely identified, in other 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species so far as like the monoterpenes cuminyl alcohol, dehydrosabina ketone or 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-4-caranone, and specially sesquiterpene like longifolene, 9-epi-caryophyllene, α-cuprenene, γ-cuprenene, italicene, nootkatol, or β-oplopenone, among many others. However, it is important to note that most of these compounds were tentatively identified, because a standard was not used for their identification, with some exception like the monoterpene 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-4-caranone and the sesquiterpenes longifolene or 9-epi-caryophyllene.
