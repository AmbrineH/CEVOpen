<p class="p">As in all the revised species, the most abundant compound in 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> is limonene, but its percentage can decrease down to 51% (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Verzera et al., 2005</xref>), while other monoterpene compounds such as γ-terpinene, β-pinene or camphene are present at higher concentration, in comparison with species of 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> cluster where these compounds are usually described in percentages below 1%. Thus, in 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> oil, γ-terpinene, β-pinene or camphene can reach percentage of 31%, 9.7%, and 10%, respectively (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lota et al., 1999</xref>;

 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic> presents higher concentrations of some sesquiterpenes, as is the case of (
