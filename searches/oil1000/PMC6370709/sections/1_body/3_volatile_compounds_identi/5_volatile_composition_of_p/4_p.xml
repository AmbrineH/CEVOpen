<p class="p">However, a recent study about the origin and evolution of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> based on the total genome shows higher similarities with the volatile profiles here summarized. Our HCA clustered 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> with 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. grandis</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>). In fact, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al. (2018)</xref> showed that the first three species are actually genetical hybrids and admixtures of the latter two. This genomic study also revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> is a hybrid of 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic>. In accordance with this, our HCA based on the volatile profile of the fruit peel also clustered them together.
