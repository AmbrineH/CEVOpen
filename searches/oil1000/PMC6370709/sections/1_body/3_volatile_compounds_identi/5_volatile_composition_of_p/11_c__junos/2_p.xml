<p class="p">Most of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. junos</italic> characteristic compounds previously mentioned are compounds that have been reported at trace levels, with percentages lower than 0.02%. In this species the major compounds are also very similar to those described in 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic>. Thus, the most abundant compound remains limonene, although in concentrations between 63 and 77%, lower than usually those of the species closest to 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> (
