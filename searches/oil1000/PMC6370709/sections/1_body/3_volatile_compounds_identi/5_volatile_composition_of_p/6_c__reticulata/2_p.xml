<p class="p">From a quantitative perspective, although non-terpenoid aldehyde compounds could help to differentiate this species from others, the most abundant compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> EO are monoterpene hydrocarbons. Among them, the most relevant is limonene, usually representing about 95% of the total EO, but occasionally down to 60% in some studies (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fanciullino et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2014</xref>). The next compounds in abundance are γ-terpinene, sometimes reaching values above 15% (

 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petretto et al., 2016</xref>), β-myrcene (7.43–0.1%) (

 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2014</xref>), α-pinene (3.93–0.1%) (

 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2014</xref>) or β-pinene (4%-traces) (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fanciullino et al., 2006</xref>). Monoterpenoids linalool and β-citronellal can reach up to 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2014</xref>). Among other compounds with abundances approximately between 0.7 and 0.1% we found the sesquiterpene α-sinensal, the non-terpene aliphatic compounds octanal and decanal, and the aromatic compound methyl 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylanthranilate (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The rest of the compounds, including the non-terpenoid aldehydes, do not usually reach percentages higher than 0.1%, although this does not necessarily imply that they do not influence the final aroma of the EO.
