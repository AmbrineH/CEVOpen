<p class="p">The volatile composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sinensis</italic> peel EO is the most studied of all 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species along with those of 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This species seems to be richer in the diversity of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons than other species as 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>. An example of these compounds is aromadendrene (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hosni et al., 2010</xref>) or sesquiphellandrene (

 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sawamura et al., 2005</xref>), although it should not be forgotten that many of these sesquiterpenes are identified ambiguously, because there are no commercial standards or are unattainable for their price for many scientific studies. Also, in this species have been reported a relative large group of monoterpenoid compounds, being some of them almost exclusive compounds as limonene diepoxide (
