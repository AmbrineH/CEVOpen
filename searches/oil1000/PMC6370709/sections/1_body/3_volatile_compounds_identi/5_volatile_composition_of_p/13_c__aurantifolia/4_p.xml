<p class="p">Despite 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> peel being rich in total terpenes, it is striking that we do not find some terpene compounds found in other 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species, as indicated in the previous section about 
 <italic class="italic">C. medica</italic>. Among the terpenes absent in 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic>, that were not mentioned above, we highlight the sesquiterpenoid nootkatone, also not reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. junos</italic>.
