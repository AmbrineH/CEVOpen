<p class="p">Lemon EO is the most different of the commonly studied 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species in terms of volatiles. The volatile profile of 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> has been analyzed in numerous studies (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dugo and Mondello, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Spadaro et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cannon et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). As far as we could find in our review mining, the majority of the volatile and semi-volatile compounds found in any other of these 10 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species have also been described in 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic>. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cannon et al. (2015)</xref> identified over 150 compounds by dichloromethane extraction in 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> peel, which we could not find in any other study on VOCs in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>. Among them, we highlight those identified without ambiguity such as sulfur monoterpenoid compounds 2-(5-isopropyl-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-2-yl)ethanol, 3-mercapto-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenyl acetate (odor-active component), 2-(5-isopropyl-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-2-yl) ethyl acetate, 2-(5-isopropylidene-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-2-yl) ethyl acetate and 2-[5-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-2-yl] ethyl acetate; other two sulfur non-terpenoid compounds, 2-propanoylthiophene and 2-(2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-2-yl) ethyl acetate; and the branched-chain aliphatic aldehydes 6-methylnonanal, 4-methyldecanal, 6-methyldecanal, 3-methylundecanal, 4-methylundecanal, 3-methyldodecanal, 4-methyldodecanal, and 4-methyltridecanal. All these exclusive compounds were identified as traces.
