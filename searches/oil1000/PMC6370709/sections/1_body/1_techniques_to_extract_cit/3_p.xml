<p class="p">Additionally, several other extraction methods not involving the use of water or organic solvents have been employed. This is the case of water-free microwave extraction (

 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2014a</xref>), a technique which extracts more efficiently higher MW compounds, such as squalene (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Benelli et al., 2010</xref>) or linoleic acid (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). Headspace techniques have also been often used to extract volatile compounds, such as headspace extraction using a gas-washing bottle and a Porapak-Q sorbent tube (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmaci and Onogur, 2012</xref>), and most frequently HS-SPME. HS-SPME has been used to extract volatiles and semi-volatile compounds of flowers and leaves, predominantly (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cheong et al., 2011b</xref>). When using this technique, the plant material is introduced in a septum-capped vial and after an equilibration period, a pre-conditioned fiber is exposed to the headspace of the vial for several minutes either at room temperature or at higher temperatures. There are currently several types of fibers suitable for adsorbing 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> VOCs. A 100 μm PDMS-coated fiber was used to analyze the aroma of 
 <italic class="italic">C. unshiu</italic> Marcov. fresh and dry blossoms (

 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> leaves (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). In other studies, a 75 μm/85 μm CAR/PDMS-coated fiber was chosen to extract the VOCs from 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> flowers (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chung, 2012</xref>). Also, an additional two fibers have been used for 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel oil. One fiber was a 65 μm DVB/PDMS coated fiber, which was used to analyze 
 <italic class="italic">C. clementine</italic> EOs (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González-Mas et al., 2015</xref>). For this analysis the oil was diluted 1:100 with dichloromethane and 10 μL were introduced in the septum-cap vial for HS-SPME with 990 μL of milli-Q water. 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Choi and Min (2004)</xref> also used this last fiber to analyze the VOCs in fresh flavedo of Hallabong

 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> flowers (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). According to the results reported in our literature review, the SPME-fibers used most often to analyze 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> flower and leaf volatiles seems be the minor polar 100 μm PDMS or 75 μm/85 μm CAR/PDMS fibers, while the 65 μm DVB/PDMS fiber is more used for
