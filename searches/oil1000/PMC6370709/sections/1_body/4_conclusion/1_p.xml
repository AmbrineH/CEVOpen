<p class="p">This review about the volatiles in the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oil summarized critically the volatile compounds identified up to date in the 10 most frequently studied 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species. It allowed their clustering based on the qualitative profile of the volatiles more reliably identified, which was in concordance with their genomic similitude. It also provides the possibility of developing species biomarkers based on this type of compounds, and points toward those which could be useful for the industry to monitor quality and consumer safety (

 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> volatile chemical database presented here. This review also provides important information to help in the selection of the most adequate species and the best source for specialized volatile chemicals for pharmaceutical, food, beverages, fragrances, and cosmetic industries.
