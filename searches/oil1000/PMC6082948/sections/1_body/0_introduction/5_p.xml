<p class="p">Cloxacillin (CLOX) is a semisynthetic antimicrobial derivate of penicillin that resists being breakdown by the enzyme penicillinase. CLOX is an antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine against

An alternative to face the problem of bacterial resistance is the use of products derived from plant extracts. In the past, natural and phytochemical products were used in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. Plants naturally synthesize aromatic chemical compounds and secondary metabolites which serve as a defense mechanism against microbes (

The biological activity of a medicinal plant is usually based on the presence of one or a set of chemical components located in the tissues of the plant. The compounds with antimicrobial activity are mostly present in essential oils, which can occur in one or more organs depending on the species (
