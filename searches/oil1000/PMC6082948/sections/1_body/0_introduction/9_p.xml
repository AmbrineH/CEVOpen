<p class="p">The antimicrobial properties of essential oils promote scientific interest in the study of them as a new group of pharmacological compounds. They possess a huge chemical and structural variety, converting them into functionally versatile mixtures (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Although their activity can be associated with the major components, all of them influence in the pharmacological effect. It is probably that the high concentration of the major compounds masks the effects of the others. However, in terms of antimicrobial activity, every isolated component shows less antibacterial effect than the complete essential oil (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). It has also been shown that the function of the main compounds is regulated by the minority molecules, contributing to the synergic effect (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Considering the large number of chemical structures that make up the essential oils it is likely that antibacterial properties cannot be attributed to a single chemical compound, and therefore there could be several targets in the microbial cells where these would act resulting in an enhancing influence. That is why it is reasonable to study the essential oils as a whole and take advantage of the synergy of all the components (
