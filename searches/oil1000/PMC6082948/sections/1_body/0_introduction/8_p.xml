<p class="p">Several authors are researching about the application of essential oils as adjuvant to increase the effect of antimicrobials against bacterial species. This is a new concept with high potential. For example 
 <italic class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</italic> essential oil reduces the minimum effective dose of norfloxacin against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherechia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Rodr√≠gues et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>) reported that the essential oil of leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Croton zehntneri</italic> is able to enhance the activity of gentamicin by 42.8% against 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> by gaseous contact, which suggests that the oil has a potential to be used as an adjuvant in antimicrobial therapy (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). Gram positive bacteria as 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> are more susceptible to essential oils than Gram negative ones (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), because these last one have an outer layer with lipopolysaccharide that cover the peptidoglycan and limiting the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through it (
