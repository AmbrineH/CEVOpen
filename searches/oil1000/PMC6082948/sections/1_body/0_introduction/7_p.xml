<p class="p">The exploitation of essential oils in the prevention of bacterial resistance is promising because those are multi-components with different targets of action, compared to many conventional antimicrobial agents that only have a single target site. Depending on the composition of the essential oils, different mechanisms of action can be attributed, including damage to essential proteins of the pathogen, blocking of membrane enzymes with which the microorganisms can pump out the active principle, changes in the metabolism, permeabilization of their membranes. These oils contain wide ranges of polyphenols and terpenoids, which have strong binding affinity to different molecular structures such as membranes, due to their great lipophilicity, presenting a high potential to penetrate through cell walls and disorganize them, leading to leakage cellular content (
