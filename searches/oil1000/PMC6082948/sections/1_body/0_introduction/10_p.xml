 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca armillaris</italic> (Soland. ex Gaertn.) Sm. is one of the most widely cultivated Melaleuca plants. It is commonly known as Honey Bracelet Myrtle and grows in the form of a large bush or as a small tree. Reports of the literature about 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> essential oil (EO) remain scarce. Investigations by GC-MS of its EO revealed the presence of 1.8-cineole as the major component (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Several activities have been determined for this EO. Rizk et al. (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) obtained positive results 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> using this EO in the treatment against the parasitoid 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, responding to the oxidant activity generated by the pathogen. Inhibitory activity was also found, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, against some bacterial species such as 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). The activities observed for the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> in pure form allow supposing that the good results obtained by themselves can be increased in synergistic systems for the same purpose, such as the improvement of antibiotics to treat infections caused by strains resistant to conventional treatment. No bibliography has been found indicating the use of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> as an enhancer of antibiotics used in the treatment of microbial infections, particularly against strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. This pathogen is very resistant to antibiotics, and is responsible for high percentage persistent infections. The indiscriminate use of antimicrobials is generating microorganisms resistant to multiple drugs, becoming a serious problem for global health (
