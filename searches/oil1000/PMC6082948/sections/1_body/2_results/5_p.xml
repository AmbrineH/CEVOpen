<p class="p">With the evaluation of the antibacterial activity index we could compare the incidence of EO in the CLOX activity, in addition to the effect caused by the pH variation. This is visualized in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>. It is observed how the acidification of the medium enhances the antimicrobial activity of CLOX against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (for the reference strain and the wild strains). Lower pH values requires a less amount of antibiotic to obtain an 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-value lesser than −3 indicating a bactericidal effect. In the graphs it can be seen how the presence of the EO favors the action of the CLOX, since lower 
 <italic class="italic">E-</italic>values are reached with lower concentrations of the antibiotic in comparison with the results obtained for CLOX alone. For the reference strain ATCC 29213, it was achieved a bactericidal effect very close to virtual eradication, since the 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-values are close to −4. This was observed from concentrations of 2 the MIC of CLOX in the mixture, at the 3 pHs evaluated (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). In wild isolates the behavior was similar to that observed for the reference strain (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>).
