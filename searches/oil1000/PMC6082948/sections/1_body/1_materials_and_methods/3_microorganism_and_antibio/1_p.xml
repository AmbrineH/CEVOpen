 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 as reference strain for quality control. Wild strains were isolated from milk samples obtained of Holstein cows with subclinical mastitis. They were identified by colony morphology and routine biochemical tests, Gram stain, coagulase, and catalase test, development of Î²-hemolysis, glucose fermentation and growth in saline medium (7.5%).
