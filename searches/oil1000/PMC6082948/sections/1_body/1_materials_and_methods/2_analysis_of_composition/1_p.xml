<p class="p">The EO was analyzed by a GC–FID–MS Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 7890A/5975C, equipped with one injector (split ratio 1:100), connected by a flow splitter to two capillary columns (HPWAX and DB-1-MS, both 60 m × 0.25 mm with 0.25 μm of fixed phase). The polar column was connected to a FID, whereas the non-polar column was connected to a quadrupolar mass detector (HP 5975C; 70 eV). Helium was used as gas carrier, at 1.8 mL/min. The injector temperature was set at 250°C. Injection volume was 0.3 μL. The column temperature was programmed according to the following gradient: 100°C, increasing at 2°C/min to 240°C and kept constant for 15 min. FID temperature was 260°C, and temperatures for the transference line and the ionic source were set at 280 and 230°C, respectively. Mass range (m/z) was 40–500 Da. Data acquisition, processing and instrument control was performed using the Agilent ChemStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) software. The identification of the compounds was achieved by analyzing the retention indexes (relative to C8–C24 n-alkanes) obtained in both columns and compared with those of reference compounds identified in chemically well-known essential oils and from bibliography (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Additionally, each mass spectra obtained was compared to those from the literature libraries (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>) and mass spectra obtained from reference compounds. Relative percentage contribution of the compounds was calculated from the FID response by a computerized integration assuming all of the responses factors were 1.
