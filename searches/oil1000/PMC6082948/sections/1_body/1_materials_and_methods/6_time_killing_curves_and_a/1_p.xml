<p class="p">The antibacterial activity index (E) was evaluated from those combinations that showed the lowest FIC values, established as the MIC value of the mixture. For this purpose we carried out time-kill assays for different concentrations (0.5MIC; 1MIC; 2MIC; 4MIC; 8MIC) of EO, CLOX and the combination. For the last one, 1MIC correspond to the lower FIC value blending and the others (0.5MIC, 2MIC, 4MIC, 8MIC) keep the proportion of both compounds (diluting or concentrating as the case may be). We prepared 7 tubes in each case (considering control positive and negative) with 1 mL of final volume containing MHB 0.5 Tween 80, antimicrobial (or AE/CLOX combination) and the inoculums. All tubes had a bacterial concentration of approximately 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL (except the negative control). They were incubated at 35°C and samples were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h in order to construct survival curves by plate count. Those were performed for all strains at pH 7.4; 6.5 and 5.0.
