<p class="p">The E index was quantified as the difference between the Log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> values of the number of viable bacteria (CFU/mL) at initial time (nt-0) and at the end of the test (nt-24) according to the following equation: E = nt-24-nt-0. To evaluate E, three theoretical cut points were applied (
