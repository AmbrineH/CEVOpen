<p class="p">To determine the MIC of CLOX and EO, we used 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates with Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) supplemented with 0.5% of Tween 80 (to enhance the EO dissolution). The broth was adjusted to pH 7.4, 6.5, or 5.0 with hydrochloric acid 1N (Anedra, Argentina), in order to emulate the conditions of pH to extracellular and intracellular level. The range of CLOX concentrations (applying a scheme of two-fold serial dilution) evaluated was from 256 to 0.007 μg/mL. The concentrations of EO tested were from 50 μL/mL to 0.1 μL/mL. In both cases each well was inoculated with a final bacterial concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL. The suspension was adjusted to match 0.5 Mc Farland (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL). The plates were incubated at 35°C for 18–24 h. The MIC was established as the lowest concentration which inhibits the bacterial growth. All determinations were carried out in triplicate and in all cases positive and negative controls were used with MHB containing 0.5% Tween 80.
