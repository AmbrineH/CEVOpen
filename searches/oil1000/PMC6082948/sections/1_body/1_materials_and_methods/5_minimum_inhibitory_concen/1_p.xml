<p class="p">The MIC of the mixture was performed as previously described by CLOX and EO. The combinations of the antibiotic and the plant extract were prepared according to checkerboard technique (

The microtiter plate consisted of a row with two-fold serial dilution of EO and a column with two-fold serial dilution of CLOX (as MIC control). The intermediate wells presented EO/CLOX combinations. The results were interpreted as for MIC of individual antimicrobials, but considering this parameter as a mix. The bacterial inoculums of
