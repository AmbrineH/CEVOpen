<p class="p">In conclusion, it was possible to reduce the concentration of the antibiotic needed to inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> by combining CLOX with EO 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>. Considering that CLOX is an antimicrobial of the group of β-lactams with good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and with wide use in veterinary medicine, the EO enhance CLOX antibacterial effect even when the intracellular pH were more acid than the extracellular medium. This is important for the treatment of intracellular infections where 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is internalized inside of phagolysosomes because the probability of therapeutic success would be really increased. Our results suggest an increase of the susceptibility to β-lactams due to the acidic pH prevailing in the vacuoles where 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> live and prosper, which would be facilitated by the action of 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> EO. The acid pH causes a conformational change of the target protein of action (PBP2a), increasing the affinity of its catalytic center for β-lactam (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> when it is refractory to immunological mechanisms. These findings become into a valuable alternative for the treatment of persistent staphylococcal infections. 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> EO needs to be considered in the design of future formulations to evaluate 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> effects, in order to maximize the efficacy of current and future antimicrobials.
