<p class="p">The combined activity of EO and CLOX, used in our study, was also evidenced in the bactericidal effect, established by the E index. The decrease in the initial bacterial inoculum -Log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (CFU/mL)- in a factor of 3 in 24 h marked bactericidal activity observed in both for the CLOX alone and for the mixture. However, the concentration of the antimicrobial in the presence of EO was clearly lower and the 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-value obtained was closer to the virtual eradication effect (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> = −4) than the concentration needed when applying β-lactam alone. In a study conducted by Nascimento et al. (
