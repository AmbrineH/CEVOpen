<p class="p">A clear synergic effect was observed for the combination EO/CLOX, since FIC values obtained were â‰¤1 (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). When we faced the EO/CLOX combination against the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains, there was a great decreased in the concentration of antibiotic necessary to inhibit the bacterial growth. In EO/CLOX combination the bactericidal effect was maintained even when the pH of the broth was reduced from 7.4 to 5.0, as we have mentioned above when EO was studied without CLOX. And in the same way, when the culture medium was acidified, the concentration of CLOX, in the mixture EO/CLOX, was reduced even up to 10-fold to inhibit the microorganism. As we have mentioned in the introduction, there is still no published works where the pharmacological interaction between the 
 <italic class="italic">M. armillaris</italic> EO and CLOX has been studied. In the bibliography another 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> (tree of tea), has been widely investigated using the checkerboard technique against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. However, the results obtained when combining its EO with different antibiotics such as vancomycin (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>), tobramycin (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), and ciprofloxacin (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>) were indifference or antagonism effect.
