<p class="p">The chromatographic analysis of our EO revealed the presence of 1.8 cineole as major component (72.3%) and in lesser magnitude limonene (7.8%) and Î±-pinene (6.0%). Those are commonly present in effective antimicrobial essential oils. The 1.8 cineole is a monocyclic monoterpene with high antimicrobial activity. In several studies (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>), the main component reported was also 1.8 cineole, but this result disagree with other authors like Amri et al. (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>) because the concentration of this one was markedly low (3.6%). There is evidence that the differences found in the concentration of the components in essential oils, extracted from different plants, would be affected by environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>). The main compound of the mixture generally exerts the strongest activity, but can be influenced by the other molecules (
