<p class="p">Recirculation has been shown to successfully increase the methane yield of anaerobic digestion of citrus waste in a two-stage process. Furthermore, recirculation system gives higher degradability as shown by VS reduction and VFA content than that of without recirculation system. Having recirculated the second-stage effluent into the first-stage reactor helped to increase the pH in the first-stage reactor. This leads a better condition for VFA production in the first-stage. In addition, filtration can be used to minimize the amount of D-limonene entering the system in the second-stage. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the combination of recirculation and filtration can be a promising strategy for anaerobic digestion of citrus waste at high OLRs.</p>
