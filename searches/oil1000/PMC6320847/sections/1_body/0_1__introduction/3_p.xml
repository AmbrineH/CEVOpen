 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] previously reported that co-digestion of citrus waste and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste with a percent ratio of 30:70 was successfully conducted up to an OLR of 3 g VS/(L·day). However, the system failed at higher OLRs. Similarly, Martín et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported that anaerobic co-digestion of orange peel with glycerol (1:1) resulted in stable operation up to an OLR of 1.91 g VS/(L·day), but failed at higher OLRs. These studies imply that co-digestion of citrus waste is not suitable for operation at high OLRs. In addition, co-digestion can only treat a relatively low amount of citrus waste, which makes it undesirable from an industrial point of view. Hence, an alternative solution is needed.
