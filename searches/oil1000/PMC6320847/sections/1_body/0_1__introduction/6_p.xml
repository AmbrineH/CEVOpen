<p class="p">Anaerobic digestion of citrus waste at high OLRs resulted in a pH drop in the first-stage reactor, which is not favorable for the growth of acid-forming bacteria. In order to maintain the pH, a base can be added to the first-stage reactor. This approach, however, is costly and less environmentally friendly. Gottardo et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that effluent from the second-stage digester is rich in buffering agents. Hence recirculation of the effluent from the reactor of the second-stage might help to maintain the pH in the reactor of the first-stage. Recirculation of effluent from the second-stage into the first-stage in anaerobic digestion of starch and cotton resulted in higher degradability (91% and 80%, respectively) compared to without recirculation (82% and 56%) [
