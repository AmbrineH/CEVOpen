<p class="p">The major component of citrus essential oil (CEO) in citrus waste is 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, which makes up 68–98% of sweet orange essential oil [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Several studies have shown the inhibition effect of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene on anaerobic digestion of citrus waste. Mizuki et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reported that the limit dosage of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene was 26 mg/(L·day). Wikandari et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] reported that the methane production of single-stage anaerobic digestion halted at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.5 g VS/(L·day). Their study showed that VFA (volatile fatty acids) started to be accumulated around 7.5 g/L, which indicated that the inhibition occurred in the system at this OLR.
