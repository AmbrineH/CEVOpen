<p class="p">Two-stage digestion with recirculation is a potential approach to address the inhibition problem. In two-stage digestion, the acid and methane forming processes are separated. Acid forming (hydrolytic, acidogenic, and acetogenic microorganisms) and methane forming (methanogens) microorganisms have different pH requirements for their optimum growth. Methanogens are considered as the microorganisms more sensitive to inhibitors (in this case 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene) and low pH. Therefore, the separation of the acid forming from the methane forming process could protect methanogens from an acidic environment. The first-stage has an optimum pH for acidophilic microorganisms 5.0–6.5 [
