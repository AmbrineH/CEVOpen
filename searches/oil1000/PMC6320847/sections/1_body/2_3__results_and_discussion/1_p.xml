 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene could inhibit methane-forming microorganisms in the rumen was published in 1957 [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Since then, several studies have attempted to digest citrus waste in different ways. However, most of the digestion halted at maximum OLR of 2 g VS/(LÂ·day) [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In this stud, several approaches combining two-stage digestions, filtrations, and an effluent recirculation have been investigated in order to increase the methane production. The first-stage was carried out in a STR whereas the second-stage was carried out in an UASB reactor. In the system with recirculation, the effluent from the second-stage was transferred to the first-stage. In order to evaluate the effect of recirculation, several parameters were measured, including the VS reduction and pH in the first-stage, as well as the biogas production and composition in the second-stage reactor. Two-stage anaerobic digestion of citrus waste in a system without recirculation was also conducted as control.
