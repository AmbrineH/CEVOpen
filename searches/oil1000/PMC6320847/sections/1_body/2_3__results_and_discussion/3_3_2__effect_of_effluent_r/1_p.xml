<p class="p">An up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used as the second-stage reactor in this study because this type of reactor is considered more effective and shows higher resistance to toxicity than a stirred tank reactor (STR) configuration [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The VFA-rich filtrate of effluent from the first-stage was fed into the second-stage to be further converted into methane. The HRT of both the recirculated and non-recirculated system was shortened from 3 to 1.5 days to help the microorganisms adapt.
