<p class="p">The digestibility of citrus waste in the system with effluent recirculation was 25–33%. The OLR used in this study (5 g·VS/L/day) was relatively high compared to other previous works. Forgacs et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] investigated methane production from co-digestion of untreated citrus waste and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste with a ratio of 30:70 at OLR 3 g VS/L/day and the process ceased after 26 days. Flotats et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] also investigated co-digestion of citrus waste (50–80% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>) and manure with a maximum OLR of 1 g VS/L/day. Wikandari et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] studied the resilience of membrane bioreactors against 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Limonene in a synthetic medium and in real citrus waste. However, the OLR of the citrus waste was only investigated until an OLR of 3 g VS/L/day. Reverse membrane bioreactors have been of interest for the biorefinery process of inhibitor containing substrates [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, the high price and intensive maintenance requirements limit their application in industry. Hence, recirculation, which plays the role of pH regulator in the acidification stage, is simpler compared to membrane technology, making it more applicable in industry. The result of the current work reveals that the combination of two-stage digestion, filtration, and effluent recirculation can be successfully applied to anaerobic digestion of citrus waste at high OLRs. However, further studies such as microorganism’s community analysis might be performed in order to broaden the knowledge in this study.
