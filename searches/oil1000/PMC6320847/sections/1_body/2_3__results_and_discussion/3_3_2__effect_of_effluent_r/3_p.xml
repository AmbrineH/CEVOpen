 <xref rid="molecules-23-03380-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The methane content in both systems was within a similar range as other reports [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. No hydrogen was detected in either system. These results reveal that recirculation did not affect biogas composition. The methane yield from the second-stage is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03380-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The results showed that methane production was two times higher in the system with recirculation (160–203 NmL/(g·VS·day)) compared to the system without recirculation (66–113 NmL/(g·VS·day)). The higher VFA in the effluent of the first-stage in the system with recirculation might be the reason for the higher methane production. Similarly, Stabnikova et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] reported that 40% higher methane production was obtained by recirculation of effluent from the second-stage into the first-stage in anaerobic digestion of food waste. The authors proposed that recirculation could enhance the acidogenesis process by preventing an excess of acid and providing a faster supply of nutrients to the microorganism. A significant effect of recirculation was observed in two-stage anaerobic digestion of vegetable waste at high OLR (above 2.6 g·VS/(L·day)) [
