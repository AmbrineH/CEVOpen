<p class="p">The pH of the effluent from the reactors in the second-stage in both systems was stable above 7, indicating that both reactors were able to consume most of the VFA. This is also shown by the low VFA concentration in the effluent that is correlated to 90% of VFA consumption in both systems (

In addition, the higher pH above 7 also indicates that buffer agents are present in the effluent from the reactors in the second-stage. In line with VFA consumption, the COD was reduced by 90% in the second-stage reactor for both systems (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03380-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The high COD reduction in the second-stage could be explained by the lower

 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Limonene is insoluble in water; hence it tends to be retained in the solid phase rather than in the liquid phase. These results prove the advantage of filtration for D-limonene removal in two-stage digestion.
