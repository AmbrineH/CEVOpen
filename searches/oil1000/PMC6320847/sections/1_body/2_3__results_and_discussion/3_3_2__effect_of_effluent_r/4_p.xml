<p class="p">Few studies have attempted to find out the mechanism behind the improvement of the anaerobic digestion performance by recirculation. Degueurce et al [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] reported that effluent recirculation from anaerobic digestion of manure produced biotic and abiotic effects. The biotic effect is changing the microbiological community, whereas the abiotic effect is providing nutrients, adjusting pH and buffering the system. Hence, anaerobic digestion with biotic effluent recirculation produced 50% more methane compared to anaerobic digestion with abiotic effluent recirculation [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Recirculation increased the proportion of phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> that has two-fold cellulolytic capabilities, which caused better cellulose degradation and higher VFA production [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Higher VFA concentration promotes the shift of methanogen genera from 
 <italic class="italic">Methanosarcina</italic> spp. to 
 <italic class="italic">Methanothermobacter</italic> spp. which is more tolerant to a high concentration of VFA [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Digestate recirculation has been also applied in pilot scale and the results proved that recirculation could stabilize the first-stage process [
