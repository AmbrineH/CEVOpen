<p class="p">The higher pH in the reactor with recirculation leads to a higher production of VFAs (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03380-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Volatile fatty acids (or short chain fatty acids) have a pKa of around 4.8 [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. VFAs can be toxic to microorganisms, and their toxicity depends on the pH. In the first-stage in the reactor without recirculation, the pH was lower than the pKa. When the pH in the reactor is lower than its pKa, the VFAs remain in undissociated form. The undissociated forms of VFAs are hydrophobic compounds. This allows them to pass through cell membranes consisting of a phospholipid bilayer, and to disrupt cell systems [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Hence, the production of VFAs is reduced. This would explain why there are higher levels of VFAs in the first-stage with recirculation.
