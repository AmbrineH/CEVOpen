<p class="p">Recirculation not only positively affected the pH and VFA production, but also improved substrate degradation. This was indicated by a higher and more stable soluble COD value in the filtrate compared to the reactor without recirculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03380-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The higher VS reduction in the recirculation reactor is in accordance with the higher VFA production. VS reduction of the system with recirculation was 32–34%, while for the system without recirculation it was 15–21%. One possible explanation could be that the reactor with recirculation has an optimum pH for VFA production. In addition, the performance improvement with recirculation might be related to the shifting of the microbial community towards the acidogenic and acetogenic community as suggested by Giulano et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. With the approximate values of 33% and 18% in the reactors with and without recirculation, respectively, the VS reduction is comparatively low. The reason for this could be that the OLR used in this study was high at 5 g VS/(L·day), as was the loading rate of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Limonene. Nonetheless, if recirculation is applied to a non-toxic substrate such as starch, the degradability can reach up to 91% of the theoretical value [
