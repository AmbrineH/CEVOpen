<p class="p">The effect of recirculation on pH during the first-stage of anaerobic digestion of citrus waste is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03380-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The pH in the first-stage reactor with recirculation increased gradually from 4.5 to 6.1, whereas the pH in the reactor without recirculation only increased from 4.4 to 4.7. This might be explained by high amounts of buffering agents such as bicarbonate and ammonia [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] in the effluent from the second-stage, which could aid in controlling the pH in the first-stage [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The effluent from the second-stage in reactor with recirculation has a pH in the range of 7â€“7.9 (data not shown). This phenomenon was also observed by Aslanzadeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] in anaerobic digestion of cotton and starch, in which the pH of effluent from the second-stage was 8. The recirculation of the effluent caused the pH of the first-stage to stabilize over 6.
