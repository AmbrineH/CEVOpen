<p class="p">Besides having a negative impact on the first-stage, low pH also affects methane producing microorganisms in the second-stage, as methanogens exhibit optimum growth at pH of 6.7â€“7.5 [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The lack of 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-muramic acid in the cell membrane structure of methanogens makes them more sensitive to acids. The impact of a low pH is more pronounced in a one-stage system where acidification and methanogenesis occur in the same reactor. Since a low pH increases the antimicrobial activity of essential oil [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-03380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], the presence of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene in the reactor combined with a low pH enhances its toxic effect. In order to control pH levels in the first-stage where acidification occurs, a base solution can also be added to the reactor. However, this approach is undesirable due to the economic cost and environmental impact of the production of this chemical. Hence, recirculation offers an advantage as no additional chemical is needed.
