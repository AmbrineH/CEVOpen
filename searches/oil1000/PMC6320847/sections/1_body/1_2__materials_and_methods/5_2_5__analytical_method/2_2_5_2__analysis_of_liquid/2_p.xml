 <sc class="sc">-</sc>limonene in the substrate, eluent and solid retentate were conducted using gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectroscopy detector (GC-MS Trace GC Ultra, ThemoScientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The GC-MS was equipped with silica capillary column (ZB-5MS fused-silica with 30 m × 0.25 mm id × 0.25 μm film). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The temperature of the column was set at 50 °C for 2 min and the temperature was increased to 120 °C with a rate of 4 °C/min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C, and the detector temperature was set at 280 °C. Before analysis, the citrus essential oil was extracted from the sample using Soxhlet method with minor modification [

The extraction was run for three hours and the solvent was removed by evaporation to achieve 50 mL solvent extract. The solvent extract was filtered through a 0.2 μL syringe filter before injected to GC-MS. Nonanal was added as an internal standard.
