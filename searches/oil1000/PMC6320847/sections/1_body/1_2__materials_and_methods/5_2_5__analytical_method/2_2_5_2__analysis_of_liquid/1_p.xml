<p class="p">Liquid samples were analysed for pH, soluble COD, and VFA concentration after centrifugation at 17,000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min and subsequent filtration through a 0.2-µm filter to remove solid particles. Glucose and fructose content of substrate were determined with Sucrose/
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Fructose/
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Glucose assay kit (Megazyme, Chicago, IL, USA). The COD was measured using a HACH apparatus equipped with a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (HACH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Digestion solution COD-kit (HACH, NANOCOLOR
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Düsseldorf, Germany) with a detection range of 1–15,000 g/L was used. The concentration of VFAs including acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acid were analyzed by HPLC (Waters 2695, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), which was equipped with an ion-exchange column (Aminex HPX-87H Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a Waters 2414 UV detector. The column temperature was set at 60 °C and 5 mM sulfuric acid was used as eluent with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.
