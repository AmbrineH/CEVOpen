<p class="p">The composition of biogas production was measured using a gas chromatograph (Auto System Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a packed column (Perkin Elmer, 6′ × 1.8′′ OD, 80/100 Mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector (Perkin Elmer). The injector temperature was 150 °C, detection temperature was 200 °C, and oven temperature was 75 °C. The carrier gas was pure nitrogen at a pressure of 0.70 bar and a flow rate of 40 mL/min at 60 °C. A 250 µL pressure-tight gas syringe (VICI, Precision Sampling Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, USA) was used for the gas sampling.</p>
