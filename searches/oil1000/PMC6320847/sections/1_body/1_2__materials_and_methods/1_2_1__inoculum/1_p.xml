<p class="p">The STR (stirred tank reactor) used in the first-stage was inoculated with sludge obtained from the 3000 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> thermophilic biogas plant (55 °C) at Borås Energy and Environment AB (Borås, Sweden). The sludge was stored in an incubator at a temperature of 55 °C for 2–3 days. The sludge was shaken in order to obtain homogenous inoculum. Any remaining large particles were separated by passing the sludge through a sieve with a pore size of 1 mm. An up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor used in the second-stage digestion was inoculated with granulated anaerobic sludge, which was obtained from a pilot scale UASB reactor treating municipal wastewater at Hammarby Sjöstad (Stockholm, Sweden).
