<p class="p">The volume of biogas production was recorded continuously by an Automatic Methane Potential Testing System (AMPTS, Bioprocess Control AB, Lund, Sweden). The biogas composition was analyzed using gas chromatography. The liquid and gas sampling were performed 3–4 times a week. The liquid samples were kept at −20 °C until the analyses were performed.</p>
