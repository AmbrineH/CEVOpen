The first-stage of the systems were STR bioreactors with 2 L volume while the second-stage was a up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) bioreactor with 0.4 L volume containing flocculated microorganism. The slurry outlet of the first-stage passed a rotary drum filter (Steadfast Equipment, Howell, NJ, USA) containing a polyamide cartridge with pore size of 70 µm to separate liquid from remaining solid particles. The solid particles (retentate) was discharged from filter, while the liquid part was fed into the UASB (second-stage) bioreactors. Both systems were fed with citrus wastes. The differences between the two systems was whether the effluent of the second-stage was fed back to the first stage bioreactor or not (conferatur
