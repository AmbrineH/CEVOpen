<p class="p">For the system with effluent recycling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03380-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A), the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the first-stage reactor was 15 days. Prior to feeding, the citrus waste was diluted with effluent from second-stage reactor until the volume reached 100 mL. At the beginning of the experiment (day 0), the OLR was started at 1 g VS/(L·day) and then increased step wise into OLR of 5 g VS/(L·day) during day 0 until day 47. The digestate from first-stage was filtered using rotary drum filter. In the second-stage reactor, the HRT was set at 3 days to adapt the microorganisms. Afterwards, it was shortened step wise into 1.5 days by increasing the volume of the feeding. The whole experiment was carried out in 120 days. The two-stage digestion without recirculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03380-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B) was carried out as the same procedure including the HRT, OLR, and filtration. The difference was the liquid that used for diluting the citrus waste was water (not the effluent from second-stage). The liquid from the second-stage was discharged from the system. The whole experiment was carried out in 120 days.
