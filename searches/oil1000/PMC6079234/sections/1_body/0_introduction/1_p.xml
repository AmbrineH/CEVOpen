<p class="p">Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi on agricultural products, which cause acute or chronic toxic effects in farm animals and humans called mycotoxicosis (Schirone et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Du et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The contamination of agricultural products with fungi occurs during pre-and post-harvesting stages due to inappropriate and unhygienic practices (Bernhoft et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimate that ~25% of agricultural products are contaminated with fungi and mycotoxins worldwide (Pitt and Hockings, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The fungal infestation brings intolerable alterations in appearance, color, texture, flavor, and nutrition of food (Pitt and Hockings, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Therefore, the incidence of fungi and mycotoxins contamination in agricultural products have become one of the foremost issues of farmers, food industry, and government concerning the food safety (Annunziata et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Udomkun et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
