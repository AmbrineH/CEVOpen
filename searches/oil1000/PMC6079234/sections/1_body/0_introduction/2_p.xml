<p class="p">Among the mycotoxigenic fungi, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> has received a wide attention because of its ability to produce a variety of mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEA) under diverse climate conditions (Pasquali et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Several studies have addressed the toxic effects of DON and ZEA in 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in-vivo</italic> experiments and documented their genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, reproductive, and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, etc. (Zinedine et al.,
