<p class="p">The DON and ZEA have been detected in wide range of agricultural commodities, such as barley, corn, corn silage, hay, oats, rice, sesame seed, sorghum, and wheat (CAST, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Zinedine et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Particularly, Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley, and Gibberella ear rot in maize caused by 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> is a devastating plant disease of temperate regions and results in yield loss and mycotoxins contamination (Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Most lately, Xu et al. (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) from North China Plain have detected as high as 95.7% of maize germ contamination with DON and measured average attendance of DON in processed products of maize germs as 163.7–1175.2 μg/kg. In Hungary, Tima et al. (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) have surveyed the occurrence of DON in maize, wheat and its by-products during the period 2008–2015 and noticed overall mean of 2,159 ± 2,818 μg/kg, which was annoyingly much higher than maximum allowed limit. Besides, Mallmann et al. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) have summarized the occurrence of DON and ZEA in barley and wheat grains of Southern Brazil during the middle of 2008–2015 and noticed 67% of DON and 41% of ZEA contamination. Similarly, Tralamazza et al. (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) have observed 99% of DON and 84% of ZEA contamination in wheat samples originated from Brazil. Also, Ji et al. (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) have detected 74.4% of wheat contaminated with DON in the FHB epidemic region of Jiangsu province, China. In our previous study (Mudili et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) 72–94 μg/kg of DON in freshly harvested maize grains from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states of Southern India was noticed. Furthermore, Mishra et al. (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) have also measured the exposure and risk assessment of DON in the Indian individuals, and DON was identified in 30% of cereal samples and in that 7% of samples were surpassed the FSSR (Food Safety and Standard Regulation, India) limit of 1 mg/kg. In this context, 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> and its toxins, DON, and ZEA have a great threat to the agricultural and food industry, especially in warm, and humid climate country like India (Ramana et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Mishra et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Divakara et al.,

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Aiyaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In this scenario, there is a need to develop safe strategies to combat the problems of mycotoxigenic
