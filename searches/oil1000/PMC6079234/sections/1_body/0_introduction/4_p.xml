<p class="p">Since last decade, agriculture and food industry have applied various decontamination practices to safeguard the agricultural products from fungi and mycotoxins (Zinedine et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kanapitsas et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Kalagatur et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). Unfortunately, some methods were undesirable, and only few of them were acceptable by WHO, FAO, EU, JECFA, and other regulatory agencies with some constraints. The application of synthetic fungicidal agents could drive the drug-resistant fungi, environmental pollution, health risk in animals and humans, and its use in food has been not passable and restricted worldwide (Kretschmer et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Henceforth, there is a huge demand for bio-fungicides as an alternative to synthetic fungicidal agents (Akocak et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; George et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Iram et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Sellamani et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Kalagatur et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Muniyandi et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). On the other hand, chemical decontamination methods bring unacceptable changes in the nutritional, sensory, and functional qualities of food and produce adverse toxic residues (Pitt and Hockings, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The physical decontamination methods are most potent due to its spontaneous and strong effects. Particularly, radiation treatment is substantially efficient decontamination technique. The WHO and FDA of the United Nations have recognized that under well-established Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) the application of Î³-radiation in a low dose for disinfestations and enhancement of shelf life of agricultural commodities is nutritionally adequate and acceptable (Calado et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, a combination of biological and physical decontamination methods is likely to be a safe and much effective in controlling the fungal growth and mycotoxins content.
