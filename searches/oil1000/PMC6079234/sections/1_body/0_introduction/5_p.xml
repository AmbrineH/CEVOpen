<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, the combinational inhibitory action of essential oil and γ-radiation on the growth rate, production of DON and ZEA by 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> has been not reported earlier. Therefore, the present study was aimed to establish the combinational inhibitory effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Hedychium spicatum</italic> L. essential oil (HSEO) and radiation for the aforementioned purposes. The 
 <italic class="italic">H. spicatum</italic> is a hardy and small perennial plant that belong to family Zingiberaceae and popularly known as “perfume ginger” or “spiked ginger lily” (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). The HSEO is a rich source of diverse medicinal compounds, and it is widely used in herbal medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including nausea, stomachache, dysentery, local inflammations, asthma, bad breath, bronchitis, and rheumatic problems (Koul et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The HSEO was obtained from rhizomes by hydrodistillation technique and its chemical profile was revealed by GC-MS analysis. The discrete inhibitory action of HSEO and radiation on the growth rate, production of DON, and ZEA by 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was evaluated in maize grains. Their combinational inhibitory action on aforementioned purposes was evaluated by response surface model adopting central composite design (CCD) and obtained model was validated experimentally.
