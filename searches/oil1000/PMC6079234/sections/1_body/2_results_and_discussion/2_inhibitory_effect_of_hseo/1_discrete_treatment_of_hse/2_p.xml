<p class="p">Best of our knowledge, till the date, the fungicidal activity of HSEO on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was not reported, and this is the first report. On the other hand, Pawar and Thaker (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) has determined the antifungal activity of HSEO on 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> by a zone of inhibition assay as 8 mm. The growth inhibitory activity of radiation treatment on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was less investigated. In support of our study, very few reports are available on the application of radiation treatment in the management of 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> in food and feed matrices. Aziz et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) have reported the complete inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. growth at 4 kGy in barley and 6 kGy in wheat and maize grains. On the other hand, Ferreira-Castro et al. (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) and Lima et al. (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) have documented that high dose of 10 kGy radiation treatment was required for complete reduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. in maize and cowpea bean grains, respectively. The radiation dose required for reduction of fungal growth depends on certain factors, such as the type of species, population number, intensity of pigmentation, water content, genetics, and induction of protective enzymes, which play a major role in the regaining of the damage induced by radiation (Jeong et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the present study, the background microbial flora of maize grains was removed by autoclave sterilization and which could affect the texture of the grains and have an impact on the results. Therefore, the differences in the radiation dose required for complete reduction of fungal growth were noticed in present and previous studies.
