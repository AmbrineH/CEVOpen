<p class="p">In the present study, discrete treatment of HSEO and radiation were effective in reducing the fungal growth (log CFU), production of DON and ZEA by 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> in maize grains. A quantity of 5.79 ± 0.33 of log CFU/g, 6.24 ± 0.37 of DON (μg/g), and 8.67 ± 0.45 of ZEA (μg/g) were determined in the control sample. While, log CFU, DON, and ZEA content were reduced in test samples in a dose-dependent way with treatment of HSEO and radiation (Tables 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content were not detected at 3.15 mg/g of HSEO and 6 kGy of radiation. The linear regression curves for reductions of log CFU, DON, and ZEA content were constructed against different doses of HSEO and radiation (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). The obtained regression models exhibited the goodness of fit (

 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). The regression models confirmed that reductions of log CFU, DON, and ZEA content by HSEO and radiation were dose-dependent.
