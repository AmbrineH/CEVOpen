<p class="p">The correlation matrix of regression coefficients of independent factors was correlated with one another on a scale of perfect negative correlation (−1) to perfect positive correlation (+1) as per Pearson's correlation coefficients to conclude their appropriateness. The perfect negative correlated matrix was appropriate and agrees to the individual effect of independent factors on responses (Anderson and Whitcomb, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In the present study, a perfect negative correlation matrix was observed for both independent factors (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). A perfect negative correlation matrix of − 0.680 and − 0.602 (log CFU), − 0.681 and − 0.625 (DON), and − 0.679 and − 0.632 (ZEA) were observed for HSEO and radiation treatments, respectively. It indicated that independent factors were independently effective in reducing the log CFU, DON, and ZEA. These results were in accordance with the assessment of the discrete inhibitory effect of HSEO and radiation treatments on the reductions of log CFU, DON, and ZEA content (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). Therefore, the combinational assessment of HSEO and radiation treatments for the aforementioned purposes were well appropriate and could reveal newer insights. Consequently, combinational treatments of HSEO and radiation were highly effective in reducing the log CFU, DON, and ZEA content in maize grains. The complete reductions of fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content were noticed at combination of 1.89 mg/g of HSEO and 4.12 kGy of radiation treatments (
