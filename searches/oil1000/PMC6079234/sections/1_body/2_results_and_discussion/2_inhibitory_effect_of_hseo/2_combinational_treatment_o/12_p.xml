<p class="p">Henceforth, combined treatments of HSEO and radiation presented a superior antifungal efficiency on

Moreover, many reports showed that the combinational treatment of essential oils with radiation up to a dose of 10 kGy do not produce any significant changes in the quality and quantity of essential oils and not produce any toxic residues (Chatterjee et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Haddad et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Consequently, functional features of essential oils do not effect on exposure to radiation and acceptable by Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology (IFST), WHO, FAO, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and consumer (Lacroix and Ouattara, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; IAEA, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Maherani et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Henceforth, the proposed novel combinational exposure of HSEO and radiation could be highly acceptable and efficient for reductions of fungal growth and mycotoxins in food and feed matrices and thereby support in obtaining the highly microbiological safe food products. Though, a greater understanding of the combinational antifungal activity of essential oils and radiation is required at the cellular and molecular level to exploit underlying the molecular death machinery.
