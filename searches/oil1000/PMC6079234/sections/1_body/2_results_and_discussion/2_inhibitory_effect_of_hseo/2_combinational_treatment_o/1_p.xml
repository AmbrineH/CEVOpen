<p class="p">Radiation process is measured as an ideal and beneficial decontamination technique at a low dose. High radiation dose produces intolerable features and toxic substances in food, such as structural and chemical changes, nutritional and sensory loss, undesirable odor and flavor, and rancidity (Calado et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, minimally radiation processed foods are highly preferred and acceptable by consumer and regulatory bodies. In this context, food industry and food technologists have made many efforts through last decade to reduce the efficient radiation dosage rate and augment the decontamination efficiency of radiation. Currently, combining radiation with other decontamination agents, such as essential oils, chemical preservatives, and modified atmospheres is an effective and innovative way to improve the decontamination efficiency of radiation (Ghosh et al.,

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The combinational approach reduces the possible means radiation dose required for decontamination of microbial flora and could promote food safety at low radiation dosage.
