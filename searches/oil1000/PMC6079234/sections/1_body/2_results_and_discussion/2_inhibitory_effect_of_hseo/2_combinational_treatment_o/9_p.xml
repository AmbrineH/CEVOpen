<p class="p">The significance of the second-order polynomial model was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and coefficient of determination (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup>). The ANOVA results for the fitted quadratic polynomial models of log CFU, DON, and ZEA were presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T9" ref-type="table" class="xref">9</xref>, respectively. For any of the terms in the model, a greater 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value and smaller 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value would indicate a more significant effect on the respective response variables (Atkinson and Donev, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>). The present model has larger 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value of 251.61 (log CFU), 335.88 (DON), and 229.45 (ZEA) and the associated 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.0001 and implied that the optimized models were very significant. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of the lack of fit were 4.44 and 0.0918 for log CFU, 2.37 and 0.2120 for DON, 2.24 and 0.2255 for ZEA, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="T10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). Which indicated that lack of fit was not significant and 9.18%, 21.20%, and 22.55% chance could occur due to noise in log CFU, DON, and ZEA, respectively. The goodness of fit of the models was judged by estimating the coefficient of determination (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup>). The value of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup> for log CFU, DON, and ZEA were observed as 0.9945, 0.9958, and 0.9939, respectively. Which implies that 99.45%, 99.58%, and 99.39% of the variations could be explained by the fitted models of log CFU, DON, and ZEA, respectively. For a good statistical model, the predicted R-squared value should be close to adjusted R-squared value and the obtained differences in all the responses of the present study were appropriate (Table 
 <xref rid="T10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). Also, adequate precision should be &gt;4.0 is desirable for the significant model and adequate precision of 52.343 (log CFU), 60.519 (DON), and 50.190 (ZEA) in the present study indicates an adequate signal and the obtained models were well appropriate to navigate the design space (Table 
 <xref rid="T10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>).
