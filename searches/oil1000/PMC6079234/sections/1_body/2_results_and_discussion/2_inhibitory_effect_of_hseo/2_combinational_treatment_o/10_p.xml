<p class="p">The diagnostic and correlation plots were judged to endorse the obtained significance of ANOVA. The normal plot residuals of normal % probability vs. externally studentized residuals were constructed to illustrate the accuracy of optimized design (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). The distribution of externally studentized residuals was satisfactorily followed the normal distribution. Which indicated that residuals plots follow linear behavior and the predicted model is accurate (Myers et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). A Box-Cox plot for power transforms of responses were considered to determine the most appropriate power law transformation to fit the responses. The best recommended transform (λ) of 0.80, 0.94, and 0.91 were observed for log CFU, DON, and ZEA, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). The obtained λ values were close to the current value of 1 for none and which indicates that responses were well fitted by the optimized design (Box and Cox, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1964</xref>). The optimized designs were assessed to examine the correlation between the actual and predicted responses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). The obtained data points were close to the straight line and presented a good correlation coefficient (

 </sup>). The correlation curves suggested a high degree correlation of 0.9945, 0.9958, and 0.9939 between the actual and predicted values of the log CFU, DON, and ZEA, respectively and concluded that the fundamental assumptions of the analysis were well appropriate. The fitted polynomial equation was expressed as 3D surface plots to illustrate the interactive effects of the independent variables on the responses and to deduce optimum conditions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). In conclusion, appropriateness of the optimized model for predicting the optimum responses was verified with suggested optimum conditions. The obtained actual values of suggested experiments were found in agreement with the predicted values (Table 
 <xref rid="T11" ref-type="table" class="xref">11</xref>). The complete reductions of fungal growth (log CFU), DON, and ZEA content were noticed in maize grains at combinational treatment of 1.89 mg/g of HSEO and 4.12 kGy of radiation. These results suggested that the designed quadratic models for reductions of log CFU, DON, and ZEA content in maize grains were statistically significant and could adequately represent the real interdependence of factors chosen (HSEO and radiation).
