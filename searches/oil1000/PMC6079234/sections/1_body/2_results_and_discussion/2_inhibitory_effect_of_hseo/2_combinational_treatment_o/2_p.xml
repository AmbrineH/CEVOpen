 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The RSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques, and one of the widely used applications in the design, development, and invention of new process or products, and improvement of an existing process or product designs in food science and technology. The RSM requires only a minimal number of experiments between input variables that potentially influence performance measures or quality characteristics of the product or process and allow to identify breakthrough productive information by means of reducing cost, errors, and disturbance. The relations between the input factors and responses were hypothesized or assessed by choosing a model (Whitcomb and Anderson,
