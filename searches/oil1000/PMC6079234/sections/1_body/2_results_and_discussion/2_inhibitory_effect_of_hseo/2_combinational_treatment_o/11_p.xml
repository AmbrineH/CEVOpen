<p class="p">The present study concluded that combinational exposure of HSEO and radiation on the reductions of fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content by 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> in maize grains was highly efficient compared to their discrete exposure. In combinational approach, radiation dose required for complete reductions of fungi and mycotoxins were reduced from 6 kGy (discrete treatment) to 4.12 kGy. Which indicated that radiation treatment with the combination of HSEO was highly efficient and minimally radiation processed compared to unaccompanied treatment of radiation. However, structural, chemical and nutritional changes of maize grains were not determined in the present study. In support of our study, earlier reports demonstrated that essential oils with a combination of modified atmosphere packaging, mild heat treatment, and radiation were highly effective and safe in maintaining the microbiological safety of the food (Hossain et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Several studies noticed that antifungal activity of essential oils is reliant on chemical constituents and their synergistic action (Hyldgaard et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; da Cruz Cabral et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In our study, varieties of chemical compounds were noticed in HSEO (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and the attributed antifungal activity of HSEO against 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> could be due to individual and combination of action of 1,8-cineole, linalool, β-pinene, limonene, germacrene-D, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, α-terpinene, and α-terpineol (Velluti et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Van Vuuren and Viljoen, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Deba et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Chee et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Vilela et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). These compounds could alter the integrity of cell membrane and disturb the membrane fluidity, osmotic balance, enzymatic functions, and leak cytoplasmic contents of the cell. These cascade of events stops the ATP synthesis, growth and proliferation of fungi, and activates the caspase-mediated apoptotic death by releasing the mitochondrial cytochrome c and death receptors (Ramsdale, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Usta et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In case of radiation treatment, radiolysis of cellular water of organisms produces positive-charged water radicals (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) and negative-charged free electrons (e
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>), and a series of cross-combination and recombination reactions generate highly reactive molecules (de Campos et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Le Caër, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). These molecules attack and cleave hydrogen from sugar and bases of nuclear material, and destruct the other cellular components, i.e., protein and lipids and even damage the integrity of cellular membranes. This process inhibits spore germination and biomass production and promotes the death of fungi (Calado et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
