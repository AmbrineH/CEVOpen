<p class="p">In the present study, the chemical composition of HSEO was revealed by GC-MS and a total of 48 compounds were identified constituting to 96.84% of total weight (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The major compounds were 1,8-cineole (23.15%), linalool (12.82%), β-pinene (10.06%), γ-terpinene (8.16%), terpinolene (5.04%), α-terpinene (3.81%), and α-terpineol (3.35%). In our study, β-eudesmol, furanoid, β-himachalene, hedycaryol, eremoligenol, agarospirol, 8-epi-β-bisabolol, and α-cadinol were not detected in accordance with the previous reports of Joshi et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Sabulal et al. (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). While, diverse compounds, such as terpinolene, α-terpinyl acetate, γ-eudesmol, and γ-muurolene were identified in our study. The chemical compounds and their concentration of essential oil depend on the genetics of plant, part of the plant used, geographical origin, nutrients, harvesting time, and analytical method employed (Gobbo-Neto and Lopes, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, in our study chemical compounds and their concentration values were varied in comparison to the previous reports.
