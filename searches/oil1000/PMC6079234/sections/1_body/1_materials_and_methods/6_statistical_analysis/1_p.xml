<p class="p">The experiments were performed in six independent replicates. The statistical analysis was done according to the one-way ANOVA and significant differences were determined by Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test and value of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis and graphical illustrations were attained adopting the software program GraphPad Prism trial version 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). The statistical analysis for the optimization of RSM was done by CCD following the Stateâ€“Ease Design-Expert trial version 10 software program (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA). The responses of the polynomial regression at a significance level of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered to design statistical model (Anderson and Whitcomb,
