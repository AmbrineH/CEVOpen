<p class="p">The fungal growth in maize grains was determined as per methodology of Aziz et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) with minor modifications. Following the incubation period, 10 g of maize grains were collected from the plastic bags and suspended in 90 mL of sterile peptone water and mixed for 15 min at 140 – 160 rpm in a rotary shaker. The decimal dilutions were prepared in sterile peptone water and spread plated on SDA plates and incubated at 28°C for 3 days. The fungal growth was determined in colony forming units (CFU) and results were expressed in log CFU/g.
