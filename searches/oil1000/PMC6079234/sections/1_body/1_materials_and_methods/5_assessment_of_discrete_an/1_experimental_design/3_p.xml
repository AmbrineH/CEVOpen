<p class="p">The combinational inhibitory effect of HSEO and radiation (independent factors) on the reductions of CFU, DON, and ZEA content (response factors) was assessed by polynomial regression analysis of RSM. The lower and higher range of HSEO (0–3.15 mg/g) and radiation treatments (0–6 kGy) was fixed based on the dose required for complete inhibition of fungal growth and mycotoxins as per the study of their discrete exposure. The coded factors, name, units, range, levels, mean, and standard deviation of independent variables were shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref>. The order of experiments within the block was randomized and executed independently for six times. The regression analysis of attained responses i.e. log CFU, DON, and ZEA were assessed by fitting with suitable models represented by the second-order polynomial equation.
