<p class="p">The fungal spore suspension of 10 μL (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> spores per mL) was diluted to 1 mL with sterile peptone water solution and aseptically inoculated to the grain samples and mixed for 15 min at 140–160 rpm in a rotary shaker (Aziz et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Following, grain samples were separately exposed to different doses of HSEO and radiation treatments to evaluate their discrete inhibitory effect. The HSEO was directly applied to maize grains and thoroughly vortexed and mixed for 15 min at 140–160 rpm in a rotary shaker as per methodology of Velluti et al. (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). The combinational exposure of HSEO and radiation treatments with distinctive doses was accomplished by CCD of the response surface methodology (RSM) statistical program adopting State–Ease Design-Expert version 10.0.6.0 software application (Anderson and Whitcomb, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In this study, grain samples initially treated with a distinctive concentration of HSEO were exposed to different doses of radiation treatment as per CCD. The grain samples were incubated for 14 days at water activity of 0.70 and temperature of 28°C. The sample unexposed with HSEO and radiation treatments were referred as a control. Following the incubation period, the growth of fungi, quantification of DON, and ZEA were determined by colony forming units (CFU) and UHPLC, respectively.
