<p class="p">Following the incubation period, 25 g maize grains were collected from the test samples and ground to a fine powder under aseptic conditions and suspended in 250 mL solution of acetonitrile and water (v/v, 6:4). The blend was mixed for 15 min at 140–160 rpm and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to clean-up with immunoaffinity columns of DON and ZEA in according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Vicam, Waters business, USA). The quantification DON and ZEA were done as per our previous reported methodology (Mudili et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kalagatur et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) using UHPLC system (Nexera, Shimadzu, Japan). The quantification of DON and ZEA was deducted from their respective standard calibration curve and concentration was expressed in μg/g.
