  <p class="p"> This study investigates the antibacterial effect of essential oil extracted from the gum of
   <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica</italic> against
   <italic class="italic"> Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and histological evaluation of an experimental gel of the extract in wound healing in the back subcutaneous tissue of Wistar rats.

  <title class="title"> Methods</title>
  <p class="p"> Clinical strains of bacteria obtained from subgingival plaque samples of individuals having periodontitis, isolation, and confirmation were done by conventional microbiological tests and molecular technique. Essential oil was extracted by using hydrodistillation method; antibacterial activity has been determined by two fold serial dilution method. Histological evaluation conducted on fifteen Wistar rats. Incisions were made on the dorsal surface of each animal for implanting of 3 polysilicone tubes (empty, tetracycline gel, and the experimental gel). After 1, 4, and 8 weeks, the animals were euthanized and the specimens were prepared histologically.</p>

  <title class="title"> Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p"> The extract was able to pose inhibitory and bactericidal activity against
   <italic class="italic"> P. gingivalis</italic> and the experimental gel was able to have a good wound healing that enable it to be considered as a compatible material.
