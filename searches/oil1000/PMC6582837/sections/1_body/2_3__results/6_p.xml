<p class="p">Histological analysis of healed wound area in the control group at 8 weeks after wounding revealed early remodeling phase, wounds are fully reepithelialized with minimum keratinization, scar tissue formed with marked intensity and loaded with the mild infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts), and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers were also observed (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(c)</xref>), while in treated groups the wound showed late stage of remodeling phase with full maturation of the wound, and the final steps of dermal reorganization are proceeding but with the variable levels; for instance, in tetracycline-treated group, the mature wound showed well-organized epidermis with dermal papillae development, while the scar intensity ranged from mild-moderate and minimum degree of inflammatory cells infiltration and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(d)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(f)</xref>), in comparison to the
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(g)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6(i)</xref>); reepithelialization was markedly completed and tissue regeneration had better quality, the mature wound revealed the remodeling phase including normal thickness of epidermis and keratinization and mild-moderate scar tissue intensity with mild numbers of inflammatory cells with well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers in the dermal layer, but the cutaneous annexes do not appear.
