 <italic class="italic">Assessment of the Inflammatory Reaction or Process in the Opening Tube Site</italic>. The statistical analysis of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear inflammatory cells at three different durations among variable groups was showed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In control group the raising of inflammatory reaction surrounding the open tube by increasing the mean numbers and scores of polymorphonuclear inflammatory with scores 1 and 0 for neutrophil (4.800±2.65) and eosinophil (2.00±1.15), respectively, was demonstrated, but the differences were significant only for eosinophil; mononuclear inflammatory cells showed a highly significant with scores 3, 0, and 3 for the lymphocytes, plasma, and macrophages cells in the first week, whereas the mean number of the inflammatory cells in the tetracycline-treated group was maintained on the same level with exception of eosinophil increased to 4.20±3.55, and the plasma cells slightly decreased (1.50±1.26), while the scores for the each cells were 1 and 1 for the polymorphonuclear cell and 3, 0, and 3 for the mononuclear inflammatory cells that showed significant effect. In the
 <italic class="italic"> P. atlantica kurdica</italic> oil treated group the inflammatory cells significantly increased in comparison to the control and tetracycline-treated groups that showed significant values with scores of 1 and 3 for the neutrophils and eosinophils and also 3, 0, and 3 for the mononuclear inflammatory cells with exception of the plasma cells (0.80±0.91) and macrophages (10.50±4.85) were dropped.
