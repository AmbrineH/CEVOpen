 <italic class="italic">Histopathological Evaluations of Cutaneous Incised Wound Healing</italic>. The histological evaluation of healed wound area at 1 week after wounding revealed granulation phase or inflammatory phase, for instance, the cutaneous wound, did not close completely and showed a scab formed by necrotic tissue remnants, fibrin, and polymorphonuclear cells infiltration with marked inflammatory cell infiltration in dermis and hypodermis in control group. Additionally, collagen fibers were seen in disorganized arrangement with fibroblast proliferation seen in the dermal layer (Figures

A clear line of demarcation seen between scab and dermis under the necrotic tissue in a tetracycline-treated group in which the wound closed if compared to the control group, moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells in epidermis extends to dermis and hypodermis with the presence of newly formed collagen fibers and fibroblast proliferation (Figures

 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group the demarcation line was completely clear, and the wound more progressed in healing if compared to the control and tetracycline groups, the fibrin net was rich in PMNs. The regeneration of the epidermis was completely started; moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts were obvious. Angiogenesis was observed, but the number of fibroblasts increased in the dermis near the wounded area with new collagen formation (Figures
