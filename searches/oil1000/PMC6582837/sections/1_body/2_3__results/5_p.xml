<p class="p">At 4 weeks after wounding, more progress in wound healing (proliferative phase) was apparent; in the control group an early phase of reepithelization process was seen; the immature-hyperplastic and disorganized epidermis superimposing the area of the wound increased in thickness of dermal layer by deposition of unorganized collagen fibers as a bundles or individual with fibroblast proliferation (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(c)</xref>). While late phase of the reepithelization process was seen in treated groups, for example, reepithelialization was markedly completed and tissue regeneration had better quality, collagen fibers were thicker and denser in the tetracycline-treated group (Figures
