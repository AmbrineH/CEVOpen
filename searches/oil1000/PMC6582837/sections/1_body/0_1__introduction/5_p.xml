<p class="p">The data concerning the efficacy of this extracted oil against periopathogens is limited. The objective of this work is to determine the antibacterial activity of the extracted essential oil from
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum against the growth of clinical isolates of
 <italic class="italic"> Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and evaluate a histopathological examination of experimental gel of essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum in the back subcutaneous tissue of Wistar rats. The tissue inflammatory reaction surrounding the opening of the experimental gel was compared with an empty tube (control negative) and tetracycline gel (control positive) was used to determine biocompatibility of the tested material.
