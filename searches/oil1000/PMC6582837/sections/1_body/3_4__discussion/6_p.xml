<p class="p">Histological findings of this study on 1 week showed that the tissue regeneration is much better in skin wounds treated with tetracycline and
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica</italic> gum oil than in control skin wounds. Although these results were based on the profitable effects of the both treated materials on the morphology of dermal wound healing, yet the newly synthetized collagens were still unorganized and distributed randomly in all rats at this stage. In the current study better healing progression in rat of
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group due to the presence of phenols and flavonoids that reduce the lipid peroxidation and can improve vascularity, collagen synthesis promotes cross linking of collagen because the Pistacia phenolics act as primary antioxidants or free radical scavengers and this finding in accordance with the previous studies that evaluated the histological examination of wound healing and indicated that the phenolics component of the
