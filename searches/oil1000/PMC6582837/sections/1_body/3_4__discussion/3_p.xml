<p class="p">GC-MS analyses of the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum revealed that 79.76% of essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum grown in Kurdistan, Iraq, was alpha-Pinene and this finding is consistent with [
