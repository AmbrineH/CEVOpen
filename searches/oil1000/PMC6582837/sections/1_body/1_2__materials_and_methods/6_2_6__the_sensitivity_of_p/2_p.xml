<p class="p">To each of the above 12 prepared MIC tubes with varying concentrations, 100
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of bacterial suspension (5
 <italic class="italic">∗</italic>10 CFU/ml) prepared earlier was added to the tubes; thus the final volume was 1100
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L per tube. Tubes were sealed with cotton and incubated for ≥48 h at 37°C in an anaerobic jar by using AnaeroGen® system Oxoid gas pack and observed for turbidity. The minimum concentration of the essential oil in the tube which does not show any turbidity is considered as the MIC of the extract. Turbidity of the MIC tube indicated growth of the bacteria expressed that the bacteria are resistant to a tested agent.
