<p class="p">At 1, 4, and 8 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and the cutaneous incised wounds were separated. All skin tissue specimens were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for at least 24 hrs, at room temperature. After fixation, the skin sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue slices of 4 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m thickness were attained and stained using the standard H and E technique, mounted on glass slides, and visualized by light microscopy. Histopathological examinations were performed in double-blind fashion, under a microscope from 40X to 400X magnifications. Inflammatory cells were quantitatively assessed in the site of the opening tube in the subcutaneous tissue that contained treated product or was empty in the case of the control group, in 2 arbitrarily chosen fields at 400X utilizing a light microscope (Leica Motic), connected with an image analyzer software (ToupTek, ToupView, 86X, 3.7.4183, 2014). For each area, a picture was captured and then partitioned into 16 squares (

Additionally, the counted inflammatory cells were calculated in each group for the three study durations. The inflammatory cells were scored and classified as follows: negative reaction or score 0 (0-25 inflammatory cells), mild or score 1 (26-50 inflammatory cells), moderate or 2 score (51-75 inflammatory cells), and severe or 3 score (more than 75 inflammatory cells).
