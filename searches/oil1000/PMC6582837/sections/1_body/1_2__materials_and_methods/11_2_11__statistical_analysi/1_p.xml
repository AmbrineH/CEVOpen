<p class="p">A statistical software package, SPSS (version 22.0, Chicago IL, USA), was used to perform statistical analysis. The statistical analysis of variation among the experimental groups was performed by One-way ANOVA, and in order to make a pairwise comparison between groups, we used Tukey's Test and also the Paired T test for the dependent variables to obtain separate averages for the polymorphonuclear and mononuclear inflammatory cells among the groups. Values were presented as mean Â± standard deviations (SD) and p &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.</p>
