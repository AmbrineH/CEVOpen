<p class="p">The determination of minimum bactericidal concentration was by choosing the concentrations that showed no bacterial growth during the evaluation of the MIC. For this, a sample was taken from the content of the chosen tubes by micropipette then spread on a blood agar plate using a sterile spreader and anaerobically incubated. After 48 h at 37Â°C, the plates were brought out and examined for bacterial growth; the plates that showed no growth of bacteria were identified as minimum bactericidal concentration. The experiments were repeated at least three times at each concentration and the modal values of MIC and MBC were selected.</p>
