<p class="p">The animals were anesthetized with a combination of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (3.3ml) and xylazine hydrochloride (2ml) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.05 mL/Kg/BW. The backs of the rats were shaved and disinfected with 0.12% chlorhexidine (Periogard; Pfizer Ltda, Santo Amaro, SP, Brazil). Four incisions were made in the dorsal surface of the rats (2 in the upper and 2 in the lower regions of the dorsum) using a sterile blade. The cutaneous tissues laterals to the incisions were twitched and dissection of the tissue was done using blunt-end scissors. Three tubes were applied or implanted in the back subcutaneous tissue of each animal: two tubes in the upper region (CN on the right of the incision and EG on the left) and one tube in the lower region (CP ). The borders of the incisions were sutured with nylon 5-0 (Ethicon; Johnson &amp; Johnson, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil).</p>
