<p class="p">Consisted of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95째C for 1 cycle followed by amplification step which was repeated for 35 cycle that consisted of denaturation of DNA template at 95째C for 30 seconds; annealing of specific primers (for annealing temperature see 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) for 30 sec, and extension of primers at 72째C for 30 sec., the final extension for 5 min in 72째C for 1 cycle in Thermo cycler PCR (Verity TM 96 well, Applied Biosystem-USA) was done.
