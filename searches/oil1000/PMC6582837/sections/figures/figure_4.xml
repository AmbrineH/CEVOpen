  <p class="p">Light micrograph sections of cutaneous wound site at one week after wounding in different groups. (a)–(c) In the control group the wound did not close completely and the wound surface covered with scab and necrotic debris, marked infiltration of neutrophils (yellow star and black arrows) in the dermis with loss of matrix and disorganized collagen fibers (red head arrows, the proliferation of fibroblast as indicated by yellow head arrows). (d)–(f) Light micrograph sections in the tetracycline-treated group showed clear line of demarcation (black dash line); the fibrin and PMN cells bridged the whole incision, moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells in dermis and hypodermis (black arrows) with the proliferation of fibroblast and newly unorganized collagen formation. (g)–(i) In the
