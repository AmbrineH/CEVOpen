  <p class="p">Light micrograph sections of the cutaneous wound section at two months subsequently wounding. (a)–(c) In the control group the section showed the new uneven epidermis formed with a minimum keratinization thickness, moderate-marked density of scar tissue (yellow dash lines) in center of the wound with infiltration of inflammatory cells (black head arrows), and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers (red head arrows) with normal fibroblast morphology as indicated by yellow arrows. (d)–(f) Well-organized epidermis with mild keratinization, mild-moderate scar intensity (yellow dash lines) with minimum inflammatory cells infiltration and starting the appearance of rete ridges or dermal papillae, and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers with normal fibroblast features in the tetracycline-treated group. (g)–(i) The wound in

The scar tissue (yellow dash lines) at the center of wound is mild-moderate in density laden with mild inflammatory cells infiltration (red arrows); compact and regularly arranged collagen fibers (black head arrows) observed in dermis with normal fibroblast as indicated by yellow head arrows (H&amp;E stain, scale bar 100
