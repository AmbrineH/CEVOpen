 <p> Light micrograph sections of the cutaneous wound site at one month after wounding. (a)–(c) Early reepithelization by forming immature disorganized epidermis and completely closed the gap (red dash line), increased in thickness of dermal layer by of individual and bundle of collagen fibers (red head arrows) with proliferative fibroblasts as indicated by yellow arrows in the control group. (d)–(f) Typical hyperplastic-immature epidermis as indicated by red dash lines with increased in thickness of the dermal layer by intense, well arranged mature bundle of collagen fibers with proliferative fibroblasts in the tetracycline-treated group. (g)–(i) In the Pistacia atlantica Kurdica gum oil group the wound healing showed early reepithelization by forming immature disorganized epidermis (red dash line), increased in thickness of the dermal layer by great, mature bundle of collagen fibers with proliferative fibroblasts (H&amp;E stain, scale bar 100 μm, scale bar 50 μm, and scale bar 20 μm). </p>
