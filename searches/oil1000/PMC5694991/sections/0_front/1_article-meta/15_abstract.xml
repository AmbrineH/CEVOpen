 <p class="p">This is the first report evaluating the relationship between the chemical compositions of cumin seeds (based on the analysis of the content of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, protein, terpenic compounds, alcohol/phenols, aldehydes, and epoxides) and the induction efficiency of somatic embryogenesis in two Iranian superior cumin landraces (Golestan and North Khorasan). Cotyledons isolated from Golestan landrace seeds cultivated on MS medium supplemented with 0.1â€‰mg/L kinetin proved to be the best primary explant for the induction of somatic embryogenesis as well as the regeneration of the whole plantlet. Results indicated that different developmental stages of somatic embryos were simultaneously observed on a callus with embryogenic potential. The high content of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, and terpenic hydrocarbons and low content of alcoholic and phenolic compositions had a stimulatory effect on somatic embryogenesis. Band patterns of RAPD markers in regenerated plants were different from those of the mother plants. This may be related to somaclonal variations or pollination system of cumin. Generally, measurement of chemical compositions can be used as a marker for evaluating the occurrence of somatic embryogenesis in cumin. Also, somaclonal variations of regenerated plants can be applied by the plant breeders in breeding programs.</p>
