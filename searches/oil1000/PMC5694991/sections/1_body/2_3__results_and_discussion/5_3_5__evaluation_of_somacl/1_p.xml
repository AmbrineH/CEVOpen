<p class="p">Somaclonal variation is a common process in plants cell and tissue culture and was firstly introduced by Larkin and Scowcroft [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. This process has led to changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes and is of genetic and epigenetic nature [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Ten primers were initially used, 7 of which generated informative and reproducible bands (6–10 bands per primer), ranging from approximately 200 to more than 1000 bp in size. The 7 primers generated a total of 52 scorable bands, with an average of 7.4 per primer, which were polymorphic across all the analyzed in vitro regenerated plantlets originating from cotyledons of the mother plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). In the present study, RAPD markers suggested polymorphism bands between regenerated plants of Golestan landrace and seed plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). It may be said that the variation is associated with the heterozygous nature of the cumin landrace and its pollination system. Some studies suggest somatic variations in plants regenerated from tissue culture and some others suggest genetic stability [

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Bakhtiar et al. [

 <italic class="italic"> Thymus</italic> regenerated seedlings and seedlings from mother plant, found that RAPD marker suggests the presence of polymorphism bands among them.
