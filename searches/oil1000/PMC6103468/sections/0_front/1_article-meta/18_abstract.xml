 <p class="p">The increasing pressure of abolishing and/or decreasing the use of antibiotics as antimicrobial growth promoters for livestock calls for alternative solutions to sustain the efficiency of current livestock production. Among the alternatives, essential oils have a great potential and are generally considered natural, less toxic, and free from residues. Essential oils have been proven in numerous 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies to exert antimicrobial effects on various pathogens. The current review touched on the basics of essential oils, and the 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> effects of essential oils on growth, intestinal microflora, anti-oxidation, immune functionality, meat qualities as well as the possible modes of action in poultry and pigs, and the future research areas were proposed.
