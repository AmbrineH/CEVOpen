<p id="p0120" class="p">Some essential oils could influence the gut microflora selectively. A cocktail of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin increased the population of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacilli</italic> and the ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacilli</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteria</italic> in the jejunum (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo et al., 2006</xref>) of early-weaned piglets using qPCR method. This is in agreement with the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study results that cinnamaldehyde was highly inhibitory for coliform bacteria and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> while it hardly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacilli</italic> (

The antimicrobial activity of essential oils could also be exploited as a green preservative to prevent food from contamination of pathogens. Tuscan sausages treated with bay leaf essential oils showed reduced population of total coliforms (

 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antimicrobial effects, however, it is necessary to use 10 to 100-fold higher concentrations of an essential oil in foods (
