<p id="p0125" class="p">Essential oils could change the lymphocyte distribution in the gut. Since a cross talk between gut microbiota and the mucosal immune system is beneficial for a mutual growth and survival (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Purchiaroni et al., 2013</xref>), it is understandable to surmise that essential oils could leverage the development and function of the gut immune system via modifying the gut microflora, and/or the essential oils might be recognized as foreign stimulants and directly attacked by the immune system. A mixture of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin decreased the population of intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) in jejunum and ileum, but increased lymphocyte in the lamina propria of early-weaned pigs (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Manzanilla et al., 2006</xref>). Capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde might be responsible for the reduced IEL population in jejunum because of their inhibition of the activation or proliferation of T cells (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nofrarias et al., 2006</xref>). It is difficult to conclude whether these changes could be construed as beneficial for the gut immune system, because a healthy gut immune system calls for a delicate balance between recognizing threats such as pathogens followed by initiation of immune defense attacks and tolerating the non-threating foreign substances.
