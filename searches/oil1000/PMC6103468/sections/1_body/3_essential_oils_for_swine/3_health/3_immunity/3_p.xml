 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2012</xref>). An essential oil cocktail (250 mg/kg) consisting of oregano, clove, and cinnamon induced more lymphocytes against the non-specific mitogens, but not to the specific mitogen (

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Halas et al.

On the contrary, the essential oil failed to increase the serum IgG level in piglets (
