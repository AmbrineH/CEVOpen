<p id="p0100" class="p">The literature has registered several studies showing the improved digestibility of energy and nutrients with the supplementation of essential oils. Cinnamaldehyde and thymol (250 mg/kg) significantly improved apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, crude protein, and energy in piglets (

 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). The apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and most amino acids were improved by the cocktail of essential oils (300 mg/kg) with menthol as the primary component, but not by the cocktail with cinnamaldehyde (
