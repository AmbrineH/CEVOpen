<p id="p0095" class="p">The effects of essential oils on feed intake of pigs were ambiguous. Feed intake change relative to control due to dietary supplementation of essential oils ranged from −9% to 12% in the review of 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franz et al. (2010)</xref>, and a recent review by 
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zeng et al. (2015b)</xref> reported a range of −3% to 19%. These numerical changes derived mainly from growth performance trials might not qualify as evidence for the animal's preference or aversion to essential oils-supplemented feed because of the latent assumption that more feed should be consumed if it is desirable. The observed improvement in feed intake might be only affiliated to the improved growth rate of animals as commonly seen with most growth-promoting additives (

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Michiels et al. (2009)</xref>. Therefore, it is advisable to take cautions to judge the feeding preference from different types of animal trials, and more in-depth investigations are warranted to reconcile the incongruent results.
