<p id="p0145" class="p">It is generally accepted that lipid oxidation is mainly responsible for meat quality deterioration during storage. Oxygen availability is the most critical factor in the development of lipid oxidation (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jo et al., 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, protein oxidation increases meat product toughness, which is characterized by the oxidation of protein thiol and the resultant formation of myosin heavy chain disulfide cross-links (

The rosemary essential oil (150 mg/kg) significantly reduced the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hexanal, indicators of lipid oxidation, and carbonyl, an indicator of protein oxidation in White pigs, while higher levels of 300 and 600 mg/kg had no effect on lipid oxidation, but significantly enhanced the oxidation of proteins; for Iberian pigs, the inhibitory effects of rosemary essential oil were stronger at higher supplementary concentrations (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nieto et al. (2013)</xref> also showed essential oils of oregano and rosemary can protect the thiols in pork patties and reduce the cross-links of the myosin heavy chains, while essential oils of garlic exhibited the opposite effects.
