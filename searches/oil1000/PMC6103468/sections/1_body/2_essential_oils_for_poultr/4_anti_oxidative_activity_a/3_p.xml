 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Khan et al. (2012)</xref> showed that thyme oil is effective in retarding oxidant degradation in poultry-derived products, such as meat and eggs. The possible reason might be the antioxidant activity derived from the phenolic OH group which acts as a donor of hydrogen interacting with peroxy radicals during the initial process in lipid oxidation and thereby inhibiting or retarding the hydroxyl peroxide formation (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kohlert et al. (2000)</xref> reported that the metabolic fates of essential oils are chemical structure depended; essential oil components are quickly eliminated; and accumulation is unlikely due to the high clearance and short half-lives in human, which lends support to no residue of essential oils in animal products.
