<p id="p0055" class="p">Unlike feed intake, improvements in weight gain and feed conversion ratio dominate the observations. Two well-accepted mechanisms are the stimulation of digestive enzyme secretion and the stabilization of ecosystem of gut microflora, leading to improved feed utilization and less exposure to growth-depressing disorders associated with digestion and metabolism (

It is noteworthy that there is an inadequate description of the environmental conditions under which these trials were conducted, and poor hygienic conditions might be instrumental for essential oils to favorably affect the growth performance of broilers.
