 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hippenstiel et al., 2011</xref>) reported that feed intake in chicks was unchanged or slightly reduced by dietary inclusion of essential oils. For the decreased feed consumption, one possible explanation is that essential oils possess an irritating smell, which renders the palatability of diet disagreeable to birds. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Amad et al. (2011)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Halle et al. (2004)</xref> reported that daily feed intake of broilers was numerically decreased by increasing the dietary level of a blend of thyme, star anise, and origanum leaves, and its associated essential oils compared with control. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cabuk et al. (2006)</xref> noted a significantly reduced feed intake of broilers from young breeders by graded inclusion of a cocktail of essential oils (oregano oil, laurel leaf oil, sage leaf oil, myrtle leaf oil, fennel seed oil, and citrus peel oil). In contrast to pigs, information of poultry concerning feed preference was scarce. 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moran (1982)</xref> reported that poultry might not be sensitive to flavor as pigs, and 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Roura et al. (2008)</xref> reported that birds are more tolerant to exposure of moderate levels of essential oils than pigs.
