<p id="p0035" class="p">Essential oils account for only a small proportion (usually less than 1%) of the wet weight of plant materials, which makes it imperative to improve the yield of essential oils by continuous developments in relevant fields such as genetic engineering and extraction methods. These developments presented challenges to the concept of essential oils as well as the knowledge of biological activities of essential oils. For example, the steam-distilled essential oils from
