<p id="p0030" class="p">The composition of essential oils is primarily determined by the homogeneity of the starting materials, whose characteristics could be influenced by a plethora of factors. For example, the total content of monoterpene hydrocarbons (mostly γ-terpinene and ρ-cymene) and phenol terpenes (mostly thymol and carvacrol) ranges from 57.3% to 62.5% of the essential oils from a Thyme (
