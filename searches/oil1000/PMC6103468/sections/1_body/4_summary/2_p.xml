<p id="p0160" class="p">The success of essential oils depends on whether our knowledge of their actions is based on a solid scientific ground. This review shows that the positive effects of essential oils on the growth performance of poultry and pigs exist both abundantly and controversially, which makes the speculated underlying mechanisms further questionable. Firstly, more attention should be paid to dietary characteristics and experimental environments, and the description of the tested essential oils should be stricter. The description of the starting materials and extraction methods cannot guarantee the stable chemical composition of essential oils in animal trials, which should be further disclosed by analytical methods. These analytical results are essential for congregating the animal trial results and reconciling the conclusions. Secondly, the metabolism of essential oils should be better understood, which could cast light on the chemical forms and the locales in the animal body for the essential oils 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> or their derivative metabolites to present themselves, and consequently to connect to their declared benefits. Lastly, the evidence for the link between essential oils and animal health is not robust yet. Anecdotal evidence and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies could not warrant the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> effects of essential oils. The direct effects on gut microflora and the indirect effects via the gut-associated immune system should be further explored.
