 <p class="p">In this study, as part of our continuous search for environmentally-friendly antifoulants from natural resources, subergorgic acid (SA) was identified from the gorgonian coral 
  <italic class="italic">Subergorgia suberosa</italic>, demonstrating non-toxic, significant inhibitory effects (EC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.25 μg/mL, LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL) against the settlement of 
  <italic class="italic">Balanus amphitrite</italic>. To further explore the bioactive functional groups of SA and synthesize more potent antifouling compounds based on the lead SA, the structure-activity relationships of SA were studied, followed by rational design and synthesis of two series of SA derivatives (one being benzyl esters of SA and another being SA derivatives containing methylene chains of various lengths). Our results indicated that (1) both the double bond and ketone carbonyl are essential elements responsible for the antifouling effect of SA, while the acid group is not absolutely necessary for maintaining the antifouling effect; (2) all benzyl esters of SA displayed good antifouling effects (EC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranged from 0.30 to 2.50 μg/mL) with the most potent compound being 
  <bold class="bold">5</bold> (EC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.30 μg/mL, LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL), which was over four-fold more potent than SA; and (3) the introduction of a methylene chain into SA reduces the antifouling potency while the length of the methylene chain may differently influence the antifouling effect, depending on the functional group at the opposite site of the methylene chain. Not only has this study successfully revealed the bioactive functional groups of SA, contributing to the mechanism of SA against the settlement of 
  <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic>, but it has also resulted in the identification of a more potent compound 
  <bold class="bold">5</bold>, which might represent a non-toxic, high-efficiency antifoulant.
