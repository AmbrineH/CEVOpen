<p class="p">It was discovered that there was high amount of SA in 
 <italic class="italic">S. suberosa</italic> (10.5 mg/g dry weight of crude extract), allowing us to hypothesize that the SA might be the primary defensive chemical produced by the gorgonian as a natural antifoulant. Meanwhile, the procedure required for the SA isolation was relatively easy with only simple extractions and one-time column chromatography (CC) purification needed. In view of the rich presence and relatively easy preparation of SA from 
 <italic class="italic">S. suberosa</italic>, the potential of SA or its derivatives as novel antifoulants was attractive.
