<p class="p">The preliminary structure-activity relationship studies revealed that both the ketone carbonyl and double bond were essential groups responsible for antifouling effects with the methyl esterification of the acid group having negligible influence on the antifouling activity, focusing the following design and synthesis of SA derivatives on the modification of the acid group. According to the methods depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-sch002" class="xref">Scheme 2</xref>, using dry DMF as a solvent and K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> as a base, SA could react smoothly with varieties of benzyl halides to give desired benzyl esters with almost quantitive yields. Interestingly, as listed in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, all benzyl esters exhibited good antifouling effects against the settlement of B. amphitrite with EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranging from 0.30 to 2.50 μg/mL. The most effective compound was 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.30 ± 0.10 μg/mL), which contained a non-substituted benzyl group, indicative of the substituents around the benzene ring reducing the antifouling effect. Another interesting observation was that the substituted position on the benzene ring might influence the antifouling effect with the o or m substitution being less influential than p substitution. This observation was tentatively supported by the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values listed in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, in which compounds 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.20 ± 0.17 μg/mL), 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.26 ± 0.11 μg/mL), and 
 <bold class="bold">12</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 2.50 ± 0.18 μg/mL), all having p substitution, demonstrated much lower antifouling effects compared to the o or m substituted compounds 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.40 ± 0.12 μg/mL), 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.65 ± 0.13 μg/mL), and 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.61 ± 0.13 μg/mL). Furthermore, it looked like the type of substituents around the benzene ring might exhibit limited influence on antifouling activity, evidenced from the biological effects of pairs between 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> with 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> and between 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold> with 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>, with each pair containing different substituents while displaying almost the same antifouling potency. Notably, compound 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.28 ± 0.17 μg/mL), however, while having an o substituent on the benzene ring, displayed much lower potency compared to other o or m substituted compounds 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>, which might be due to steric effects induced by the bulky benzene ring. Therefore, based on these experimental results, we tentatively assumed that steric effects might highly influence the antifouling activity of benzyl esters of SA. Compound 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>, which bears a non-substituted benzene ring, occupies the least space and has the least steric effects and thus shows the best antifouling effect. To further support this assumption, compounds 
 <bold class="bold">13</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">14</bold>, which are very close to 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> in molecular size, were synthesized by replacement of starting material benzyl bromide with 2-(bromomethyl)pyridine and 4-(bromomethyl)pyridine, respectively. In good agreement with our assumption, these two pyridine-containing SA derivatives demonstrated excellent antifouling effects, with EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> being 0.32 ± 0.11 and 0.63 ± 0.12 μg/mL for 
 <bold class="bold">13</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">14</bold>, respectively. Worthy of note, as shown in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, is that compounds 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">14</bold> were non-toxic toward the larva B. amphitrite at concentrations up to 25 μg/mL, strongly supporting the potency of SA derivatives as environmentally-friendly antifoulants.
