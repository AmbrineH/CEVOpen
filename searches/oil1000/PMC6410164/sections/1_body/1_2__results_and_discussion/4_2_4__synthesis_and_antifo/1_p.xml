<p class="p">Methylene chains have been found within many antifouling compounds as a bioactive moiety [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Additionally, the functional groups -Br and -NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> have been found to be present in some potent antifoulants such as 2,4-dibromo-6-(2,4-dibromobenzyl)phenol [
 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and halaminol A [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, a spectrum of SA derivatives containing methylene chains of various lengths and -Br or -NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups were designed and synthesized to identify their influence on the antifouling activity of SA derivatives. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-sch003" class="xref">Scheme 3</xref>, using SA and dibromoalkanes of various lengths as starting materials, compounds 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">20</bold> were easily synthesized in good yields. In order to avoid the formation of dimers of SA, over four equivalents of dibromoalkane was used for each reaction. Compounds 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">20</bold> were then subjected to antifouling screening. Unfortunately, as revealed in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, none of these compounds exhibited better or comparable effects when compared with SA, with the activity following an order of 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 2.05 ± 0.16 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 2.48 ± 0.11 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">17</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 2.75 ± 0.13 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">18</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 7.51 ± 0.22 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">19</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt;25 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">20</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt;25 μg/mL). This order was correlated with the lengths of the methylene chains, with greater length resulting in less potency. Furthermore, another kind of methylene chain-containing compounds 
 <bold class="bold">21</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">26</bold>, which differ from 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">20</bold> mainly in the replacement of the -Br with the -NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> group, were designed and synthesized according to the procedure briefly depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-sch003" class="xref">Scheme 3</xref>. Firstly, SA was reacted with oxalyl chloride to give SA acid chloride, which was then directly reacted with series of diaminoalkanes of various lengths to give SA amides 
 <bold class="bold">21</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">26</bold>. The antifouling effects of 
 <bold class="bold">21</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">26</bold> were then screened, with results being reported in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Interestingly, all compounds 
 <bold class="bold">21</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">26</bold>, in addition to being less potent than SA, displayed antifouling effects in the order 
 <bold class="bold">26</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 4.50 ± 0.10 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">25</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 20.00 ± 0.15 μg/mL) &gt; 
 <bold class="bold">21</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">24</bold> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL), which is exactly opposite to the trend of compounds 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">20</bold>, with 
 <bold class="bold">26</bold>, which contains the longest methylene chain, exhibiting the best antifouling effect. The length of the methylene chain differently influenced the antifouling effect of these two kinds of SA derivatives, the assumed reason for which might be that -NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was more potent than -Br in interacting with the bonding protein of larva, including the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, based on these experimental results, it might be deduced that the introduction of a methylene chain into SA would result in a reduction in activity, while the length of the methylene chain might differently influence the antifouling effect depending on the functional group at the opposite site of the methylene chain.
