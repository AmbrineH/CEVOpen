<p class="p">Primarily, there are three functional groups present in SA: an acid, a ketone carbonyl, and a double bond. The modification procedures of these functional groups are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>. The esterification product 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> was readily obtained from SA using CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>I as a methylating reagent and K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> as a base. We then planned to directly reduce the ketone carbonyl of SA to a hydroxyl group with NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> or LiAlH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. Unfortunately, the reaction products were very complex, as indicated by TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) analysis, which might be attributable to the presence of the acid group. Just as we suspected, when starting from ester 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, the reductive reaction went very well with NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> to give 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>. Furthermore, LiOH (3eq)/TFH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O was used, trying to remove the protecting group methyl to give 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>. However, this reaction failed to go forward at 50 °C overnight with high amounts of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> left, making us turn to stronger reaction conditions and using 2 M NaOH at 85 °C overnight, which successfully furnished 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> in 94% yield. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> has been isolated from the Indian ocean gorgonian coral 
 <italic class="italic">S. suberosa</italic> previously [
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, this is the first report regarding its synthesis from SA. As for the modification of the double bond of SA, the Pd/C catalyzed hydrogenation was adopted, trying to saturate the double bond; this reaction, by contrast, failed to give the desired product with the starting material remaining unchanged. The Sharpless dihydroxylation reaction was then employed, attempting to modify the double bond into two hydroxyl groups, which also encountered failure, leaving SA unchanged. Fortunately, when using the strong oxidative reagent 30% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/TFA, the double bond of SA was successfully epoxidized to furnish 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> in good yield. The relative stereochemistry of the epoxide ring of 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> was determined as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, based on the NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum where H-9 was clearly correlated with the proton signals of the two methyls CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-13 and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-15 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-17-00101" class="xref">Supplementary Figures S1 and S13</xref>). With compounds 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> at hand, their antifouling effects against the settlement of B. amphitrite were tested and compared with those of SA. As shown in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, ester 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> maintained most of the antifouling activity of SA, with an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 3.16 ± 0.18 μg/mL, which was slightly less than that of SA (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.25 ± 0.14 μg/mL), indicating that the acid group is not absolutely necessary for maintaining the antifouling effect of SA. Meanwhile, similar to SA, compound 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> exhibited non-toxic effects toward tested larva with LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL. Surprisingly, after either the ketone carbonyl or the double bond group was modified, none of the obtained compounds 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> or 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> still exhibited antifouling activity at concentrations up to 25 μg/mL, clearly demonstrating that both the ketone carbonyl and the double bond groups are essential elements responsible for the antifouling effect. Based on these preliminary structure-activity relationship studies, the key pharmacophores of SA as a potent antifouling compound were experimentally determined, providing a basis for the rational design of more potent SA derivatives.
