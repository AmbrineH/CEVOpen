<p class="p">To a solution of SA (20 mg, 0.08 mmol) in DCM (1 mL, freshly distilled from CaH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), was added oxalyl chloride (17.5 μL, 0.20 mmol). The obtained mixture was then stirred under N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere at room temperature for 1 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo to remove the DCM and left oxalyl chloride to give the SA acid chloride, which was used directly for the next step directly. To the flask containing SA acid chloride was added 1 mL freshly distilled DCM, followed by diaminoalkane (0.4 mmol). The mixture was then stirred under N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere at room temperature for 10h and quenched with brine (5 mL). The mixture was then extracted with DCM (5 mL x 3), washed successively with brine (10 mL × 3) and water (10 mL × 3), dried over Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel CC (MeOH/DCM 3:97) to yield
