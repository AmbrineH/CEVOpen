<p class="p">To a solution of SA (15 mg, 0.06 mmol) in DMF (1 mL, freshly distilled from CaH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), was added K

 <bold class="bold">13</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">14</bold>, respectively. The obtained mixture was then stirred under N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere at 50 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched by brine (5 mL). The mixture was then extracted with DCM (5 mL × 3), washed successively with brine (10 mL × 3) and water (10 mL × 3), dried over Na
