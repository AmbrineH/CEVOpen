<p class="p">The antifouling activity was examined using cyprids of the barnacle 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> Darwin according to the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Briefly, adults of 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic>, collected from the intertidal zone in Hong Kong, were exposed to air for more than 6 h, and were then placed in a container filled with 0.22 µm filtered seawater (FSW) to release nauplii. The collected nauplii were raised to cyprid stage using the method described by Thiyagarajan et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Fresh cyprids were used in the test. Larval settlement assays were examined using 24-well polystyrene plates. The tested samples were first dissolved with small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted with FSW to achieve final concentrations at 25.0, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.57, 0.78, 0.39, 0.19, 0.1, and 0.05 µg/mL. About 15−20 competent larvae were added to each well containing 1 mL of test solution in triplicate, and wells containing only FSW, DMSO, and larvae served as a control. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 48 h. The effects of the test samples against biofouling were determined by examining the plates under a microscope to count settled, unsettled, and swimming larvae, and where appropriate, potential toxic effects were recorded. The number of settled larvae was expressed as a percentage of the total number of larvae per well. Three replicates of each treatment were performed. A concentration-response curve was then made and a trend line was constructed for each compound. EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was calculated as the concentration where 50% of the larval individual was inhibited to settle as compared to the control while LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was calculated as the concentration where 50% of the larval population was dead. In this study, the highest concentration tested for the toxicity of each compound toward the 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> was fixed at 25 µg/mL, partially due to limited amounts of compounds available after being used for the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> test, together with the unstable status and the limited availability of barnacle 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> which is highly sensitive to climate and environment changes. For the purposes of this study, adults of the barnacle 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> were scraped off from the concrete posts at a pier of Pak Sha Wan, Kowloon, Hong Kong (22°21′45″N, 114°15′35″E), where only limited quantity of 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> could be collected during the period of our experiment because of the relatively hot weather and artificial disturbing of nearby construction work.
