<p class="p">All reactions were carried out using commercially available starting materials or reagents unless otherwise stated. Optical rotations were measured on a WZZ-3A automatic polarimeter (Shanghai YiCe Apparatus &amp; Equipment co. LTD, Shanghai, China), NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury VX 300 spectrometer (Varian, Tokyo, Japan) or Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Berlin, Germany) using TMS as an internal standard, and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm relative to CDCl

High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were performed on a QSTAR XL mass spectrometry system (Applied Biosystem Co., Foster City, CA, USA) or on a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (ABSciex, Redwood City, CA, USA). Column chromatography (CC) was performed with silica gel (230–400 mesh, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC was carried out with an aluminum sheet precoated silica gel G
