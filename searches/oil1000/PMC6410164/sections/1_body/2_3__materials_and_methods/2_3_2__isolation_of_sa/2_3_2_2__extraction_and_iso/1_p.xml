 <italic class="italic">S. suberosa</italic> (6.5 kg, wet weight) were extracted with 95% ethanol (EtOH, 20 L × 3) three times (each time for 30 days) at room temperature. The EtOH extracts were concentrated under vacuum to give a brown gum (200 g, dried crude extract), which was partitioned between ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 1.5 L × 3) and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1.5 L). The EtOAc fraction (140 g) obtained was then subjected to CC on silica gel (700 g; 9.0 cm diam × 100.0 cm height), eluted with a step gradient of EtOAc in petroleum ether (PE) (10–100%), and then with MeOH-EtOAc (10–30%), to give 11 fractions (Frs. A-K) and yield the pure compound SA (2.1 g, 1.05% isolated yield from the dried crude extract, mainly from the 30% EtOAc/PE gradient). SA was obtained as white powder whose chemical structure was determined by spectroscopic methods (
