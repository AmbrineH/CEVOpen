<p class="p">As part of our continuous search for non-toxic yet high efficiency antifoulants from marine resources, the chemical composition of the gorgonian 
 <italic class="italic">S. suberosa</italic> has been systematically investigated, leading to the discovery of SA, which not only significantly inhibited the settlement of the barnacle 
 <italic class="italic">B. amphitrite</italic> (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.25 ± 0.14 μg/mL, LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL), but also showed rich abundance among the metabolites. This discovery allowed us to hypothesize that SA might be the primary defense chemical produced by the gorgonian as a natural antifoulant. Therefore, the structure-activity relationships of SA were studied to identify the bioactive functional groups responsible for the antifouling effect, followed by the rational design, synthesis, and antifouling testing of SA derivatives, aiming to obtain more potent antifoulant using SA as a lead. Our results indicated, for the first time, that the ketone carbonyl and the double bond of SA were essential groups accounting for the antifouling effect of SA, while the acid group slightly influenced biological activity. Based on these preliminary structure-activity relationships, two series of SA derivatives (one being benzyl esters of SA, and another being SA derivatives containing methylene chains of various lengths), were then designed and synthesized. Antifouling testing revealed that all benzyl esters of SA exhibited comparable or more potent antifouling effects compared with SA, with compound 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>, which contained a non-substituted benzyl ring, showing the most potent antifouling activity (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.30 ± 0.10 μg/mL, LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 25 μg/mL). Furthermore, the results also indicated that none of the SA derivatives containing a methylene chain exhibited better antifouling effects than SA, while the length of the methylene chain differently influenced the antifouling effects of SA derivatives depending on the functional group at the opposite site of the methylene chain.
