<p class="p">A literature survey indicated that benzyl groups are often present in the antifouling compounds as a bioactive moiety. Maculalactone A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), which contains three benzyl groups, was highly effective against the naupliar larvae of several barnacles, with EC

 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], each containing one benzyl group, demonstrated significant settlement inhibition against barnacle larvae with EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 1.26 μM and 3.19–3.81 μg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, many compounds bearing methylene chains, such as 1-hydroxymyristic acid [

 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], 5-(6-methyloctyl)furan-2(5H)-one [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and halaminol A [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00101-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, were reported to display excellent antifouling effects, indicative of the importance of methylene chains as an antifouling functional group. Therefore, based on our literature review, two series of SA derivatives, one containing benzyl functional groups and the other involving the methylene chain of various lengths, were designed and synthesized in this study, aiming to identify more potent antifouling compounds using SA as a lead.
