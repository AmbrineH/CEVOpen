<p class="p">Marine biofouling, formed by the settlement of microfoulers (marine bacteria, protozoans, and microalgae) and macrofoulers (invertebrates and macroalgae) on the underwater surface of artificial substrates [

Coatings containing metal-based antifoulants, such as organotins, have been widely applied on the surface of facilities to control marine biofouling for decades. Although highly potent against targeted foulers, these kinds of metal-based materials are significantly toxic toward many non-targeted marine organisms [
