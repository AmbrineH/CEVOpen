 <p class="p">Principal component analysis (PCA) multivariate analysis was applied to study the cytotoxic activity of essential oils from various species of the 
  <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> genus on human tumor cell lines. In particular, the cytotoxic activity of essential oils obtained from 
  <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> var. chia (mastic gum), 
  <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic>, was screened on three human adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 (breast), 2008 (ovarian), and LoVo (colon). The results indicate that all the 
  <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> phytocomplexes, with the exception of mastic gum oil, induce cytotoxic effects on one or more of the three cell lines. PCA highlighted the presence of different cooperating clusters of bioactive molecules. Cluster variability among species, and even within the same species, could explain some of the differences seen among samples suggesting the presence of both common and species-specific mechanisms. Single molecules from one of the most significant clusters were tested, but only bornyl-acetate presented cytotoxic activity, although at much higher concentrations (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 138.5 Âµg/mL) than those present in the essential oils, indicating that understanding of the full biological effect requires a holistic vision of the phytocomplexes with all its constituents.
