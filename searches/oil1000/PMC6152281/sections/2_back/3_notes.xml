 <title class="title">Conflicts of Interest</title>
 <p class="p">Alessandro Buriani and Stefano Fortinguerra work as external collaborators for Data Medica, but there is no conflict of interest, since the authors are not among the owners of the patent and do not share any interest in the results other than their scientific value. The founding sponsors had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of data, in the writing of the manuscript, or in the decision to publish the results.</p>
