<p class="p">Cytotoxicity was evaluated on three human adenocarcinoma cell lines: ovarian (2008) breast (MCF-7), and colon (LoVo). The cell line 2008 was kindly supplied by Prof. G. Marverti (Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena, Reggio Emilia, Italy) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). MCF-7 cells were supplied by the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Lombardy and Emilia (Brescia, Italy) and were grown in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). LoVo cells were supplied by Dr. G. Toffoli (Oncologic Reference Centre, Aviano, Italy), and were grown in HAM’s F12 (Lonza). L929 fibroblasts (supplied by Lombardy and Emilia Romagna Experimental Zootechnic Institute, Brescia, Italy) and HFFF2 cells, a human Caucasian foetal foreskin fibroblast derived from a 14–18 old human foetus (ICLC cell bank, Genova, Italy), were used as healthy controls to verify the specificity of the cytotoxic effects for cancer cells (data not shown). L929 and HFFF2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and in DMEM (Seromed-Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) respectively, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/10,000 μg/mL) (Seromed-Biochrom KG). All cultured media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (foetal calf serum) (20% for HFFF2 cells), 1% antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) (Seromed-Biochrom KG), and 1% 200 mM glutamine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were maintained under humidified conditions (air 95%; carbon dioxide (CO
