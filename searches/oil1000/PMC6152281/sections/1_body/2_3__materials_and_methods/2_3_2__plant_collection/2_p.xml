<p class="p">Plant parts were recognized by one of the authors (G.I.), University of Padua, Italy. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences of the University of Padova (PL01-11; PT01-17; PV01-1).

 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic>) were collected, rinsed, dried, and frozen at −21 °C within three hours from collection to preserve their phytochemical composition until the moment of the distillation. The material was then hydrodistilled within a few months. All the samples, before distillation, were minced to obtain the maximum extraction yield and make the process of diffusion of the essence easier [
