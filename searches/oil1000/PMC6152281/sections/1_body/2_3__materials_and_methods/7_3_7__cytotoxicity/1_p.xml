<p class="p">Cells (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well tissue plates (Falcon, New York, NY, USA) and treated for 3 h with different concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> essential oils, with single compounds, or with vehicle (0.1% DMSO, untreated controls). The cells were then rinsed with sterile PBS and incubated in culture medium for 21 h. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated by MTT reduction assay after 21 h of incubation. An amount of 20 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. DMSO (150 µL) was added to all wells and mixed thoroughly to dissolve the dark-blue crystals. The absorbance was measured on a micro-culture plate reader (Titertek Multiscan, Midland, ON, Canada) using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The 3 h pre-incubation followed by recovery model was chosen after some preliminary tests aimed at identifying the best conditions to assay for specific cytotoxic effects. Cisplatin was used as the positive control. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values below 500 µg/mL were taken into consideration for the cytotoxic activity of each phytocomplex tested. This value was chosen as threshold in line with recent literature on the subject and other works on cytotoxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> essential oils, although some authors have used different thresholds [
