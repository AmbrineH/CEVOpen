<p class="p">Correlating the amount of each compound with the relative IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value takes into consideration the intrinsic contribution of the compound to the cytotoxic effect of the phytocomplex and allows the evaluation of its relative potency in the context of the phytocomplex. The resulting values were used as variables in the matrix, and are the vectors in the biplot graphs of principal components, while the samples of the different 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> species represent the observations in the matrix and the points in the graph. The clusters of molecules in a given species were identified in the graphs according to four vector characteristics: correlation with the 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> species, positive distribution with respect to one or more given principal component, distance from the origin, and angle widths between vectors.
