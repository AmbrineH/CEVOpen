<p class="p">The identification of compounds by GC-MS was performed considering not only the matching of mass spectra fragmentation but also the retention index. These two parameters allow the identification of phytoconstituents of the essential oil. In particular, the separation was achieved using a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 film thickness), with a stationary phase of 95%polydimethylsiloxane. GC-MS analysis carried out under the following conditions: carried gas, He; flow rate, 0.8 mL/min; split ratio, 1:10; injection volume, 1 µL; injector temperature, 200 °C. The temperature programme was as follows: 60 °C with 3 min initial hold, and then to 280 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and finally held isothermally for 5 min. The ionization mode was electronic impact at 70 Ev. Identification of the components was achieved by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those stored in the data bank (Wiley Library) [
