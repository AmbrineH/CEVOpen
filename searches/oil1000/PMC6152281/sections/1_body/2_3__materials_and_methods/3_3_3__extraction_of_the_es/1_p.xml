<p class="p">Plant parts were hydrodistilled with a Clevenger apparatus for 4 h. The oils were collected and stored at 4 Â°C in sealed brown vials until analysis. The mean initial weights of the sample were: leaves (450 g), branches, galls or nuts (250 g), berries (100 g), and flowers (270 g). The yield for the various parts of the plant, express as percent of initial wet weight was: leaves (0.05%), branches (0.06%), nuts (0.02%), berries (0.11%), flowers (0.08%), and galls (0.40%).</p>
