<p class="p">Molecular cooperation is the most important aspect of the biological activity found in natural products, where a holistic approach is needed to understand their therapeutic potential. This was confirmed in our PCA study and we found several clusters of bioactivity-associated molecules in each species, likely to specifically synergize on each cell line. Two such clusters were shared for the three adenocarcinomas, indicating the presence of at least two common pathways of cytotoxic activity, while all the others were different, thus suggesting specific cell line sensitivity and different species-specific mechanisms observed in vitro. Among the molecules identified only about 20% were compounds already known for their anti-tumoral effect as single drugs, while the others were novel findings. Among the new molecules identified, mostly terpenes, bornyl acetate showed significant cytotoxic activity even when used alone, but to a much lesser extent if compared to the dose range present in the essential oil, thus highlighting the importance of cooperation between different molecules in the phytocomplex to achieve the final effect.</p>
