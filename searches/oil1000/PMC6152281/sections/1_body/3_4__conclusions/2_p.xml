<p class="p">PCA was used to investigate the correlations between the molecular components of the phytocomplexes, most of them terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and fatty acids, and the observed biological activity. This approach appears to be favourable because it takes into consideration the relative contribution of each compound of the phytocomplex to the final effect on the tumoral cells creating a correlation with the measured IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the considered essential oils. Merging the chemical composition data and the results of the biological assay by a multivariate approach offers a new approach in the evaluation of the bioactivity of these complex mixture. This approach allows the identification of clusters of compounds that, when present together in the mixture, are correlated with increased bioactivity.
