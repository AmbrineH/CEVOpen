<p class="p">This is the largest study conducted to investigate the in vitro anti-tumoral effect of different species from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic>. The phytocomplexes in essential oils from four different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">lentiscus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">terebinthus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">vera</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">integerrima</italic>) consistently, though differently, induced cytotoxicity on the three cell lines of human adenocarcinoma, with variable potency and tropism depending on the species, and no significant difference among samples from different aerial parts. In general, this suggests that the in vitro anti-tumoral effect is a shared feature of the 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> genus, although there are differences that also indicate patterns of activity characteristic for each species and for each adenocarcinoma.
