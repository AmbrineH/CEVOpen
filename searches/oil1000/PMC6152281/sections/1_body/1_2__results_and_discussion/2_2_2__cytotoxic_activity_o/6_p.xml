<p class="p">The oils did not show a consistent order of potency from one cell line to the other, and in some case the same sample could display high activity on one cell line, while being inactive on the others (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01336-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Such different sensitivity of the three cell lines to the same oils suggests that the cytotoxicity mediating network of molecular targets (from receptors, to second messengers to DNA expression regulators) is not the same in the three cell lines, which then respond in a different fashion to the multiple bioactive compounds present in the phytocomplexes. This aspect is pharmacologically relevant and suggests cell linesâ€™ specific effects.
