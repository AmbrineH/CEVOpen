<p class="p">Terpenes and terpene-rich essential oils have been shown to exert specific cytotoxic activity on several tumoral cell lines [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Cytotoxic activity on tumoral cell lines has been previously identified in plants from the 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> genus, but most studies have focused on different types of extracts and not on the terpene-rich essential oils, suggesting other types of chemicals and mechanisms were involved [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In some cases essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> species have been shown to exert cytotoxic activity on tumoral cell lines. 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia vera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia khinjuk</italic> resin essential oils were found to be active against retinoblastoma cells (Y79) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. palestina</italic> Boiss. Although inactive on MCF-7 cells, displayed cytotoxic activity towards amelanotic melanoma cells (C32) and renal cell adenocarcinoma (ACHN) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Our results are, thus, consistent with previous observations on the same genus. A significant amount of data has been produced on the cytotoxic, or antiproliferative effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> var. chia, although in most cases not with essential oil [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In some cases essential oil from the resin was used and a significant cytotoxic effect was observed [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Although we used the same type of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> var. chia resin (mastic), we did not observe any cytotoxic activity in our experimental conditions. This discrepancy could be related to the different experimental models used, to the different treatment with the essential oil, or to the relatively stringent threshold we used for the cytotoxic effectiveness (500 µg/mL). To eliminate nonspecific interferences with adhesion of cells to the experimental substrate, a “pre-incubation” strategy was also used. Unlike the other published data, cell cultures were exposed to essential oils only for three hours and then allowed to recover for the following 21 h. The limitation of unwanted effects on cell adhesion, by improving the focus on cytotoxicity, might explain the different results.
