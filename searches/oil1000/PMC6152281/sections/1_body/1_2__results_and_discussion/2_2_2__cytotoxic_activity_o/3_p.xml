<p class="p">Apart from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> on LoVo cells, none of the species was active on all the other cell lines. In particular the activity towards 2008 cells was higher for the samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> (71%), while 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> displayed a significant activity in 55% of samples, while the two samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> were active and those from 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> var. chia were not. The two most active samples were both from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> leaves (sample A: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 181.5 µg/mL and sample C: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 220.4 µg/mL).
