<p class="p">Taken together the results indicate a dose dependent cytotoxic effect of different 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> species phytocomplexes on all the three cell lines tested, in most cases with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values below 500 Âµg/mL, suggesting that this effect might be a shared feature of the 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> genus. There were wide differences in biological activity between samples, regardless of the species and even the anatomical part, likely related to the high variability in oil composition even within the same species, as determined by GC/MS fingerprinting.
