<p class="p">The activity on MCF-7 cells was higher for the samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> (73%), and it was the only cell line sensitive to the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic>. Essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> were active in 44% of cases, while the two oils from 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> had a weak effect or were inactive. The two most active samples were from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> leaves (sample B: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 239.6 µg/mL), from 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> galls (sample AB: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 254.9 µg/mL) and from 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic> nuts (sample A3: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 290.6 µg/mL).
