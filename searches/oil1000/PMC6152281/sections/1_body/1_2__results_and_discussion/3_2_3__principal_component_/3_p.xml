<p class="p">In summary, PCA allowed the identification of 46 compounds in the phytocomplexes correlated with potential biological activity, most of which had not been previously reported for their in vitro cytotoxic activity on tumoral cells (80%). The compounds are distributed within different clusters of molecules potentially cooperating to achieve the cytotoxic activity on the cell lines.</p>
