<p class="p">The active cluster identified for 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> on LoVo cells (I1: spathulenol, endoborneol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, bornyl acetate) is also the core part of I1a and I1b and correlates with activity in all cell lines and, is shared by all L1s 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> clusters, thus suggesting a common mechanism of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> phytocomplexes throughout the cell lines. Although the aim of the work was not to identify biological activity in single terpenes, given that this particular cluster is shared by all cell lines and at the same time by more than one 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia</italic> species, we tested the cytotoxic activity of the pure compounds on LoVo cells, where the activity of the phytocomplexes seemed to be stronger. Bornyl acetate was the only tested molecule showing a cytotoxic activity when used alone (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 138.5 (130.8 to 146.7 µg/mL), although its potency was not as strong as that corresponding to the actual concentration range in the oils. The other compounds displayed no activity in the pre-treatment paradigm used (data not shown), although

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This points out to the specific biological effect exerted by the phytocomplex as a whole, which cannot be attributed to a single component but, rather, is likely the result of a complex network of simultaneous biological signals which contribute to the global cytotoxic effect. The other cluster whose core compounds are all shared in all the three cell lines is L3 (from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic>): α-copaene, α-cadinol, τ-cadinol, cadina-1,4-diene, α-elemene, α-amorphene, germacrene A, α-muurolene, β-elemene, and alloaromandrene. In this cluster α-copaene and β-elemene are known cytotoxic compounds for tumoral cells [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. α-Terpinene, α-phellandrene, and α-terpinene are shared by L2s clusters, although they represent only one third. In this group α-terpinene has been previously documented for its cytotoxic activity on cancer cells [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Other active compounds are associated with bioactivity on all cell lines, but seem not to cooperate consistently with the same clusters. α-Terpineol and 1-4 terpineol cooperate with cluster L1 and L1a on LoVo and 2008 cells, respectively, while on MCF-7 cells, though active, cluster with L2b. Both compounds have been previously found to exert in vitro anti-tumoral activity [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. α-Humulene, another terpene previously shown to be cytotoxic in vitro [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-01336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], is present in clusters of activity in all the three cell lines from both 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> (L4, T1, T2, T3). Ten more compounds are differentially cooperating in clusters of cytotoxic activity towards all cell lines, some in the same group, some in totally different contexts (γ-eudesmol: L2, L2a, L3; sabinene: L2, L2a, S; 2-nonanone: S, L2a, L2b; 2-undecanone: L2, L3a, L2b; β-eudesmol: L2, L3a, L3b; germacrene D L4, T2, L4a; β-cubebene L4, T1, T2, L4a; α-ylangene: L4, T1, T2,L4a; δ-cadinene L4, T2, L3b; butylated hydroxytoluene: L4, T1, T2, V1), the last one being the only clustered molecule shared by 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic> with other species. Other compounds’ bioactivity are not shared by all three cell lines, thus suggesting a different cell sensitivity and cell-specific mechanisms. Two such molecules, β-caryophyllene and d-limonene, previously shown to have cytotoxic activity and considered promising potential anti-tumorals [
