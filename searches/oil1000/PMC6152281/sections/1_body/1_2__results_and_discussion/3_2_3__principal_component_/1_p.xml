 <xref rid="molecules-22-01336-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Four principal components were used (PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4) which together accounted for more than 60% of the total variance in all three cell lines (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01336-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Positive correlations with one or more principal components were identified for each cell line and each active species in the PC biplot. The highest percent value of association with bioactivity was chosen, proceeding down from the strongest association, until a cluster of active molecules could be identified. PCA allowed the identification of 18 clusters of putative bioactive compounds (compounds likely to cooperate in the cytotoxic activity), many of them differing among cell lines for just one or a few compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01336-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). MCF-7 was the cell line with more clusters of bioactive compounds (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 7), while LoVo and 2008 cells had six and five, respectively. All the compounds showing a high level of correlation with bioactivity were included at least in one cluster, with the exception of sabinene and Î±-humulene, the latter a known anticancer agent [

 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> was the species with more clusters of bioactivity-associated molecules in all cell lines. 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> was also the species with higher principal component scores, with L2 being the cluster with the highest values (43.2% LoVo, 42.5% 2008, 44.9 MCF-7).
