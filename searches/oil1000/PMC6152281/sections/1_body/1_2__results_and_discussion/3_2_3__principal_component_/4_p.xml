<p class="p">Taken together, the PCA results indicate that the cytotoxic activity of the phytocomplexes can be highlighted in several clusters of likely-synergizing compounds. 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> is the species with the most clusters, which is in line with its higher potency and frequency of activity with respect to the other species tested. Only two of such clusters are common for all the cell lines, they are characteristic of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic>, and one is also shared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic>. In other cases clusters are shared only for one or two cell lines. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic>, only one cluster could be identified. These similarities and differences suggest that the cytotoxic effect is complex. Some are common for all three cell lines which suggests a shared mechanism for all three adenocarcynomas, but some are not and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> seems to display the most variability, while samples from the other species seem more consistent throughout the different cell lines. This behaviour points to different mechanisms exerted in a cell-specific fashion.
