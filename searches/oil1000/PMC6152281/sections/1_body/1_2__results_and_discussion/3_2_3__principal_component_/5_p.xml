<p class="p">Keeping in mind that the results with PCA do not necessarily explain the full activity of the whole phytocomplex, the analysis allowed the identification of substances, mostly terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and fatty acids, present in the essential oils likely playing a central role in the in vitro anti-tumoral effect. Of these, some had been previously shown to have such activity when used as single compounds. Almost all the substances identified cooperate with others, thus forming clusters of activity, often different for one or more components in terms of cell sensitivity.</p>
