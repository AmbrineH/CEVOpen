<p class="p">Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of aerial parts of the plants, or obtained from producers, and oil composition was determined using GC-MS.

 <xref rid="molecules-22-01336-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> show the main components of oil samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> L. (including 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> L., var. chia), 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic> L., and 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> J.L. Stewart ex Brandis, as identified by the Wiley mass spectra library. A total of 32 samples from different aerial parts of the plants were analysed. Although most terpenes were present in both 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> samples, the oil composition varied considerably, with limonene and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-ocimene being more meaningfully present in samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic>, while β-phellandrene, 1,4- and α-terpineol, α- and γ-terpinene, and T and α-cadinol were relatively more abundant in samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic>. Collectively, the two species show similar amounts of α- and β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, and butylated hydroxy toluene. Among the samples from other species, those from 
 <italic class="italic">P. integerrima</italic> showed similarities to 
 <italic class="italic">P. terebinthus</italic> in the content of α- and β-pinene and of β-caryophyllene, and to 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> in the amounts of 1,4- and α-terpineol, endoborneol, and bornyl acetate. Finally, a significant amount of δ-carene appears to be characteristic of all the three species. Oil samples from 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> var. chia (resin) and from 
 <italic class="italic">P. vera</italic> (nuts) are the ones with the least similarities with the others. The composition of the essential oils indicates consistency with the major terpenes known to be present in these species [
