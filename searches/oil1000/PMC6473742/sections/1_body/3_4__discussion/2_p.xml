<p class="p">The shelf life of medicinal plants depends on moisture, temperature and other environmental factors. It was argued that plant material with a level of moisture higher than 8% favours the invasion of insects and moisture content of plant materials higher than 15% stands the risk of having been contaminated with bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The outcome of this research reveals that the moisture content of the dried samples of the leaf (7.57 ± 0.40%) and root (7.59 ± 0.08%) of 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> have low moisture and could be preserved with little risk of insect and microorganism invasion, hence increasing its shelf life. The result of the moisture content was close to the moisture content of 
 <italic class="italic">Rumex dentatus</italic> Linn. and 
 <italic class="italic">Rumex nepalensis</italic> Spreng. as reported by Hameed and Dastagir (2009) [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The level of the ash contents of the plant suggested the availability of inorganic constituents which is subsequently confirmed by the considerably high content of mineral compositions. Referring to the percentage of ash, our values in the leaf (15.35 ± 0.04%) slightly doubled the values of the root (6.22 ± 0.28%) of 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> which is in accordance with those described by Hameed and Dastagir (2009) [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The ash content closely suggested the reason why the mineral level of the leaf is higher than the root, except for the calcium composition in the root (1190.0 ± 0 mg/100g) which is significantly higher. The leaf is no doubt a better source of minerals than the root. In general, minerals have been confirmed to be essential in human nutrition for overall physical and mental wellbeing.
