<p class="p">The fat and oil in the plant was extracted and quantified as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00051-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The leaf (2.01 ± 0.24%) has more fat and it was twice the value of fat recorded in the root (0.90 ± 0.14%). Fat is one of the major component causing differences in the gross energy of various food substance, it yields over 9 Kcal/g compared to carbohydrates and proteins that yield about 5 Kcal/g. Nagao and Yanagita, (2010) [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], reported medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have a therapeutic advantage in preserving insulin sensitivity as found in animal models and patients with type 2 diabetes. The level of oil in

The higher NDF level of the leaf (46.02 ± 3.13%) could have been due to lesser NFC (10.25 ± 2.37%) but these were contrary in the root which has higher digestible carbohydrate (57.74 ± 3.06%) and lesser fibre (31.38 ± 3.79%). The estimated oxidizable energy of the root was found to be 1063.23 ± 95.31 KJ/100g which is signifcantly higher than that of the leaf (688.72 ± 81.5 KJ/100g) and the reason is not far-fetched from the higher level of digestible carbohydrate contained in the root as shown in
