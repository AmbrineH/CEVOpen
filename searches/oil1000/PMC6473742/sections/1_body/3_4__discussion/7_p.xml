<p class="p">The essential oils obtained using SFME and HDE were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, but some compounds found in HDE are not found in SFME and vice versa in the essential oil of the fresh root and leaf of 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus.</italic> For comparison of chemical components of the extracted essential oil, same weight (400 g each) of fresh samples were used throughout the extraction process, the microwave extraction was done in 30 min without adding any solvent, and Hydro-distillation extraction was performed for 180 min using distilled water. The principal volatile compound found in the leaf are 5-Eicosene; possessing antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], docos-1-ene, trans-5-Octadecene, and tetradecane which was reported by Kavitha and Uduman (2017) [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] as an antimicrobial compound. While in the root; 1-Heptacosanol was one of the principal components which was reported to be nematicidal, anticancer, antioxidant and antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], 4-Methyloctane; could be used as tumor biomarker [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], ethylcyclohexane, tetradecane, eucalyptol; it has antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], to be active against bacterial, phytol; was also reported as an antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diureti compound [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, their proportions depend on the type of isolation technique used, HDE was found to have more yield (
