<p class="p">The fat-soluble vitamin A content of the plant was evaluated using retinol equivalent. The dried sample of the leaf (1.29 ± 0.014 mg retinol/100g) has the highest retinol and the dried root (0.74 ± 0.034 mg retinol/100g) has the lowest value of vitamin A which is commensurable to the recommended Average Requirement (AR) of vitamin A, by European Union (EU) for average body weight adult men (68.1 kg) and women (58.5 kg) with an established ARs values of 0.57 mg retinol equivalent (RE)/day and 0.49 mg RE/day respectively [

The fresh sample of the leaf (159.73 ± 26.77 mg AA/100g) and root (43.07 ± 3.49 mg AA/100g) has higher ascorbic acid content compared to the dried samples. Vitamin C is less stable to heat, hence this might result in the lesser value of the ascorbic acid content of the pulverized samples as shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00051-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. According to Frei and Trabe (2001), the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin C for adults (≥19 years) is 75 mg/day for a female and 90 mg/day for a male. 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> could be a complementary diet for the deficiency of vitamin C. Unlike ascorbic acid, vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with the most potent lipid-soluble antioxidant in the plasma. The daily RDA for vitamin E is 8 and 10 mg/day α-tocopherol equivalents for adult women and men respectively [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In contrast to the value of vitamin C, the vitamin E content of the dried and fresh samples do not show heat or moisture dependence. The fresh sample of the root (54.90 ± 0.39 mg α-tocopherol/100g) has the highest value, followed by the dried leaf (54.71 ± 0.38 mg α-tocopherol/100g). The least value of tocopherol was found in the fresh leaf (53.87 ± 0.21). This could be due to the thermal stability of vitamin E at high temperature as reported by Työppönen and Hakkarainen (1985) [
