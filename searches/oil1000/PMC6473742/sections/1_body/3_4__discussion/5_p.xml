<p class="p">Phytate is the free-acid form of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and it is the primary storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, predominantly seeds and bran. Although, there have been few reports of phytate being found in other tissue of the plant aside from the storage tissues or reproductive organs [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The values of the phytate in the leaf and root of 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> were found to be 1.15 ± 0.74% and 1.38 ± 0.27% respectively, which was considered to be trace according to Alkarawi and Zotz, (2014) [

On the other hand, phytate has been confirmed to have effects on absorption and digestion of some minerals and impacts negatively on some protein and lipid utilisation in the body. This is possible due to its affinity to chelate with cations such as magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, potassium and copper to form insoluble salts [

 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> were evaluated to have a deposit of calcium oxalate (0.15 ± 0.019 mg/g and 0.11 ± 0.0033 mg/g) respectively. The biological roles of oxalate in the plant include calcium regulation, tolerance to heavy metals, protection against herbivores and helps in plant growth, but in human, it could form a larger kidney stone that can block the kidney tubule [
