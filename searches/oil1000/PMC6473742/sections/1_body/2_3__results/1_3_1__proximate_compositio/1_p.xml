<p class="p">The proximate composition of the dried pulverized root and leaf of 
 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> was evaluated and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00051-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The moisture content of the leaf and root (7.57 ± 0.40% and 7.59 ± 0.08% respectively) was not significantly different. The ash content of the leaf (15.35 ± 0.04%) was found to be higher than the root (6.22 ± 0.28%), which indicates a higher mineral concentration in the leaf. The level of fat in the leaf (2.01 ± 0.24%) was twice that of the root (0.90 ± 0.14%) and the crude protein of the leaf (26.37 ± 0.06%) was found to be significantly higher than the protein of the root (3.75 ± 0.31%). The fibre (NDF) level of the leaf (46.02 ± 3.13%) was higher than the root while the carbohydrate (NFC) of the root (57.74 ± 3.06%) was higher than the leaf, maybe due to lesser fibre levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00051-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The estimated oxidizable energy of the root (1063.23 ± 95.31 KJ/100g) is significantly higher than that of the leaf (688.72 ± 81.5 KJ/100g), which could be due to the higher carbohydrate content of the root.
