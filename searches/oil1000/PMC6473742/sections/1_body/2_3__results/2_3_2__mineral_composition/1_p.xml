 <italic class="italic">Rumex crispus</italic> was measured and recorded in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00051-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> below. The root has a higher composition of calcium (1190.0 ± 0 mg/100g), zinc (5.2 ± 0.14 mg/100g) and iron (32.95 ± 1.20 mg/100g) compared to the leaf; 635.0 ± 7.01 mg/100g, 4.10 ± 0 mg/100g, and 28.70 ± 0.70 mg/100g respectively. However, the magnesium (445.0 ± 7.00 mg/100g), potassium (5600.0 ± 0 mg/100g), sodium (280.0 ± 42.43 mg/100g), phosphorus (515.0 ± 7.01 mg/100g), copper (1.15 ± 0.7 mg/100g), and manganese (10.95 ± 0.21 mg/100g) composition of the leaf is significantly higher than that of the root as shown in
