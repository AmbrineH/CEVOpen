<p class="p">The vitamin and the anti-nutrient compositions of the plant sample were quantified and presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00051-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The estimated retinol equivalent in the fresh plant sample was 1.22 ± 0.047 mg retinol/100g (Leaf) and 1.24 ± 0.018 mg retinol/100g (Root). The retinol per 100 g of the dry sample was estimated at 1.29 ± 0.014 mg (Leaf) and 0.74 ± 0.034 mg (Root). The ascorbic acid equivalent per 100 g was found to be higher in the fresh samples of the leaf and the root; 159.73 ± 26.77 mg and 43.07 ± 3.49 mg respectively while the ascorbic content of the dry sample of the leaf (26.73 ± 4.46 mg) and root (7.69 ± 1.35 mg) was lesser. The value of the Vitamin E content per 100 g of the fresh samples; 53.87 ± 0.21 mg (Leaf), 54.89 ± 0.39 mg (Root) and per 100 g of the dry samples; 54.71 ± 0.38 mg (Leaf), 54.41 ± 0.34 mg (Root) were slightly different from each other. The percentage phytate composition of the leaf (1.15 ± 0.74%) was found to be lesser than the root (1.38 ± 0.27%) while there was a slight difference in the oxalate content of the root (0.11 ± 0.0033 mg/g) and leaf (0.15 ± 0.019 mg/mg).
