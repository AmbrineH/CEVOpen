 <italic class="italic">Rumex crispus</italic> were collected (32°47′1.23′′ S, 26°51′9.85′′ E) in late summer of 2017, identified, and the sample was deposited in Giffen’s herbarium (Idr-Med-2017/03), Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare. The essential oil was extracted from the fresh plant sample with Solvent Free Microwave Extraction (SFME) and Hydrodistillation (HD). Subsequently, the remaining of the collected plant material was dried in a controlled environment at room temperature. The dried plant sample was pulverized with an electric blender (Polymix PX-MFC90D Switzerland) and stored in an airtight dark bottle in the refrigerator at 4 ± 2 °C until use.
