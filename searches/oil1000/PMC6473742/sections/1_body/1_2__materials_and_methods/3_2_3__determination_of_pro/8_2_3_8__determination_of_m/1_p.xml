 <xref rid="B24-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], with modification was adopted. The pulverized plant samples (2.5 g) were weighed and ashed at 550 °C. The resulting residue (white-ash) was dissolved in 4 mL of concentrated HCl acid, filtered and the filtrate was diluted in a volumetric flask with distilled water. The resulting solution of the extract was then subjected for the analysis of specific major minerals. The analyses were performed in triplicates. The Iron (Fe) content was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES; Varian 710–ES series) while the content of other elements; K, Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cu and P were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Varian Spectra AA-220, USA).
