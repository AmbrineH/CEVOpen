<p class="p">Oxalate content of the samples was determined by titration method as described by Unuofin et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The samples (1 g) were weighed in triplicate in an Erlenmeyer flask which contains 75 mL of 3 M sulfuric acid. The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 1 h, filtered and 5 mL of the filtrate was titrated against 0.05 M KMnO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution until a reddish brown colour persists. The oxalate content of the sample was expressed as 2.2 mg oxalate as an equivalent to 1 mL of 0.05 M of KMnO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>.
