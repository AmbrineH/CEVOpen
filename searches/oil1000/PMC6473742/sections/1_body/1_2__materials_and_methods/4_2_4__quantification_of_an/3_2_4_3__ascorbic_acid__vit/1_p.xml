<p class="p">The ascorbic acid of the sample was quantified spectrophotometrically with modification as described by Njoku et al. (2015) [

 <italic class="italic">R. crispus</italic> was tested, by weighing 1 g of plant sample in a flask containing 20 mL of 0.4% oxalic acid. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 5 min at room temperature and filtered. An aliquot of the filtrate (100 µL) was measured in a microtiter plate and 200 µL of 0.8 mg/mL of 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol was added. It was incubated for 5 min and the absorbance of the triplicates was taken at 520 nm using a stand-alone microplate reader (Diagnostic Automation, INC DAR800, USA). The standard solution (Ascorbic acid) was prepared similarly with concentration gradient (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg/mL) and the results were expressed as equivalents of mg ascorbic acid per 100 g plant sample, using the equation from the standard curve: y = −0.698ln(x) − 0.0548, R
