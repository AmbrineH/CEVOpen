 <xref rid="B26-plants-08-00051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The samples were weighed (1.0 g), macerated with 20 mL of absolute ethanol for 3 h and filtered. The filtrate was added to 0.2% ferric chloride (dissolved in 99.9% ethanol) in ratio 1:1 (

An aliquot of 200 µL of the resulting solution was measured in a microtiter plate and 100 µL 0.5% of ∝-∝′-dipyridyl reagent in ethanol was added, the solution was then diluted with 50 µL distilled water. The absorbance of the triplicates was taken at 520 nm using a microplate reader. The standard ∝-tocopherol was prepared 100 mg/100 mL in absolute ethanol and graded (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg/mL). Standard curve was plotted and vitamin E equivalent (mg d-alpha-tocopherol/100 g) was extrapolated from the standard curve gradient; y = 1.9283x − 6.2896, R
