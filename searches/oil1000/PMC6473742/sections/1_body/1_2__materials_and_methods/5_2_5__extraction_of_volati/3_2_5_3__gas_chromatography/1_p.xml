<p class="p">The component analysis of the volatile oil was done on a gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The essential oil samples were prepared by diluting the extracted volatile oil with n-hexane (1:100,

A.05.04 data handling system, equipped with a single injector and double flame ionisation detectors (FIDs). The operating conditions for the system during this analysis were set as follows; silica capillary columns with stationary Zebron (ZB) phase, ZB-5MS (5% Phenyl Methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm). The temperature was set to 70 °C with a raising rate of 3 °C for 1 min, then held at 220 °C for 15 min and ramped for 3 min at 4 °C. The injection was initiated by 1 mL splitless injector with an initial temperature of 280 °C; carrier gas was GC grade helium adjusted to a linear velocity of 30 cm/s. The oven and detector temperature were set 280 °C; pressure at 8.27 psi; flush out time of 0.20 min and flows at the rate of 30 mL/min. MS (Agilent 5977 MSD) operating condition; source temperature was 230 °C; quadrupole temperature was 150 °C; the ionisation current, energy and mass was 60 µA, 70 eV and 35–350 µ respectively and the scan rate was 4.5 scans s
