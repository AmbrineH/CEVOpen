<p class="p">SFME was performed using a laboratory microwave oven (Milestone Microwave, Apollo Scientific, South Africa). The microwave has a 2.45 GHz multimode reactor with a maximum power of 900 W which is delivered in an increment of 10 W with 650 nm wavelength. The power, time, temperature, and pressure of the microwave oven was digitally controlled by software (Easy-Wave) during the extraction and parameters were set at an optimum level to maximize the yield of essential oil. The SFME was carried out at standard atmospheric pressure, 400 g of the fresh plant samples were heated without any solvent. The extracted essential oil was separated by simple decantation. It was then dried under anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na
