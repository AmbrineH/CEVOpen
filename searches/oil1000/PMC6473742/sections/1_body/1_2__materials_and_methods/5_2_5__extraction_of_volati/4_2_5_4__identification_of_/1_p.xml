<p class="p">The chemical components of the essential oils were identified by the GC-MS system by comparison of the mass spectra fragmentations, GC retention times, retention indices and percentage area composition of the compounds with the robust Library references (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Library 2014) by autonomously linear interpolating the component to the retention of the series of n-alkanes in database. The identification was further confirmed by searching through the NIST database. However, Chen et al. (2014) [
