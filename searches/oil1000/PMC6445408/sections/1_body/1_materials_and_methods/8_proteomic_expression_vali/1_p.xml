<p class="p">The RNA abundance for several upregulated proteins from CBO-treated 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pneumoniae</italic> BAA-1705 was determined by qRT-PCR using QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR (QIAGEN, Germany) on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, USA). The Livak method was employed to assess the relative expression of three upregulated genes, namely cytidine deaminase (
 <italic class="italic">cdd</italic>), thiamine phosphate synthase (
 <italic class="italic">thiE</italic>) and uridine phosphorylase (
 <italic class="italic">udp</italic>), one down regulated gene, namely, 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (
 <italic class="italic">fabA</italic>) and two housekeeping genes, namely 
 <italic class="italic">16S rRNA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">OmpK36</italic> porin. Reactions were performed in triplicate and data were analysed by using the CFX Manage Software (Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 10 s. In all experiments, no template reactions were used as negative controls.
