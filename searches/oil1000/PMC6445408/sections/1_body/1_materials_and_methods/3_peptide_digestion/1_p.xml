<p class="p">Approximately 100 μg of total protein was resuspended in 100 μL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). RapiGest (Waters Corporation, USA) at final concentration of 0.05% was added to the protein in equal parts. Protein from each sample was then concentrated to 100μL using Vivaspin column (GE Healthcare, USA) with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 3000 and incubated at 80°C for 15 min. The proteins were reduced in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 60°C for 30 min, and then alkylated in the dark using 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 45 min. Proteolytic digestion was performed using Trypsin Gold (Promega, USA) at a ratio of 1:200 parts of protein, followed by incubation at 37°C overnight. Tryptic digestion and RapiGest activity were terminated by the addition of 1 μL concentrated trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) followed by the incubation of samples at 37°C for 20 min. The tryptic peptide solution of each sample was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 20 min, and the resulting supernatants were collected in clean microcentrifuges tube kept at -80°C until subsequent analysis.</p>
