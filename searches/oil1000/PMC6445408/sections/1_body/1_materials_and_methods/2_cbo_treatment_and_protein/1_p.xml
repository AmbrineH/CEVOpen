<p class="p">KPC-KP cell cultures were divided into two treatment groups, namely control (no treatment) and CBO treated prior to protein extraction. The CBO final concentration used was 0.08% (v/v), as determined by Yang et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Both treatment groups had a final volume of 50 mL, supplemented with Tween 80 at final concentration of 10% to enhance the solubility of CBO and a standard inoculum of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL KPC-KP cells. Samples were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h to obtain sufficient cells for protein extraction. The cells from both treatment groups were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min, washed for at least three times and resuspended in 500 μL cold protein extraction buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were then sonicated on ice at 20 amplitude for 10 cycles to lyse the cells; each cycle consisted of 10 seconds of sonication followed by 20 s of cooling, with a Qsonica Sonicator Q55 (Fischer Scientific, USA). Sonicated samples were then pelleted at 4°C and 10000 rpm for 1 h; supernatants were then collected and quantified via Bradford assay. The protein concentration of each sample was standardized to 1 mg/mL for the subsequent proteomic analysis. Treatment and analysis was standardized in three distinct biological replicates to ensure reproducibility of the experiment.
