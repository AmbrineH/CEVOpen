<p class="p">The nanoLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The samples (2 μL containing 2 μg peptides) were injected and separated on an EASY-nLC 1000 (Dionex, Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with an Easy-Spray Column Acclaim PepMap C18 100Å (2 μm, 50 μm × 15 cm, Thermo Scientific, USA). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 250 nL/min and using a gradient of 5% to 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% formic acid (FA) for 45 min followed by a further gradient to 85% ACN in 0.1% FA for 2 min. The column was equilibrated back to 5% ACN with 0.1% FA over 1 min and maintained at 5% CAN until the next sample injection. Mass spectrometry was conducted in a positive ion mode with a nanospray voltage of 1.5 kV and a source temperature of 250°C. The instrument was operated in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with an Orbitrap MS (OTMS) survey scan using the following parameters: mass range of m/z 310–1800 with resolving power of 120000, automatic gain control (AGC) of 400000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The Top Speed Mode of 3 seconds was used in the selection of precursors with the monoisotopic charge state of 2 to 7. These precursors were further analysed by MS/MS scanning. All precursors were filtered using a 20 s dynamic exclusion window and intensity threshold of 5000. The MS/MS spectra were analysed using ion trap MS (ITMS) with the following parameters: rapid scan rate with resolving power of 60000, AGC of 100, isolation window of 1.6 m/z and maximum injection time of 250 ms. Precursors were then fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) and high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at normalized collision energy of 30% to 28%.</p>
