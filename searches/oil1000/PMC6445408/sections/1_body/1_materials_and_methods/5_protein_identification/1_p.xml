<p class="p">Raw data were processed using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer Software v2.1 with the SEQUEST HT search engine. The MS ion intensities were calculated based on the accurate mass and time tag strategy. The accurate alignment of the detected LC retention time and 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> value across different analyses, together with the area under chromatographic elution profiles of the identified peptides could be compared between different samples. For protein identification, data was searched against the Uniprot

 <italic class="italic">pneumoniae</italic> database with 1% strict FDR and 5% relaxed FDR criteria using Percolator. Search parameters were set to 2 miscleavages with fixed modification of carbamidomethylation and variable modification through methionine oxidation or asparagine and glutamine deamidation. A fragment tolerance of 0.6 Da and a precursor tolerance of 10 ppm were used with trypsin as a digestion enzyme. Proteins with at least 2 unique peptides implied a greater confidence of protein identity.
