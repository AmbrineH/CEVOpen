<p class="p">Protein quantification and statistical analyses were performed using Perseus Software v1.6.0.7 (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Each control and treated samples analysis consisted of three biological replicates with three technical replicates, independently injected into the LCMS/MS. The protein file with three technical replicates in txt. format from Proteome Discoverer software were uploaded to Perseus for further comparative analysis between the samples. The data were log2-transformed to stabilise the variance and scale-normalised to the same mean intensity across the technical replicates. The mean values for all three technical replicates of the same biological samples were grouped together in the same matrix and valid values were obtained by filtering with ‘at least 2’, eliminating proteins which only existed in one of the technical replicates. Finally, all biological replicates of the same treatment group were consolidated into the same matrix, with the missing values imputated with the random number derived from a normal distribution. The histograms were plotted to compare the ratio distributions between all samples. Differentially expressed proteins between control and treatment were detected using a T-test, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values were also adjusted for multiple-testing using the permutation-based false discovery rate, with a number of randomization of 250. Proteins were considered to be significantly differentially expressed between treatment groups with adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values of &lt;0.05 and a fold changes of ≤ -1 or ≥ +1.
