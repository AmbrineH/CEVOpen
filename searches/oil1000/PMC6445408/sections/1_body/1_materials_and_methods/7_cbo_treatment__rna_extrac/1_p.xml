<p class="p">KPC-KP cell culture were treated with CBO or vehicle buffer prior to RNA extraction. The CBO final concentration used was 0.08% (v/v), as determined in our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Both treatment groups had a final volume of 50 mL, and contained Tween 80 at final concentration of 10% to enhance the solubility of CBO. The standard KPC-KP cell inoculum was 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL. Samples were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 h followed by RNA extraction using the TransZol RNA purification kit (Transgen Biotech, China). RNA (0.5 ng) was subjected to reverse transcription with QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) in a 20-μl reaction volume. The synthesized complementary DNA (cDNA) was stored at −20 °C until further use.
