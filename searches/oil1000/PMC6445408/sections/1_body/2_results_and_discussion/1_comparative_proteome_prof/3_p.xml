<p class="p">Of the overlapping 232 proteins identified in both treatment groups, only 41 proteins showed significant differences, in terms of fold change between the groups. The majority of the proteins which showed significant abundance difference were downregulated (51.2%) when compared to the non-treated KPC-KP cells, whereas the other 48.8% of the proteins were upregulated as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Proteins that were absent or present in each treatment group were also listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, with proteins that were only present in the CBO-treated KPC-KP cells listed under the upregulated proteins whereas proteins which were only present in the non-treated KPC-KP cells listed under the downregulated protein section. These proteins were then subjected to KEGG pathway analysis to elucidate mechanism involved in the action of CBO on KPC-KP cells.
