<p class="p">Comparative proteomic analysis was carried out between non-treated and CBO-treated KPC-KP cells in four independent experiments using Perseus Software v1.6.0.7 (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). The protein profiles of treated and non-treated cells varied significantly with no outliers from the replicates, as shown in the principle component analysis (PCA) in

In addition, the Pearson correlation values between non-treated and CBO-treated KPC-KP were of high confidence (0.788 to 0.822), indicating that both the compared groups are of the same organism with no contamination within the samples (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>) of the comparative proteome between non-treated and CBO-treated KPC-KP cells showed a total of 46 proteins with significantly different abundance; 25 proteins of which were upregulated, whereas the other 21 proteins were downregulated in response to CBO treatment.
