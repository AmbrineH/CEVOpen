<p class="p">A total of 384 proteins were identified from the non-treated cells, whereas only 242 proteins were identified from the CBO-treated cells, A total of 152 proteins were only expressed in the non-treated cells while 10 proteins were only expressed in the CBO-treated cells, the other 232 proteins were present in both groups of cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). Proteins that were present in both samples were compared within the Perseus software to measure up- and downregulation of proteins while the rest of the proteins are referred as absent or present from each treatment group (
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Proteins that were differentially present or absent, and up- or downregulated between the two groups of cells were subjected to gene ontology analysis with regards to biological process involvement, cellular component and molecular function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The majority of the proteins identified were linked to cellular and metabolic processes (37.5% and 35.7%), a number were also involved with cellular component organization and response to stimulus (8.2% and 7.9%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). Cellular component wise, the majority of the proteins identified were categorized under cytosol and cytoplasm (41.5% and 30.3%) followed by macromolecular complex and plasma membrane (11.9% and 10.5%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2d</xref>). The categorization by molecular function identified proteins that were involved in catalytic activity and binding (46% and 45%) in addition to proteins that were structural molecules and or had transcription regulator activity (2.8% and 2.1%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2F</xref>). Most proteins involved in biological processes, cellular component and molecular function were downregulated (
