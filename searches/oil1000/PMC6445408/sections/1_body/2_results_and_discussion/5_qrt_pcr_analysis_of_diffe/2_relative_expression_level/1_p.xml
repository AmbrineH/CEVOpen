<p class="p">The relative abundance of mRNA for the differentially expressed proteins investigated was measured by qRT-PCR, comparing the untreated cells with CBO-treated KPC-KP cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Proteomic profiling found that 
 <italic class="italic">fabA</italic> was downregulated by -3.46 fold, whereas

 <italic class="italic">thiC</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">udp</italic> were upregulated by 1.62, 2.08 and 2.57 fold respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA abundance found that 
 <italic class="italic">fabA</italic> was downregulated by 0.8 fold whereas 
 <italic class="italic">cdd</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">thiC</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">udp</italic> were upregulated by 0.8, 11 and 1.4 fold respectively. The pattern in mRNA abundance change following CBO treatment mirrors that of the protein abundance for these four gene products, indicating that at least part of the change in the abundance for these four proteins is due to changes in gene transcription. The differences in the magnitude of the fold changes between the protein abundance and mRNA transcript abundance may be a consequence of oxidative stress-induced protein degradation or different stabilities for the mRNA species. Nevertheless, the trends in expression changes shown in the protein profiles and mRNA transcription levels are consistent with each other and validate our results obtained from proteomic profiling.
