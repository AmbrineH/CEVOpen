<p class="p">CBO exerts antimicrobial activity on KPC-KP cells through membrane disruption, and proteomic profiling shows that the membrane damage induced was due to oxidative stress. This is supported by the increased in abundance of oxidative stress regulators when KPC-KP cells were exposed to CBO. A review by Itri et al. (2014) consolidated information from studies involving oxidative stress and membrane damage. The study concluded that oxidative stress would reduce the permeability and integrity of the plasma membrane, leading to leakage of intracellular contents and eventually killing the bacterial cells [

The membrane disruptive effects of CBO could also be deduced from our proteomic profiles, and numerous proteins showed decreased abundance or were lost following CBO exposure. Interestingly, CBO treatment also interfered with the biosynthesis of the plasma membrane, cell wall and outer membrane, disabling the structural repair system. The proteomic profiles were validated using qRT-PCR analysis, where proteomic changes were mirrored by changes in corresponding mRNA abundance. Together with the evidence from our previous study on the antimicrobial potential and the mode of action of CBO against KPC-KP cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], we showed that the antibacterial activity of CBO derives from its ability to induce oxidative stress in bacterial cells. The resulting oxidation disrupts the bacterial membrane, eventually enabling the influx of ROS into the cells and, at the same time, leads to intracellular content leakage. ROS induce genetic damage and impair DNA and membrane repair systems. Our results demonstrate that CBO causes oxidative stress, damage to bacterial membranes, cellular leakage and cell killing.
