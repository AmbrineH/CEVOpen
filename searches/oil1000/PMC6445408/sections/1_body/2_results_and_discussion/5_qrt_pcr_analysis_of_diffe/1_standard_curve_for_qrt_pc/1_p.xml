<p class="p">We selected four genes for further validation of our proteomic data using qRT-PCR together with two housekeeping genes, namely 
 <italic class="italic">3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">fabA</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">cytidine deaminase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">cdd</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">thiamine phosphate synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">thiE</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">uridine phosphorylas</italic>e (
 <italic class="italic">udp</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">16s rRNA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">OmpK36 porin</italic>. Out of these, three were significantly higher in abundance and one was less abundant in the proteomic profile following exposure to CBO. The designed primers for each selected genes were listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214326.s003" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>. Their efficiency ranged within 90 and 100%.
