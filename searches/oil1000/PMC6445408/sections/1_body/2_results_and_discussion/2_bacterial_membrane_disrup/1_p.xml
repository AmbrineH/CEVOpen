<p class="p">The Gram negative bacterial cell outer barrier consists of three separate component, the outer membrane, the peptidoglycan and the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Both the outer membrane and the plasma membrane are made up of a phospholipid bilayer embedded with membrane proteins. The biochemical feature which differentiates the layers is the presence of lipopolysaccharides uniquely in the outer membrane. Of the identified proteins from the KPC-KP cells, 10.5% were located at the bacterial membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214326.g002" class="xref">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Following exposure to CBO, our proteomic profiling showed 5 outer membrane exclusive proteins and 26 plasma membrane exclusive proteins were completely lost after the exposure to CBO (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-trans-coumaroyl-2-hydroxyquinic acid, a phenolic compound isolated from Himalayan cedar essential oil caused bacterial membrane damage and the loss of membrane proteins due to specific interactions between the compound and the lipid and proteins within the bacterial membrane [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This disrupted the membrane integrity of the bacteria which caused the loss of plasma membrane protein. The downregulation of outer membrane integrity regulators such as the TolB porin-interacting protein, the large-conductance mechanosensitive channel and outer membrane protein assembly factor BamA in KPC-KP cells exposed to CBO also indicated the loss of membrane integrity in KPC-KP cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In addition, proteins involved in energy generation, such as the ATP synthase, the electron transport complex and the NADH-quinone oxidoreductases which are often embedded within the bacterial membrane were lost completely. This is yet another indicator for disrupted bacterial membrane integrity that may contribute to bacterial cell killing through the shutdown ofenergy production in CBO-treated KPC-KP cells. With compromised plasma membrane integrity, intracellular proteins easily escape into the extracellular environment as suggested by Ukuku et al. (2007) [
