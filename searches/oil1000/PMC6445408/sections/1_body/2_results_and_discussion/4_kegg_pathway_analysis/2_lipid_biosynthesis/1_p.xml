 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. KEGG pathway analysis identified 4 proteins which are involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathway that were affected by CBO treatment. Two of these proteins were downregulated in CBO-treated KPC-KP cells: 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (-3.46 fold) and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyl transferase subunit alpha (-1.08 fold). While two other proteins were undetectable following CBO treatment: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and large-conductance mechanosensitive channel protein. The former two proteins are key components in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway of Gram-negative bacteria. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyl transferase is one of the major enzymes in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a substrate required in the synthesis of fatty acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase functions as an essential mediator in the synthesis of phospholipids in bacteria [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (G3PAT) was undetectable in the CBO-treated KPC-KP cells. G3PAT, a rate determining enzyme belonging to the glycerolphospholipid metabolism pathway catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidic acid from glycerol-3-phosphate and long-chain acyl-CoA, is an essential precursor in the synthesis of the bacterial phospholipid bilayer [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The absence of G3PAT indicates a perturbed bacterial membrane repair system. This further indicates a disruption in the integrity of the phospholipid membrane in CBO-treated KPC-KP cells. The absence of the large-conductance mechanosensitive channel protein in the treated group also indicated a disrupted membrane structure as this channel regulates membrane stretching and stability under osmotic stress [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Upon exposure to CBO, oxidative stress may promote protein denaturation and so affect bacterial cell membrane stretch capacity under osmotic pressure, eventually leading to increased CBO influx and bacterial cell killing.
