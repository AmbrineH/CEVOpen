<p class="p">Peptidoglycan in the cell wall is a major structural component in prokaryotic cells, forming a stable layer which protects the bacteria from lysis under osmotic stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The proteomic profile showed that three essential proteins in bacterial cell wall synthesis were lost upon exposure to CBO. This may indicate that CBO inhibited the expression of these proteins or that CBO-induced oxidative stress resulted in degradation of these proteins, so preventing cell wall synthesis and repair, and eventually causing cell death. These proteins included UDP-N-acetylglucosamineâ€”N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide) pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase (murG); penicillin-binding protein activator LpoB and succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase. The MurG protein is involved in the biosynthesis of the N-acetylmuramic acid-N-acetylglucosamine intermediate, which form a single unit of peptidoglycan cell wall. In the absence of murG, no N-acetylmuramic acid would not be linked to N-acetylglucosamine, preventing the formation of peptidoglycan bilayer linkage and eventually killing the cell due to osmotic pressure and oxidative stress [

Additionally, succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase also play a major role in maintaining the structure and integrity of the peptidoglycan, as this protein is essential in the synthesis of meso-diaminopimelic acid which is one of the penta-peptides found linked to N-acetylmuramic acid, and is crucial for the cross-linkage with the opposite layer of N-acetylglucosamine. Interestingly, penicillin-binding protein activator LpoB which stimulates the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan molecules was not detected in CBO treated KPC-KP cells. These findings may indicate that the peptidoglycan biosynthesis and repairing had been completely shut down [
