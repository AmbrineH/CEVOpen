<p class="p">Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a highly acylated saccharolipid located on the outer layer of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is crucial in the maintenance of membrane integrity and has a barrier function which prevents the passive diffusion of hydrophobic solutes, such as antibiotics and detergents into the cell [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Many studies have postulated that CBO exerts its bactericidal activity through damage to the outer membrane which allows other bactericidal molecules to enter the cell, eventually killing the cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. LPS consist of a few components including lipid A; core oligosaccharide and O-antigen [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. We identified three proteins that are involved in LPS biosynthesis that became undetectable upon CBO exposure. These were O-antigen export system ATP-binding protein (RfbB); UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinoseâ€”oxoglutarate aminotransferase (arnB) and UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (lpxC). In order to achieve resistance towards antibiotics such as polymyxin, the 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose moiety must be added to the lipid A [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. This reaction is catalyzed by the arnB protein which is not detected in the KPC-KP cells exposed to CBO. Furthermore, lpxC protein, a critical enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of lipid A was also undetectable in CBO-treated KPC-KP cells. 90% of the bacterial outer membrane consists of lipid A, which is crucial for the attachment of core oligosaccharide as well as o-antigen, granting antibiotic resistance to bacteria while maintaining the membrane integrity. In the absence of the lpxC protein, the outer membrane integrity cannot be maintained, compromising cellular resistance against antibiotics. Due to the importance of this protein in lipid A biosynthesis, lpxC has been a target for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The O-antigen export system ATP-binding protein, which facilitates the export of O-antigen into the outer membrane was also not detected following exposure to CBO. Thus, CBO may contain compounds that inhibit the expression of these important membrane proteins and sensitize bacteria to antibiotics and changes in osmotic pressure.
