<p class="p">CBO contains a plethora of different chemical compounds which are dominated by a large group of oxygenated terpenes and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. These compounds are hypothesized to be responsible for CBO’s action on the bacterial membrane. From our proteomic data, upregulation of proteins such as autonomous glycyl radical cofactor and catalase peroxidase in the CBO-treated KPC-KP cells suggest the presence of significant oxidative stress. Autonomous glycyl radical cofactor is upregulated by 7.07 fold, and acts as a radical domain which protects pyruvate formate lyase from oxidative stress. Wagner et al. (2001) and Shisler et al. (2014) found that upregulation of glycyl radical cofactor indicates oxidative stress which affects the pyruvate formate lyase that is involved in glucose metabolism [

 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In addition, catalase peroxidase, an enzyme which alleviates oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS), was also induced when KPC-KP cells were exposed to CBO. Under condition of oxidative stress, high abundance ROS cause oxidative damage to nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The detection of the DNA mismatch repair protein MutS and the DNA ligase following the exposure to CBO showed that genetic materials of KPC-KP had been damaged, and that elevated expression of these proteins could alleviate some of the oxidative DNA damage. The work of Vogel et al. (2011) showed that oxidative stress leads to the degradation of ribosomal protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and this appears to be in line with our findings in CBO-treated KPC-KP cells where 14 ribosomal proteins and ribosome related proteins showed decreased abundance. Specifically, 30S ribosomal protein S3; 50S ribosomal proteins L17, L32, L34 and L5; ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase; ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase E, F and I; ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase B and G; ribosome maturation factor M and P, and ribosome binding factor A were all reduced in abundance. As one of the key proteins in the maturation of 30S ribosomal subunit, ribosome maturation factor RimP protein is crucial in the process of protein translation by allowing correct pairing of the mRNA and the corresponding anticodon of the tRNA [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In agreement with this finding is the decrease in abundance of the other three 50S ribosomal subunit fragments namely, L5, L17 and L32. This further supports the idea that induction of oxidative stress by CBO affects the abundance of ribosomal subunit fragments, as a result of the denaturation of protein fragments or the interruption of protein synthesis in KPC-KP cells. Cosentino et al. (2014) found that bergamot essential oil induced the production of ROS in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, contributing to enhanced eradication of infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Another study by Yoo et al (2005) also suggest that eugenol, one of the main constituents of essential oils such as from nutmeg and cinnamon bark induces the production of ROS in leukemia cells, eventually killing the cells by initiating apoptosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The induction of oxidative stress by essential oils seems to be in conflict with the perception that essential oils contain high concentration of antioxidants. We previously found that the CBO used in this study comprised 13 compounds, of which nine were antioxidants whereas the other four were not [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. These non-antioxidant compounds may be responsible for inducing the oxidative stress observed, by generating ROS or inhibiting anti-oxidizing systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Mimica-Dukić et al. (2016) suggested that essential oils may act both as antioxidants and also as pro-oxidant due to their complex chemistry [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Additionally, a single compound might exhibit dual antioxidant and prooxidant effects. For instance, Bezerra et al. (2017) found that eugenol had such dual effects, acting as an antioxidant in free-radical scavenging while inducing DNA damage via ROS generation [
 <xref rid="pone.0214326.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. So, the prooxidant activity within CBO may contribute to the oxidative stress, leading to lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, while inhibiting the antioxidant activity, as indicated in the proteomic profile.
