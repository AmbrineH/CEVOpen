  <title class="title">Comparative proteomic analysis of protein from CBO-treated KPC-KP cells.</title>
  <p class="p">(A) Venn diagram of the total protein obtained from non-treated KPC-KP and CBO-treated KPC-KP cells, a total of 394 proteins were identified in non-treated KPC-KPs (384 proteins) and CBO-treated KPC-KPs (242 proteins) together. These total proteins were categorized based on the related biological process (B), cellular component (D) and molecular function (F). The numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes were also compared with respect to the relevant biological process (C), cellular component (E) and molecular function (G). Gene ontology analysis in terms of biological process of protein with significant abundance from CBO-treated KPC-KP cells.</p>
