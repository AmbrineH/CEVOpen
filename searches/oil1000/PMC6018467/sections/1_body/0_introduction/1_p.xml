<p class="p">Honey bees (
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera</italic>) are social insects that live in highly organized colonies, consisting of a queen, many workers, and some drones. Division of labor among the workers is age-dependent (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Winston, 1987</xref>). Young bees mostly work inside the colony, whereas older bees engage in foraging. Honey bee foraging behavior, as well as other characteristics of the honey bee, makes them the most important pollinator in commercial crops (

Nectar is the main source of carbohydrates and pollen provides micro- and macro-nutrients, including proteins, fatty acids (FA), vitamins, and minerals. Bees prefer to collect pollen from a variety of plants (
