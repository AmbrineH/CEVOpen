<p class="p">Because of the low prevalence of omega-3 in the modern western diet, most researches have focused on the impact of deficiency of this FA. In mammals, the importance of omega-3 fatty acids is well known. These fatty acids constitute a major proportion of total FAs of brain, retina, and sperm in humans and other mammals (

These findings showed, that similar to mammals, omega-3 fatty acids have a crucial role for cognitive function of honey bees.
