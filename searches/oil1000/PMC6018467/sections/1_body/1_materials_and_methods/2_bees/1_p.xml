<p class="p">Bees were of the local strain of honey bees, which is based mostly on the Italian bee, 
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera ligustica</italic>. We placed sealed brood combs from ordinary hives in an incubator overnight. The following day we randomly collected up to 24 h-old bees that emerged in the incubator and placed them inside 9-cm petri-dishes with filter paper at the bottom, in groups of five bees. To each petri-dish we added two 1-ml Eppendorf feeders, one with diet and one with water. The bees were fed one of the diet treatments for 1 week, as in 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arien et al. (2015)</xref>; pollen consumption is mostly by young bees during the first days after emergence (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crailsheim et al., 1992</xref>). Diet consumption per dish was calculated by weighing the feeders at the beginning and after the 1 week in the incubator, taking into account weight loss due to evaporation by having for each diet a control dish with no bees. The diets contained honey so there was no need for supplemental carbohydrates. Then the bees were taken for olfactory conditioning of the proboscis-extension response (PER) experiments. There were between 31 and 34 bees in each treatment in PER experiments.
