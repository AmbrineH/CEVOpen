<p class="p">Learning performance was affected also by the diet lipids content; bees fed a low-fat diet of 1% lipids had the lowest learning curve, regardless of the omega-6:3 ratio. Thus, even a diet whose EFA contents was strongly biased toward omega-3 (with omega-6:3 ratio of 0.3), could not support good learning when the total lipid content (and therefore the absolute amount of omega-3) was too low. The reported range of pollen lipids content is between 2 and 20%; the range is reduced to between 3 and 8% for bee bread, which consists of a mixture of several pollens stored in cells within the hive (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we show that for good learning ability lipid levels should be between 2 and 8% with peak performance at 4% total lipids. Relatively high pollen lipid concentration is also important for proper brood development. 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di Pasquale et al. (2013)</xref> found that young nurse bees developed well when fed several pollens with total lipid contents of between 6.4 and 7.4%.
