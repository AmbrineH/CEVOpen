 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andruchow et al. (2017)</xref> found a correlation in healthy older adults between dietary ratio of omega-6:3 and spatial cognition; those whose diet contained a lower omega-6:3 ratio had better spatial memory and performed better in navigation tests. Similarly, rats fed lower omega-6:3 ratio diets performed better in a task requiring navigating a maze (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hajjar et al., 2012</xref>). Similarities between bees and mammals in the detrimental effects of high dietary omega-6:3 ratio on learning performance suggests that similar to mammals, also bee spatial cognition might be impaired by high omega-6:3 ratio. Honey bees have sophisticated navigation and orientation abilities, which are crucial for colony survival (
