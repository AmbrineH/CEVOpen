 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Klein et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we tested the effect of a pollen-substitute diet on the performance of 8-day-old bees. The typical task of young bees at this age is to be nurses, which attend to and feed the larvae (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Amdam, 2011</xref>). We have previously shown that the impaired learning performance due to omega-3 deficiency could not be attributed solely to impairment of olfactory perception, as tactile associative learning was equally affected (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arien et al., 2015</xref>). We are currently testing specifically whether olfactory perceptual abilities are also affected by omega-6:3 imbalances. It remains to be determined how impairment of olfactory perception and/or of olfactory associative learning would impact the ability of nurse bees to raise larvae.
