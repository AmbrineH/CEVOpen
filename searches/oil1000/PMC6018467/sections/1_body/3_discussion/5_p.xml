<p class="p">It is debated whether honey bee foragers can assess the nutritional value of pollen, especially with regards to its protein contents (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zarchin et al., 2017</xref>). However, in choice experiments, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hendriksma and Shafir (2016)</xref> recently showed that honey bee foragers preferred to collect diets that balanced their nutritional deficiencies, including in essential amino acids and EFAs. Furthermore, when a colony was fed pollen lacking a specific EFA, foragers attempted to compensate for this deficiency at the colony level by evaluating complementary pollen as more attractive in their recruitment dances (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zarchin et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it appears that a honey bee colony needs a balanced omega-6:3 diet, and that it attempts to selectively forage so as to achieve it. The geometric framework approach to nutrition (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>) has been applied lately to assess the macronutrient requirements of honey bees, for example the balance between proteins and carbohydrates (
