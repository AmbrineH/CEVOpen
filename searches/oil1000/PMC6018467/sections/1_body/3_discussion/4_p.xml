<p class="p">In a study in which pollen was collected by hand from 28 different plant species, the range of omega-6:3 ratio was between 0.09 and 5.34 (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arien et al., 2015</xref>). The highest values were of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> trees. Our results suggest that a colony situated in a 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> monoculture forest would suffer from this high omega-6:3 ratio. There are other crops that are grown in monocultures, and which have relatively high omega-6:3 ratio pollen, which are probably not ideal for a colony. However, when a colony is situated in a habitat with diverse vegetation, it tends to collect pollen from several plants at the same time (
