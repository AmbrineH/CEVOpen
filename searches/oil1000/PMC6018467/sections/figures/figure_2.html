 <p> Performance in olfactory conditioning of bees fed diets with omega-6:3 ratio of 0.3 ( N = 133), 1 ( N = 132), or 5 ( N = 136). Data are pooled for all four total lipid concentrations tested. (A) Learning curves show the proportion of bees that extended their proboscis to the conditioned odors in each of six trials with each odor. The full lines show learning curves to a positively rewarded conditioned stimulus (CS+). The dashed lines represent response to the negatively rewarded conditioned stimulus (CSâ€“). (B) Shows the response to the sucrose reward, unconditioned stimulus (US+). Different letters represent statistically significant difference between treatments (Tukey HSD test, P &lt; 0.05). </p>
