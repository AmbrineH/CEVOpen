 <p> Mean of learning index of the bees for each of the different diets. The learning index for each bee is the difference between the sum of responses during the last three trials to the positively rewarded (sugar) odor (CS+) and the sum of responses during the last three trials to the negatively rewarded (salt) odor (CS-). The numbers at the bottom of bars represent sample size. Different letters represent statistically significant difference between treatments (Tukeyâ€™s test, P &lt; 0.05). </p>
