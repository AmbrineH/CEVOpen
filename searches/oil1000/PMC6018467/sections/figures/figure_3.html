 <p> Average of performance in olfactory conditioning of bees according to percentage of lipids in the diet. (A) Learning curves show the proportion of bees that extended their proboscis to the conditioned odor in each of six trials with each odor. The full lines show learning curves to a positively rewarded conditioned stimulus (CS+). The dashed lines represent the negative rewarded conditioned stimulus (CS-). (B) Shows the response to the sucrose reward, unconditioned stimulus (US+). Different letters represent statistically significant difference between treatments (Tukey HSD test, P &lt; 0.05). </p>
