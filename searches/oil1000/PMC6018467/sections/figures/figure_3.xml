  <p class="p">Average of performance in olfactory conditioning of bees according to percentage of lipids in the diet. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Learning curves show the proportion of bees that extended their proboscis to the conditioned odor in each of six trials with each odor. The full lines show learning curves to a positively rewarded conditioned stimulus (CS+). The dashed lines represent the negative rewarded conditioned stimulus (CS-). 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Shows the response to the sucrose reward, unconditioned stimulus (US+). Different letters represent statistically significant difference between treatments (Tukey HSD test,
