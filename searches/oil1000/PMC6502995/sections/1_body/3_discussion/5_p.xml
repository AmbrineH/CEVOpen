<p class="p">Hematoxylin and eosin-stained brain tissue showed increased neurodegeneration with pyknotic nuclei observed in disease control group. Cardamom oil treatment ameliorated these degenerative changes in the hippocampus and cortex region of the brain due to its neuroprotective action. It has been reported that aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) are the main culprits in the pathogenesis of AD which leads to neurodegeneration (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). Also, AChE promotes the aggregation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are pathological features of AD (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). It has been reported that accumulation of aluminum in the brain is responsible for the formation and deposition of amyloid beta protein (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>). Multifocal moderate deposition of Aβ plaques observed in disease control group. However, treatment with cardamom oil showed a decrease in deposition of Aβ plaques in hippocampus and cortex region. In Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis expression of Aβ significantly increased in the disease control group. In present study, treatment with cardamom oil showed significant reduction in Aβ expression in hippocampus and cortex region of the brain. It has been reported that expression of BDNF decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease (

 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies has been reported that BDNF enhances central cholinergic neurotransmission. (
