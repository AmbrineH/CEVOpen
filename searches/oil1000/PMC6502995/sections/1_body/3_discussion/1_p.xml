<p class="p">Several genetical and environmental factors are involved in etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Genetic mutation related to both metabolism and expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are considered to be important for diagnosis of familial Alzheimer's disease (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). In addition, exposure to environmental metals for long time instigate neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). Aluminum (Al) exposure occurs mainly through occupational, environment and dietary factors for humans (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>). Aluminum has a cholinotoxin nature which causes apoptotic neuronal loss that lead to neurodegeneration associated with AD (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Aluminum is non-redox trivalent cation and has been recognized as a causative factor in various neurological disorders due to its neurotoxicity (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>). Accumulation of aluminum in the brain has been reported to be one of the contributing factor in AD, where aluminum affects integrity and permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) by altering the lipophilic characteristics of the same.(

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>). Deposition of amyloid beta, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>), increase in AChE activity (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>), imbalance in level of neurotransmitters, inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>), memory and learning deficits (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>) are important manifestations caused due to aluminum neurotoxicity, which is involved in the etiology of AD (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>). Also mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation are strongly associated with neuronal cell death, which is observed in Alzheimer's disease (
