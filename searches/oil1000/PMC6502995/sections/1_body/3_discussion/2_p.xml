<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis showed the main constituent of cardamom oil is 1,8 Cineole (31.09%). Study reported that 1,8 cineole inhibits AChE

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>) in neurodegenerative disease like AD. So it has been proposed that treatment with 1,8 cineole rich cardamom oil can be useful and one of the important alternative in pharmacotherapy of AD. The results of present study showed that AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> administration resulted into progressive deterioration of spatial and recognition memory in rats. EPM test is used for determination of spatial learning and memory by measuring initial transfer latency (ITL) and retention transfer latency. In this test, decrease in RTL after ITL determination indicated improvement in recognition memory of rats. Cardamom oil treatment significantly reduced RTL of rats as compared to aluminum chloride treated group. MWM test is used to evaluate cognitive functions related to spatial learning by measuring escape latency (EL). EL is the time required to locate the hidden submerged platform. Decrease in EL indicated improvement in spatial learning and memory of rats. In this study, cardamom oil administration significantly decreased EL of rats as compared to aluminum chloride treated group indicating improvement in learning and memory skills. Accumulation of aluminum in the brain interfere with long term potentiating molecule such as cyclic GMP which leads to an impairment in glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway that results into cognitive impairments and neurobehavioral deficits in animals (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>). Cardamom oil treatment reversed the spatial cognitive impairment. PA is a fear-motivated test used to evaluate short term and long term memory by recording pre and post-shock latencies. An increased in post-shock latency was observed in rats treated with cardamom oil as compared to the aluminum chloride treated group. In this test, the increase in post-shock latency after the pre-shock latency indicated improvement in recognition memory of rats. In present study, aluminum chloride treatment showed reduction in retention latency due to anxiogenic-like behavior in animals, cardamom oil treatment showed increase in retention latency. This activity may be due to neuroprotective effect of cardamom oil. Substantial locomotion impairment was observed in disease rats; previous literature reports of chronic AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> administration have been shown, a decrease in locomotion activity as well, which is implicated to be a central nervous system depression (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>). Treatment with cardamom oil improved locomotor activity and behavioral impairments in rats.
