<p class="p">Lipid peroxidation is one of the important biomarker of oxidative stress. It has been reported that aluminum activates and stimulates lipid peroxidation in presence of iron in the brain (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>). Aluminum increases iron-induced oxidative injury by enhancing iron-based oxidation in the brain that alters iron homeostasis mainly via the Fenton reaction (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>). As increased in oxidative stress lead to inhibition of various endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione due to redox reaction which have crucial role against free radical damage (

In our study, aluminum chloride treatment showed marked increase in oxidative stress in the brain which was indicated by decrease in level of catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level leading to neuronal damage (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>). In the present study, treatment with cardamom oil reduced oxidative damage by increasing catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione levels and by decreasing MDA level.
