<p class="p">Cardamom oil treatment produced improvement in the neurobehavioral parameters like cognitive functions and anti-anxiety effect. It also inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in hippocampus and cortex and improved glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation levels in the brain indicating reduction in oxidative damage. Treatment with cardamom oil also reduced neuronal degeneration by increasing BDNF level and inhibiting amyloid β expression in hippocampus and cortex. The formation of amyloid β plaque was inhibited by cardamom oil treatment. Cardamom oil showed a neuroprotective effect via inhibition of AChE activity and reduction in oxidative stress. As there are limited approaches for AD management; cardamom oil may provide a safe, economic and therapeutic alternative in the management of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
