Paraffin wax embedded tissue blocks were cut and transverse sections at 5–6 μm thickness were taken with the microtome (Leica, USA) and placed on slides coated with Poly-L-Lysine and placed in an incubator overnight at 37°C for 1 h. Further these sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and incubated with citrate buffer, pH 6 at decloaking chamber. Slides were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide block for 20 min to block endogenous peroxidase. β-Amyloid (B-4) antibody and pro BDNF (5H8) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) were applied as the primary antibody and secondary antibody like mouse anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) was used. The staining was visualized by reaction with diaminobenzidine (DAB) reagent and further counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were rinsed with Tris buffer saline (TBS) and dehydrated in alcohol and cleared in xylene prior to mounting using DPX. All the sections were examined under the digital microscope (Motic, Canada) to record the intensity of antigen antibody reaction. The observation of the sections was carried out at 400X. For immunohistochemistry analysis six slides per group were evaluated for hippocampal and cortical region (complete section). Morphometric analysis was carried to observe extent of immunoreactivity. Optical density (OD) was determined as measure of amyloid β and BDNF expression in hippocampus and cortex by analyzing the images with ImageJ 1.51a software (NIH, USA).
