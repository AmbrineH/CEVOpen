<p class="p">Cardamom oil was analyzed by GC-MS using Agilent 6890 N Network GC system. Capillary column used was BPX 35 (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm) coated with 35% Phenyl Polysilphenylene-siloxane using helium as a carrier gas (1.0 ml/min). The temperature programme started with 50°C to 220°C at a rate of 10°C per minute, split ratio was kept 1:25 and flame ionization detector (FID) was used during analysis. The acquisition mass range was kept 40–400 amu. Two percent solution of cardamom oil was prepared in ethanol (95%) and two replicates of the samples processed in the same way. The injection volume was kept 1.0 μl. The identification of the compounds from the oil sample was done and compared them with respect to their retention times (RT) and mass spectra that obtained from authentic Wiley libraries (available through Hewlett Packard) and the literature (
