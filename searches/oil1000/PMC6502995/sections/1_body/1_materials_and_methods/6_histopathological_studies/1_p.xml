<p class="p">Brain tissues stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) (4 g of sodium phosphate monobasic anhydrous, 8.15 g sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 100 ml formalin, and 900 ml distilled water) were used for histopathology study. It was fixed in paraffin blocks and thin transverse sections of 5 μm thickness were taken using microtome (Leica, USA) of hippocampus and cortex region. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Congo red dye and examined under digital microscope (Motic, Canada). The observations of the sections were carried out at 400X. For histology analysis six slides per group were evaluated for cortical and hippocampal region (complete section). Morphometric analysis was carried out for evaluation of the extent of neurodegeneration and amyloid beta deposition in brain (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>) and severity index was considered as No Abnormality Detected, Minimal (&lt;1%), Mild (1–25%), Moderate (26–50%), Marked/Moderately Severe (51–75%), Severe (76–100%), and distribution was recorded as focal, multifocal and diffuse. Optical density (OD) was determined to measure the extent of amyloid β plaques deposited in hippocampus and cortex in congo red staining by analyzing the images with Image J 1.51a software (NIH, USA).
