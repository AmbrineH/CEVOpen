<p class="p">PA test is used to assess memory retention deficit in rodents and was performed as per earlier method described (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). The apparatus consisted of both light and dark compartment having dimensions (25 × 25 × 25 cm) of each, illuminated with a 40W bulb and a dark chamber, separated by a guillotine door. The bottom of the dark compartment equipped with a metal grid floor with a shock generator to induce electric stimuli. In the acquisition trial, the animal was placed in the light compartment and kept inside for 60 s for habituation. After this guillotine door was opened and the latency to step into dark compartment was recorded as pre-shock latency. Once the animal entered in the dark compartment, a mild electric stimulus of 0.5 mA for 2 s period was given through the grid floor and then taken out. The animal was immediately removed from the compartment and returned to the home cage. After 24 h of acquisition trial, retention trial was performed in which no electric stimulus was given when rat entered in the dark compartment. Time taken to step into dark compartment was recorded as post-shock latency in seconds.
