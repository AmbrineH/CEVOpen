<p class="p">MWM test is used to assess spatial memory task in rodents. It was performed as per earlier method described (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>) with slight modifications. A large circular swimming tank (150 cm diameter, 45 cm height) consisted of four equal quadrants (NW, NE, SE, and SW) containing water (25 ± 1°C) was used. Visual cues in the form of red and blue colored tapes were placed around the water tank for facilitation of the spatial orientation in experimental animals; positions of the cues were kept unchanged throughout the experiment. The submerged platform (10 × 10 cm), was kept 1 cm above the surface of water in the acquisition phase. During the acquisition phase, the animal was placed in the tank, facing toward the wall of tank and allowed for 120 s to locate the platform. The animal was guided to reach the platform, if failed within 120 s and placed for 30 s on the platform. Daily four trials were given to each animal for four consecutive days (17
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day) at the interval of 10 min maintained between each trial. Animal was gently placed in different quadrants of swimming tank during each trial. During the retention phase, water surface made opaque by using milk powder in order to hide the platform and kept 1 cm below the level of water in the tank. The animal was placed in the quadrant of tank facing toward the wall of the tank and retention of memory of the animal was evaluated on day 21 and 42. Escape latency was calculated by measuring time taken to locate the hidden platform by the animal in water maze.
