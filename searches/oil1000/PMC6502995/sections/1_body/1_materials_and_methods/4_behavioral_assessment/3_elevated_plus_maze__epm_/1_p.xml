<p class="p">EPM test is used to assess anxiety in rodents and was performed as per earlier method described (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). The elevated plus maze apparatus consisted of two closed walls (50 × 10 cm), transverse with two open arms with same dimensions each and having 40 cm high walls. Both the arms of EPM were connected with central square (10 × 10 cm) and maintained 50 cm height above the ground level. During the acquisition phase, the animal was placed at one end of arm, facing away from central square area. Initial transfer latency (ITL) was recorded as the time required to the animal to move from open arm to closed arm. After recording ITL, each animal was allowed to explore for 20 s inside the maze and after that returned to the home cage. Retention of memory was evaluated after 24 h by placing the animal in an open arm and the 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> transfer latency and 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> transfer latency was recorded on day 21 and 42, respectively.
