<p class="p">Hippocampus and cortex part of the brain were excised and homogenized in 10 volume of ice-cold 0.1M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) using probe homogenizer (Polytron PT 2500E, Kinematica, Switzerland). Total protein content was determined in as such homogenate as the method described by Lowry et al. (
