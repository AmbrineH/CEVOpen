<p class="p">The acetylcholinesterase activity in brain tissue was performed according to the method described by Ellman et al. (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>) with slight modifications. The assay mixture contained 0.1 ml of supernatant, 2 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 8.0) containing 0.1% BSA, 0.1 ml of dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) and 0.05 ml of acetylthiocholine iodide (AChI). The change in absorbance was measured for 2 min at 1 min interval at 412 nm using UV-VIS Spectrophotometer, (Perkin Elmer Lambda 20, USA). acetylcholinesterase activity was expressed as micromoles of acetylthiocholine iodide hydrolyzed per min per mg protein.
