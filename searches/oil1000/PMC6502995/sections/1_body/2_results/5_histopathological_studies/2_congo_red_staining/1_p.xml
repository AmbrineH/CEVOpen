 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8d</xref>) did not decrease the deposition of amyloid beta plaques to normal and showed mild to moderate plaque lesions in hippocampus and cortex region. At a dose of 200 mg/kg of cardamom oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figures 7e</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8e</xref>) treatment showed a decrease in the deposition of amyloid beta plaques and observed intact, normal histology in hippocampus and cortex when compared with disease control animals. These results are comparable to that of donepezil hydrochloride treated group (
