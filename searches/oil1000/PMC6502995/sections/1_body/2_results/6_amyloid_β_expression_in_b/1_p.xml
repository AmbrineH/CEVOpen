<p class="p">Immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampus and cortex region showed significantly increased the expression of amyloid- β in the disease control animals (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">10f</xref>). Treatment with cardamom oil at a dose of 100 mg/kg (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">Figures 9d</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">10d</xref>) did not decrease expression of amyloid- β in hippocampus and cortex to normal. However, treatment with cardamom oil at a dose of 200 mg/kg (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">Figures 9e</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">10e</xref>) showed a decrease in amyloid- β expression and showed normal histology, weak expression in hippocampus and cortex when compared with disease control animals. The results at a dose of 200 mg/kg of cardamom oil are comparable as that of donepezil hydrochloride treated group (
