<p class="p">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is clinically characterized by a decline in cognitive function and pathologically defined by the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). Deposition of β-amyloid protein results into formation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles. The major symptoms of AD include loss of cognitive functions and motor activities (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). Patients with AD have cholinergic deficits, which induces learning and memory impairments (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). Environmental factors increase the risk of AD such as exposure to metals. Heavy metals like aluminum and iron mainly affect brain development and are reported to the main progenitor in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). Exposure to aluminum causes activation of AChE enzyme which is involved in the pathogenesis of AD (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Several characteristic factors such as an increase in oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, aggregation of Aβ plaques, tau protein and decrease in acetylcholine (ACh), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain are involved in etiology of AD (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). In Alzheimer's disease, the increased activity of the AChE leads to the breakdown of the ACh that causes depletion of acetylcholine level, resulting into impaired cholinergic functions in the brain (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). It has been shown that, AChE promotes the aggregation and formation of Aβ fragments in the brain (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). It has been reported that AChE inhibitors such as donepezil hydrochloride enhance neurogenesis in the brain by decreasing AChE and increasing BDNF (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). BDNF is one of the most widely distributed neurotrophins present in the brain. BDNF plays an important role in neurogenesis, neuronal plasticity, neuronal survival, serves as a neurotransmitter modulator and is widely expressed in the brain (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). It also participates in Long Term Potentiation (LTP), an essential process involved in learning and memory (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). It has been reported that patients with certain neurologic disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>) and Parkinson's disease (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>) contain high concentration of aluminum in their autopsied brain samples. It has been reported that elevated level of aluminum specifically in the hippocampus part of a brain lead to development of amyloid beta plaques, neurofibrillay tangles in AD patients (
