<p class="p">Current pharmacotherapy for AD provides only symptomatic relief. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors e.g., galantamine, rivastigmine, donepezil hydrochloride, which produces side effects like, bronchoconstriction and hypotension and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist e.g., memantine produces side-effects like, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.(

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>) So, there is an urgent need for development of new drugs for treatment or management of AD. Now, global therapeutic research is shifting toward herbal or alternative system of medicine. Natural products have reported for their neuroprotective action in various disease pathways which are involved in the progression of AD (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). Herbal drugs are popular because people presumes that herbs are safer than synthetic drugs, though they should be used with caution as synthetic active products. Terpenoids are mixture of naturally occuring, volatile compounds which are synthesized by plants in the form of secondary metabolites. The essential oils (EOs) obtained from certain plants such as juniper oil from common juniper (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). So, essential oils may show their neuroprotective effect by down-regulation of AChE and up-regulation of BDNF in the brain.
