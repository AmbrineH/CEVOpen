 <p> Effect of Cardamom oil on H.E. stained hippocampus and cortex tissue (400X). (a) Normal control group: Hippocampus and Cortex: showing normal histology, normal neuronal cell (small arrow) {H &amp; E, 400X}, (b) AlCl 3 group: Hippocampus and Cortex: showing neuronal degeneration with pyknotic nuclei (small arrow), reduced layer of neuronal cell (Large arrow) {H &amp; E, 400X}. (c) AlCl 3 + Donepezil hydrochloride (1 mg/kg): Hippocampus and Cortex: showing normal histology, focal mild neuronal cell with pyknotic nuclei (small arrow) {H &amp; E, 400X}, (d) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (100 mg/kg): Hippocampus and Cortex: showing neuronal degeneration with pyknotic nuclei (small arrow), reduced layer of neuronal cell (Large arrow) {H &amp; E, 400X}. (e) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (200 mg/kg): Hippocampus and Cortex: showing focal mild neuronal cell with pyknotic nuclei (small arrow) {H &amp; E, 400X}. The magnification was 400X. H.E., Hematoxylin and eosin; AlCl 3, Aluminum chloride. </p>
