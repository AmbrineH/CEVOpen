 <p> Effect of cardamom oil on BDNF expression in cortex tissue (400X). (a) Normal control: Cortex: showing moderately enhanced expression of BDNF, exhibited by brown coloration at cortical neurons (arrow) {Immunostaining: BDNF, 400X}, (b) AlCl 3 group: Cortex: showing reduced expression of BDNF, exhibited by brown coloration at cortical neurons (arrow) {Immunostaining: BDNF, 400X}, (c) AlCl 3 + Donepezil hydrochloride (1 mg/kg): Cortex: showing moderately enhanced expression of BDNF, exhibited by brown coloration at cortical neurons (arrow) {Immunostaining: BDNF, 400X}, (d) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (100 mg/kg): Cortex: showing reduced expression of BDNF, exhibited by brown coloration at cortical neurons (arrow) {Immunostaining: BDNF, 400X}, (e) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (200 mg/kg): Cortex: showing mild enhanced expression of BDNF, exhibited by brown coloration at cortical neurons (arrow) {Immunostaining: BDNF, 400X,}, (f) Histogram of IHC. Data are expressed as mean Â± SEM ( n = 6), ## p &lt; 0.01 when compared with normal control, * p &lt; 0.05 when compared with disease control group. The magnification was 400X. AlCl 3, Aluminum chloride; SEM, Standard Error of Mean; BDNF, brain- derived neurotrophic factor; IHC, Immunohistochemistry. </p>
