 <p> Effect of Cardamom oil on Congo red stained cortex tissue (400X). (a) Normal control: Cortex: showing normal histology, normal neuronal cells in (small arrow) {Congo Red, 400X}, (b) AlCl 3 group: Cortex: showing multifocal moderate deposition of amyloid β plaques (arrow) {Congo Red, 400X}, (c) AlCl 3 + Donepezil hydrochloride (1 mg/kg): Cortex: showing multifocal mild deposition of amyloid β plaques (arrow) {Congo Red, 400X}, (d) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (100 mg/kg): Cortex: showing multifocal moderate deposition of amyloid β plaques (arrow) {Congo Red, 400X}, (e) AlCl 3 + Cardamom oil (200 mg/kg): Cortex: showing multifocal mild deposition of amyloid β plaques (arrow) {Congo Red, 400X} (f) Histogram of congo red staining. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM ( n = 6), ### p &lt; 0.001 when compared with normal control, ** p &lt; 0.01, * p &lt; 0.05 when compared with disease control group. The magnification was 400X. AlCl 3, Aluminum chloride; SEM, Standard Error of Mean. </p>
