<p id="p0080" class="p">Colloidal NP superparticles are an important class of materials that are self-assembled from size- and shape-controlled NPs. The typical sizes of the superparticles are in the mesoscopic regime, ranging from tens of nanometers to a few micrometers. The superparticles exhibit not only intrinsic physical characteristics of their nanometer-sized particles but also collective properties of the self-assembled NPs due to coupling effects (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>). The properties of superparticles can be tuned by the size, shape, and composition of the initial NPs. These promises have stimulated extensive research efforts to study superparticle formation. Previous works were mainly focused on noncovalent interactions between hydrophobic NPs (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). During the formation of NP-micelles, there are enough surfactants to encapsulate individual NPs to form interdigitated bilayers around individual NPs. If the NP concentration is increased in the self-assembly solutions, there is not a large enough amount of surfactants to form interdigitated bilayers around individual NPs. Instead, microemulsions are formed with NPs in oil (or organic solvent) phase. Surfactants at the interface between the oil and aqueous phases of the microemulsions shield the NPs from the aqueous phase to form stable NP/solvent/water microemulsions. Thus NPs are confined within the microemulsion droplets. Subsequent self-assembly is initiated by evaporation of organic solvents through heating or vacuum. Evaporation of organic solvents progressively enriches the concentration of the NPs in microemulsion droplets, which induces the noncovalent interactions and self-assembly to produce superparticles (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). In this process, self-assembly is based on a subtle balance of entropy arguments and van der Waals attractions between NPs and the alkane chains of the ligands located on the NPs. The alkane chains of the surfactants from the aqueous phase spontaneously interdigitate with the alkane chains of the primary ligands located on the outside surface of the NP assemblies through hydrophobic-hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. The resultant colloidal NP superparticles can be well dispersed in aqueous solution and can be collected and purified by centrifugation or filtration.
