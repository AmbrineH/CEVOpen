 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. The diameters of these superparticle spheres range from 50 to 200 nm, depending on the size of the microemulsion droplets formed for a given set of the designed experimental conditions. The diameter of the colloidal spheres can be controlled by adjusting the emulsification processes, NP concentrations in the oil phase, surfactant concentrations in the water phase, and oil-to-water ratio. A stronger emulsification process gives smaller emulsion droplets, and thus produces smaller superparticles (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). For example, CdS superparticles with a diameter larger than 500 nm were obtained by stirring (greater than 1,500 rpm), and superparticle spheres with a diameter less than 300 nm were obtained by strong sonication emulsification. In addition, higher NP concentrations in the oil phase result in a larger sphere diameter due to the increased NP numbers in the emulsion. Accordingly, decreasing the surfactant concentrations in the water phase or increasing the oil-to-water ratio results in larger emulsion droplets and thus increases the diameter of the products. It is interesting to note that extra amounts of surfactants in both the oil and water phases play an important role in stabilizing microemulsion droplets. In some cases when extra surfactants are used, hollow assembly structures can be obtained instead of solid superparticle spheres. For example, Park et al. prepared vesicle-like 2D assembled iron oxide nanostructures by adding extra sodium oleate (
