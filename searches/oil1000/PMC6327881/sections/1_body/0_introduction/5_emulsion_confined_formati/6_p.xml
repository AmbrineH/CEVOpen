<p id="p0105" class="p">In the above discussions, we have highlighted the superparticles that are formed from one type of NPs. Multicomponent NP nanostructures self-assembled from more than one type of NPs represent a new pathway for generating complex active superparticles with multiple functions for various technological applications (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). These multicomponent NP nanostructures not only enhance the size-dependent properties of their individual components but also manifest novel interactions and synergistic properties from the near-field coupling that occurs between neighboring NPs.
