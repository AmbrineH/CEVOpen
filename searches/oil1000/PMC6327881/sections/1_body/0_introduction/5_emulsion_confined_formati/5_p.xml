 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park et al., 2016</xref>). In the assembly, the emulsion was initiated with a chloroform solution of iron oxide NPs in an aqueous solution of CTAB under stirring. By evaporating chloroform from the emulsion overnight at 40°C, hollow vesicle-like NP structures were formed instead of solid superparticles. They found that oil-in-water pickering emulsion droplets were initially formed upon mixing the two phases, allowing the oil-water interfaces to be stabilized by both surfactants and NPs. As chloroform diffused out and was evaporated and water diffused in over time, the polarity of the core solvent increased and more NPs accumulated at the interface. Finally, NPs were trapped into a curved 2D membrane structure encasing water. When evaporating chloroform at a high temperature, the thermodynamically stable structure of compact spherical assemblies was formed. It is interesting to note that the relatively high solubility of chloroform in water (25°C, 0.82% w/w) also promotes the formation of hollow assemblies, as it allows for the exchange of the two solvents while keeping the hollow structure intact.
