<p id="p0115" class="p">Recently, Dong et al. prepared self-assembled superparticles of Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs with doped TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanorods by using the surfactant-assisted self-assembly (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xue et al., 2018</xref>). They found that the superparticles exhibit highly enhanced electrochemical properties, such as high specific capacity, rate capacity, and stable cycle performance of lithium storage. The significantly enhanced performance resulted from the synergistic effect between the co-assembled Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs. First, the co-assembled Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs improved the poor conductivity of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> superparticles. Second, the Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs with a higher theoretical capacity contributed to the capacity of superparticles. Finally, the porosity and stability of the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> matrix provided enough stable void space to buffer the volume expansion of the Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs, which improved cycling stability.
