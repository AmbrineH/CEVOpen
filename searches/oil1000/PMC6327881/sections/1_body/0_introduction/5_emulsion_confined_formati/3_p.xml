<p id="p0090" class="p">Temperature has been identified to be an important factor influencing the surfactant-assisted self-assembly because heating is needed to evaporate the organic solvents to induce NP self-assembly. Too high temperature could cause NP sinter and could chemically change the chemical and physical structures and properties of the NPs. In general, temperatures lower than 100°C are enough to remove most organic solvents, such as chloroform and toluene, without sintering the NPs. Depending on the boiling points of the solvents, solvents such as chloroform can be readily removed at room temperature. It is also noted that if the evaporation times are much longer than the self-assembly equilibration time of the colloidal systems, disordered assemblies (icosahedral colloidal clusters) can be formed (
