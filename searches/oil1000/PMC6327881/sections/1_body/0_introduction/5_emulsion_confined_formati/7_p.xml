<p id="p0110" class="p">Using the surfactant-assisted self-assembly process, Zhang et al. successfully prepared Au/CdSe superparticles that exhibit dual functions from both Au and CdSe (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Au NPs of specific sizes (2.8, 4.6, 7.2, or 9.0 nm) and CdSe QDs of size 3.3 nm were assembled into large spherical superparticles of diameter ∼100 nm. They controlled the spatial distribution of Au NPs and CdSe QDs in the assembly by changing the weight ratio of the two components. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping showed a uniform distribution of Cd and Se over the whole cluster, with Au dispersed sporadically (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). Using finite-difference time-domain modeling, time-resolved PL spectra, and wavelength-dependent illumination tests, they presented strong evidence of an efficient plasmon resonance energy transfer from the Au NPs to the CdSe QDs, which enhances charge carrier generation in the semiconductor and suppresses bulk recombination. The additional electron-hole pairs in adjacent CdSe QDs contributed significantly to the enhanced photocatalytic H
