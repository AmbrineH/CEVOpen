When evaporating at 70°C, ordered CdSe superparticles were formed. In this situation, the thermal energy facilitated adjustment of the spatial position of the NPs and counteracted the loss of the configurational entropy, which resulted in the formation of highly ordered superparticles. However, when the temperature was decreased to 40°C, random superparticles were obtained because the thermal energy was not sufficient to overcome the loss of configurational entropy. In addition, only monodispersed QD-DTAB micelles were obtained without an additional heat source (stay at 20°C). Because of the ordered structure, the NPs within the superparticles are highly compacted, which promotes coupling and electronic energy transfer between CdSe QDs. Therefore, the acquired QD superparticles exhibited different optical properties and enhanced photoelectric activity compared with the original QDs.
