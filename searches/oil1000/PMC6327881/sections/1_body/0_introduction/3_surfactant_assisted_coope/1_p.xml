In aqueous solutions, they form aggregates, such as micelles, which are tiny (5–50 nm) structures with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior. In simple terms, the hydrophilic heads link up in an aqueous solution to create a spherical shell that encapsulates the hydrophobic tails away from the solution. Hydrophobic NPs or precursors can be encapsulated within the hydrophobic micellar interiors, as typically happens with hydrophobic NPs or oil-like species. As noted above, other surfactant aggregates such as mesophases can also form depending on the concentration and types of surfactants. Growth from NPs to seed structures and then to final highly ordered superstructures through cooperative interactions between NPs is confined within the micelles (or other surfactant aggregates), giving rise to uniform and complex 1D–3D NP active nanostructures.
