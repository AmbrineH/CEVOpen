 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. First, the building blocks need to be hydrophobic for encapsulation inside the micelles. Second, heating is required to remove the oil phase or organic solvents from the emulsions to initiate the self-assembly process. The temperature should be higher than the boiling point of the oil or solvents and lower than that of water. Higher temperatures (more than 70°C) are usually used to prepare ordered superparticles, because the thermal energy facilitated adjustment of the spatial position of the NPs and counteracted the loss of the configurational entropy. Otherwise, when the temperature was decreased to 40°C, random superparticles were obtained because the thermal energy was not sufficient to overcome the loss of configurational entropy. Third, the self-assembly process critically relies on the surfactant concentrations. The surfactant concentrations should be equal to the critical micelle concentration or higher to induce the formation of NP-micelles. Depending on the surfactant concentration, surfactant mesophases can be formed for complex NP superstructures. Finally, as the final nanostructures relied on the interdigitation between the organic ligands and surfactant hydrophobic tail groups, alkane chains of surfactants and organic ligands with a minimum of 8–10 carbons are desirable to stabilize NP-micelles and other NP superstructures.
