<p id="p0015" class="p">In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly of NPs using amphiphilic surfactants and NPs to synthesize new classes of highly ordered active nanostructures. We start with a brief overview of the concept of the surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly. Then detailed discussions will be made on how the approach works with nanoscale materials of different dimensions, such as spherical NPs, 1D nanorods, and 2D nanosheets in active nanostructures. We highlight some promising applications of these self-assembled nanostructures in the areas of nanoelectronics, photocatalysis, and biomedicine. Finally, we conclude with the current research progress and our perspectives on the challenges and some future directions.</p>
