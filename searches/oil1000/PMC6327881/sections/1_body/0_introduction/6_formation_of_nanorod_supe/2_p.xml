The chloroform solution containing these hydrophobic nanorods is first mixed with an aqueous solution of DTAB followed by evaporation of chloroform to form water-soluble micelles. Then, the nanorod micelle solution was injected into ethylene glycol under vigorous stirring. This second step results in the loss of DTAB molecules into the growth solution, which leads to the aggregation of nanorods and the eventual formation of the 3D assembly structures. The resulting nanostructures have multiple well-defined supercrystalline domains with configurations and sizes that are dependent on the total number (N) of constituent nanorods in each nanostructure (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). The 3D double-domed cylindrical structure is obtained when N is less than ∼80,000. This double-domed cylinder consists of seven distinct domains wherein the nanorods within a single domain are arranged parallel to each other, whereas the nanorods of neighboring domains are arranged normal to each other. Interestingly, it was found that when the nanorods are incubated with octylamine before micelle preparation, 3D needle-like nanostructures having only one supercrystalline domain are obtained. It has been demonstrated that when unidirectionally aligned in polydimethylsiloxane thin films, these 3D needles exhibit anisotropic PL property with strong linearly polarized emissions. This anisotropic optical property is believed to be caused by resonance energy transfer through dipole-dipole interactions within the self-assembled CdSe-CdS nanorods. These specific anisotropic nanostructures display great promise as downconversion phosphors for polarized light-emitting diodes. In addition to CdSe-CdS nanorods, PbSeO
