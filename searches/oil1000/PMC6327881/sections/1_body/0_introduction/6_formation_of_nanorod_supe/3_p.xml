<p id="p0135" class="p">These results show that anisotropic interactions of nanorods can be used to synthesize superparticles with multiple well-defined supercrystalline domains. The anisotropic interactions between these nanorods can be kinetically introduced during self-assembly, leading to the formation of anisotropic assembled structures. It is anticipated that these findings can be extended for the self-assembly of nanomaterials having other anisotropic shapes, as well as the self-assembly of two or more types of anisotropic nanomaterials into well-defined mesoscopic and macroscopic complex architectures.</p>
