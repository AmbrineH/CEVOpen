<p id="p0125" class="p">In the above discussion, spherical NPs have been very well demonstrated in the surfactant-assisted self-assembly process for synthesis of superparticles. By using multiple compositions of NPs, complex superparticles can also be readily produced to achieve multiple functions. It has been shown that nonspherical NPs, such as nanorods, can also be used for the synthesis of superparticles that exhibit anisotropic properties.</p>
