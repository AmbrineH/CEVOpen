 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). Organizing NPs into highly ordered arrays, or the so-called “metamaterials,” which exhibit collective electronic, magnetic, and optical behaviors, enables their great potential for nanoelectronic and nanophotonic applications (

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2008</xref>). There are numerous recent examples of organizing uniformly sized NPs into ordered arrays or superstructures in processes such as solvent evaporation, solution growth, Langmuir-Blodgett receptor-ligand interactions, and layer-by-layer assembly (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hong et al., 2017</xref>). NPs are stabilized through surface functionalization with organic ligands or active surfaces. These ligands protect the NPs from aggregation on the one hand and render the driving forces for self-assembly and formation of NP superstructures on the other hand. To date, most previous works focus on the NPs functionalized with alkane chains as the ligand (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kovalenko et al., 2015</xref>). The nature of alkane chains causes the resultant NPs to be hydrophobic and to dissolve only in organic solvents (e.g., toluene). As such, methods such as solvent evaporation, solution growth, and Langmuir-Blodgett have been explored to form highly ordered well-defined NP nanostructures through balanced interparticle interactions, such as hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, repulsion, and dipolar interactions. Methods such as solvent evaporation and solution growth lead to 3D superlattice or supercrystals, whereas uniform 2D monolayer of NP arrays can be formed by using the Langmuir-Blodgett approach. Besides these alkane-chain-functionalized hydrophobic NPs, other NP active surfaces such as DNA biofunctionalization have been explored (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hong et al., 2017</xref>). One can use DNA as molecular scaffolds to control NP self-assembly to form hierarchical NP nanostructures that resemble DNA scaffolds (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hong et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, these self-assembled NP nanostructures provide well-defined systems for studies of NP coupling and interactions for optoelectronic applications. In recent reviews, these progresses have been very well documented (
