<p id="p0165" class="p">The additional morphologies and structure control of the porphyrin nanocrystals benefit mainly from the intermolecular forces between the porphyrin and surfactants compared with the spherical NP self-assembly discussed above. Besides van der Waals forces, additional noncovalent interactions between surfactant and porphyrin, such as hydrogen bonding, aromatic π-π stacking, and axial coordination, provide rich options for forming different morphologies and sizes during the self-assembly process. For example, in the tin porphyrin octahedral nanocrystals, the porphyrin macrocycles lie flat in the a-b plane with the core Sn at the corners and centers of the unit cells. As such, each porphyrin has 12 neighbors with which it interacts, 8 neighbors offset above and below its plane (stronger interactions) and 4 neighbors in-plane (weaker interactions). Periodic semiempirical calculations (PM6) find the crystal binding energy to be 72 kJ/mol, which is far greater than the energy of thermal motion. This indicates that the self-assembly process is controlled by molecular interaction other than thermodynamics that occur in the NP systems, which results in diverse morphologies compared with NP assembly systems.</p>
