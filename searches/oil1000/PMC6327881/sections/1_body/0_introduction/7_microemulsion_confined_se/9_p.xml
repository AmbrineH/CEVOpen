<p id="p0180" class="p">In the case of THPP self-assembly, THPP was first alkalized to make a water-soluble precursor (
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Although THPP has four hydroxyl groups at the outer core of the porphyrin, it is not soluble in water. To initiate the self-assembly in aqueous phase, it is first alkalized so that its hydroxyl groups are deprotonated to form tetrahydroxy TPP
 <sup class="sup">4−</sup> anions that are soluble in water solutions. Then the TPP
 <sup class="sup">4−</sup> basic solution was added into an acidic surfactant solution under vigorous stirring to initiate the acid-base neutralization reaction. The four hydroxyl groups were recovered from the corresponding anion state, whereas the two nitrogen groups at the inner core of the THPP were protonated, forming (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>THPP) 
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, which is encapsulated within the hydrophobic interior of the surfactant micelles. Consequently, the combined noncovalent interactions such as hydrophobic-hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and aromatic π-π stacking induce nucleation and growth, and the eventual formation of self-assembled 1D THPP nanostructures within the micelles.
