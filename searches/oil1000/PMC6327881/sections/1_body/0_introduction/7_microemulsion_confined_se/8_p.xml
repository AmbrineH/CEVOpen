<p id="p0175" class="p">Besides ZnTPyP porphyrin, the modified method has been successfully extended to assemble other porphyrins into nanocrystalline superparticles, such as meso-tetra(4-pyridyl) porphine (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>TPyP) or 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-(hydroxyl)phenyl) porphyrin (THPP) (

 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The assembly of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>TPyP is initiated by adding the protonated porphyrin tetraammonium salt acidic aqueous solution into the basic solution of surfactant under vigorous stirring. The mixture of protonated porphyrins and the base solution immediately triggers an acid-base neutralization reaction that deprotonates pyridine tetraammonium salt, producing neutral porphyrins that are insoluble in water. The resulting insoluble porphyrins are then encapsulated into the hydrophobic cores of surfactant micelles. This encapsulation then confines the nucleation and growth driven by noncovalent interactions such as π-π stacking, forming uniform porphyrin NPs. Notably, metalation of the porphyrin can be realized during the assembly process by the addition of Zn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> (through Zn(NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) in the self-assembly solution (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Zn is inserted into the core of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>TPyP through the incorporation of Zn ions with the core pyrroles forming ZnTPyP. Subsequent self-assembly of ZnTPyP was conducted through axial ligation between central Zn and pyridyl groups, which results in the morphology changing from octahedron to nanowires.
