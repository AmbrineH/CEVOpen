<p id="p0160" class="p">Similar to the formation of spherical NP superparticles during surfactant-assisted self-assembly, temperature also has a big impact on the self-assembly and formation of porphyrin nanocrystals. For example, at the same self-assembly conditions, evaporation at 80°C resulted in nanosheets with edge length ranging from 300 to 500 nm. The relative amount of the octahedra to the nanosheets decreased with an increase of temperature. This might be due to the preferential formation of CTAB lamellar mesophase, which confines formation of the nanosheet morphology.</p>
