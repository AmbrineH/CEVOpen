<p id="p0150" class="p">The growth process of the nanocrystals is an evaporation-induced nucleation and growth self-assembly mechanism. At the beginning of the self-assembly processes when oil and water phases are mixed together, emulsion droplets are rapidly formed. As the self-assembly progresses during heating, the emulsion droplets gradually shrink. This shrinkage is due to the evaporation of the organic solvent with heating. The evaporation in the first few minutes resulted in small NP nuclei. Then the nuclei started to grow quickly into nanocrystalline superparticles with controllable size and shape.</p>
