<p id="p0155" class="p">Bai et al. discovered that the type of surfactant was a key factor to the control of morphologies and arrangement of the porphyrins. For example, when CTAB was used, nanocrystalline octahedra were obtained. When CTAB was replaced with SDS under the same self-assembly conditions, amorphous microspheres were formed instead of octahedra. It is believed that the different nanocrystalline morphologies are due to the nature of interactions of surfactants with porphyrins. In the case of SDS, the anionic head groups SO

The evaporation of organic solvents resulted in amorphous microspheres instead of crystalline octahedra. Besides the morphology, the size of the tin porphyrin self-assembled nanocrystals can be easily tuned by varying the surfactant concentration. By increasing the CTAB concentration, diameters of porphyrin octahedral nanocrystals increased from 85 to 440 nm, whereas their polydisperse index remained narrow.
