<p id="p0145" class="p">In recent years, various porphyrin nanocrystalline superparticles with uniform shape and size have been produced by using the surfactant-assisted self-assembly method, including hollow nanospheres, solid nanospheres, nanotubes, nanorods, nano-octahedra, nanosheets, and nanofibers (

In their preparation, chloroform solution containing tin porphyrin was added to an aqueous solution of CTAB or SDS surfactants. This solution was then emulsified by ultrasonic treatment under gentle stirring. The low-boiling chloroform was subsequently evaporated from the emulsion system by mild heating. As chloroform evaporates from the emulsion droplets, they are enriched in concentration, and this induces self-assembly of porphyrin molecules confined in the emulsion droplets. Through noncovalent interactions, such as π-π stacking and ligand coordination, tin porphyrins self-assembled into different nanostructures.
