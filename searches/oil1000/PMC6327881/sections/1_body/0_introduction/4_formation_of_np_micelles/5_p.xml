<p id="p0050" class="p">In addition to bioapplications, NP-micelles have been demonstrated to be a functional building block for further self-assembly into robust, highly ordered NP arrays for nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fan et al., 2006</xref>). Because of the interdigitated surfactant bilayer structure, the NP-micelle surface affords flexible surface chemistry and active function depending on the use of different surfactants. Using the NP-micelles as a building block, formation of 2D ordered NP arrays and 3D NP superlattices by the evaporation-induced self-assembly process have been demonstrated. For example, drying of a gold NP-micelle solution on solid substrates can result in hexagonal close-packed 2D superlattices. If a concentrated NP-micelle aqueous solution is used for directly drying, 3D superlattices with face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry can be formed. The robustness of this approach allows tuning of interparticle spacing through the use of various space molecules (
