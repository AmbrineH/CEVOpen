<p id="p0035" class="p">Semiconductor NPs or quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent nanocrystals (NCs) that provide distinct advantages over conventional organic dyes or fluorescent proteins. The advantages include the large absorption coefficient, bright Photoluminescence (PL) emission (∼10–100 times brighter than that of single organic dye), a narrow and symmetric emission profile, and high photochemical stability (

As QDs are normally stabilized by organic alkane ligands and are therefore hydrophobic, they often need surface modifications to obtain biocompatibility. Encapsulation of QDs in micelles of lipids or surfactants to form QD-micelles through surfactant-assisted cooperative assembly can effectively preserve the optical properties of as-synthesized QDs while providing biocompatibility (
