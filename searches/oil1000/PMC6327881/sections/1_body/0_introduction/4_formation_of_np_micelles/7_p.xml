<p id="p0060" class="p">Through the sol-gel process, the NP-micelles have been used to form thin films of ordered gold NP silica arrays (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fan et al., 2004</xref>). By suppressing siloxane condensation and thereby gel formation, solvent evaporation induced self-assembly of gold NP-micelles with silica into a thin film. The final film consists of monodisperse gold NPs arranged within silica or organosilsesquioxane host matrices in an fcc mesostructure with precisely controlled interparticle spacing. The gold NP/silica composite films are transparent when less than 300 nm thick and have an average refractive index of ∼1.7. The film thickness can be controlled from 100 nm to several micrometers.
