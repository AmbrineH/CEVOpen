<p id="p0040" class="p">For preparing biocompatible QD-micelles, monodisperse CdSe and CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs were used as the fluorescent core of the QD-micelles (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dubertret et al., 2002</xref>). A concentrated suspension of QDs in chloroform was added to an aqueous solution containing a mixture of surfactants or phospholipids with different functional head groups, such as ethylene glycol (–PEG, [polyethylene glycol]) and amine (–NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). The –PEG group was used to improve biocompatibility, and the -NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> amine group provided sites for further bioconjugation. Because the surfactant-assisted self-assembly does not chemically change the nature of the QDs, the QD-micelles essentially preserve their optical property from the original hydrophobic QDs. For example, the acquired QD-micelle solutions exhibited the same visible and emission colors as their hydrophobic counterparts, as shown in the optical micrograph (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). Optical spectra, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B) and PL (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>D), further confirm the preservation of the optical property of the original QDs after formation of QD-micelles. Besides the optical property, the QD-micelles also maintain the structural monodispersity of the original QDs. Transmission electron microscopic images show the formation of ordered hexagonal close packing of QD-micelles (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C), as expected for individual monosized QDs. Studies of photostability of the water-soluble QD-micelles under long-time laser irradiation showed that these NC-micelles exhibited no loss of PL intensity in water. Because of the interdigitated phospholipid bilayer interface at the QD-micelle surface, the QD-micelles exhibit very good biocompatibility, which was evaluated by examination of their uptake in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and other bioenvironments (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dubertret et al., 2002</xref>). The retained fluorescence character after a fairly long incubation suggested the effective biocompatibility of the QD-micelles (
