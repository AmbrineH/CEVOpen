 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanocrystals as core and dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as the surfactant to make NP-micelles. When injecting the NP-micelle solution into a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ethylene glycol solution, DTAB molecules were detached into the ethylene glycol solution due to a decrease of van der Waals interactions between nanocrystal ligands and surfactants (DTAB), causing the NP-micelles to decompose. As a result, solvophobic interactions between nanocrystal surface ligands and ethylene glycol/water solvent molecules were induced, leading to nanocrystal aggregation and the formation of superparticles. The superparticle formation is a very rapid process that takes only 1 min, implying that it is a kinetically controlled process.
