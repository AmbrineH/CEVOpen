<p id="p0030" class="p">NPs have demonstrated important biomedical applications such as bioimaging and biosensing (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nam et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2017</xref>). These applications require them to be water soluble and biocompatible in biological environments. Most of the organically passivated NPs have hydrophobic surface chemistry making them unsuitable for direct bioapplications, whereas surfactant-assisted self-assembly can effectively functionalize NPs to form NP-micelles that are water soluble and biocompatible. By surfactant-assisted self-assembly, organically passivated hydrophobic NPs could be transferred to aqueous phase forming NP-micelles (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fan et al., 2005b</xref>). The NP-micelles are composed of NPs at the core and a hybrid bilayer shell that is formed by interdigitated alkane chains from the organic ligands (the primary layer) on NP surface and the surfactants (the secondary layer) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The interdigitation of the alkane chains is thermodynamically favorable to lock in the bilayer structure, which renders the NP-micelle stable in aqueous solutions. The thicknesses of the bilayer could be precisely defined by primary and secondary layers (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fan et al., 2005b</xref>). Depending on the length of the alkane chains, surfactants and organic ligands with a minimum of 8–10 carbons are desirable to stabilize the NP-micelles (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fan et al., 2004</xref>). The surfactant-assisted cooperative assembly method can be extended effectively to prepare water soluble and biocompatible semiconductor and magnetic NP-micelles for
