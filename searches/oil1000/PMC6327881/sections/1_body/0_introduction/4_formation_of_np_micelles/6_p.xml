 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wright etÂ al., 2006</xref>). The process involved two steps: (1) preparation of an NP-micelle solution through surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly process and (2) hydrothermal nucleation and growth of mesophase crystals using NP-micelles. Through the hydrothermal self-assembly process, well-shaped and oriented NP/silsesquioxane crystals were formed on substrates over several hours. These crystals were fairly uniform in shape and size with flower-like hierarchical structure and the NP-micelles self-assembled as an fcc mesophase inside these crystals.
