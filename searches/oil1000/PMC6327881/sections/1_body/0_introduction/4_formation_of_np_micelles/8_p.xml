<p id="p0065" class="p">Overall, the surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly method provides several advantageous features to synthesize solid NP arrays for practical applications. First, self-assembly of NP-micelles allows for the preparation of ordered NP arrays in aqueous phase, resulting in enhanced safety and better compatibility with current semiconductor fabrication and integration processes. Second, this method allows simple tuning of framework composition, and thus dielectrics, between NPs. This is essential to achieve enhanced transport properties of such three-dimensional superlattice films. Finally, the formation of self-assembled NP solids in inorganic matrix through cooperative self-assembly of NP-micelles and inorganic precursors (e.g., silica) essentially improves NP thermal stability for enhanced practical applications.</p>
