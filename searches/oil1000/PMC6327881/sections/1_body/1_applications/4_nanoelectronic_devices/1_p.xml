<p id="p0215" class="p">The surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly enables formation of highly ordered and densely packed NP arrays for collective behavior and enhanced charge transport. In general, such highly ordered NP arrays should serve as ideal model systems to discover new nanoscale phenomena, and to develop and test theories of collective optical, electronic, and magnetic behaviors. Fan et al. reported the synthesis of planar metal-insulator-metal devices from ordered 3D mesophases consisting of gold NPs inside silica matrix (

Linear Arrhenius behavior of the zero bias conductance from 78 K to room temperature testified to the uniformity of NP sizes and interparticle spacings. The calculated activation energy U = 90.4meV is attributed to the Coulomb charging energy of individual gold NPs. By measuring the
