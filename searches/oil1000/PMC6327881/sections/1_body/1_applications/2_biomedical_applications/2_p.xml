<p id="p0195" class="p">Wang et al. synthesized self-assembled porphyrin-silica nanocomposite particles with an ordered porphyrin network as the core surrounded by amorphous silica as the shell for a high-yield generation of singlet oxygen for PDT (
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The long-range ordering of the porphyrin network enables efficient energy transfer and impressive fluorescence for cell labeling while the silica layer provides opportunities for biofunctionalization. The synthesis of these particles was conducted by the combined surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly and sol-gel process using silicate precursors and the photoactive precursor zinc porphyrin ZnTPyP as a building block (

Control of pH conditions in the self-assembly solution is an important factor for tuning the final nanostructures with either amorphous or crystalline porphyrin networks. Low pH conditions promoted porphyrin noncovalent self-assembly, forming core-shell particles. However, high pH conditions were favorable for silicate condensation, forming solid porphyrin-silica mesophase particles. Both types of nanocomposites can generate lethal singlet oxygen to kill HeLa cells, but the core-shell structured particles were found to have better singlet oxygen yield, which is probably due to the increased porphyrin π-π stacking and out-of-plane coordination of Zn and pyridine. The enhanced PDT activity was demonstrated in the phototherapy with more tumor cells destroyed by the core-shell structured particles, which is consistent with their high yield production of singlet oxygen.
