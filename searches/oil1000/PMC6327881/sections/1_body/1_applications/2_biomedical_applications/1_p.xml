<p id="p0190" class="p">The interdigitated bilayers provide an effective interface and enable NPs to be water soluble and biocompatible for biological applications such as imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy. Chen et al. reported the synthesis of colloidal magnetofluorescent superparticles by co-assembling magnetic NPs with fluorescent QDs (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). The final superparticles consist of a close-packed magnetic NP “core” that is fully surrounded by a “shell” of fluorescent QDs (
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>). The superstructure exhibits uniform and tunable sizes, high magnetic content loading, and maximized fluorophore loading on the surface and versatile surface functionality. The superparticles can be further encapsulated with a thin silica shell through a sol-gel process to improve biocompatibility and colloidal stability. No measureable changes in both the PL intensity and size were observed after 6 months at 4°C. They demonstrated that after surface pegylation, these magnetofluorescent superparticles could be magnetically manipulated inside living cells while being optically tracked. Moreover, these magnetofluorescent superparticles also served as an
