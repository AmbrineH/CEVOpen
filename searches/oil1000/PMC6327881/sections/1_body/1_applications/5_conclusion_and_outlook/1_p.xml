<p id="p0220" class="p">In summary, recent research progress on the surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly of NPs to form highly ordered active nanostructures has been reviewed. A variety of nanomaterials including plasmonic NPs, fluorescent semiconductors, magnetic NPs, and optical active molecules have been assembled into highly ordered active NP nanostructures. Benefiting from the flexible composition, ordered structure, and biocompatible properties, these nanostructures have been utilized in the areas of nanoelectronics, photocatalysis, and biomedicine. One of the advantages of the surfactant-assisted self-assembly method is its ability to integrate different functional nanomaterials to create active superparticles with multiple functions. Another important advantage is that the resultant nanostructures exhibit new collective properties resulting from the self-assembled and compactly packed NPs, which enhances charge and energy transport within the nanostructures.</p>
