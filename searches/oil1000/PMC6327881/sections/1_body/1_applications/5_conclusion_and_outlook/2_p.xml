<p id="p0225" class="p">Although great success has been achieved in the development of surfactant-assisted assembly strategies for the synthesis of highly ordered NP active nanostructures, accurate control of structure and property of the final nanostructures still remains a great challenge. This requires precise control of size, shape, and composition of the starting building block of different nanomaterials. Establishment of structure-property relation for the final nanostructures through surfactant-assisted self-assembly will further improve the understanding of the surfactant-assisted self-assembly processing for better design and engineering of active nanostructures. There has been an emergence of new nanomaterials, such as graphene and its derivatives (

These nanomaterials will benefit from the surfactant-assisted self-assembly to form highly ordered and compacted nanostructures with enhanced properties. For example, compact QD thin films are one of most important prerequisites for high-performance perovskite QD solar cells, which ensures efficient electronic coupling between QDs for effective carrier transport (

 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meidan et al., 2017</xref>). Although using short inorganic ligands can obviously reduce the interparticle spacing to enhance electronic coupling, it is still challenging to transfer randomly stacked QD films into regular arrays for better carrier transport (

 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meidan et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore high-quality QDs' growth and self-assembly of QD thin film are the most fundamental steps for the efficient perovskite QD solar cells. To this end, surfactant-assisted self-assembly strategy can achieve more compact film configuration for stronger electronic coupling and charge mobility by building high-quality self-assembled QD films and reducing interparticle spacing among QDs. Recently, direct assembly such as stress-induced assembly has been developed to tune NP phase transformation and coupling (

 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). It also requires ordered NP assemblies as the starting materials to accomplish the stress-induced tuning of phase transition and interparticle separation. Another interesting direction in the NP community is the synthesis of hybrid nanocrystals through nanocrystal or ion diffusion in solutions to control nano-heterogeneous structures (

Finally, increasing structural complexity by combining with other top-down and bottom-up methods is one of the natural directions for nanoscience. It is expected that new complex active nanostructures will be synthesized through surfactant-assisted self-assembly for exploration of novel applications (
