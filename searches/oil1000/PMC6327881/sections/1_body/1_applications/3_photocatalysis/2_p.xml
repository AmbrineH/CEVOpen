 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Based on results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra, they found that the formation of J-aggregate leads to much stronger exciton coupling between THPPs. Such coupling activates the porphyrin core by increasing the electronic density to a large extent, which helps to stabilize the photoexcited electron-holes for enhanced hydrogen evolution rate of all nanowires. Such arrangement is similar to that of a light-harvesting complex in natural photosynthetic systems that contain chlorophyll aggregates, in which chromophores form J-aggregates along the head-to-tail arrangement via a stronger transition-dipole moment for harvesting solar energy. In addition, the absorption spectroscopy results unambiguously establish that a self-assembled nanostructure induces different coverage of the light range of spectra, which results in structure-dependent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (

 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>C), they found that the nanorods have decreased separation distance of the porphyrin lattice fringes (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>D). This essentially increases the interactions between THPP molecules within nanorods, which enhances the delocalization of excited electrons and extends the lifetime of electron-hole pairs for better photoactivity.
