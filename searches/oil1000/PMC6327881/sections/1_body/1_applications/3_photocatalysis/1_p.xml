<p id="p0205" class="p">One important issue in the synthesis of photocatalytic materials is to increase photoactive material absorption in the visible light range and hot-electron transport to the reaction sites. One method to address these issues is to assemble optically active nanomaterials into highly ordered structures to increase their absorption cross-section and hot-electron transport. Zhong et al. found that the absorption spectra of self-assembled porphyrin nanocrystals are more broad in the visible wavelength when compared with those of individual porphyrins and display enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with commercial P25 catalysts (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>TPyP octahedra exhibit much broader UV-vis absorption bands that are red shifted and enhanced from the corresponding bands of the monomeric porphyrins (

Under visible light (λ &gt; 420 nm) irradiation with ascorbic acid as the sacrificial agent and Pt as the co-catalyst, ZnTPyP nanowires displayed the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 47.1 mmol/g/h, which is much higher than the reported porphyrin- and other organic-material-based photocatalysts, whereas the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>TPyP nanooctahedra exhibited negligible photocatalytic activity with an evolution rate of 0.8 mmol/g/h. This extraordinary photocatalytic activity mainly benefits from the long axes of π-π stacks in the 1D nanostructures that have extensive delocalization and retard the charge recombination by stabilizing the electron transfer products, which enhances the lifetime of electron-hole pairs.
