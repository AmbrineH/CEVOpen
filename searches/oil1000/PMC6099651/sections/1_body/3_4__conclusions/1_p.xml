<p class="p">Based on the findings discussed above, it is clear that natural EOs demonstrate many neuro-pharmacological properties, such as anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, anti-depressive, and sedative properties. An increasing number of studies show that two inhibitory systems, the GABAergic system and the neuronal voltage-gated Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels, are most likely involved in such pharmacological effects. EOs are emerging as a promising source for modulation of the GABAergic system and Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels. The neuro-pharmacological activities and the underlying mechanisms of many constituents obtained from EOs have been reviewed. Most of the above-mentioned constituents are reported to have either anti-nociceptive or anxiolytic effects through activating the GABAergic system and by inhibiting neuronal Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels. Only a few constituents have been reported to antagonize GABA receptors. The perspective compounds targeting the GABAergic system and/or voltage-gated Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels could serve as better candidates or pharmacophores during new drug development to control pain and anxiety syndromes.
