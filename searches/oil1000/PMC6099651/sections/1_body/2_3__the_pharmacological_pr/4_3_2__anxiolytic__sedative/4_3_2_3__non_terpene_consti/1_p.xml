 <italic class="italic">Acorus tatarinowii</italic>, is clinically used as a medication for treating epilepsy, cough, bronchitis, and asthma. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] evaluated the action of α-asarone on the excitability of rat hippocampal neurons in culture and on the epileptic activity induced by pentylenetetrazole or kainite injection in vivo. They found that α-asarone inhibits the activity of hippocampal neurons and produces an antiepileptic effect in the central nervous system through enhancing tonic GABAergic inhibition [
