 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seeds EO (27.6â€“57.0%), exhibits anticonvulsant activity in the PTZ-induced seizure model [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. The anticonvulsant effects are probably mediated through an opioid receptor-mediated increase in GABAergic tone. Gilhotra and Dhingra [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] investigated the role of GABAergic and nitriergic modulation in the antianxiety effect of thymoquinone. Thymoquinone (20 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic effects with a significant decrease in plasma nitrite and the reversal of decreased brain GABA content in stressed mice [
