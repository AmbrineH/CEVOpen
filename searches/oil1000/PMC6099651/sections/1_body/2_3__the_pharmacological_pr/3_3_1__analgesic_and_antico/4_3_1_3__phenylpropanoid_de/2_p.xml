<p class="p">Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01061-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), an aromatic phenylpropanoid molecule found in plants including 
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (Clove), has been used in medicine to relieve pain [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The EO of clove, which is made from the aromatic flower buds of a tree in the family Myrtaceae, 
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic>, is known as an important weak local anesthetic for dental pain [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Eugenol possesses analgesic effects that may be related to the inhibition of voltage-dependent Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels and/or to the activation of TRPV1 receptors or both. Moreira-Lobo et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that eugenol inhibited action potentials and modified the excitability of the rat sciatic nerve and superior cervical ganglion neurons. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported that eugenol reduced the firing of neuronal action potentials and hyperexcitability through a synergistic blocking effect of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> currents. Recently, Vatanparast et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] studied the effects of eugenol on the excitability of central neurons of the land snail 
 <italic class="italic">Caucasotachea atrolabiata</italic> and the underlying ionic mechanisms. It was found that a low concentration of eugenol could have antiepileptic properties, while at a higher concentration, it induced epileptiform activity. The dose-dependent inhibition of the ionic currents underlying the rising and falling phases of the action potential seems to be relevant to the eugenol suppressant and excitatory actions, respectively [
