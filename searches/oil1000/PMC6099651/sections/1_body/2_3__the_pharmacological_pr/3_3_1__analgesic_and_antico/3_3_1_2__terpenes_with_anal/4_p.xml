<p class="p">Thymol is a monoterpenoid monocyclic phenolic compound. It is the main component of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> (Lamiaceae). The main therapeutic application of thymol is in dental preparations to kill odor-producing bacteria and has various actions including antinociception and nerve conduction inhibition [

 <xref rid="B93-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Thymol displayed inhibition on spontaneous excitatory transmission in adult rat spinal substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons, suggesting that thymol increases the spontaneous release of 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-glutamate onto the neurons by activating TRPA1 channels while producing an outward current without TRP activation [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Considering that the substantia gelatinosa plays a pivotal role in modulating nociceptive transmission from the periphery, the actions of thymol could contribute to at least a part of its antinociceptive effect [
