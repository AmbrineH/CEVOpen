 <xref rid="B89-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] evaluated the antinociceptive activity of nerolidol using the acetic acid-induced writhing test, the formalin test, and the hot-plate test. The results showed that nerolidol had antinociceptive activities in chemical nociception models (acetic acid-induced writhing test and formalin test), but not in the thermal nociception model (hotplate test). The analgesic activity of nerolidol is possibly related to the GABAergic system, and not to the opioidergic system or to ATP-sensitive K
