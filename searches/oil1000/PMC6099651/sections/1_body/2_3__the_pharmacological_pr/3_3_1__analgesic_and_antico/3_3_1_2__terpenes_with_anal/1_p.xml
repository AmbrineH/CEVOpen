 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-Jasmone, jasmine lactone, linalool oxide, and methyl jasmonate significantly potentiated the response to GABA. The inhalation of 0.1% cis-jasmone or methyl jasmonate significantly increased the sleeping time of mice induced by pentobarbital. The results suggest that these fragrant compounds could be absorbed by the brain and thereby potentiated the GABA
