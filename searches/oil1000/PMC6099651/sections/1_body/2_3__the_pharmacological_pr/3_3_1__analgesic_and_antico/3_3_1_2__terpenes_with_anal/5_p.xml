 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01061-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), a monoterpene alcohol of the menthane family, is present in the EOs of various plants species, such as

 <xref rid="B84-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. It was found that similar to diazepam, isopulegol significantly prolonged the latency for convulsions and mortality of mice in a PTZ-induced convulsion animal model [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. The results suggest that the anticonvulsant effects of isopulegol against PTZ-induced convulsions are possibly related to positive modulation of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA
