<p class="p">1,8-Cineole is a terpenoid present in many EOs of plants with several pharmacological and biological effects, including antinociceptive, smooth muscle relaxant, and ion channel action. Additionally, 1,8-cineole blocked action potentials, thereby reducing the excitability of peripheral neurons [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] reported that 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) induced hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity in snail neurons, which is most likely mediated through the direct inhibitory action on the potassium channels.
