 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01061-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) is a monoterpenoid alcoholic component of EOs obtained from several aromatic plants. NÃ³brega et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] investigated the psychopharmacological and electrophysiological activities of Terpinen-4-ol in male Swiss mice and Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Terpinen-4-ol (
 <italic class="italic">i.p.</italic>) inhibited pentylenetetrazol-(PTZ-) induced seizures, indicating anticonvulsant effects. The anticonvulsant action exerted by Terpinen-4-ol involved the GABAergic system but did not bind to the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Furthermore, the electrophysiological results show that terpinen-4-ol decreased a sodium current through voltage-dependent sodium channels [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Thus, its anticonvulsant effect may be related to changes in neuronal excitability based on the modulation of both the GABAergic system and Na
