<p class="p">Menthol (2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol), which is contained in peppermint or other mint oils, is well-known to induce analgesia by activating the transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin-8 (TRPM8) channels [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] examined the effects of menthol and its related compounds on CAP peak amplitude. (−)-Menthol and (+)-menthol concentration-dependently reduced the CAP peak amplitude. (−)-Menthone, (+)-menthone, (−)-carvone, (+)-carvone, (+)-carveol, and (+)-pulegone inhibited CAPs with extents similar to that of menthol (see

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. They found that menthol and its related compounds reduce CAP peak amplitude in a manner specifically related to their chemical structures and that menthol activity is not mediated by TRPM8 channels [
