<p class="p">Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] examined the effects of (−)-carvone and its stereoisomer (+)-carvone (in caraway) on glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory transmission in SG neurons of adult rat spinal cord slices by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. They found that (−)-carvone and (+)-carvone activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, respectively, resulting in an increase in spontaneous L-glutamate release onto SG neurons, with almost the same efficacy [
