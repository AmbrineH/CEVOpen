<p class="p">Estragole, a volatile terpenoid, is the primary constituent of EO of tarragon (comprising 60â€“75%). It has several pharmacological and biological activities, including antioxidant, anxiolytic, and antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The mechanism of action of estragole on neuronal excitability was recently investigated. The intact and dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons of rats were used to record action potential and Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> currents with intracellular and patch-clamp techniques, respectively. It was found that estragole blocked neuronal excitability by direct inhibition of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channel conductance activation.
