<p class="p">Komiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] examined the anti-stress action of the EOs of lavender, rose, and lemon using an elevated plus-maze task, a forced swimming task, and an open field task in mice. Among the tested EOs, lemon oil had the strongest anti-stress effect in all three behavioral tasks. Unfortunately, the authors only indicate that the EOs of lavender, rose, and lemon were supplied by Soda Aromatic Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), but did not mention the botanical origin of EOs. Despite the fact that rose oil did not show a larger anti-stress effect, it has been reported that rose oil had anti-conflict effects and that the effects were not mediated by the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The anxiolytic, antidepressant-like effects of lemon oil were mediated through the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced serotonergic (5-HT) neurons [

 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> L. was reported to have an anti-stress related effect [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Costa et al. (2013) investigated the anxiolytic-like activity of the EO of

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The acute treatment with the EO showed no activity in the forced swim test, which is sensitive to antidepressants. The studies demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> EO exhibited an anxiolytic-like activity which was mediated by 5-HT1A-receptors [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The similarity of the mechanism underlying anxiolytic-like activity suggests that lemon oil and EO from 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> may present the same bioactive compounds or analogs which target the serotonergic system. The anxiolytic effects of
