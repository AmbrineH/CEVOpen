The multiple exposures to coriander volatile oil can be useful as a means to counteract anxiety, depression, and oxidative stress in Alzheimer’s disease conditions. The GC-MS and GC-FID analyses determined the main volatile component of the coriander volatile oil sample to be linalool (69.4%), which is probably the responsible constituent for the observed anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. This assumption was confirmed by the fact that inhaling linalool rich EOs can be useful as a means to counteract anxiety [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Other minor constituents of coriander volatile oil are α-pinene (3.0%–7.0%) and γ-terpinene (1.5–8.0%) [
