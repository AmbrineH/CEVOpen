 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The constituents of the volatile oil of valerian are very variable due to population differences in genetics and environmental factors. The major constituents include the monoterpene bornyl acetate and the sesquiterpene valerenic acid, which is characteristic of the species, in addition to other types of sesquiterpene. The non-volatile monoterpenes known as valepotriates were first isolated in 1966 and contribute to the overall activity by possessing sedative activity based on the effects on the CNS [
