 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] reported that pre-inhalation of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Acorus gramineus</italic> markedly delayed the appearance of pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion. Moreover, fragrance inhalation progressively prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time as the inhalation time was lengthened. This sedative effect after inhalation or oral administration of
