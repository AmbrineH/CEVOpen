 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seed volatile oil and the main components of the oil (that is, thymoquinone, α-pinene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene) using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The volatile oil protected mice effectively against PTZ-induced convulsions that may be attributed mainly to its content of thymoquinone and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and to a lesser extent, α-pinene. Volatile oil and its component 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene effectively suppressed convulsions induced by MES. Their studies suggest that picrotoxin and bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors mediate an increase in the GABAergic response.
