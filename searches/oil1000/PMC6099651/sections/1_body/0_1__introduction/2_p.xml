<p class="p">Activation of the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor system and the blockade of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels) are essential for the overall balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition which is vital for normal brain function and critical for the central nervous system (CNS) disorders. It has been suggested that EO constituents could exert their biological activities through modulating the GABAergic system and inhibiting Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and the GABA receptor system exerts a major inhibitory function in the brain. The dysfunction or deficiency of the GABAergic system has been implicated in epilepsy, pain, and anxiety [

 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels mediate the propagation of action potentials along axons, and thus, are thought to be important targets of antiseizure drugs. Local anesthetics and analgesics prevent the transmission of nerve impulses via their binding to Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels. Two main types of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> currents, termed tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive and TTX-resistant, have been identified in the dorsal root ganglion [

 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels have demonstrated a greater involvement of Nav1.7, a predominant subtype of TTX-sensitive sodium channels expressed principally in peripheral neurons [
