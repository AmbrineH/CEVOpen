<p class="p">(1) The corrosion products are mainly composed of FeO(OH) and FeCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and the corrosion of steel pipe is controlled by oxygen absorption corrosion and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> corrosion. Flow rates of the transmission medium affect the structure of the corrosion scale, and defects in scale promote the occurrence of medium penetration and local corrosion.
