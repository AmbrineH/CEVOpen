<p class="p">(2) The specimens immersed in condensate are generally corroded, and the specimens exposed to a gaseous environment are locally corroded. The 1 mm area below the waterline has the highest corrosion rate, which is approximately two times higher than that of the fully immersed area far away from the waterline. Condensate with a depth of less than 5 mm is most likely to cause severe corrosion.</p>
