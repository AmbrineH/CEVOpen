<p class="p">(3) The localized corrosion rate in a gaseous environment is slightly lower than the uniform corrosion rate in full immersion zone. Therefore, no autocatalysis of the occluded corrosion cell occurs in the formation of the corrosion pit, and a uniform corrosion essentially takes place in the precipitation location of the condensate water.</p>
