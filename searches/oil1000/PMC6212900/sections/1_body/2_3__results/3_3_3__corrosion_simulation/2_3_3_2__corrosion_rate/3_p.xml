<p class="p">The weight loss rate can be used to evaluate the general corrosion rate. The specimens before and after the corrosion test were weighed three times, and the relevant weight loss data are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The weight loss rate was converted into a thickness loss rate to compare the general corrosion rate with the latter local corrosion rate. It is clear that the general corrosion rate of 2″ pipe is the slowest, while the corrosion rate of 4″and 6″ pipes is faster and substantially the same.
