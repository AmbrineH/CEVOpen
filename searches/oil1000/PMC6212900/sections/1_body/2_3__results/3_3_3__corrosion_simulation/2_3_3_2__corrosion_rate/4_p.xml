<p class="p">For the specimens exposed to a simulated transmission gas environment, the condensation of water droplets results in local corrosion. The depth of the corrosion pits was measured by a confocal microscope to determine the local corrosion rate.

 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The local corrosion rates for the specimens from the 4″ and 6″ pipe sections were also determined using the same method, and the results are also listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The 2″ pipe has the slowest corrosion rate, while the 4″and 6″ pipes have a faster and substantially identical corrosion rate. This is similar to the uniform corrosion rate of the three pipes in the full immersion zone, except that the corrosion rate of the material in the gas phase is slower than that in the full immersion zone.
