<p class="p">General corrosion occurs below the waterline. However, the corrosion rate near the waterline is different from that far away from the waterline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>). The residual thicknesses in the areas exposed to gas, 1 mm below the waterline, 5 mm below the waterline, and near the bottom, were measured and recorded to determine the change rule of the corrosion rate near the waterline. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>a shows the measuring positions. Here, the waterline is considered the critical position at which the overall thickness of the specimen begins to change. The region exposed to gas phase but without a corrosion pit was selected as a baseline, and the corrosion rate was set at 0 mm/y. Thus, the corrosion rate from the waterline to the bottom of the specimen can be determined, and the relevant data are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. For the areas from 5 mm below the waterline to the bottom of the specimen, the corrosion rate of the three specimens is approximately the same as the results in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. This means that the area outside 5 mm below the waterline works in the same environment as the full immersion zone. 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> shows that the area 1 mm below the waterline exhibits a higher corrosion rate, which is approximately two times higher than that of the area outside 5 mm below the waterline. It is believed that the area in the range 5 mm below the waterline shows severe corrosion, especially the 1 mm area below the waterline.
