<p class="p">To compare the chemical and phase compositions of corrosion products obtained in the simulation tests with those collected from a leaking pipeline, the corroded specimens covered with corrosion products were investigated by EDS and XRD. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows the EDS analysis results. From the figure, the main elements include Fe and O for all the specimens, and the chemical compositions of corrosion products are the same as those of the corrosion products collected from the leaking pipeline (
