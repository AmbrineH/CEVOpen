<p class="p">After 135 h in a simulated corrosion environment, the simulated gas was released from the kettle, and the specimens were removed. The specimens immersed in solution exhibits a general corrosion behavior, whereas the specimens exposed to gas presents a localized corrosion behavior. In comparison with other regions, more corrosion products are piled up near the waterline for the specimens partly immersed in the solution.
