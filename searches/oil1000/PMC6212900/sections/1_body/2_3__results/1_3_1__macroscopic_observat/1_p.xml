 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the typical corrosion morphology on the internal walls of the 2″, 4″, and 6″ steel pipe sections with internal corrosion. The upper and lower positions of the pipe section in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,b are consistent with the working status. Corrosion products are distributed across all the exposed surfaces. However, the corrosion products on the bottom part of pipe sections, especially in pipes with a small diameter, are thick and nonuniform. A perforation occurs on the bottom part of the 6″ pipe section (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c), and thickness reduction can be clearly observed around the perforation, thereby indicating that the perforation is induced by internal corrosion. The corrosion environment for the bottom part of the pipe sections is different from those for the side and top parts, and the bottom parts are likely covered with condensate liquid.
