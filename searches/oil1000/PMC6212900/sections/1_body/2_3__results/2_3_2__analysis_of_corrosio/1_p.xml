<p class="p">An SEM equipped with EDS was applied to investigate the cross-sectional and surface morphology and chemical compositions of corrosion products on the pipe surface of the 2″, 4″, and 6″ steel pipe sections. The approximate observed positions are marked in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> with red boxes. No obvious micromorphology differences occur between smooth scale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a) and raised corrosion products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b). Subsequently, the chemical composition of corrosion products on the 2″, 4″, and 6″ steel pipes were analyzed by EDS. The results show that no essential difference is found in the composition of scales along its thickness direction for different pipes. Therefore, only the analysis results on the 6″ steel pipe are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The main elements include Fe, C and O. Then, the corrosion products are speculated to be oxides and carbonates from the reaction between steel and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the environment. Furthermore, few S is found in corrosion products, and the material should be sulfide of Fe, which is the reaction product of steel with H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S.
