<p class="p">On the basis of the analysis results of EDS and XRD, the corrosion products on different pipes share the same chemical and phase compositions; however, only the 6â€³ pipe is perforated in the collected pipe sections. Given that the pipe materials and the transmission medium are the same, the only difference is the flow rate of the medium in the pipe. Under the given working conditions, the medium flow rate increases with the pipe diameter. Therefore, the influence of flow rate change on the microstructure of corrosion products is further observed.</p>
