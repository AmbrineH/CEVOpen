<p class="p">The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the corrosion scale on the 2″, 4″ and 6″ steel pipes is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. The scale on the 2″ pipe is dense (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a); however, the bond strength between the scale and steel substrate is weak, and cracking tends to occur at this interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b). The surface of scale on the 4″ pipe seems dense, and no pores can be found; however, cracks in scale are observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c). The cross-sectional observation also shows cracks and pores in the corrosion scale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>d), and the inner layer is stronger than the outer layer. The surface morphology of the corrosion scales on the 6″ pipe is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>e. Cracks and many pores are found in the corrosion scales; therefore, these scales can easily peel off. The cross-sectional morphology on the 6″ pipe is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>f, and the corrosion scales near the steel surface are denser than the outer parts. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the corrosion products are porous at the beginning formation and will become denser with time. The dense inner layer can prevent penetration of the outer corrosive medium. However, the flow rate of the transmission medium will influence the structure of corrosion scale, and high flow rate can damage the integrity of the corrosion scale, thereby resulting in many pores and cracks in the scale. Intact and dense corrosion scales with strong adhesion can reduce the uniform corrosion rate, whereas defects and scale shedding can induce severe local corrosion [

 <xref rid="B28-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The corrosive medium can penetrate along the paths formed by cracks and porosities [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], and corrosion can occur beneath corrosion products. Meanwhile, the peeling of the corrosion scale will lead to the exposure of fresh metal, thereby accelerating the corrosion here. Evidently, the 6″ pipe with loose corrosion products is most prone to corrosion failure.
