<p class="p">Associated gas is the gas that is obtained in crude oil production; the main ingredients of such associated gas are methane, ethane, and hydrocarbons [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The flaring or venting of associated gas not only causes energy waste but also adversely affects the environment. In contrast, reinjection is a type of treatment method that is beneficial to sustainable development [

 <xref rid="B5-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In some oil fields, associated gas is used as a lift gas to raise oil recovery [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Gas lifting is the process of injecting compressed natural gas (called lift gas) into the production tubing of an oil well, and the lift gas increases the pressure gradient between the reservoir and well fluid that pushes the fluid to the surface [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Usually, the compressed gas from a field processing facility is routed to oil gathering manifold and wellhead via pipelines.
