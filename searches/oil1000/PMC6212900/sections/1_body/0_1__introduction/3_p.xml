<p class="p">Thus far, many studies have been conducted on corrosion and its control of gas pipelines. Most researchers have deemed that the presence of water and dissolved gases, such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S, introduce serious internal corrosion [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Many factors that promote liquid collection, including gas quality, operating parameters, and pipeline features, affect the likelihood of internal corrosion [

 <xref rid="B21-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and the corrosion rate is accelerated by O

 <xref rid="B26-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Various laboratory tests have been conducted to study the corrosion of steel pipelines under full immersion in the water or gas phase under water condensing conditions [

 <xref rid="B26-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, the liquid depth in gas pipelines is relatively small in most cases, and the corrosion law of steel pipelines under thin liquid film and in large-volume liquid should be different. No research has shown the corrosion of the liquidâ€“gas transition zone near a waterline. In addition, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> corrosion is not necessarily the root cause of gas pipeline corrosion. The corrosion mechanism of gas pipelines changes with gas impurities. At present, corrosion research on CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> coexistence conditions remains insufficient because corrosion products may change with changes in their partial pressure.
