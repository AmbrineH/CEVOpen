<p class="p">In this study, the corrosion mechanism of associated gas pipelines was developed for actual engineering failure accidents. Gas lift facilities were commissioned in 2009â€“2010, and associated gas was used as the lift gas. The associated gas contained water, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Several leaks were observed in the associated gas lines in November 2014. Then, the situation became increasingly serious, thereby seriously affecting the normal operation of pipelines. Relevant research is urgently needed to determine the root cause of the leak and take remedial measures. Therefore, the corrosion failure mechanism of the associated gas pipeline was clarified by simulating three corrosion environments inside a gas pipeline on the basis of observing corrosion morphology and analyzing corrosion products.
