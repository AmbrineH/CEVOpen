<p class="p">The mechanism of waterline corrosion can explain why corrosion perforation mostly occurs at the bottom of the actual gas pipeline. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that numerous corrosion products are found at the bottom of the pipe. Notably, the amount of corrosion products in the gas pipeline indicates the degree of corrosion. The more products are present, the more severe the corrosion because although the wall shear stress caused by the gas flow in the pipeline can influence the structure of corrosion scale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), this stress is insufficiently high to carry the corrosion product away [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Therefore, the corrosion product is easily deposited in the position where corrosion occurs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that the amount of corrosion products at the bottom of the pipe is considerably more than that in other areas, thereby indicating severe corrosion at the bottom of the pipe. On-site sampling proves the presence of condensate water at the bottom of the pipeline. When the depth of water is shallow, severe corrosion will occur at the bottom (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a). When the depth exceeds 5 mm, severe corrosion will occur at the symmetrical position on both sides of the bottom of the pipe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b), and the severe corrosion sites correspond to the areas at a short distance below the waterline. Water with a depth of less than 5 mm is most likely to cause severe corrosion at the bottom of the pipe.
