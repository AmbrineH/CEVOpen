<p class="p">Generally, the dissolution of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> together with mineral ions let the condensate water be a strong corrosive medium, thereby resulting in steel pipe corrosion. The transport medium cannot carry the corrosion products away; hence, the corrosion products will increase with time, although their compactness is affected by the medium flow rate. Pores or cracks occur in the corrosion scale when the flow rate of the transmission medium is high (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>e,f). The outer corrosive medium can penetrate through the corrosion scale along the paths formed by pores and cracks, thereby causing corrosion beneath the corrosion products. Furthermore, the oxygen concentration beneath the corrosion products is considerably lower than the open zones. The difference in oxygen concentration can accelerate the corrosion beneath the corrosion products, thereby promoting local corrosion.
