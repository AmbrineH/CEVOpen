<p class="p">The pH value of collected condensate water is 6.74; thus, acid gas corrosion should not be serious. Carbonic acid formation by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> dissolution and hydration is the major reaction during CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> corrosion. At pH &lt; 4, the hydrogen reduction is the dominant cathodic reaction, whereas direct reduction of carbonic acid becomes important at pH &gt; 4 [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. High pH results in a decreased solubility of iron carbonate and leads to an increased precipitation rate and high scaling tendency, and the higher pH of 6.6 results in the formation of several protective scales, which are reflected by a rapid decrease of the corrosion rate with time [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The pH value of the medium in the studied gas pipeline is as high as 6.74; however, corrosion perforation proves that the corrosion product does not have effective protection. This result also shows that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> does not play a leading role in the corrosion of the studied pipeline.
