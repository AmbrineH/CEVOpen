<p class="p">Oxygen concentration cell can be used to explain why the corrosion rate in the area of 1 mm below the waterline is the highest among different corrosion environments. Great variation in the oxygen concentration gradient occurs near the waterline [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The oxygen concentration decreases with water depth and finally reaches a stable value [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-11-01935" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. When the different areas of the same metal are in contact with a solution with different oxygen concentrations, the area with high oxygen concentration is good for the oxygen absorption reaction, whereas the metal dissolution reaction in this area is inhibited to a certain extent. By contrast, areas with low oxygen concentrations are subject to metal dissolution as anodes. It can be speculated from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref> that the oxygen concentration changes within 1 mm below the waterline and then reaches a low stable value. The anodic reaction near the waterline is suppressed; thus, the degree of corrosion is lighter than that in large water depth. After leaving the waterline, the potential of the metal should not change after the oxygen concentration is stabilized. However, the area 1 mm below the waterline, where the oxygen concentration has only reached a stable low value, has a shorter conductive path than the areas farther from the waterline. Therefore, the anodic current concentrates flow through this narrow area and results in severe corrosion.
