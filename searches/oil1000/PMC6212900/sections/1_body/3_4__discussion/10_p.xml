<p class="p">Corrosion of steel pipe in a gaseous environment only occurs in spots in which condensate water droplets exist. Therefore, local corrosion occurs.

 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> show that the localized corrosion rate of the steel pipeline in a gaseous environment is slightly lower than the general corrosion rate of the specimen immersed in condensate. Analysis indicates two reasons for this situation. First, no autocatalysis of occluded corrosion cell occurs in the formation of a corrosion pit because the area around the pit without condensate cannot form a corrosion couple with the area with condensate droplets. Without electrolytes, no electrochemical reactions can occur. Localized corrosion in the gas phase is actually uniform corrosion that occurs at the precipitation location of condensate water. The other reason why the corrosion rate in a gaseous environment is lower than that in full immersion zones is that corrosion products are not easily washed away in gas, and the anodic process will be impeded by the formation of corrosion products.
