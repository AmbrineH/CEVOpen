 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are the key factors that induce pipeline corrosion; thus, three measures can be taken to control the corrosion failure of gas pipeline, namely, dehydration, deoxygenation, and application of inhibitors. However, no standard is used to specify the oxygen content in natural gas, and deoxidization is not a common method in controlling gas pipeline corrosion. Here, we recommend deoxygenation and application of inhibitors. The corrosion rate of gas pipelines is directly related to the water content in natural gas [
