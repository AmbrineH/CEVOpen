<p class="p">The investigated pipelines are buried trunk lines (151.1 mm × 7.1 mm, 6″ pipe) and flow lines (102.3 mm × 6.0 mm, 4″ pipe; 50.7 mm × 4.8 mm, 2″ pipe) for conveying the associated gas. The pipe material is ANSI B31.8 API 5L X42. The chemical compositions of the collected pipe materials were determined by a Metallab 75/80 direct-reading spectrometer (GNR, Novara, Italy), and the results are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The tensile properties of the collected pipe materials were investigated by a WDW-300E computer-controlled universal testing machine (Shijin Testing Equipment, Jinan, China), and the test results are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The corresponding acceptance criteria are also listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> as Spec. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> that the chemical compositions and tensile properties of the three pipes with different diameters are all acceptable based on the requirements for PSL 2 seamless X42 pipe in API Spec 5L-2013; however, the content of sulfur in the 2″ pipe is more than the requirement. The microstructures of the 2″, 4″ and 6″ steel pipes in cross section, longitudinal section, and inner surface layer were observed by a Leica DM2500 M optical microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). No essential difference was found between cross-sectional, longitudinal-sectional, and inner surface microstructures; therefore, only the microstructures in the cross-section are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01935-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. It is obvious that the microstructures are normal and are composed of ferrite and pearlite.
