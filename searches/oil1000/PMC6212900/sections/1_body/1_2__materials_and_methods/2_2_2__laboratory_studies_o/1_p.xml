<p class="p">The information from the site investigation indicates that most leakage points are located at the bottom of the pipeline, whereas some are located on the side; only a few are located at the top. Representative corroded pipe sections were collected for laboratory studies. The internal corrosion morphology was observed macroscopically by a camera and microscopically by using a JXA 8230 scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The chemical composition of corrosion products on the pipe surface of the 2″, 4″, and 6″ steel pipe was obtained by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis using the JXA 8230 SEM. The phase compositions of corrosion products were analyzed using an X’ Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands).</p>
