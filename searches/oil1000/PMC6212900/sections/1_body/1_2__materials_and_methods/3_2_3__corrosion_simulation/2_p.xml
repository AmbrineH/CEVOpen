<p class="p">Corrosion simulation tests were conducted following ASTM G111 “Standard guide for corrosion tests in high-temperature or high-pressure environment, or both”. The tests were conducted in a kettle, and the specimens were positioned in three different environments. One-third of the total specimens was totally immersed in the water phase, which is a condition that corresponds to the so-called “bottom of the line” situation in gas pipelines; another one-third of the total specimens was partly immersed in the solution, which represents the working environment of the part of the pipe that corresponds to the transfer zone from liquid to gas environment; and the final one-third of the total specimens was exposed to high-pressure gas phase under water condensing conditions, which corresponds to the “top of the line” situation. The gas and the solution were prepared based on

 <xref rid="materials-11-01935-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, and nitrogen was used to replace the organic components in the simulated gas. Four specimens were investigated for each pipe in each environment; one of them was used for SEM observation and XRD analysis, and the other three were used to calculate the corrosion rate. The test temperature was 43 °C, and the test pressure was 11 MPa. The corrosion tests lasted 135 h.
