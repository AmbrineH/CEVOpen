<p class="p">The corrosion rates with different corrosion failure modes were determined in various ways. The weight loss rate was used to evaluate the general corrosion rate, and the depth of local corrosion pits was measured by Leica DM2500 M confocal microscopy. For comparison, the rate of depth change was used to represent the corrosion rate. Corrosion products were analyzed by EDS and XRD.</p>
