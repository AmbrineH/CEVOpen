 <p> Addition of amino acids in M2G medium recapitulates cell chaining phenotype. Cells were re-inoculated in M2G medium from overnight grown culture without amino acid (A) and with combination of individual amino acids (0.1 %) (B), followed by incubation at 30°C for 24 h. Number of cells were counted and plotted on the basis of morphology ( n = 250) (F). L-Methionine alleviates cell growth (C) but the combination of four amino acids L-methionine, L-lysine, L-aspartate, and L-threonine resulted in cell chaining (D). Addition of L-ornithine to the minimal medium also induced cell chaining (E). Scale bar, 5 μm. </p>
