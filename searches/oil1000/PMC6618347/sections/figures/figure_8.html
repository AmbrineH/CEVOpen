 <p> Cell wall analysis of D. indicus grown in different growth media. UPLC profiles of muropeptides obtained from D. indicus grown in PYE (A), NB (B), and TSB (C). The chromatograms represent monomer (1 and 2), dimer (3), and trimer (4) peaks and their corresponding chemical structures are shown in right panel. Peaks 2a, 3a, and 4a correspond to penta(Gly) containing muropeptides (labeled in red). </p>
