  <p class="p">Addition of amino acids in M2G medium recapitulates cell chaining phenotype. Cells were re-inoculated in M2G medium from overnight grown culture without amino acid 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> and with combination of individual amino acids (0.1 %) 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold>, followed by incubation at 30°C for 24 h. Number of cells were counted and plotted on the basis of morphology (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 250) 
   <bold class="bold">(F)</bold>. 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Methionine alleviates cell growth 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> but the combination of four amino acids 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-methionine, 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-lysine, 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-aspartate, and 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-threonine resulted in cell chaining 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold>. Addition of 
   <sc class="sc">L</sc>-ornithine to the minimal medium also induced cell chaining 
   <bold class="bold">(E)</bold>. Scale bar, 5 μm.
