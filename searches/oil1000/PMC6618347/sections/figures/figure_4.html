 <p> FM4-64 and DAPI staining showed daughter cell attachment at division sites. Cells were grown in (A) PYE, (B) LB, (C) NB, and (D) TSB growth media at 30°C to an OD 600 of 0.4–0.5 followed by inner membrane and nucleic acid labeling by FM4-64 and DAPI. Line scan analysis of cells grown in various media showed the distribution of DAPI and FM 4-64 along the cell length. Fluorescence intensities are represented as plots next to each panel. The cyan arrowed lines correspond to sections that were scanned to determine the fluorescence intensity. </p>
