 <p> D. indicus formed multi-cell chains in the presence of casamino acid (CAA) in growth media. Cells were grown at 30°C for 18 h in M2G medium with increasing concentration of CAA. (A) M2G medium without CAA (control), (B) M2G with 0.1% CAA, (C) M2G with 0.5% CAA, and (D) M2G with 1% CAA. Cells started elongating and formed convoluted multi-cell chains on successive addition of CAA. Scale bar, 10 μm. </p>
