 <p> Growth medium dependent morphological changes in D. indicus. DIC micrographs of D. indicus cells grown in varied growth media showed different morphology. For microscopy, cells were grown in (A) PYE, (B) M2G, (C) LB, (D) M63, (E) NB, and (F) TSB growth medium at 30°C for 18 h. (G) Cell length was measured ( n = 205) and compared with PYE incubated cells indicating a significant increase in the cell length in NB and TSB growth media ( p &lt; 0.001). Scale bar, 10 μm. </p>
