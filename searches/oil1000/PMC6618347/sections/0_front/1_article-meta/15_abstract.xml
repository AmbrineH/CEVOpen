  <italic class="italic">Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> exhibits growth medium-dependent morphological variation in cell shape, but there is no evidence whether this phenomenon is observed in other members of the Deinococcaceae family. In this study, we isolated a red-pigmented, aerobic, 
  <italic class="italic">Deinococcus indicus</italic> strain DR1 from Dadri wetland, India. This 
  <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> strain exhibited cellâ€“morphology transition from rod-shaped cells to multi-cell chains in a growth-medium-dependent fashion. In response to addition of 1% casamino acids in the minimal growth medium, rod-shaped cells formed multi-cell chains. Addition of all 20 amino acids to the minimal medium was able to recapitulate the phenotype. Specifically, a combination of 
  <sc class="sc">L</sc>-methionine, 
  <sc class="sc">L</sc>-lysine, 
  <sc class="sc">L</sc>-aspartate, and 
  <sc class="sc">L</sc>-threonine caused morphological alterations. The transition from rod shape to multi-cell chains is due to delay in daughter cell separation after cell division. Minimal medium supplemented with 
  <sc class="sc">L</sc>-ornithine alone was able to cause cell morphology changes. Furthermore, a comparative UPLC analysis of PG fragments isolated from 
  <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells propagated in different growth media revealed alterations in the PG composition. An increase in the overall cross-linkage of PG was observed in muropeptides from nutrient-rich TSB and NB media versus PYE medium. Overall our study highlights that environmental conditions influence PG composition and cell morphology in 
  <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>.
