<p class="p">Morphological changes in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> may be a result of minor changes in the cell wall mediated by the concentration of amino acids in the growth medium. Similar to 
 <italic class="italic">D. radiodurans</italic>, the cell wall of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> was found to be abundant in ornithine containing muropeptides (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quintela et al., 1999</xref>). However, muropeptides from both TSB and NB showed presence of glycine terminated muropeptides, which were absent in muropeptides extracted from PYE growth medium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). The most significant change was observed in PG components obtained from TSB medium, where the cross-linking was increased compared to PYE medium (68% vs. 57%). Studies have shown that minor alterations in the composition and cross-linking of the peptidoglycan drastically affect cell shape (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meberg et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Priyadarshini et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Also, cell curvature might be generated by alterations in PG crosslink number or length (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). Changes in PG cross-linking lead to alteration in curvature and helicity of 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic> (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>). Alteration in the ratio of tetra–tri and tri–tri cross-links also lead to changes in surface glycopeptidolipids, colony morphology, and biofilm formation in 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pandey et al., 2018</xref>). Growth medium-dependent glycine incorporation in PG is also observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takacs et al., 2013</xref>). However, it should be noted that in 
 <italic class="italic">C. crescentus</italic> increase in pentaGly muropeptides did not alter the overall PG cross-linking (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takacs et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">in D. indicus</italic>, the increase in overall PG cross-linking in both TSB and NB medium could be contributing toward altered cell morphology. The increase in PG cross-linkage could be affecting the cell separation of daughter cells after division leading to formation of chains in nutrient-rich growth media.
