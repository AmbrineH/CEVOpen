<p class="p">The question still remains as to why some bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">D. radiodurans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> exhibit growth media-induced morphological changes. It is proposed that bacterial size is limited by the competition for available nutrients (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Young, 2006</xref>). Thus, a bacterium can adapt to nutritional stress by altering its morphological form in a particular environment. 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> delays cell separation in the presence of CAA, indicating that availability of nutrients in the environment is sufficient to induce morphological variability. By keeping the newly formed daughter cells attached in chains, 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> effectively increases the number of cells in the particular environment which probably help in establishing biofilms in natural environments. While there are reports of altered morphology in some bacteria (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chou and Tan, 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rice et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shashidhar and Bandekar, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Joshi and Toleti, 2009</xref>), spatiotemporal control of cell division and cytokinesis is still not very well understood in Deinococcaceae family. 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> can serve as a good model system to study cell division and physiology of extremophiles.
