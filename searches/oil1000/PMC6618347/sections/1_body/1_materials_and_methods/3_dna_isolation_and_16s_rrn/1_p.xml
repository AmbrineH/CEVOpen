<p class="p">Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Udupa et al., 1994</xref>). Briefly, pellet of 10 ml culture was resuspended in 450 μl TE buffer after 15 min treatment in 95% ethanol. Cells were then treated with 0.1 mg lysozyme (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) followed by incubation for 30 min at 30°C. In addition, cells were treated with 25 μl 10% SDS and 2.5 μl proteinase K (20 mg/ml; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 12 h at 56°C. DNA was extracted by phenol–chloroform treatment and stored in TE buffer (pH 8.0) at 4°C.
