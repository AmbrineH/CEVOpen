<p class="p">For initial identification, isolated DNA was amplified by PCR with the universal primers targeting 16S rRNA gene sequence of bacteria – 27F: 5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′ and 1492R: 5′-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>-specific primers were designed using its partial 16S rRNA sequence for further verification (FP: 5′-AGGGTTTGATCCTGGCTC-3′; RP: 5′-GGGCGGTGTGTACAAGGC-3′). The following cycling conditions were used for PCR: 94°C for 10 min (94°C for 40 s, 56°C for 1 min, 74°C for 2 min) × 30 cycles, 74°C for 10 min (Eppendorf Thermal Cycler). Amplicons from PCR reaction were purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sent for sequencing (SciGenom Labs Private Ltd., Kerala, India). The sequence similarity was analyzed with BLAST tool on NCBI
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> which showed 99% similarity with 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>. Further, by multiple sequence alignment (Clustal Omega)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, the number of mismatches among top hits was compared with partial 16S rRNA sequence of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> Wt/1a strain.
