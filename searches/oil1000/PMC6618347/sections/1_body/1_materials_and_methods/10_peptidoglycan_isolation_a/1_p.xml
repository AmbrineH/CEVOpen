<p class="p">For the peptidoglycan profile and analysis, 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> DR1 strain was grown in three different media and harvested. Peptidoglycan purification was carried out as previously described in 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Desmarais et al. (2013)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alvarez et al. (2016)</xref> with some minor changes. Briefly, the cell pellets of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> were boiled in an equal volume of 5% (w/v) SDS for an hour and stirred overnight at 37°C. The sacculi were washed repeatedly with MilliQ water by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 13 min, 20°C Optima
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Max Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, CA, United States). The clean sacculi were digested with muramidase (Cellosyl 100 μg/ml) overnight at 37°C. The muramidase digestion was stopped by heat-inactivation at 100°C. Coagulated proteins were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 15 min). To reduce the samples, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 8.5–9.0 with borate buffer, followed by the addition of freshly prepared NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, samples were adjusted to pH 3.5 with phosphoric acid. Muropeptides were separated by UPLC on a Waters UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, United States) equipped with a Kinetex C18 UPLC Column, 130 Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm (Waters, Milford, MA, United States) and a dual wavelength absorbance detector. Elution of muropeptides was detected at 204 nm. Muropeptides were separated at 45°C using a linear gradient from Buffer A [formic acid 0.1% (v/v)] to Buffer B [formic acid 0.1% (v/v), acetonitrile 40% (v/v)] in an 18 min run with 0.250 ml/min flow.
