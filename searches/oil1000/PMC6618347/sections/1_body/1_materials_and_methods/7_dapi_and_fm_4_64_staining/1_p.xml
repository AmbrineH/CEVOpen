<p class="p">Cells were grown overnight in PYE, LB, NB, or TSB media at 30°C, re-inoculated next morning to mid-log phase and 1 ml of culture was centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>. Pellets were washed with 1× phosphate buffer saline (PBS), resuspended, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 2 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were spun and washed again with 1× PBS. Finally, FM 4-64 (4 μg/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for 15 min in dark, then DAPI (1 mg/ml) was added to the cells (1:1000 dilution) and left for additional 15 min at room temperature in dark. After final wash with 1× PBS cells were observed by microscopy.
