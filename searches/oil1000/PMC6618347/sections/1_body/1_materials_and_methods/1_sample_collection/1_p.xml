<p class="p">Water samples were collected in spring (April 2014) from the wetland of Dadri located in the north western region of Uttar Pradesh, India (coordinates 28°31′30.7″N 77°34′40.1″E). The average pH of water samples collected was ∼7.6 and the average temperature maintained in the water body throughout spring season was recorded as 30°C. Samples were collected in sterile glass bottles and immediately taken for further processing. Two liters of the collected water sample was filtered in a batch of 100 ml through a 0.22-μm-pore size filter (Millipore Corp.). Filter papers having the concentrated samples were kept over different media plates (PYE, R2A, LB, M2G, and M9) in triplicates and peeled off after 2 h. Plates were incubated overnight at 30°C. The next day, pinkish-red colonies were selected and streaked on fresh plates.</p>
