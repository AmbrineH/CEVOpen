 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), DAPI- and FM 4-64-stained cells were scanned for fluorescence intensity. Individual cells from each growth media (PYE, LB, NB, and TSB) were scanned using segmented line tool. The selected line scan was restored for other channel for unbiased fluorescence intensity measurement. Scan values were plotted individually for cells grown in separate media comparing different channels.
