 <italic class="italic">Deinococcus indicus</italic> cells were grown overnight in PYE medium and then re-inoculated in 5 ml fresh media (PYE, LB, M2G, M63, NB, and TSB), respectively. Cells were harvested at optical density (OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>) of 0.6, and imaged by DIC microscopy. Cell length was measured at 0.6 OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 200) by Nikon Eclipse Ti analysis tool and plotted using GraphPad Prism software. To check the effect of media components on morphological variation in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>, cells were grown with varying concentration of CAA. Overnight grown cells, previously inoculated in M2G medium at 30Â°C, were re-inoculated in fresh M2G with increasing concentration of CAA (0.1, 0.5, and 1%). Cell morphology was analyzed at the log phase using Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
