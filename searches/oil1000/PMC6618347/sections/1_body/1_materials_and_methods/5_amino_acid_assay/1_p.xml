 <italic class="italic">Deinococcus indicus</italic> cells were grown overnight in M2G medium at 30°C. Using this overnight culture, cells were re-inoculated in M2G medium containing specific combination of amino acids as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>. Control samples were grown in M2G medium without amino acids. After 24 h of incubation, cells were imaged in DIC using 1% agarose slides made in M2G medium. On the basis of morphology, cells were counted and plotted accordingly. Cell morphology was also analyzed with various combinations of amino acids using standard concentrations and 11 different amino acid combinations were examined for the diagnosis of auxotrophs according to the Manual for Advanced Molecular Genetics (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al., 1980</xref>). The combination of all 20 amino acids was maintained at 0.1% concentration whereas 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-ornithine concentration in the medium was kept equivalent to 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-lysine concentration (0.005%). Cells were imaged in DIC with 100× oil-immersion objective.
