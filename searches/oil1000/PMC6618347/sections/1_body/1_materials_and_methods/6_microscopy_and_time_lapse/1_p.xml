 <italic class="italic">Deinococcus indicus</italic> was inoculated in PYE medium and incubated overnight at 30°C. Next day, culture was re-inoculated in NB medium (1:100 dilution) and grown to an optical density of 0.1. Cells (5 μl) were placed over 1% agarose-coated slides made in NB medium and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to immobilize the cells. Time-lapse was performed for 8 h using a 100× oil-immersion objective, in DIC on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. Heating platform was used to maintain temperature at 30°C.
