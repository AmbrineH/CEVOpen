 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> strain wt/1a 16S ribosomal sequence. The whole genome of this bacterium was sequenced and the bacterium was named 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> strain DR1 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chauhan et al., 2017</xref>) and is referred as 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> in the rest of the manuscript. The family Deinococcaceae consists of non-spore forming bacteria which survive in ionizing radiations.
