<p class="p">During growth studies we observed that 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> exhibited different cell morphologies. Further examination revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> displayed small rod-shaped cells in PYE growth medium and multi-cell chains in LB, TSB, and NB media (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). We then grew 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells in different growth media and observed cell morphology. In both PYE and M2G media cells were short rods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and in LB medium cells were elongated and attached as chains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1C</xref>). In M63, NB, and TSB media multi-cell chains were observed, which were further coiled on each other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1D</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">F</xref>). Our results suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> displayed different morphotypes in different growth media. It is plausible that cell morphology changes could be a result of differential growth rate of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> in various growth media. Generation time of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> in various media was measured and it was found to be approximately 120 min in PYE and TSB, 150 min in LB, and 90 min in NB (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). As both in PYE and TSB the generation time was 120 min, and cells are rod shaped in PYE and multi-cell chains in TSB; it was concluded that growth rate was not the cause of the phenotype observed.
