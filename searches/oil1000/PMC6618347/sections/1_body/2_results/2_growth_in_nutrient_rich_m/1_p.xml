<p class="p">Microscopic analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells grown in LB, TSB, or NB media showed cells in chains, suggesting that some stage of cell division was inhibited. To get a closer look, we observed growth of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cell on TSB medium by time-lapse microcopy. In the initial stages the cells grew and divided normally and after 90 min, the cells started to elongate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The elongated cells were connected to each other at the old division sites (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). Even after 4 h daughter cells were not separated, suggesting a delay in cell separation. To confirm that the daughter cells remain attached at the division sites in multi-cell chains, we examined 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells grown in various growth media by SEM. Cells in PYE medium were rod shaped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>), while cells grown in LB, NB, and TSB media were in chains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">D</xref>). Cells in chains were connected at the division site, showing clear indentations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">D</xref>), suggesting that cell division is occurring but cell separation is not complete. To probe further which stage of cell division is inhibited in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells, we grew cells in different growth media and stained them with DAPI and FM 4-64, a lipophilic membrane dye. FM 4-64 dye has been used previously to stain membrane of 
 <italic class="italic">D. radiodurans</italic>, and FM 4-64 dye labeling was also observed at the division sites (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). As evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>, in PYE single rod-shaped cells and dividing cells with FM 4-64 staining at the midcell were observed. In LB, NB, and TSB media, strings of cells were attached together and in some cases FM 4-64 staining was retained between two cells at the old-division site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">D</xref>). Fluorescence intensity profiles of dividing cell obtained from PYE medium reinforced these observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). Cell division sites in these cells were identified by the coincident combination of a high intensity red peak (FM 4-64) coupled with a trough of low intensity between blue (DAPI) peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). In multi-cell chains formed in NB, TSB, and LB media, multiple high intensity blue peaks (DAPI signaling for the nucleoid) were observed along with multiple division sites (high intensity red peak coupled with a trough of low intensity between blue peaks) distributed in a repeating pattern along the lengths of the filaments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">D</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that in nutrient-rich media decoupling of cell division and cell separation leads to the formation of multi-cell chains.
