<p class="p">As growth of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells in nutrient-rich growth media delayed cell separation, it is plausible that when these multi-cell chains are transferred back to nutritionally poor medium, they would resume growth as rod-shaped cells. To test, we grew cells overnight in NB and LB media and then transferred them into PYE medium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A,D</xref>). After 5 h of growth in PYE, majority of the cells were rod shaped and only a few short multi-cell chains were observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C,F</xref>), indicating that there was no lag in cell separation. We also observed this phenomenon by time-lapse microscopy, and when cells grown in NB media were placed on PYE pad they grew as rod-shaped cells (Supplementary Video

 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> is influenced by the growth medium.
