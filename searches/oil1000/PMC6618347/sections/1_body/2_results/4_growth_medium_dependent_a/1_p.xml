<p class="p">Studies have shown that minor alterations in the composition and cross-linking of the peptidoglycan drastically affect cell shape (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). It is probable that growth of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> in various media could be causing alteration in PG composition. To investigate this further a comparative analysis of PG from 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cultures grown in either PYE, TSB, or NB was performed. As expected, we identified the presence of 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Orn muropeptides, a characteristic of Deinococcaceae family. Both 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Orn monomers and 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Orn crosslinked muropeptides were present in the samples obtained from PYE-grown cultures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Similar to 
 <italic class="italic">D. radiodurans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quintela et al., 1999</xref>), muropeptides crosslinked by (Gly)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> bridges were also observed in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> murein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). However, muropeptides from PYE grown 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> were abundant in 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Orn–
 <sc class="sc">D</sc>-Ala terminated muropeptides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), which are relatively low in 
 <italic class="italic">D. radiodurans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quintela et al., 1999</xref>). PG from 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cultures grown in nutrient-rich growth media (TSB and NB) exhibited muropeptides with extra terminal glycine [penta(Gly)] in addition to 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-Orn–
 <sc class="sc">D</sc>-Ala terminated muropeptides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The presence of penta(Gly) peptides represented the major difference between the muropeptides profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> PG obtained from PYE, TSB, and NB cultures.
