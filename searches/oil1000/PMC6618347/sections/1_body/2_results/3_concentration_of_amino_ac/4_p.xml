<p class="p">Ornithine is an intermediate of arginine biosynthesis. The Deinococcus family is predicted to have the AAA pathway for lysine biosynthesis, and enzymes involved in lysine biosynthesis are also involved in arginine biosynthesis (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lombo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is probable that the concentration of lysine in the growth medium could be regulating the amount of ornithine in the cell. We thus hypothesized that addition of exogenous ornithine alone in minimal medium would cause morphological alterations. Consistent with this hypothesis,
