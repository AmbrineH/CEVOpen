<p class="p">To further confirm whether the cell chaining could be recapitulated by addition of any single amino acid in minimal medium, we grew 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells in M2G medium with exogenous amino acids. None of the 20 amino acids when supplemented individually in M2G affected cell morphology. As no single amino acid was able to recapitulate the phenotype, it is probable that a combination of more than one amino acid is required to alter cell morphology of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>. To narrow down which combination of amino acids to test we selected the combinations listed in the Manual for Advanced Molecular Genetics (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al., 1980</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Out of all the 11 combinations tested, only one combination consisting of 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-methionine (0.9%), 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-lysine (1.1%), 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-aspartate (1.0%), and l-threonine (0.71%) showed cell deformities (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>). M2G medium containing this combination of amino acids had increased cell width and length and some cells were also growing as chains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7D</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). To assess the role of each of the four amino acids, we tested various combinations of these amino acids. M2G medium when supplemented with methionine increased the growth rate but did not alter cell morphology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Cells grown in a combination of both methionine and lysine displayed multi-cell chains, while a combination of methionine with either aspartate or threonine did not alter cell morphology. 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> grown in M2G medium supplemented with a combination of 18 amino acids devoid of only lysine and methionine did not exhibit multi-cell chains. It should be noted that cells grown in the presence of both methionine and lysine displayed less cells in chains compared to cells grown in medium supplemented with all four amino acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> and data not shown). Moreover, increase in average cell length was observed in presence of four amino acids (10.28 μm) when compared to control cells in M2G medium (2.5 μm) alone or M2G medium supplemented with 18 amino acids mixture lacking methionine and lysine (3.33 μm). Taken together our data suggest that the concentration of methionine and lysine in the growth medium plays a major role in inducing morphological alterations in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> (
