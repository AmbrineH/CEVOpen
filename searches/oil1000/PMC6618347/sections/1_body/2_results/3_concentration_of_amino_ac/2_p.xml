<p class="p">We further investigated if amino acids were able to delay cell separation in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells propagated in M2G medium containing a combination of all 20 amino acids (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), exhibited multi-cell chains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7B</xref>). About 25% of cell population grew as chains in M2G medium supplemented with 0.1% amino acids mixture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7F</xref>). Increasing the concentration of all 20 amino acids above 0.1% did not augment cell chaining (data not shown). M2G is a minimal growth medium, containing ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source. We also grew 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells in M2G medium supplemented with increasing amount of ammonium chloride and the cells retained their rod shape (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Taken together our data reinforce the notion that concentration of amino acids in the growth medium influences the morphology of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells.
