<p class="p">As morphological alterations were dependent upon some changes in the growth media composition, we analyzed the component of various media. PYE, LB, TSB, and NB are complex growth media containing, peptone, beef extract, or tryptone. M2G and M63 are minimal media, whereas M63 contains CAA, which are lacking in the former. Cells were rod shaped in M2G and multi-cell chains in M63, suggesting that the concentration of CAA in the growth media may be influencing the morphological alterations. To confirm this we added increasing amount of CAA in M2G medium and grew

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells started to chain upon addition of 0.1% CAA and these chains began to coil as the concentration was increased to 1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6A</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">D</xref>). M2G containing more than 1% CAA severely affected the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells. Taken together our data suggest that, in the presence of CAA, 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> grows and divides but delays cell separation, resulting in the formation of multicellular chains. LB and TSB contain NaCl, while PYE medium is devoid of NaCl. It is possible that the change in cell shape is influenced by salt concentration in the growth medium. To investigate this further, we grew 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells in LB and TSB media devoid of NaCl and cells were still attached together in chains suggesting that the phenotype observed was not due to the presence of sodium chloride in the growth medium (
