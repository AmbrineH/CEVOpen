<p class="p">In this study, we report the characterization of a red-pigmented, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium previously isolated from the wetland of Dadri, India (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chauhan et al., 2017</xref>). The bacterium was identified as belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Deinococcaceae</italic> and was designated as 
 <italic class="italic">Deinococcus indicus DR</italic>1 (referred as 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> in the manuscript). Our studies show nutrition-induced morphotypes in 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> which manifests as growth in multi-cell chains with increased cell size in nutrient-rich media in contrast to its existence as short rods in minimal or nutrient-depleted media. A role for casamino acids (CAA) in the growth medium is indicated for the observed phenotype. Addition of amino acid mixture to the minimal medium was able to recapitulate the multi-cell chaining phenotype, suggesting that concentration of amino acids in the growth medium induced morphological alterations. Moreover, addition of only 
 <sc class="sc">L</sc>-ornithine to minimal medium was sufficient to cause cell morphology changes. Furthermore, a comparative UPLC analysis of PG fragments isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic> cells propagated in different growth media revealed alterations in PG composition. The overall cross-linkage of PG was increased in muropeptides extracted from nutrient-rich TSB and NB media compared to PYE medium. Our study showed an unexpected plasticity in cell wall of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicus</italic>.
