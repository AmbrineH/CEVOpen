<p class="p">Mass spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a split–splitless injector. Separation was achieved using an Rtx-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm film thickness) (Restek, USA). The initial column temperature was kept at 45°C for 2 min and programmed to 300°C at a rate of 5°C/min, and kept constant at 300°C for 5 min. Injector temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.41 mL/min. Mass spectra were recorded applying the following conditions: Ion source temperature, 200°C; ionization voltage, 70 eV; (equipment current) filament emission current, 60 mA. Split mode injection of diluted samples (1% v/v) was applied with split ratio 1: 15.</p>
