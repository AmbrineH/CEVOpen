<p class="p">Membrane stabilization activity of the essential oils was assessed using hypotonic solution-induced erythrocyte hemolysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0219571.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of stock erythrocyte (RBCs) suspension was mixed with 5 mL of hypotonic NaCl solution (50 mM) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing the tested essential oil at a concentration of 7.81–1000 μg/mL. The control sample was composed of 0.5 mL of RBCs mixed with 5 mL hypotonic-buffered saline solution alone. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Indomethacin was used as a reference standard. In 96 well plates, the absorbance (O.D.) of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. The percentage inhibition of hemolysis or membrane stabilization percentage was calculated according to the method described by Shinde et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219571.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was defined as the concentration of the sample that inhibited 50% erythrocyte hemolysis under the assay conditions.
