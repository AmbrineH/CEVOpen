 <xref rid="pone.0219571.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Exponentially growing cells were seeded at a density of 10×10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well (HCT-116) and 15 x10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well (Hela) in 96-well plates. Stock solutions of essential oils in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were prepared. Essential oils were subjected to two-fold serial dilutions in the respective media where the maximal concentration of DMSO did not exceed 1%. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control. Cells were treated with 100 μL of the tested essential oils at concentrations ranging from 0.002–1.0 mg/mL Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Afterwards, 0.5 mg/mL of MTT was added, and the plates were incubated for additional 4 h. The formazan crystals produced by viable cells were dissolved in DMSO (100 μl) and subsequently shaken for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Tecan Safire II (Crailsheim, Germany) spectrophotometric plate reader. The percentage cell viability was calculated using the following formula: % cell viability = (OD of treated cells / OD of control cells) x 100.
