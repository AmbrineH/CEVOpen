<p class="p">The main goal of this study is phytochemical profiling of essential oils from three 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rigidus and C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viminalis</italic>) in different seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) by GLC/MS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied as pattern recognition techniques to discriminate between species and seasons. Moreover, essential oils were assessed for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities.
