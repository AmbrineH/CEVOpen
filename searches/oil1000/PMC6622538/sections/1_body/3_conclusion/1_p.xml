<p class="p">The phytochemical profiling of the essential oils from three 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species by GLC/MS showed that oxygenated monoterpenes represent the major class of the oil components with eucalyptol as the major secondary metabolite. The chemical profiles show high qualitative and quantitative similarities between species. Different chemometric analysis techniques were effectively applied as a discriminatory tool to differentiate between three 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species, in each season, and within the same species in different seasons. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viminalis</italic> essential oil exhibited pronounced membrane stabilization activity, which was equivalent to that of the standard drug, indomethacin. The three essential oils showed no cytotoxic activity against tested cancer cell lines. Future studies should be implemented to unravel other potential bioactivities of 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> essential oils.
