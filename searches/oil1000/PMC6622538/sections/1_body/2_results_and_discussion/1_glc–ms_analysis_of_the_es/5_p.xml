 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> leaves from Western Himalayas revealed high content of

Thus, remarkable qualitative and quantitative variations in essential oil composition could be traced among plants collected in different geographical regions and /or seasons which necessitates construction of a simple and efficient chemometric model that could discriminate closely related species collected in different seasons.
