<p class="p">The major secondary metabolite of the three essential oils in different 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species was eucalyptol (syn. 1,8-cineole) ranging from (71.27% - 81.70%), (69.15% -81.70%), (64.63% - 79.39%) and (55.69% - 80%) in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively, with the highest variation in summer and spring. Essential oils of the three 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species in four seasons showed α-terpineol and α-pinene as major components in addition to eucalyptol. α-Thujene, β-pinene, O-cymene, ɣ-terpinene, terpinolene and 4-terpinenol were detected as common constituents in all 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species.
