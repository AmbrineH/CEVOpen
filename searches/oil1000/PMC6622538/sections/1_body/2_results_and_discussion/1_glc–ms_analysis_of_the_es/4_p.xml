<p class="p">Our results were consistent with previous reports on the essential oils obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species from different geographical regions. A study conducted on thirty Australian 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species reported that 1,8-cineole was the major component (45–80%) of the majority of leaf essential oils. Other identified compounds include α-pinene (2–40%), limonene (2–9%) and α-terpineol (1–13%) [

 <italic class="italic">lanceolatus</italic> (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic>) from the north-eastern region of India exhibited 1,8 cineole (58.3%) as a major constituent followed by α-pinene, α-phellandrene, limonene and α-terpineol [

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> from Reunion was found to be rich in 1,8-cineole (68.0%) followed by α-pinene and α-terpineol [

 <xref rid="pone.0219571.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Essential oils from Brazil, were characterized by a high content of 1,8-cineole (77.0% and 65.0%) for

 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>.

 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rigidus</italic> from Cameroon were dominated by 1,8-cineole (73.8% and 79.1%, respectively) [
