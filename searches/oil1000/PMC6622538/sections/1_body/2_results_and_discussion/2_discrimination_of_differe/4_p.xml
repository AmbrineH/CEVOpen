<p class="p">In an attempt to find the relationship between the phytochemical profile of each 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species in different seasons, PCA was applied as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219571.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A, 5B &amp; 5C</xref>. Regarding 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viminalis</italic>, PCA score plot demonstrated the discrepancy in the chemical composition of the essential oils collected in each season where they were completely segregated from each other with eucalyptol, α-pinene and α-terpineol as major metabolites with the highest impact on the separation of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic>. In addition to eucalyptol, α-pinene, β-myrcene exhibited an influence on the segregation of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viminalis</italic> in different seasons. For 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rigidus</italic>, a substantial difference was observed between essential oils constituents in spring and summer that are distanced from each other, with regard to that of autumn and winter that are closely related. From the loading plot, it was found that 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-cymene and pseudolimonene were the main markers responsible for the segregation of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rigidus</italic> in summer, however α-pinene discriminates the species in spring.
