<p class="p">Different bar charts were constructed for the major identified components of 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> essential oils. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219571.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>, bar charts exhibited quantitative and qualitative differences regarding the metabolic profile of each species in each studied season. There are very close correlations between different 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> species in different seasons, as all samples showed eucalyptol as the major metabolite. Metabolic profiling (29 components, 
 <xref rid="pone.0219571.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were subjected to both PCA and HCA to reveal the chemical variability, and the inter-relationships between the oils in each season and among different species.
