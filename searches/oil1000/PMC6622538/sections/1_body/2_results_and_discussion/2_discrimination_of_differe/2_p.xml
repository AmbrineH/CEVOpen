<p class="p">PCA explained 99% and 100% of the variance of the data in spring and summer seasons, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219571.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A &amp; 2B</xref>. The three species were significantly discriminated from each other, and each species was located in a different quadrant away from the other species. Loading plots showed that the main discriminating markers were eucalyptol, α-pinene and linalool. However, regarding autumn and winter season, PCA described about 100% of data discrepancy as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219571.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A &amp; 3B</xref>, where each species was completely segregated from each other. In addition to eucalyptol, α-pinene, and linalool, the loading plot showed that one main discriminating metabolic maker was α-terpineol, which highly influenced the segregation between the samples in winter season. However, for autumn both eucalyptol and α-terpineol were recognized as a marker for separation between different species.
