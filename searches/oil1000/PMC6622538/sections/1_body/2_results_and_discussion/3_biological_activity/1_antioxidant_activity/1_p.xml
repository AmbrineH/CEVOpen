<p class="p">Essential oils have attracted attention for the plethora of bioactivities they possess. 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> essential oils were assessed for DPPH radical scavenging capacity. Antioxidant activity was presented herein as the concentration of essential oil that resulted in 50% free radical inhibition (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viminalis</italic> showed more pronounced antioxidant activity than 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic>, exhibiting IC50 values of 1.40 mg/mL and 1.77 mg/mL, respectively. Nevertheless, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rigidus</italic> showed very weak antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> above the tested concentration range. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid exhibited IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 14.2 μg/ml. Results were in agreement with previous studies. Essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> showed free radical scavenging activity with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 4.02 mg/mL [

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citrinus</italic> leaf essential oil, comparable to 0.1 mg/mL gallic acid (95.7 ± 2%) [
