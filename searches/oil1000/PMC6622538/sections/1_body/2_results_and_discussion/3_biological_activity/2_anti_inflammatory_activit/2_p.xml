<p class="p">The erythrocyte membrane is analogous to the lysosomal membrane. Thus, its stabilization serves as a parameter to assess the ability to stabilize the lysosomal membrane [

Stabilization of the lysosomal membrane is necessary to limit the inflammatory response through inhibition of the release of lysosomal constituents of activated neutrophils such as proteases and bactericidal enzymes. Exposure of erythrocytes to a hypotonic medium results in membrane lysis [

 <italic class="italic">Callistemon</italic> essential oil observed herein could be attributed to the ability of essential oil constituents to integrate into cellular membranes, increasing the surface area to volume ratio of the cells that might be brought about by expansion of the membrane or shrinkage of the cell, as well as an interaction with membrane proteins [
