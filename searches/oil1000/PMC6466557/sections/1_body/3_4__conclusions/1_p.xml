<p class="p">The data obtained indicate the fixed 
 <italic class="italic">O. speciosa</italic> almond oil as a valuable source of lauric, oleic, and myristic fatty acids, with a potential for modifying aminoglycoside antibiotic activity. In this sense, the use of the almonds which become residues during babassu consumption or processing, as a source for obtaining the fixed oil with the purpose of studying its antibacterial properties in isolation and in association with antibiotics is suggested.
