<p class="p">Evaluation of the fixed oil as an antibiotic activity modifier was performed according to Pereira et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-08-00028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For each Eppendorf tube, 1162 μL of 10% BHI was used with 150 μL of the inoculum from each strain as well as the tested oil at a volume corresponding to a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/8 = 128 μg/mL). Controls were prepared with only 1350 μL of 10% BHI and 150 μL of bacterial suspension. The plates were filled in numerical order, and each well received 100 μL of this solution. Microdilution was performed with 100 μL of each antibiotic being added up to the penultimate well and the final volumes being discarded. The tests were performed in triplicates, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and read through the addition of resazurin.
