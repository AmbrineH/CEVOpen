<p class="p">The fixed oil minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined according to Pereira et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-08-00028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For the assay, Eppendorf tubes were prepared using 100 μL of the inoculum and 900 μL of 10% BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) liquid culture medium in 96-well plates filled in the numerical sense with 100 μL of this solution being added to each well. Serial microdilution was then performed using 100 μL of the oil, varying the concentration from 1024 to 1.0 μg/mL. The tests were performed in triplicates, and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. To read the bacterial MIC, 20 μL of resazurin was added to each well, where the color of the wells were observed after 1 h with a color change from blue to red corresponding to microbial growth and a permanence in the blue color corresponding to the absence of growth.
