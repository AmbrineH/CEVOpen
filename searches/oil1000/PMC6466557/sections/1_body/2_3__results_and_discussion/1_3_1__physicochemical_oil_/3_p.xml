 <xref rid="antibiotics-08-00028-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The oilâ€™s GC/MS chemical composition analyses allowed the identification of four constituents, corresponding to 100% of the fatty acids present. The oil was characterized by a high saturated fatty acid content (76.90%), where lauric acid was the most representative (56.28%), followed by myristic acid (14.38%). The only unsaturated fatty acid identified was oleic acid (23.10%).
