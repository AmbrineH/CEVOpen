<p class="p">The major constituents observed in the fixed 
 <italic class="italic">O. speciosa</italic> oil in this study were different from those found in the hot oil extracted using an organic solvent. Darnet et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-08-00028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found oleic (75.7%) and palmitic (18.9%) acids at higher quantities in the oil. Similarly, Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-08-00028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] found oleic (74.0%) and palmitic (16.7%) acids as the main constituents of this oil. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids were predominant in the oil obtained in both studies.
