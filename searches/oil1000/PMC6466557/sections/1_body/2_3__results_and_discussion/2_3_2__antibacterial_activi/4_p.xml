<p class="p">The fixed oilâ€™s ability to act either as an antibacterial or as an antibiotic modifier may be related to the detergent property of fatty acids against the amphipathic structure of the bacterial cell membrane. In addition, the detergent ability to solubilize membrane components (lipids and proteins) may cause breaks in this structure and affect metabolic processes essential for obtaining energy for the bacterial cell, such as the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. These membrane damages can also lead to difficulties with nutrient absorption, enzymatic activity inhibition, and toxic peroxidation generation [

In addition, the presence of hydrophobic compounds in the fixed oils may make the cell more permeable to antibiotics, thus increasing its efficiency and reducing the minimum concentration required to affect the bacterial cell [
