 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00028-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the MICs of the antibiotics and the synergistic effects of the fixed oil in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics. A significant synergistic MIC reduction effect was observed with amikacin and gentamicin against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (SA-10). On the other hand, a significant antagonistic effect was observed in the amikacin activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The oilâ€™s modifying activity over aminoglycoside antibiotics varied according to the antibiotic type associated with the oil and the bacterial strain analyzed.
