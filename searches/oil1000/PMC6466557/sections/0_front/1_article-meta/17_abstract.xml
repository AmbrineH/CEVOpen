  <italic class="italic">Orbignya speciosa</italic> (babassu) is an important palm tree in Brazil whose fixed almond oil is used in popular medicine and especially in food, in addition to being a research target for the manufacture of biofuels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fixed almond oil physicochemical characterization and its antibacterial activity in isolation and in association with aminoglycosides against standard and multidrug-resistant bacteria. Analyses such as water content, pH, acidity, peroxide index, relative density, and refractive index indicate the stability and chemical quality of the oil. In the oil’s GC/MS chemical composition analysis, a high saturated fatty acid (76.90%) content was observed. Lauric acid (56.28%) and oleic acid (23.10%) were the major oil components. In the antibacterial test, a more significant oil activity was observed against 
  <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> KP-ATCC 10031 (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 406.37 μg/mL) and 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 (MIC = 812.75 μg/mL), but for the other strains—including standard and multi-resistant strains—the oil presented an MIC ≥ 1024 μg/mL. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when the oil was associated with amikacin and gentamicin against 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (SA-10) and an antagonistic effect was observed with amikacin against 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>. Data indicate the 
  <italic class="italic">O. speciosa</italic> oil as a valuable nutritional source of lauric, oleic, and myristic fatty acids with an ability to modulate aminoglycoside activity.
