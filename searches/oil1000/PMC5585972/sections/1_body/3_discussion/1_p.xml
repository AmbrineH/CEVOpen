<p id="Par20" class="p">Here, we showed the pronounced larvicidal activity of the investigated essential oils against wild larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">An.arabiensis</italic> and laboratory-reared larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.s.</italic>) despite their different chemical components. Clove and cinnamon essential oils under investigation were found to have one common main active ingredient, Eugenol (4-alil-2-methoxyphenol). A similar chemical composition has been described for these essential oils with different extraction techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The mortality caused by cinnamon was found to be higher than that caused by the clove essential oils, which might be attributed to the presence of β-linalool, found in cinnamon essential oils although in a small proportion. In a previous study, 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum suave</italic> essential oils extracts containing Eugenol as the highest occurring active ingredient had the lowest mortality in grain pests when tested in the absence of β-linalool than with β-linalool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. In previous reports, Eugenol mostly showed a high adult repellency effect rather than inducing larval mortality [
