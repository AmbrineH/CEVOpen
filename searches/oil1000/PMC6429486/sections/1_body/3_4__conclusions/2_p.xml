<p class="p">Our study showed that different drying techniques (lyophilization and shade-drying at 4 °C) did not affect the composition and yield of EOs. Location, soil characteristics, and geographical factors did not affect the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii.</italic> The main factor influencing EO yield and composition was the harvest time, which affected the relative presence of carvacrol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinne, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene, thymol methyl oxide, and thymoquinone. What was remarkable in our study is that the flowering period (June and July) affected neither the relative proportion of carvacrol, nor the overall composition of the EO. A harvesting period from March until September would give a maximal antimicrobial property (correlated with carvacrol content), with the highest yields obtainable from June to July. Harvesting 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> in Aabadiye in January and February would yield a thymoquinone-rich EO with higher anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties.
