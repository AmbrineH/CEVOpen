<p class="p">In conclusion, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the drying methods, time, and region of harvest on the yield and the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO. The EO analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> extracted by hydrodistillation from plant material harvested in Aabadiye and Qartaba highlighted the presence of six major constituents, with a predominance of carvacrol. This led us to the conclusion that the studied populations belong to the carvacrol chemotype. In addition to carvacrol, the most abundant compounds present in the EOs were 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, thymol methyl oxide, thymoquinone, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene.
