 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> were collected from a rocky ground near a degraded juniper forest, at Qartaba (34°05’58” N 35°48’46” E/Jbeil District/Mount Lebanon Governorate), at an altitude of 1250 m, and a Pine forest at Aabadiye (33°50’11” N 35°37’13” E/Baabda District/Mount Lebanon Governorate) at an altitude of 600 m. The harvest was conducted twice a month, throughout 2013 and 2014, at all the vegetative stages of plant development. Sampling started from March 1, 2013 and continued until December 1, 2014. Botanical identification of the plant samples was carried out by Dr. Marc El Beyrouthy according to the New Flora of Lebanon and Syria, as described by Mouterde [

A voucher specimen of each plant was deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences of USEK, Lebanon under the registry numbers MNIII187a for the Qartaba plant and MNIII187b for the Aabadiye plant. The fresh samples (150 g) were either dried in the absence of light in a cold room at 4 °C for one month (shade-drying at 4 °C), or were lyophilized using a Virtis bench top “K” lyophilizer machine. The EOs were obtained by hydrodistillation performed for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus, according to the European Pharmacopoeia [

The composition of the 94 oils (49 obtained from samples harvested at Qartaba and 45 from samples collected at Aabadiye) was determined with GC-MS. Since this plant is over-harvested by local inhabitants, quantities were sometimes insufficient to collect at a constant frequency (twice per month). EO yield, expressed in mL/g, was calculated by measuring the volume of oil extracted per weight of dried/lyophilized plant material.
