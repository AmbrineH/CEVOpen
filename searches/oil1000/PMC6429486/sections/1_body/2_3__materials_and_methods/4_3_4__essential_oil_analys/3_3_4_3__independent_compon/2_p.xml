<p class="p">The general ICA model is given by: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula"> X = A Ã— S 
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where X is the matrix of observed signals, S is the matrix of unknown source signals (the ICs), and A is the mixing matrix of unknown coefficients directly related to the corresponding proportions of the signals (contributions of source signals to the observed signals).
