<p class="p">Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique for blind source separation (BSS) [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It aims to recover underlying “source” signals from a set of signals where they are mixed in unknown proportions, based on the assumption that these source signals are statistically independent [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. ICA retrieves ICs and maximizes the statistical independence among the extracted source signals by using a linear transformation that maximizes the non-Gaussianity of these signals [
