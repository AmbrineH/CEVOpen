<p class="p">The choice of the number of independent components is a very crucial step to consider in an ICA data treatment. In our case, ICA-DA, an extension of ICA inspired by the work of Gustafsson, was introduced in order to make a pertinent choice [

It consists of creating a new matrix, Z, made by the concatenation of 2 matrices, the original matrix X of the peak areas of the chromatograms (observed signals) and the matrix Y, corresponding to the information about the groups of samples. The matrix Y contains vectors corresponding to the predefined groups and highlighting the studied factors: geographical location of harvest (two sites implying two predefined groups), time of harvest (twelve months implying twelve predefined groups), and drying methods (two methods implying two predefined groups). The matrix Y contains as many rows as there are individuals in the matrix X, and as many columns as there are predefined groups. All values in this matrix are zeros, except when an individual is a member of a group, in which case the cell contains a 1. This matrix of predefined groups is then scaled by multiplying all values by the maximum value in the X matrix. Subsequently, ICA is applied to this new matrix Z (X, Y). The number of ICs, which gives a maximum discrimination of samples is chosen [

The corresponding proportions are influenced by the predefined groups. It is therefore necessary to recalculate the proportions using only the original matrix X, in order to determine whether the MS variables selected by ICA-DA are able alone to discriminate the samples into the predefined groups.
