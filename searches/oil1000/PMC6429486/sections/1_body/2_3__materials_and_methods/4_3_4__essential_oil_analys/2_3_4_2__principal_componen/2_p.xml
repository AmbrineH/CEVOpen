<p class="p">In fact, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, and Pearson’s test gave valuable information about the correlations between variables. However, no specific information can be extracted, since these techniques were used to determine whether there are any significant differences between individual variables. Furthermore, the vectors calculated by PCA, which may usually denote combinations of diverse phenomena, cannot reveal a physical reality. Consequently, ICA, which extracts statistically independent vectors related to the “source” signals, and CCSWA, which determines a common space describing the dispersion of all the data, were applied to the data set in order to obtain signals that were chemically easier to interpret and in order to study the effect of drying methods, time, and region of harvest on EO chemical composition.
