<p class="p">Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry generates a large amount of data for each analyzed sample. In this paper, the tables considered for the CCSWA method are in fact the different chromatographic peak surfaces of the EO chemical compounds for the oil samples. The data therefore consisted of 54 tables corresponding to the 54 compounds found in the GC-MS signals for each of the 94 samples. CCSWA determines a common space describing the dispersion of all the data sets; each table having a specific weight (or “salience”) associated with each dimension in this common space.</p>
