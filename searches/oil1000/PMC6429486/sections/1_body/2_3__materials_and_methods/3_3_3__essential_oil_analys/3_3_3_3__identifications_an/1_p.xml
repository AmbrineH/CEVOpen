<p class="p">Most constituents were identified by comparing mass spectra on both columns with those stored in NIST and Wiley 275 libraries and our home-made library constructed with pure compounds and EOs of known composition (such as the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. from 
 <italic class="italic">Phytosun Aroms</italic>, Pl√©lo, France). The mass spectra were also compared to those from literature [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. A further identification was achieved by comparing their retention indices (RI) on both polar and apolar columns with those from literature [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], or with those of standard compounds available in our laboratories, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> to C
 <sub class="sub">25</sub>) analyzed under the same GC-MS operating conditions. Relative proportions of oil constituents were calculated from the GC peak areas corrected using the probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN), using the median of all the chromatograms as reference signal for the correction [
