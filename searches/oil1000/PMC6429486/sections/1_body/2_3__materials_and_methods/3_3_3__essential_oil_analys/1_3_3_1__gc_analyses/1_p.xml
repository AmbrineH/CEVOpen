<p class="p">Analytical gas chromatography was carried out on a Thermo Electron Corporation gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector (FID), a non-polar HP-5MS (5% Phenyl Methyl Siloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and a polar fused-silica HP Innowax polyethylene glycol capillary column (50 m × 0.20 mm i.d., film thickness 0.20 μm) (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Helium was the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min). The column temperature was initially set to 35 °C before being gradually increased to 85 °C at 5 °C/min, held for 20 min at 85 °C, raised to 300 °C at 10 °C/min, and finally held for 5 min at 300 °C. Diluted 1 µL samples (1/100
