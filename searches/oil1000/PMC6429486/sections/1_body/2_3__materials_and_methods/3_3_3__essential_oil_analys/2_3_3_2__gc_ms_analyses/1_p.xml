<p class="p">The GC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph 6890 coupled with a 5975 Mass Detector. The 7683 B auto sampler injected 1 µL of each oil sample diluted in pentane (1/100

A fused silica capillary column HP-5MS (5% Phenyl Methyl Siloxane) (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, film thickeness 0.25 µm) (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) or a fused silica HP Innowax polyethylene glycol capillary column (50 m × 0.20 mm, film thickness 0.20 µm) (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Helium was the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min). The oven temperature program was identical to that described above (
