<p class="p">In addition, an ANOVA analysis indicated a significant difference in yield as a function of altitude. EO yields obtained from plant material collected at Qartaba (1250 m.a.s.l.) were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower than those obtained from Aabadiye (600 m.a.s.l.). With increasing altitude, the yields decreased. 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-01026-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the altitudes of the two geographical locations focused on, and the main chemical parameters of the associated soils. Unfortunately, we could not collect samples of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> in all months from the specific sites, due to over-harvesting by local inhabitants. The two sites can be distinguished through a set of parameters (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-01026-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In Qartaba (1250 m.a.s.l), the pH and the contents of P

 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, and nitrogen of the soil were higher, while the organic matter was slightly lower than in Aabadiye (600 m.a.s.l.). It is not clear which factor(s) exerted the strongest influence on EO yield. Although organic matter could, in principle, favor plant growth, the difference in organic matter between the two sites seems too small to have had a significant effect on EO production [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Precipitation can also significantly influence EO yield [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Since both villages are located on the Mount Lebanon range, exposed to similar quantity of precipitation, this parameter seems not to be responsible [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Another possible parameter is the altitude above sea level, which is correlated with significant average temperature differences. In fact, similarly, Avci reported the highest EO yield obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus praecox</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">scorpilii</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">laniger</italic> samples from the lowest altitude [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and Baydar reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum onites</italic> L. growing at higher altitudes yielded less EO than those from lower altitudes [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Additionally, according to Giuliani et al., 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> L. ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">vulgare</italic> EO contents decline with increasing altitude [
