<p class="p">One-way ANOVA indicated significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in EO yield as a function of the growing phase and the date of collection. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the mean values of EO yield (mL/g) from 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> increased significantly from January to July, and peaked at the flowering stage in June and July. The highest yields were 3.83% in July 2013 and 4.04% in July 2014 for samples harvested from Qartaba and dried by lyophilization, and 4.52% in July 2013 and 3.97% in June 2014 for samples harvested from Aabadiye and dried by lyophilization. Collections made after July showed lower EO contents. These results could be explained by the accumulation of EO during the full-flowering stage, possibly related to ecological pressures such as pathogenic microorganisms (fungi, bacteria virus), herbivory, or the need for attracting pollinators [
