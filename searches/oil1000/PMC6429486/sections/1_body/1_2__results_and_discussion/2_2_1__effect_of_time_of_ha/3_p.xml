<p class="p">Hence, it is likely that altitude difference is causing yield reduction in this case. Analyses of EO content with plant material collected at different altitudes could provide insights into the causative potential on EO content of this parameter. Further investigations are necessary in order to better understand the effect of altitude and year of harvest on 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO yield. Lastly, Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests showed that the two drying methods applied in this study (lyophilization and shade-drying at 4 °C) did not significantly affect EO yields (
