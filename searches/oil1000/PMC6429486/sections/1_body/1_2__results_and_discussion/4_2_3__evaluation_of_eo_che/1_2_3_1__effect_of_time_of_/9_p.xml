<p class="p">CC4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a) showed a slight discrimination of samples harvested in September, October, November, December, January and February from the rest of the samples. According to the saliences of CC4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b), the data tables contributing to this discrimination corresponded mainly to thymoquinone (0.768), linalool (0.726) and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-dihydrocarvone (0.661). The loadings of CC4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>c) highlighted that the samples harvested during these months contained more of these three terpenes than those harvested during the rest of the year.
