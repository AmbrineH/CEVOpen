<p class="p">The signal extracted in the first IC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), directly related to signals of chemical compounds extracted from the volatile mixture, is mainly due to carvacrol. The proportions of this IC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) are lower in the samples harvested between November and March (months: 1, 2, 3, 11, and 12), and higher in the other months. On the other hand, IC2 has a positive contribution from 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and negative contributions from 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). As can be seen in the corresponding proportions plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>), the samples harvested between October and February (months: 1, 2, 10, 11, and 12) should therefore contain more 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and less 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene than the samples harvested between March and September (months: 3–9).
