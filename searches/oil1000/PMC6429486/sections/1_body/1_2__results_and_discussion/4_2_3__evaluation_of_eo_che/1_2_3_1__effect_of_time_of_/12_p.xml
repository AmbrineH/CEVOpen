<p class="p">In light of this observation, the differences in the accumulation of major biologically active compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO associated with the seasonal development of the plant confirm the influence of the physiological stages on EO composition. The observed chemical variability could be due to the interactions between genetic (biotic) factors, climatic and environmental (abiotic) factors, seasonality, age, maturity, and ontogenic stages of the plant [
