<p class="p">It seems, thus, that the accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene is correlated with low temperatures. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, which transforms 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene into carvacrol, is down-regulated or less active at low temperatures, resulting in an accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene. At higher temperatures, from March to October, the proportion of carvacrol increased and remained stable regardless of the vegetative stage (pre-flowering, flowering, and post-flowering stages). Overall, flowering itself did not significantly change the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic>. This result stands in contrast to studies conducted on 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic>, which noted that the content of the main components, thymol and carvacrol, increased considerably during the period of flowering [

 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> also includes, besides being endemic to Lebanon, its carvacrol content, which contributes more than 80% of the total percentage of the EO. This phenolic compound is known for its pronounced broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity [
