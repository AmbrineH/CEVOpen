<p class="p">CC2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a) distinguished samples harvested in June, July, and August from the rest of the samples. The values of the saliences corresponding to CC2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b) showed that the major compounds contributing to CC2 and influencing this discrimination are myrcene (0.74), 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene (0.63), and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene (0.473). Looking at the loadings of CC2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01026-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c), it can be deduced that the samples harvested in June, July, and August contained more myrcene, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene than those harvested in all the other months.
