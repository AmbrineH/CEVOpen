 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01026" class="xref">Table S2</xref>) (the highest proportions were detected from September to January). The highest amounts of this molecule were recorded in Aabadiye EO samples collected during January 2014, for plant material shade-dried at 4 Â°C (12.8%), and, in February 2014, for lyophilized material (11.6%) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01026" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). The presence of thymoquinone is thus inversely related to carvacrol. This led us to conclude that, in winter, carvacrol is presumably biotransformed into thymoquinone [
