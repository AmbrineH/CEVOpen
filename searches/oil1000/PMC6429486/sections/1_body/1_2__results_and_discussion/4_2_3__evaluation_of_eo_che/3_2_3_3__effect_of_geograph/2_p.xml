 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> harvested at Qartaba (1250 m.a.s.l.) naturally grows on sandy clay soils while in Aabadiye (600 m.a.s.l.) it grows on sandy silt soils. Our results show that the composition of the oils is not correlated to the place of collection, i.e., the environmental factors associated (such as humidity, altitude, temperature, and climate) and the soil characteristics. It can be concluded that the composition is most probably linked to the botanical variety and genetic factors. A Pearson’s test confirmed this assumption as the correlations of carvacrol, thymoquinone, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, thymol methyl oxide and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene with soil characteristics were non-significant (
