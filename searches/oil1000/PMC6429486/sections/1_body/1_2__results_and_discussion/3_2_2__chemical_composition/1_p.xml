<p class="p">The 94 samples of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO obtained by hydrodistillation of dried aerial plant material and analyzed by GC-MS revealed the presence of 54 components, representing 80.4–99.8% of the total EO of the samples of Qartaba and 87.9–99.7% of the total EO of the samples of Aabadiye.

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01026" class="xref">Supplementary Materials</xref>, show the detected chemical composition of the EOs derived from the 94 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> samples harvested twice a month throughout 2013–2014 from Qartaba and Aabadiye. Compounds were classified into different groups: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and other components. Monoterpenes, both monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were the most frequently represented classes. The main components were: carvacrol (55.3–89.7% in Qartaba; 48.1–88.6% in Aabadiye), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (1.3–16.6% in Qartaba; 1.6–20.9% in Aabadiye), 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene (0.1–4.8% in Qartaba; 0.3–7.1% in Aabadiye), thymoquinone (0.0–2.9% in Qartaba; 0–12.8% in Aabadiye), thymol methyl oxide (1.7–9.3% in Qartaba; 1.1–7.1% in Aabadiye), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene (0.5–5% in Qartaba; 0.4–4.3% in Aabadiye) and caryophyllene oxide (0.1–2.7% in Qartaba; 0.1–2.9% in Aabadiye).
