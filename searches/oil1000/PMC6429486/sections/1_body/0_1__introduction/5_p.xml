<p class="p">Basic knowledge in plant phenology and factors influencing the composition of secondary metabolites is essential for the determination of the optimal harvest period [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to a better knowledge of factors influencing the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> Eos, in order to detect possible chemotypes and for the determination of the optimal harvest time depending on the preferences. The main objective of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively track the variability of the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO from March 2013 until December 2014, taking vegetative growth stage, drying method, and geographical location into account. To the best of our knowledge, no studies dealing with the variation of the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> have been published to date. 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum ehrenbergii</italic>, endemic to Lebanon and growing in localized populations throughout the country, is treated under the protection act (Decision 1/340 (1996) by the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture), which regulates its harvest and its commercial exploitation. The sustainable production of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ehrenbergii</italic> EO constitutes an important economic resource for a part of the rural population of Lebanon.
