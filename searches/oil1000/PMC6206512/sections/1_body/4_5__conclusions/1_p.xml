 <italic class="italic">M fruticosa serpyllifolia </italic>VOs from different regions in Palestine represented by three cities showed variable antilipase and antiamylase activities depending on the phytochemical constituents of the volatile oils.
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia </italic>VOs of three regions owned the same chemical components but in difference proportions. The sample from north Palestine (Nablus) exhibited highest antilipase and antiamylase activity due to higher amount of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene. Further
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> studies are needed to evaluate the potential pharmacological activities and to assess the safety and toxicity of plant extract. Also further studies are required to isolate the basic components responsible for potential pharmacological activities.
