<p class="p">Dissimilar to conventional single drug, plant extracts or raw plants have a range of phytochemicals and bioactive constituents that provide synergistic effects which allow for multitarget effect in curing of diseases [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The medicinal plants and their claimed traditional use are considered one of the major approaches in developing new drug from natural products [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, and volatile oils (VOs), are important for healing diseases and are responsible for the therapeutic effect of plants; for example, VOs have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anthelmintic, antimalarial, antiviral, antibacterial, cholesterol inhibition, and insecticide effects [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Volatile oil also called “ethereal oil” or “essential oil” is extracted from different parts of plant (roots, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The chemical compounds of VOs can be classified into oxygenated (ketones, alcohols, phenols, etc.) and hydrocarbons (limonene, pinene, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The chemical structures of VOs determine their therapeutic activities [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The chemical composition and the aroma of VOs may be different due to growing condition (climate, type of soil and composition, altitude), plant age, geo-climatic location, and environmental conditions of collection time and site [
