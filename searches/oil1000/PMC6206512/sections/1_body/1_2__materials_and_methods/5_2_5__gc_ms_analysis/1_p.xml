<p class="p">The chemical composition of the three samples of
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs was separated and quantified using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS. The method used was described by Mohammad Al-Hamwi

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] with some modifications. GC was equipped with column Rtx-5ms (0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m thickness, and 30 m length). A carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature of the injector was 220°C. The temperature of the oven was programmed from 50°C (1min hold) at 5°C/min to 130°C and then at 10°C/min to 250°C and kept constant for 15 min. The temperature transfer line was 290°C. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization method, with detector volts of 1.7 KV, was utilized. A scan speed 1000 amu/sec and scan rate of 0.5 s were used, covering a mass range from 38 to 450 M/Z [
