 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> plant were extracted by microwave-ultrasonic method which was examined by Jaradat
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>, 2016 by which the suspension of plant fractures was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The apparatus consisted of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor. Approximately 100 g of the fractioned dried aerial parts of each plant sample was placed in a one litter round-bottom flask, about 300 mL deionized water was added, and the flask was placed in the apparatus connected with Clevenger apparatus placed in the same apparatus. The power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was fixed at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was fixed at 50 W and the frequency of 40 kHz at its maximum power. The extraction process was prolonged for 10 min at 100°C. This was repeated three times for each plant sample. The resulting VOs were collected into a separate clean, well closed small glass bottle, chemically dried over calcium chloride, and stored in the refrigerator at 2-8°C until use [
