 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> assay of alpha amylase inhibitory activities by using starch as a substrate and Acarbose as a positive control was conducted on
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs of the three samples. Our findings revealed that the three samples of VOs showed different degree of inhibition. The highest potency and efficacy of the antiamylase activity of the VOs were reported in the sample collected from Nablus (north), where an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 3.31 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL was estimated with antiamylase inhibition of 64.34%. The VOs samples from Ramallah and Hebron showed little amylase inhibition activity, while Acarbose showed potency at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 21.38 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and I% effect of 91.39%. The results of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values and the antiamylase activity of the three samples and Acarbose are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The three VOs samples showed higher potency in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-amylase inhibition compared to Acarbose. There were significant differences in antiamylase potency and efficacy of VOs compared to Acarbose and compared to each other (
