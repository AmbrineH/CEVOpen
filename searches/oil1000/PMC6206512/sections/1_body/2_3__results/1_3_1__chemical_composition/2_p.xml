<p class="p">The chemical analysis conducted using GC-MS characterized the VOs with seven components classified into oxygenated ingredients mainly ketones and nonoxygenated ingredients mainly hydrocarbons in all three samples with different proportions (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The most abundant components in all three samples were pulegone and isomenthone. The total identified components in the three samples were almost consistent in which 90.48, 94.44, and 93.55% of the constituents were identified in Nablus, Ramallah, and Hebron districts, respectively. Detailed results are represented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Other five common compounds identified in all three samples with total percentage less than 2% were D-Limonene,
