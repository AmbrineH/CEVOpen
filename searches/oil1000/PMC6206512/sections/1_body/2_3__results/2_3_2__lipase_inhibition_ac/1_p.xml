<p class="p">The hydrolysis of
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate to
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-nitrophenol was used to measure the influence of
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs of three samples on pancreatic lipase enzyme. The assay was detected by comparing to Orlistat lipase inhibitory agent; the three VOs samples showed varied antilipase activity while Nablus VO sample showed the highest potency with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 39.81 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL but with a maximum inhibition % of 65.40%. However, Orlistat owned potency at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 43.64 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL with antilipase inhibition of 99.13%. The results of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values and the antilipase activity of the three samples and Orlistat are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Comparative statistical analysis of the findings of the three samples of VOs showed that there were significant differences in antilipase potency and efficacy of VOs compared to Orlistat (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In addition, there were significant differences in antilipase potency and efficacy of VOs compared to each other (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
