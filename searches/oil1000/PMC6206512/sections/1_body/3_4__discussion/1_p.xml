<p class="p">The qualitative and quantitative differences in the chemical composition of VOs might be attributed to several factors such as geographical factors (location), climatic effects of the plants, harvest season, nature of the soil, age of the plant parts (young or adult), and time of collection. In addition, the effect of the environment on the secondary metabolic profile of

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Pinene, and D-Limonene. The middle region represented by Ramallah city owned the highest percent in Pulegone, and the south region represented by Hebron city showed the highest percent in 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Myrcene, Isocaryophyllene, and Isomenthone and in total nonoxygenated constituents. These cities are calcified into different biogeographical zones in West Bank in Palestine, such as the central highlands, and the eastern slope which has influence on climate, elevation, the average rainfall, and temperature that affect the rate of biochemical reaction and the weathering process of soil.
