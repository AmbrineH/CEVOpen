<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis identified seven compounds listed in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Studies were conducted previously on
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa serpyllifolia </italic>VOs. 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 4</xref> summarizes different relevant literature with the most important finding. In Palestine Shehab
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>. (2012) reported that pulegone, neo-Menthol, and Isomenthone were the dominant compounds [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], while in Lebanon Pulegone and D-limonene were the prevalent components (Al-Hamawi
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>., 2011) [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and for that growing in Turkey piperitenone, pulegone, and Isomenthone were the most abundant components (Gulluce
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>., 2004) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Isa Telci1 and Mustafa Ceylan (2007) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that the VOs of subspecies of
 <italic class="italic"> Micromeria fruticosa </italic>belong to different chemotypes, (a) pulegone, linalool, and
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-menthone and (b) piperitenone and linalool type, and revealed that pulegone was the most prominent compound in
 <italic class="italic"> Micromeria </italic>species mainly in
 <italic class="italic"> M fruticosa</italic>. In the current study Isocaryophyllene was lower than that identified in VO sample of Palestine (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The rest of the components in recent study such as D-limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene were presented in higher levels than that of the samples of the Palestinian sample and of the Turkey sample. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Myrcene was not identified in the Turkey sample [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Pulegone, limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene were also being identified in
 <italic class="italic"> M</italic>.
 <italic class="italic"> barbata</italic> growing in Lebanon but in different proportions [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The differences in the total percentages of yields, identified components, and chemical compounds may be explained by the variations in environmental conditions including location, climate, and seasonal and geographical factors [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]: the part of the plant studied and the growing period of leaves; the younger leaves were investigated to be rich mainly in pulegone accounting for 70% of the VOs [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]; it accounted for 29.19% of VOs in the flowering stage [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and 58.5% before flowering period.
