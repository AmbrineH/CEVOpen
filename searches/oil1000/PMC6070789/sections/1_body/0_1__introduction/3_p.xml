<p class="p">Microemulsion has generated considerable interest over the years as potential drug delivery systems [

 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. One of the most important applications of MEs is to incorporate lipophilic active ingredients into aqueous-based formulations [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Moreover, MEs can easily be fabricated from active ingredients using simple processing operations, such as mixing and shearing. Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable systems that typically consist of oil, surfactant (sometimes co-surfactant/co-solvent), and water [

 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, there are limited approaches for using orange oil ME to enhance antibacterial activity in thin film for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, the focus of our current study was established to develop orange oil in an ME system, and then incorporate it into pectin thin film and investigate the effect of film formulation loaded with orange oil ME on film morphology and mechanical property, limonene loading content, as well as antibacterial activity.
