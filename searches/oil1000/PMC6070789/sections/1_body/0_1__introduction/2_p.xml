<p class="p">Nowadays, hydrocolloid bandages, which are flexible bandages made of a water-attracting material attached to a thin plastic or natural film, has become more popular, particularly for acne. The thin plastic film is usually made from polyurethane, whereas the natural ones are usually made of carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, and pectin, which are the polymers that have lots of water-binding groups in their chemical structure. Natural polymer like pectin is an interesting candidate for thin film dosage form, because pectin is comparatively cheap, abundant, non-irritating, and non-toxic [

 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, which are common skin infection microorganisms, but its application has been associated with problems such as lack of solubility in hydrophilic pectin solution, volatility during film formation processing resulting in low limonene loading content, and failure to inhibit any of the tested strains. Therefore, finding methods to increase the solubility and biological activity focusing on the antibacterial activity of orange oil in hydrophilic film formulation is very important, being a turning point in the use of aromatic compounds, especially essential oils in film dosage form. In this regard, emulsion technology, especially the microemulsion (ME) technique, seems to be one of the most promising processes to solve these problems.
