 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu/mL was used and cultivated on MHA plates. The orange oil ME-loaded pectin thin films (4 mm diameter) were put on the MHA plates. Five serial concentrations of orange oil (0.125 to 150 mg/mL) were prepared. Then, they were sterilized using 0.2 μm membrane filtration method, dropped on sterile discs, and put on the plate in order to determine MIC. Ampicillin was used as a positive control. One microliter of Tween 80 and propylene glycol (which was equivalent to the amount in ME-loaded film) were also investigated for their antibacterial activity. After that, the MHA plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and the diameter of the clear zone was measured using a Vernier caliper. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
