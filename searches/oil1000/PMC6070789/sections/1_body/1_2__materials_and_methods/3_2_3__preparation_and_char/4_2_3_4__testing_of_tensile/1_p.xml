<p class="p">The dried film was cut into a rectangular shape (2 cm × 7 cm). The tensile properties of the films were tested using a texture analyzer TA.XT Plus (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK). The film sample was clamped between two grips and the initial gauge length was set at 5 cm. The film was pulled using a crosshead speed of 1 mm/s and the load cell was set at 100 N. At the point of breaking, force (N) and elongation (mm) were recorded. Only films that broke at the center of the strip were used for data analysis. Each experiment was repeated six times. The tensile properties of the films were characterized by the tensile strength, percent elongation, and Young’s modulus [
