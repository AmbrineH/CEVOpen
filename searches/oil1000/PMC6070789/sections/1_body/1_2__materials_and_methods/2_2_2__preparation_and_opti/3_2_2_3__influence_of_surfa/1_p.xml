<p class="p">The selected surfactant and co-surfactant (S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>) were blended at the weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 1:3, and 3:1. Different combinations in different weight ratios of oil and S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub>, 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, 1:9 and 0:10, were taken. Aqueous titration method was employed for the construction of the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams. Subsequently, the mixtures were evaluated visually and the ME phase was identified as the region in the phase diagram where clear, easily flowable, and transparent formulations were obtained.
