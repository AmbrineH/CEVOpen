Fifty mg of surfactant was added to 50 mg of orange oil. This isotropic mixture, 100 mg, was diluted with distilled water (25 times) to yield a fine emulsion. The emulsion were allowed to stand for 2 h to note for any change in turbidity, and its transmittance was assessed at 650 nm by UV spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) using distilled water as blank [
