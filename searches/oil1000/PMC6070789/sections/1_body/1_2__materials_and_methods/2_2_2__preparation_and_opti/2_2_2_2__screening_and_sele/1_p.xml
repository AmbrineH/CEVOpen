<p class="p">The selection of co-surfactants was done on the basis of ME region. Tween 40 or 80 was mixed with three types of co-surfactants, namely, glycerin, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol. S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio (1:1) was kept constant. The phase diagrams of ternary systems (oil, surfactant, and aqueous phases) were constructed using aqueous titration or spontaneous emulsification method [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Ten combinations in different weight ratios of orange oil and S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> (10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, 1:9, and 0:10) were prepared in glass vials at room temperature. Each ratio of S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and oil phase was then titrated drop-by-drop continuously with water using micropipette by vortex mixing till it turned turbid. The phase behavior of each ternary system during titration was observed minutely. The percentage composition of the component in each ternary system was determined and the observed results were plotted on triangular co-ordinates to construct the phase diagrams.
