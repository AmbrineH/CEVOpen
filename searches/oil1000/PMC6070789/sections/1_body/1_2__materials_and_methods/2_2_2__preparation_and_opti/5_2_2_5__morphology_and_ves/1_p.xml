<p class="p">A drop of ME was applied on a 300-mesh formvar carbon-coated copper grid (FCF400-Cu-50, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, UK) on paraffin, and the sample was allowed to adhere on the formvar for 10 min. The remaining ME was removed and a drop of 2% aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate was applied for 5 min. The remaining solution was then removed. The sample was air dried and examined with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2200FS JEOL, JEOL Ltd., Peabody, MA, USA). The morphology of the particle was observed. The particle sizes of orange oil MEs were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Zetasizer 300HSA (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, WR14 1XZ, UK), based on photon correlation spectroscopy. Analysis (
