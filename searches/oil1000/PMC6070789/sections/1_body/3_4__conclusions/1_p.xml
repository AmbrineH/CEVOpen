<p class="p">In summary, orange oil ME and pectin thin films loaded with orange oil ME were prepared and characterized. Tween 80 as the surfactant and propylene glycol as the co-surfactant at 1:1 ratio were selected to prepare orange oil ME. Three optimized orange oil ME formulations possessed a spherical shape with a droplet size of about 70 nm. Orange oil film (control) showed a loose structure with micropores inside film’s matrix because orange oil evaporated during the drying process. Interestingly, films loaded with orange oil ME exhibited a dense matrix with negligible micropores together with high limonene loading content. Furthermore, the addition of orange oil ME into film improved film flexibility with higher percent elongation and lower Young’s modulus values than the control film. FME 30 film showed higher antimicrobial activity against
