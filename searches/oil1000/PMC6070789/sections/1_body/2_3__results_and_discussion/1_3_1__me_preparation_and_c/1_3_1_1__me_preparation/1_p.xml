<p class="p">The solubilization capacity of surfactants was studied by aliquot of orange oil to aqueous solution of each surfactant until the solution became cloudy. The same maximum volume of orange oil solubilized in Tween 20, 40, and 80 aqueous solutions was found at 3 mL. The emulsification ability of the surfactant in terms of percent transmittance was Tween 40 (93.93%)~Tween 80 (92.93%) &gt; Tween 20 (76.73%). In general, the lipophilic chains of surfactant should be short or at least contain a fluidizing group such as double bonds in order to allow oil uptake [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] such as Tween 80, which contains a double bond in its lipophilic chain. However, in this present study, there was no significant difference between percent transmittance of Tween 40 and 80. Therefore, they were selected as surfactants for further co-surfactant screening. The emulsification capability of co-surfactants was determined by ME region in the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams. These were compared at a fixed S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> (1:1). The orange oil ME regions were observed only when propylene glycol was used as a co-surfactant in both Tween 40 and 80 containing systems (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The larger ME area in case of propylene glycol as a co-surfactant was in the Tween 80 system (

Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using orange oil, Tween 80 as surfactant and propylene glycol as co-surfactant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). A large ME area was obtained toward the surfactant: co-surfactant at 1:1 ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c). When the co-surfactant concentration was doubled or tripled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d,e), the total area of ME decreased compared to 1:1 S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio. Higher concentration of co-surfactant appeared to have a destabilizing effect on the formation of ME resulting in the reduction of ME area [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition, when surfactant concentration of S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> was increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,b), no ME area was observed. It might be due to insufficient co-surfactant concentration, required to reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Generally, surfactant helps in the reduction of the interfacial tension by forming a film at the oil-water interface resulting in the spontaneous formation of ME, while the presence of co-surfactants decreases the bending stress of the interface and allows the oil-water interfacial film sufficient flexibility to take up different curvatures required to form ME over a wide range of compositions [

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. This result is similar to the result in an earlier study, where the S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio of 1:1 possesses the maximum ME area [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Therefore, Tween 80 as the surfactant and propylene glycol as the co-surfactant at 1:1 ratio were selected to prepare orange oil ME in this study. After that, three ME formulations including ME 20, ME 25, and ME 30 were prepared for further experiments (
