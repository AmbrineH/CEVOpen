<p class="p">The characterization of ME was carried out on the basis of percentage transmittance, droplet size, and polydispersity index (PdI), and the results are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Transmission electron microscopy is one of several techniques used to measure the size of ME droplets. In this study, all the optimized orange oil MEs possessed a spherical shape with a size ranging from 50 nm to 100 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). From DLS measurements, the droplet sizes of ME 20, 25, 30 were 73.42 ± 1.60, 75.17 ± 7.27, and 77.63 ± 0.57 nm, respectively. There was no significant difference (

The PdI values of all ME formulations were rather high, indicating non-uniformity of droplet size within each formulation. This may be due to low energy of ME production with the stirring method. In order to produce ME with a high uniformity and proper size of droplets in the dispersed phase, high-pressure homogenizers, high-shear mixers, ultrasonic devices, and membrane techniques are used [
