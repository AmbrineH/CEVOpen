 <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Control film, which was the film containing orange oil instead of orange oil ME, failed to inhibit any of the tested strains. Whereas films with incorporated orange oil ME showed the inhibition zones against both bacteria. This might be due to orange oil in control film not being able to release from the film. All orange oil ME-loaded films exhibited an inhibitory clear zone against the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>, which was FME 30 (16.10 mm)~FME 25 (15.18 mm) &gt; FME 20 (13.64 mm). Only FME 30 film, however, showed an inhibitory clear zone (8.32 mm) against the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. The small size of essential oil droplets in microemulsion systems ensures a close and wide contact to the surface of the bacteria cell walls and may increase the amount of the essential oil penetrated into the cell [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Weiss et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] confirmed that the penetration of antimicrobial compounds in the bacterial cell is higher with reduction in the oil droplet size. Subsequently, the greater amount of orange oil released from microemulsion may increase the bioavailability of the essential oil, and therefore, improve its antibacterial effect. In addition, the thinner film (i.e., FME 30) tended to present more antibacterial activity than thicker ones (i.e., FME 20 and 25). As the differences in droplet size between the ME formulations were not significant, the effect of antibacterial activity of orange oil ME-loaded film in this study is associated with film porosity, film thickness, and the relative amount of the active ingredient. Since each ME-loaded film had identical 3% 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic> of orange oil in the film-forming solution. A thinner film resulted in a greater amount of the active compound to migrate from the film.
