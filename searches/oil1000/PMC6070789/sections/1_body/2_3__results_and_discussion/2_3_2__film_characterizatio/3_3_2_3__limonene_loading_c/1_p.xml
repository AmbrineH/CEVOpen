<p class="p">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the orange oil was comprised of 19 known compounds, and the major compound of this orange oil was limonene (84.57%). Therefore, limonene was used as the marker for loading content study. The limonene loading content of orange oil ME-loaded films is shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. All orange oil ME-loaded films exhibited significantly higher limonene loading contents (83â€“85%) than control film (60.75%). This result is consistent with a morphological study of films. The texture of the orange oil incorporated film turned out to play an important role because micropores indicated the evaporation of orange oil from the polymer matrix, as shown in the loading content results. Films with a fewer and smaller-sized micropores can encapsulate more content of orange oil. On the other hand, films with a larger amount and larger size of micropores show the lowest orange oil content. Moreover, the increase in loading orange oil content could be attributed to enhanced solubility of orange oil in ME. Hence, the increased loading capacity of films to contain more orange oil has been accomplished in this present study.
