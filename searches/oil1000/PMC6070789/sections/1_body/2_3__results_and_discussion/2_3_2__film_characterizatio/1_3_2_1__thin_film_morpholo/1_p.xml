<p class="p">All orange oil and orange oil ME-loaded films were slightly yellowish-translucent with orange flavor. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the large-size micropores inside the film’s matrix were found when orange oil was incorporated. These micropores occurred when 3% orange oil evaporated from the polymer matrix during the drying process. Our results are consistent with another study which loaded oregano essential oil in quince seed film and also showed a loose structure with micropores inside the film’s matrix [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This result was also similar to the findings in a previous study by Ferreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-08-00545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] who found that film structure discontinuities were induced by incorporation of wax or oil into the polysaccharide matrix. Interestingly, the current study found that the micropores were reduced by loading orange oil ME into pectin thin film. FME 20, 25, and 30 films showed smooth surfaces and dense film matrices with fewer micropores (
