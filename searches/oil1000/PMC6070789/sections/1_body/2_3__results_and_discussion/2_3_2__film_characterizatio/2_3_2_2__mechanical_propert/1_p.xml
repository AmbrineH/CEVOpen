<p class="p">The effect of ME loading on the mechanical properties of film containing orange oil ME is of interest. The tensile strength, percent elongation, and Young’s modulus values of orange oil ME-loaded films are shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00545-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. There was no statistically significant difference of tensile strength, percent elongation, and Young’s modulus values among FME 20, 25, and 30 films. Tensile strength and Young’s modulus of orange oil ME-loaded films significantly decreased, while percent elongation significantly increased compared with the control film. Essential oils have been widely reported to weaken the intermolecular interactions between polymeric chains, resulting in less rigid and more extensible and flexible films [
