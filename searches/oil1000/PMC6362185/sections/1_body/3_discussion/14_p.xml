 <italic class="italic">Jatropha curcas</italic> plant against some selected microorganisms, the extracts, and latex of 
 <italic class="italic">Jatropha curcas</italic> displayed potent antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhea, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus,</italic> giving minimum inhibitory concentration as low as 0.5Â mL. The results confirmed the potency of this plant in treating human infections including sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, it is worthwhile to note that the plant extracts and exudates in the formulated toothpastes showed pronounced inhibitory activities against cariogenic organisms than the commonly used fluoridated tooth pastes. This implies that bioactive constituents of the plant extracts and latex could be useful raw material in producing toothpaste that may, which will reduce the occurrence of microbial pathogens associated with dental diseases.
