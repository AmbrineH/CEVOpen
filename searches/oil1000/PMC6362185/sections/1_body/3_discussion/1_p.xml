<p id="Par32" class="p">The importance of bioactive compounds like alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids and some other secondary metabolites have been reported by Kala et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2010</xref>). The presence of these active ingredients would be an added advantage to the formulated toothpastes. Ihemeje et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2013</xref>); and Elekwa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2011</xref>) have reported the detection of observed phytochemical compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">D. tripetala</italic> (pepper fruit) seed, which are the basis for its medicinal prowess. The presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, total phenols, saponins among other phytochemicals has been attributed to antifungal, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory and antidiabetes of its seed (Reihemann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">1999</xref>; Sparg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2004</xref>). Phytochemical compounds such as phenolics, alkaloids, and flavonoids were detected in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (clove) buds. In this study, the identified bioactive ingredients are valuable drug components that could be used as antimicrobial and analgesic. Hence, clove is a good pharmaceutical ingredient (Amin et al.
