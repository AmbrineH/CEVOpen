<p id="Par42" class="p">Essential oils, which are known to be mixture of volatile lipophilic (fat loving, i.e., soluble in fat) and fatty acid present in those extracts, might pass through the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, disrupting the structural arrangement of different polysaccharides, fatty acids and phospholipids layers and this may affect others cellular structure leading to the death of the bacterial (Carson et al.

The destruction of the cell wall membrane of bacterial by the essential oil and the fatty acid could make the organism vulnerable to other phytochemicals such as flavonoids, saponins, tannins and alkaloid which been reported as antibacterial agents. According to Aliyu et al. (
