 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (Hema et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2012</xref>). The low quantity of essential oils in the two plant extracts could be due to the method of extraction but essential oils are mostly extracted when steam distillation method is adopted. Also, the process of concentrating the extracts through exposure to air could have reduced some of the extracted essential oils. All these factors could have lowered the number of essential oils detected by GC/MS analysis.
