<p id="Par34" class="p">The pH values recorded for the formulated toothpaste indicated that all have different pH values. Most of the formulated toothpastes and two of the commercial toothpastes (Com B and C) are in alkaline state pH region but Com A is in weak acidic pH region. The presence of tannin, alkaloid, flavonoids, and phenols in those extracts as indicated by the qualitative analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), which could have influenced the pH of the herbal pastes. Most of these phytochemicals contain a hydroxyl group in their chemical structures thus, causing the paste to be alkalinity in nature. The pH result obtained in this research work was in agreement with those reported by Oyewale (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2005</xref>). The researcher analyzed 20 different types of commercial toothpaste and revealed varying pH values, about 60% have neutral pH, 35% have acidic pH (5–5.8) and only one has alkaline pH of 8.26. The finding of Oyewale (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2011</xref>) who reported pH of some commercial toothpastes as 7.87 for G1. Sorriso Dentes Brancos (Conventional toothpaste), 9.12 for G2. Close-UP Whitening (Whitening toothpaste) and 10.09 for G3. Sensodyne Branqueador (Whitening toothpaste). Also, antibacterial herbal toothpaste prepared using
