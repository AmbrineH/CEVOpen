<p id="Par38" class="p">The result of the antimicrobial activities of the formulated toothpastes, commercial toothpastes, and the controls revealed that all have different inhibitory actions against the tested oral pathogen. The difference observed could be an indication of the biological strength of the phytochemicals contained in each of the plant extract used for the toothpaste formulation. This is evident in the none-bioactivity character of the paste formulated without any active ingredient (negative control) towards any of the microbes. It could be inferred that the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and phenols apart from other bioactive components detected by GC/MS in those plant materials could enhance their bioactivities against the pathogens. Alkaloids as a secondary metabolite have been used to develop various human drugs and have potential toxicity against foreign organism cell (Kam and Liew

These bioactive compounds; phenols, have several hydroxyl groups, flavonoids whose ring structure consists of different phenolic hydroxyl groups and saponin with the characteristic foaming/bitter taste properties and consists of polycyclic aglycones attached to one or more sugar side chains, have been proved to possess various biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, analgesic, anti-allergic, cytostatic and antioxidant (Hodek et al.
