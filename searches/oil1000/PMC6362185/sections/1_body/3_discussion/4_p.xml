<p id="Par35" class="p">Greater bioactivity was recorded for the mixture of three or two extracts, which is could be the results of good synergy between the entire extracts. The inhibitory activity of Jat paste could be associated with the presence of bioactive phytochemicals in its latex. The 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> latex has been used to treat bacterial and fungal mouth infection due to the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, glycosides, phenols, and flavonoids (Suhaili et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sharma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2016</xref>). Hence, 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> has been a traditional toothbrush in some places and used for various trado-medicines. Also, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> latex revealed the presence of dotriacontane, pentatriacontane, hexatriacontane, 1,2-benzene dicarboxylic acid and Î²-sitosterol (Mahmoodi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2012</xref>). The secondary metabolites of 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> have been reported to hinder the growth of various bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa E. coli, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Shigella flexneri</italic> (Igbinosa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2009</xref>; Sharma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2016</xref>). Though, it was noticed from the phytochemical screening of the two plant materials used in this study and literature search on 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> that secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, saponins, tannins, saponins and flavonoids present in these plant. These phytochemicals have been reported to possess good antibacterial activity against several oral caries microbes (Hassan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2004</xref>). Notwithstanding, the bioactive compounds detected by the GC/MS seems to have a synergetic role with those phytochemicals contributing to their antimicrobial prowess. Many of these compounds have been reported to be good antimicrobial agents (Holopainen
