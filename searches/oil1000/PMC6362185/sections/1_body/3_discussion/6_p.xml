<p id="Par37" class="p">Findings of Mostafa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2018</xref>) revealed that ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> showed potential antimicrobial activity against the highly susceptible strains of food borne bacteria namely; 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> with MIC ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL. In the studies of Okoh et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2016</xref>), the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Dennettia tripetala</italic> displayed pronounced inhibitory activity against pathogenic microorganisms with lower MIC of 0.05–0.2 mg/mL. The variability in MIC may be as result of extraction method, type or size of indictor microorganisms and quantity of phytochemicals in the plant extracts.
