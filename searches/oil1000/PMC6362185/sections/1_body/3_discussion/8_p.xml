<p id="Par39" class="p">The presences of alkyl aryl alcohols (AAAs) fragrance such as benzyl alcohol, a-methylbenzyl alcohol, and phenethyl alcohol etc., have been reported to occur in plants (Belsito et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">1988</xref>), phyto-compounds with phenolic groups such as carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol possess antimicrobial activity against microbes due to the presence of alkyl substitution on the phenolic nucleus. It has been reported that these group of compounds could act as bactericidal or bacteriostatic agent. Thus the presence of 2-methylbenzyl alcohol and eugenol in the extracts of

This has been reported to have good antibacterial and antifungal activities with skin penetration effect, which could make it dissolve the cell wall of the pathogenic microorganisms (Byron and Johnson
