<p id="Par30" class="p">The antimicrobial activities of the formulated pastes against test microorganisms are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The formulated toothpastes labeled as DenSyzJat, DenSyz and SyzJat exhibited antimicrobial property against all the tested microorganisms with inhibition zones ranged from 10.7 to 18.3 mm, 7.3 to 14.6 mm and 8.33 to 14.4 mm respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The following bacteria; 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aeruginosa</italic> were not susceptible to DenJat at 20 mg/mL. Formulated toothpaste with only 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> extract (Syz) seems to be much more active among the three bioactive materials used for the formulation, having recorded zone of inhibition of 14.0 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic> when compared (P &lt; 0.05) to Jat and Den paste with inhibition zones of 10.0 mm and 8.0 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>. Com C, commercially produced toothpaste without any herb product has no inhibition against tested microorganisms.
