 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> latex was obtained into a sterile amber bottle as liquid exudate from the cut stalk of leaves and young stem of 
 <italic class="italic">J. curcas</italic> plants grown in Ilara-mokin, Ondo State. The dried seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">D. tripetala</italic> (pepper fruit) were obtained from Relief Market, Oyingbo, Lagos State, while 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (clove) buds were bought from King’s Market, Akure, Ondo State. The samples were sorted and stored in air tight glass bottles to protect them from contaminants. All plant samples were authenticated at the Department of Crop, Soil and Pest Management, The Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria. The dried seeds were ground to powder. Powdered samples were sieved to a particle size of 212–249 µm and used for the analysis. The entire chemicals used in this research are analytical grade obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
