Briefly, the indicator microorganisms were sub cultured into nutrient broth and malt extract broth. The test tubes containing bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, while tube with yeast was incubated at 28 °C for 48 h. Thereafter, inoculum size was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. A sterile cotton swab was aseptically used to transfer organism on the dried surface of sterile Mueller Hinton Agar plate. Sterile cork borer was used to make well of 7 mm.
