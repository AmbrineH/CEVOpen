<p id="Par22" class="p">The GC/MS analysis of the plant extracts was carried out at the Central Laboratory, the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State in Nigeria. The isolated sample was analyzed on a wall coated gas chromatograph interfaced to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Agilent 7890A, US) instrument employing the following conditions: wall coated capillary column (BP-1; 50 m × 0.22 mm × 0.25 μm), which was programmed as follows: 60 °C to 70 °C at 2 k/min ending with a 20 min at 220 °C to 230 °C. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, split mode, with a ratio of 1:5 and injection volume of 1 μL in a CH
