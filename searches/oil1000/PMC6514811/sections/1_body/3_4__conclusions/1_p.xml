<p class="p">In summary, we have developed a facile, catalyst-free and mostly solvent-free MW-assisted method for the synthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophosphonates and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophosphine oxides, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">N,N</italic>-bis(diarylphosphinoylmethyl)ethanolamines by the three-component reaction of amino alcohols, paraformaldehyde, and dialkyl phosphites or diarylphosphine oxides. This method is a novel approach for the preparation of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophosphine oxides and 
 <italic class="italic">N,N</italic>-bis(diarylphosphinoylmethyl)ethanolamines. Altogether, 21 derivatives were synthesized and fully characterized, and all of them are new compounds. The crystal structure of [(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-benzyl)(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-2-hydroxyethyl)aminomethyl]diphenylphosphine oxide (
 <bold class="bold">11a</bold>) and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-bis(diphenylphosphinoylmethyl)ethanolamine (
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>) was studied by single-crystal XRD analysis.
