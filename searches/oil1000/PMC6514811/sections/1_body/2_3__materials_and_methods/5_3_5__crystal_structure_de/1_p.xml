<p class="p">Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were collected on an Agilent Technologies SuperNova Dual diffractometer using Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The data were processed using CrysAlis Pro [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The structures were solved by ShelXT [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] using intrinsic phasing and refined by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were readily located in difference Fourier maps, and were subsequently treated as riding atoms in geometrically idealized positions with C–H = 0.93 Å (aromatic) or 0.97 Å (methylene), O–H = 0.82 Å, and with
