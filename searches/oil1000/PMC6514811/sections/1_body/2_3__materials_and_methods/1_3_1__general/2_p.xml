<p class="p">HPLC-MS measurements were performed with an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatography system coupled with a 6130 quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI ion source (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Analysis was performed at 40 °C on a Gemini C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The composition of eluent A was 0.1% (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)(HCOO) in water; eluent B was 0.1% (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)(HCOO) and 8% water in acetonitrile. 0–3 min. 5% B, 3–13 min. gradient, 13–20 min. 95% B. The injection volume was 5 µL. The chromatographic profile was registered at 254 nm. The MSD operating parameters were as follows: positive ionization mode, scan spectra from
