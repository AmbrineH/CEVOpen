<p class="p">The Kabachnikâ€“Fields condensation of amino alcohols is a less studied area. The condensation of ethanolamine was investigated with oxo compounds (e.g., paraformaldehyde [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], or acetone [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]) and dialkyl phosphites. A MW-assisted, Al

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. A few special amino alcohols, such as 2-amino-2-methylpropanole [
