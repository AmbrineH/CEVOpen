<p class="p">In this paper, we introduce the synthesis of 2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophosphonates and 2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophoshine oxides by the MW-assisted Kabachnik–Fields condensation of amino alcohols, paraformaldehyde, and &gt;P(O)H reagents, such as dialkyl phosphites, ethyl phenyl-
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphinate, and secondary phosphine oxides. We also aimed at developing a green, catalyst-free and mostly solvent-free synthesis, as well as at the preparation of new derivatives.
