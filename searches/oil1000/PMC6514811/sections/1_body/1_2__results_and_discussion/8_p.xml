<p class="p">In addition to the spectroscopic analysis, we have determined the crystal structure of 
 <bold class="bold">11a</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>∙H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O by single-crystal XRD analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01640-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In the structure of 
 <bold class="bold">11a</bold>, an intramolecular O–H···O=P hydrogen bond is present between the hydroxy group as the donor and the P=O group as the acceptor. Moreover, intermolecular C–H···O=P interactions enable the formation of hydrogen-bonded chains, which are connected into layers via C–H∙∙∙π interactions (

 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>∙H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, an O–H···O hydrogen bond is present between the hydroxy group (donor) and the water hydrate molecule (acceptor). The H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O forms two more O–H···O=P hydrogen bonds with P=O groups of two adjacent molecules, resulting in the formation of wavy layers enhanced by C–H∙∙∙O interactions. These layers are connected into a supramolecular structure via additional C–H∙∙∙O interactions (
