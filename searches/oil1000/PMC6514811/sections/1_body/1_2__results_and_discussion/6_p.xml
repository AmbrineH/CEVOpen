<p class="p">The condensation of ethanolamine with paraformaldehyde and other secondary phosphine oxides was also carried out (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, entries 1–3). Using the optimized conditions (100 °C, 30 min), the reactions were complete in all the cases. Applying diphenylphosphine oxide as the P-component, the corresponding 2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophosphine oxide (

 <bold class="bold">8b</bold> or 
 <bold class="bold">8c</bold>) were isolated in yields of 89% and 95%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, entries 2 and 3). The condensation was also extended for using

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-ethyl-, or
