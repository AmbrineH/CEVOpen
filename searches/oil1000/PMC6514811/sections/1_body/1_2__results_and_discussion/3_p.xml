<p class="p">In the next series of experiments, the condensation of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylethanolamine, paraformaldehyde, and diethyl phosphite was investigated (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Carrying out the reaction at 60 °C for 20 min, the conversion was 85%, and the mixture comprised 96% of the desired 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-hydroxyethyl-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-α-aminophosphonate (
 <bold class="bold">4a</bold>) and 4% of 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphonate 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> formed in the alcoholysis of diethyl phosphite by 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylethanolamine (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, Entry 1). In accordance to our previous experiences [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-ethanolamine was much less active in the alcoholysis than the ethanolamine. Repeating the experiment at 80 °C, the reaction reached a full conversion, and the ratio of products 
 <bold class="bold">4a</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> was 95:5, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, Entry 2). The comparative thermal experiment under similar conditions was less selective, since 81% of the desired product (
 <bold class="bold">4a</bold>) and 19% of compound 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> were present in the mixture (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, Entry 3). At 100 °C for 10 min, the ratio of the by-product (
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>) increased (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, Entry 4). Based on the results obtained, the temperature of 80 °C and the reaction time of 20 min were found to be the optimum conditions (
