<p class="p">Formation of the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-α-aminophosphonate (
 <bold class="bold">4a</bold>) may be explained with the methylation by the paraformaldehyde, which side reaction was also observed in similar Kabachnik–Fields reactions of ethyl octyl phosphite [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] or alkyl phenyl-
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphinates [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-ethylated by-product (
 <bold class="bold">5a</bold>) may have formed in the alkylation of compound 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> by diethyl phosphite, which is also a known side reaction during similar transformations [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The 2-aminoethyl ethyl phosphite (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>), which was present in the highest proportion of 34%, is probably the product of the alcoholysis of diethyl phosphite by ethanolamine [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01640" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>].
