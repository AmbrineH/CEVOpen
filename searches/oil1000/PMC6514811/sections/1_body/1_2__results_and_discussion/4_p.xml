<p class="p">Next, the condensation of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-alkylethanolamines, paraformaldehyde, and dialkyl phosphites or ethyl phenyl-
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphinate was studied under the optimized conditions (80 °C and 20 min). The reactions were complete in all the cases. Using 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylethanolamine, the diethyl (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-2-hydroxyethyl)(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl)aminomethylphosphonate (
 <bold class="bold">4a</bold>) was isolated in a yield of 78% (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, Entry 1). Changing for dibutyl phosphite, the desired product (
 <bold class="bold">4b</bold>) was obtained in a yield of 87% after column chromatography (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, Entry 2). The ethyl phenyl-
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphinate was also tried out as the phosphorus reagent; however, the α-aminophosphinate (
 <bold class="bold">4c</bold>) could be prepared in a slightly lower yield (67%) as compared to the α-aminophosphonates (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, Entry 3). Carrying out the experiments starting from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-ethylethanolamine, the condensations took place similarly (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, Entries 4-6). The diethyl (
 <bold class="bold">5a</bold>) and the dibutyl 2-ethyl-2-hydroxyethyl-α-aminophoshhonate (
 <bold class="bold">5b</bold>) were prepared in yields of 72% and 79%, respectively; while using ethyl phenyl 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-phosphinate as the P-reagent, product 
 <bold class="bold">5c</bold> was isolated in a yield of 64%.
