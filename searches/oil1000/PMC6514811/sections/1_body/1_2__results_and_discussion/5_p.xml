 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In these reactions, some acetonitrile had to be used to overcome the heterogeneity. First, the condensation of ethanolamine, paraformaldehyde, and diphenylphosphine oxide was investigated (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In these experiments, only the desired product (
 <bold class="bold">8a</bold>) was formed, and no by-product was observed. Carrying out the reaction at 80 °C for 20 min, the α-aminophosphine oxide (
 <bold class="bold">8a</bold>) was obtained in a conversion of 58% (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, Entry 1). Prolonging the irradiation to 30 min, a significantly higher conversion (86%) could be reached (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, Entry 2). Any further increase in the reaction time did not cause a significant change in the conversion (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, Entry 3). Performing the three-component reaction at 100 °C, the conversion was already 92% after 20 min; using a reaction time of 30 min, the condensation was complete (
