<p class="p">In the next round, the double Kabachnik–Fields condensation of ethanolamine with an excess of paraformaldehyde and secondary phosphine oxides was studied (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). As the first experiment, the ethanolamine was reacted with two equivalents of the paraformaldehyde and the diphenylphosphine oxide at 100 °C for 1 h (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 1). It was found that the mono α-aminophosphine oxide (
 <bold class="bold">8a</bold>) was the main product (75%), while the desired 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-bis(diphenylphosphinoylmethyl)ethanolamine (
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>) was present in a proportion of only 25%. Increasing the temperature to 120 °C, the ratio of product 
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold> increased to 34% (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 2). Prolonging the reaction time to 1.5 h, the composition did not change significantly (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 3). As the next step, the effect of the molar ratio of starting materials was investigated (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, entries 4–6). By using 2.5 equivalents of the diphenylphosphine oxide, the ratio of the mono (
 <bold class="bold">8a</bold>) and the bis product (
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>) remained almost unchanged (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 4). When both reagents (the paraformaldehyde and the diphenylphosphine oxide) were used in 2.5 equivalents quantity, the proportion of product 
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold> increased significantly (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 5). Further increase in the molar ratios to three equivalents allowed a full transformation toward the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-bis(diphenylphosphinoylmethyl)ethanolamine (
 <bold class="bold">12a</bold>), which was obtained in a yield of 95% after purification (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, Entry 6). The double Kabachnik–Fields reaction was also carried out starting from bis(
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-tolyl)phosphine oxide or bis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphine oxide using the optimized conditions (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01640-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, entries 7 and 8). The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-tolyl-substituted product (
 <bold class="bold">12b</bold>) was synthesized in a yield of 93%, while product 
 <bold class="bold">12c</bold> could be isolated in a yield of 91%.
