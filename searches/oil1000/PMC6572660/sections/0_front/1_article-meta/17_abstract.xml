  <italic class="italic">Background and objectives:</italic> Natural products such as essential oils with antioxidant potential can reduce the level of oxidative stress and prevent the oxidation of biomolecules. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant potential of 
  <italic class="italic">Lantana montevidensis</italic> leaf essential oil (EOLM) in chemical and biological models using 
  <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">Materials and methods:</italic> in addition, the chemical components of the oil were identified and quantified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the percentage compositions were obtained from electronic integration measurements using flame ionization detection (FID). 
  <italic class="italic">Results:</italic> our results demonstrated that EOLM is rich in terpenes with Germacrene-D (31.27%) and β-caryophyllene (28.15%) as the major components. EOLM (0.12–0.48 g/mL) was ineffective in scavenging DPPH radical, and chelating Fe(II), but showed reducing activity at 0.24 g/mL and 0.48 g/mL. In in vivo studies, exposure of 
  <italic class="italic">D. melanogaster</italic> to EOLM (0.12–0.48 g/mL) for 5 h resulted in 10% mortality; no change in oxidative stress parameters such as total thiol, non-protein thiol, and malondialdehyde contents, in comparison to control (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). 
  <italic class="italic">Conclusions:</italic> taken together, our results indicate EOLM may not be toxic at the concentrations tested, and thus may not be suitable for the development of new botanical insecticides, such as fumigants or spray-type control agents against 
  <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.
