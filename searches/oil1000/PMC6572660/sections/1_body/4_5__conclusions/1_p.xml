<p class="p">In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana montevidensis</italic> leaf essential oil was ineffective in scavenging the DPPH radical, but exhibited reducing activity in vitro. Exposure of 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> leaf essential oil (0.12â€“0.48 g/mL) for 5 h did not significantly alter markers of oxidative, as evidenced by there being no change in total thiol, GSH, and MDA contents.
