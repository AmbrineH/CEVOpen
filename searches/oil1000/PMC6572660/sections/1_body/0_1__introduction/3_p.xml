<p class="p">In spite of the fact that numerous studies have reported the insecticidal activity of essential oils against mosquitos and flies, there is a lack of knowledge about the effect of the essential oil from

 <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Many basic biological, physiological, and neurological properties are conserved between mammals and
