<p class="p">Considering the abovementioned information, the objective of this study was to investigate the chemical characterization and antioxidant potential of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> leaf essential oil (EOLM) in vitro, as well as its possible toxic effects using 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model. Particularly, we evaluated the toxic effect of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> on the cell viability (MTT) and on biomarkers of oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation, iron levels, total thiols, and non-protein thiols (NPSH).
