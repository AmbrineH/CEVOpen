<p class="p">In Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> chelating assay, the rate of the reduction in the absorbance of the orange complex formed by the interaction of Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> and ortho-phenanthroline allows estimation of a possible chelator. Surprisingly, the incubation of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> leaf essential oil (0.24 and 0.48 g/mL) with Fe
