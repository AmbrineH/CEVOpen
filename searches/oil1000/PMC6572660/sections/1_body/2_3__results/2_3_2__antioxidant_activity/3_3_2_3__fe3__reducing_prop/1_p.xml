<p class="p">The Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> reducing properties of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicina-55-00194-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. Similar to that observed with Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, the incubation of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> with Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> in the presence of ortho-phenanthroline resulted in a significant increase in the absorbance in a dose-dependent manner (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison to that of Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> alone. However, the absorbance of the complex formed with Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> and ortho-phenanthroline was lower than that obtained with Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> and ortho-phenanthroline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicina-55-00194-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The addition of ascorbic acid to the reaction medium dramatically increased the absorbance of the sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicina-55-00194-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the component(s) of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> may have released Fe(II) in the medium or have reduced Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>.
