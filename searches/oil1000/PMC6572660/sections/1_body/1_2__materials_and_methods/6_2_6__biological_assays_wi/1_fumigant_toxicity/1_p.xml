<p class="p">Different concentrations of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. montevidensis</italic> (EOLM) (0, 0.12, 0.24, and 0.48 g/mL) were prepared by dissolving it in 4% DMSO. The filter paper fragment was treated with 300 μL of different concentrations of EOLM and placed at the bottom of the flask. Then, 50 adult flies (males and females) of 3–5 days were exposed to the oil. The top of the flask was sealed with adhesive foam to prevent evaporation of the essential oil. The control group was exposed to the filter paper soaked with 4% DMSO alone. The flasks were maintained in a light/dark cycle of 12 h, 25 °C ± 1 °C, and 60% of relative humidity. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the number of death flies was counted after 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h.
