<p class="p">Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured to determine lipid peroxidation products as a measure of oxidative stress. Ten flies per group, in triplicate, were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Briefly, the reaction mixture containing 100 μL of the supernatant, 100 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and 100 μL of 0.75% of 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA, prepared in 0.1 M HCl) was incubated at 95 °C for 1 h. After cooling, they were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using 250 μL of the reaction mixture [
