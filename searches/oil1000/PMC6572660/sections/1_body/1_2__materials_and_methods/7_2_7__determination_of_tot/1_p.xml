<p class="p">Twenty flies from each group were homogenized in 1 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a ratio of 1:10 (1 mg of flies for 10 µL), and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. For the determination of total thiols, 50 μL of the obtained supernatant was added to 190 μL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and then 10 μL of 5 mM DTNB (5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature (protected from light), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using microplate reader. Glutathione (GSH) was used as standard, and the results were expressed as ηmol GSH/g of tissue. For the measurement of NPSH level, the obtained supernatant was missed with equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 rpm. The clear supernatant was used for NPSH determination as described for the total thiol. </p>
