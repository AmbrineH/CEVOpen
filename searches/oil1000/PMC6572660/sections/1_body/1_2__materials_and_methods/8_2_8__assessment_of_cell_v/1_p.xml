<p class="p">Cell viability was assessed with MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2′-tetrazolium bromide], according to the method described by Mosman [
 <xref rid="B37-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. A volume of 20 μL of the supernatant from treated and untreated flies was added to 170 μL of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), followed by the addition of 10 μL of 1 mg/mL MTT prepared in ethanol. The reaction medium was incubated for 120 min, and then 150 μL of the mixture was pipetted and added to 50 μL of DMSO. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the readings were carried out at 492 nm and 630 nm, respectively, in an ELISA microplate reader.
