<p class="p">The iron (II) ions content was determined by measuring the intensity of the orange complexe formed with 1,10-phenanhroline and free Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> in the supernatant of control and treated groups with EOLM. The free Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> content was determined using a modified method of Kamdem et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and Klimaczewski et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Briefly, ten microliters (10 μL) of 1,10-Phenanthroline (0.25%) was added to the reaction mixture containing 110 μL of saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 60 μL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 20 μL of the supernatant, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Iron(II) sulfate was used to construct the standard curve. Absorbance was measured after incubation at 492 nm using microplate reader, and the results were expressed in ηmol of Fe (II)/g tissue.
