<p class="p">It is widely recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) induce oxidative stress by causing significant damage to cell structure directly or indirectly, leading to a number of diseases [

 <xref rid="B59-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The major targets of ROS during oxidative stress are thought to be DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. Different reactive species have different degrees of reactivity with the cellular components, and the availability of free iron in the form of Fe
