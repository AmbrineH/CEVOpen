<p class="p">Plant essential oils (EOs) have been tested against a wide range of arthropod pests, with promising results. EOs have been reported to possess high efficacy, multiple mechanisms of action, low toxicity in non-target vertebrates, and the potential to act as reducing agents and stabilizers for the synthesis of nanopesticides [
