<p class="p">Glutathione (GSH) is an essential compound in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis because of its reducing properties [
 <xref rid="B63-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Protein thiol groups are inherently very reactive, and can be oxidized by reactive species. The balance between oxidized and free thiols is important not only for the maintenance of protein and enzymatic functions, but also for cellular redox balance [
 <xref rid="B64-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The results obtained in this study showed that EOLM at all the concentrations tested did not alter the total thiol and NPSH levels and the MDA content of flies homogenates, indicating that EOLM does not cause oxidative stress since the total thiol depletion is associated with increased lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B65-medicina-55-00194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Thus, it is possible to presume that the beneficial effects of EOLM may be attributed at least, in part, to its reducing ability. In spite of the fact exposure of flies to EOLM (0.12â€“0.48 g/mL) did not affect MDA content (an index of lipid peroxidation), there is report showing the potential of
