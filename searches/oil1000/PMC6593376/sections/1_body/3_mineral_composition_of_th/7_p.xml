<p class="p">About 6% of iron in humans are present in certain proteins, which are crucial for respiration and energy metabolism process and implicated in the amalgamation of collagen and certain neurotransmitters (Bashiri, Burstein, Sheiner, &amp; Mazor, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). About quarter of the Fe in humans is deposited as ferritin, located in cells, and circulated in the blood circulation system. Iron deficiency is known as erythropoiesis, and worst Fe deficiency leads to anemia (Abbaspour, Hurrell, &amp; Kelishadi, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The RDA of iron is 1.8 mg in adults, and merely 10%–30% of the Fe in diet is bioavailable (Endrias et al.,

OFSP was reported to be 0.63–15.26 mg/100 g of iron, whereas maize (2.71 mg/100 g), rice (0.8 mg/100 g), wheat (3.19 mg/100 g), potato (0.78 mg/100 g), cassava (0.27 mg/100 g), WFSP (0.61 mg/100 g), and yam (0.54 mg/100 g) reported to be lesser than the OFSP (USDA,
