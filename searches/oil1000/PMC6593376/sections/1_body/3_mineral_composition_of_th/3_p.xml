<p class="p">Calcium plays a major role in muscle function, formation and strengthening of bones, teeth, conducting nerve impulses, blood clotting, and maintaining a normal heartbeat (Zemel, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0246" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Humans in the ages of 18–50 require 1,000 mg of calcium per day as recommended daily allowance (RDA). Individuals younger than 18 years need superior concentration (1,300 mg) of Ca for developing bones and teeth (Wosje &amp; Specker, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0238" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The calcium content of 24.40–45.54 mg/100 g was reported in OFSP, and this variation in the Ca concentration attributed to varietal and agrogeological conditions (Endrias et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0222" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The Ca content in OFSP was reported as superior to common staple cereals, roots, and tubers. Sorghum (28 mg/100 g), maize (7 mg/100 g), rice (28 mg/100 g), wheat (29 mg/100 g), potato (12 mg/100 g), cassava (6 mg/100 g), WFSP (30 mg/100 g), and yam (17 mg/100 g) are reported to have superior concentration of Ca than common staples (USDA, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In all the common roots and tubers, high concentration of the Ca, high amount of OFSP has to consume, or the food rich in Ca (animal‐based food) has to incorporate into the staple diets to achieve RDA of Ca was reported in OFSP.
