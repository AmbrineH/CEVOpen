<p class="p">Central American countries are considered as the center of SP origin, but recent times they are extensively cultivated in the tropical, in the subtropical zone, and in few temperate locations with divergent agroclimatic conditions (Chandrasekara &amp; Josheph Kumar, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The roots of SP plants are primary storage organs and act as sinks to photosynthetic products, and it resulted in the deposition of different micro (phytochemicals)‚Äê and macro (carbohydrates)nutrients (Lemoine et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). SP was reported to have highest dry matter content due to its sink strength (Rukundo, Shimelis, Laing, &amp; Gahakwa, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0182" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and this crop was highly appreciated for the positive agronomic and nutritive characteristics (Abidin, Carey, Mallubhotla, &amp; Sones,
