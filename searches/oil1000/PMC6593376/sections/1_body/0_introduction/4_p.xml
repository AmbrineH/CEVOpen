 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that sweet potato is 3rd vital food crop in seven central and eastern African countries, 4th priority crop in six South African nations, and 8th in four West African countries. SP is a key conventional crop, growing traditionally in limited area for domestic consumption purpose. SP is praised as a “poor man's” crop as it characteristically grown and consumed by meager communities especially by women‐headed families (Githunguri &amp; Migwa,
