<p class="p">Root and tuber crops play a significant role in agriculture and facilitate food security in many developing countries. In the year 2017 worldwide, 494.6 million tons of roots and tubers (including potato) are produced (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). Roots and tubers are part of diet for majority of the global population, with world average per capita consumption of 19.4 kg/year (2013–2015) and projecting to achieve 21.0 kg/year by 2025 (OCED‐FAO, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and also contributing to animal feeds and industrial needs (starch source) (Scott, Rosegrant, &amp; Ringler, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0194" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Among the roots and tubers, SP (
 <italic class="italic">Ipomoea batatas</italic>) is very important after potato on the basis of production and consumption. SP is a dicotyledon associated with Convolvulaceae family and ranks worlds' seventh most important food crop (Ahn et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>); it is a potential energy contributor and considered as fifth essential crop (fresh weight basis) after rice, wheat, maize, and sorghum (Ndolo, Nungo, Kapinga, &amp; Agili, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Currently, SP cultivation was reported in more than 115 nations (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>), and SP was recognized as the secondary staple food and possess significant role in diet of humans in many underdeveloped countries (Van Jaarsveld et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0225" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In contrast to the other staple food crops, Trancoso‐Reyes et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0219" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) defined that SP possess special attributes such as adoptability in wider topography, ability to grow in subsidiary circumstance, good productivity in short durations, and balanced nutritional composition. Sweet potato was reported to have good sensory acceptability due to the eye‐pleasing colors and sweet taste. This high sensory acceptability of some SP varieties was suitable in malnutrition management and facilitating food security in underdeveloped nations (Julianti, Rusmarilin, Ridwansyah, &amp; Yusraini,
