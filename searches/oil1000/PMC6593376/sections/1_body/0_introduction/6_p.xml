<p class="p">Researchers reported the clear role of variety difference in physical properties and chemical compositions of SP; for instance, van Jaarsveld, Marais, Harmse, Nestel, and Rodriguez‐Amaya (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0226" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported that purple‐ and orange‐fleshed cultivars possess higher quantities of ACN and carotenes in comparison with white‐fleshed cultivars.
