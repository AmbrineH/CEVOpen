 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Prolonged storage of OFSP is usually achieved by drying (sun drying), and during the traditional drying (sun drying) techniques, microbial contamination was reported as the major problem due to the high moisture content of the fresh OFSP. Amajor et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that OFSP flours can produce by sun drying and milling of the fresh OFSP roots.

Some of the reported studies on animal or human studies related to the role of OFSP in VAD management are summarized in Table
