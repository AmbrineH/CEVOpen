<p class="p">Vitamin E represents eight isomers of fat‐soluble compounds (α‐, β‐, γ‐,δ‐tocopherol and tocotrienol) metabolized in plants (Bjorneboe, Bjorneboe, &amp; Drevon, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>; Helmut, Wilhelem, &amp; Alfred, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>; Netscher, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0151" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), available in various concentrations in fat‐rich foods (edible oils and seeds) (Reboul et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Yanishlieva &amp; Marinova, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0243" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). α‐Tocopherol (Pryor, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0173" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) is appreciated for cytoprotective nature, anti‐inflammatory, and liver protection (Galli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and also considered as potential AA and immune system booster, to fight against viruses and pathogenic bacteria (Traber &amp; Atkinson, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0218" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Tocopherol also helps to synthesize new red blood cells and widens blood vessels (Evelyne et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), potentially lowering risk of developing blood clots (Krem &amp; Cera, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Vit. E RDA is between 3,000 and 15,000 µg in different countries, and the variation reported depends on the age (Jiang, Christen, Mark, &amp; Bruce, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Limited studies were reported on the concentration of the α‐tocopherol (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) in OFSP, and the range of 2.61–8.48 (µg/g fw) was reported by Oki et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Consumption of 100–200 gm of OFSP requires achieving around 20%–25% RDA of Vit. E. However, the OFSP is not considered as the best source of the α‐tocopherol because less concentration of fats was reported in OFSP. So, supplementation of Vit. E‐rich foods such as oilseeds is very important for the consumers of OFSP as second staple.
