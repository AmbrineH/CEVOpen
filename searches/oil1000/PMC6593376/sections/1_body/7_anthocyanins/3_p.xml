<p class="p">Anthocyanin consumption in worldwide reported in high variation depends on the diet composition and eating patterns of the individuals. Studies identified the deviations in the anthocyanin intake in different countries such as the United States (12.5 mg/day) (Wu et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0211" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) reported 2.9 (µCyE/g) anthocyanins in OFSP (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The variation in the concentrations reported in OFSP by different researchers may be due to the agrogeological conditions. However, the OFSP is not the good source of the anthocyanin compared to the other fruits and vegetables.
