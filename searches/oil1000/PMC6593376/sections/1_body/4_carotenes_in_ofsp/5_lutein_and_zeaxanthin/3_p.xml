<p class="p">Limited reports were available on the concentration of the lutein and zeaxanthin in OFSP. Brown, Edwards, Yang, and Dean (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) reported the 120–148 (µg/g fw) and 242–2,055 (µg/g fw) of lutein and zeaxanthin respectively, whereas Donado‐Pestana et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) reported 1–4 (µg/g db) and 1–2 (µg/g db) of lutein and zeaxanthin in OFSP, respectively. The orange color of the OFSP is devoted to the presence of this lutein and zeaxanthins. The differences in the reported concentrations of the two reports may be attributed to the variety‐related issues. Researchers reported the intensity variations of orange color among the cultivars in different countries, and this was directly linked to the concentration of lutein + zeaxanthin. However, the lutein + zeaxanthin by Brown et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) reported high concentration in OFSP, which is comparable with the other leafy vegetables. Vegetables such as baby carrots, peaches, corn, papaya, and oranges possess &lt;1 mg of lutein + zeaxanthin in 100 g of fresh weight (Holden et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0248" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) reported the limited quantity of lutein esters in cereals; in contrast, xanthophylls are rich in fruits and vegetables such as collards, capsicum, yellow corn, and spinach (Sajilata, Singhal, &amp; Kamat, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0185" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Consumption of OFSP also provides the required xanthophylls to the consumers. Recent studies reported that these two xanthophylls possess very important role in different disease management such as skin damages, reduce the chance of pancreatic cancer, reducing the CHD, and increase in overall antioxidant activity (Gordon,
