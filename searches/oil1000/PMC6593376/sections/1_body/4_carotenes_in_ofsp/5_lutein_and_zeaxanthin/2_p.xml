<p class="p">Lutein (β,ε‐carotene‐3′,‐diol) is naturally present with zeaxanthin (β, β‐carotene‐3,3′‐diol) as stereoisomer and available in large quantities in leafy vegetables (Perry, Rasmussen, &amp; Johnson, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0167" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Lutein and zeaxanthin are structured with 40 carbon atoms and named as tetraterpenoids, and they are synthesized only in plant kingdom (Shegokar &amp; Mitri, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0196" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Lutein and zeaxanthin belong to xanthophyll family and do not possess any VA activity (Abdel‐Aal, Akhtar, Zaheer, &amp; Ali, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The yellow colors of these two xanthophylls are connected to their structural properties and responsible for orange to yellow color of different vegetables and animal products (egg yolk, animal fat). The animal retina is exceptional and contains a yellow colored region positioned in its ocular center known as “macula lutea” (Kalariya, Ramana, &amp; vanKuijk, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This yellow color attributed to the accumulation of lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso‐zeaxanthin, and they are very important in eye well‐being (Kijlstra, Tian, Kelly, &amp; Berendschot, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Nwachukwu, Udenigwe, &amp; Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0156" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Xanthophylls play a critical role in the defense of skin against sunlight (Stahl &amp; Sies, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0203" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Lutein and zeaxanthin protect eye from high‐energy blue light, and inhibit and repair the photoinduced oxidative damage (Bian et al.,
