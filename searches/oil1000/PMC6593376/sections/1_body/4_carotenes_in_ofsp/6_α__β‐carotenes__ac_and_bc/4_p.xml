<p class="p">The OFSP is considered as the good source of the carotenoids, and many researches are recommended to use the OFSP to combat the problems of VAD in developing countries. Stinco, Benítez‐González, Hernanz, Vicario, and Meléndez‐Martínez (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0207" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported 13.11 (µg/g db), and Huang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) reported 1–15 (µg/g fw) of AC in OFSP. Many researchers reported the BC concentrations are higher than AC in fresh and dry basis. Among the all, Tomlins, Owori, Bechoff, Menya, and Westby (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0217" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) reported the highest range (20–364 (µg/g db)) of the BC in OFSP from different varieties grown in Uganda, whereas Teow et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0213" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) reported the 44.9–226 (µg/g fw) of the BC in fresh base from US varieties of OFSP. Overall, the presence of high concentration of BC in the OFSP is a good sign as previously discussed as BC yields high amount of the PVA. Both the carotenes are very high in OFSP compared to the common consuming yellow to orange vegetables and fruits. As reported by the Gul et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) the carotenoid concentration in different foods, such as carrot (43.5–88.4 µg/g), mango (10.9–12.1 µg/g), and tomato (2.17–2.83 µg/g), contain the lower concentration of the BC than the OFSP. In case of the total carotenoids, 570 µg/g (db) of the carotenoids are reported by Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) in OFSP from Korea. These concentrations are much higher than any other fruits and vegetables.
