<p class="p">In plants, carotenoids are located in chromoplasts and chloroplasts, and possess pivotal roles in photosynthetic guard from photo‐oxidative injuries (Carol &amp; Kuntz, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Carotenoids are metabolized in the plastid by methylerythritol‐4‐phosphate (MEP) pathway (Phillips, León, Boronat, &amp; Rodríguez‐Concepción, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0168" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). This biopathway is composed of two branches behind lycopene to produce AC and BC by lycopene ε‐cyclase (LCYE) and lycopene β‐cyclase (LCYB) (Fraser &amp; Bramley,
