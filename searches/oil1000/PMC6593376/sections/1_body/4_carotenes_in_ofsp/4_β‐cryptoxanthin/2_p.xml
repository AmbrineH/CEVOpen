<p class="p">β‐Cryptoxanthin (BCX) is the most common dietary carotenoids found in the fruits and vegetables, and it is a PVAC along with AC and BC (Berni, Chitchumroonchokchai, Canniatti‐Brazaca, De Moura, &amp; Failla,

Researchers proved that high concentration of NPVAC (lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene) to VAC (AC, BC, BCX) in plasma has positive role in reducing diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (Brazionis, Rowley, Itsiopoulos, &amp; O'dea,

Lower concentrations of high‐density lipid (HDL) concentration in body was found with BCX intake by food, and also recent experimental study reported the BCX positive correlation with osteoporosis prevention (Gammone, Riccioni, &amp; D'Orazio,
