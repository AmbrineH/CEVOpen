<p class="p">Limited studies were reported on concentration of BCX in OFSP as 21.2 (µg/g db) (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). So, consumption of OFSP with BCX concentration will contribute to the 0.5 µg of VA by 1 g consumption. So, 100 g of OFSP will provide 50 µg of VA, and it contributes to the VA RDA requirements with BCX, AC, and BC. Some foods such as pumpkin, papaya, oranges, carrots, and yellow corn are rich sources of BCX. The comparable BCX concentrations in agreement with other foods is reported in OFSP (Breithaupt &amp; Bamedi,
