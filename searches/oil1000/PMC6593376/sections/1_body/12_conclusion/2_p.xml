<p class="p">An eye pleasant color and good flavor make OFSP possesses acceptable by different age groups in many processed forms. The OFSP contained high moisture and starch contents; in contrast, protein and fats are present in very less concentrations. However, the ash and fiber contents are present in moderate concentrations. The minerals are moderately present in OFSP, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and sodium are reported in very less concentrations, but phosphorus and potassium are reported in moderate concentrations, and iron is reported in good concentrations. PVA and NPVA carotenoids are reported in the OFSP; in case of BCX, lutein, zeaxanthin, and AC and BC are in good concentrations. Among the all, very high concentrations of the BC are reported, which is a good source for the VA. Very low concentration of the Vit. E and Vit. C is reported in OFSP. In case of phenolic acids, such as CGA, CA, 4, 5‐; 3, 5‐; 3, 4‐diCQA isomers are reported in good concentrations. The presence of different carotenoids and phenolic acids with good AA is reported by different scientists. The role of OFSP is successfully reported in the VAM in developing countries. Scientists successfully prepared the different food products both in liquid and in solid forms by OFSP base. Finally, it is concluded that OFSP is a good secondary staple food for the developed countries.</p>
