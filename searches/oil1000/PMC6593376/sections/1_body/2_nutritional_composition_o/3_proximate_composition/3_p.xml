<p class="p">Moisture is the major component in OFSP, which accounts for &gt;62% and &lt;75% (Endrias et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Lyimo, Gimbi, &amp; Kihinga,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Other root and tubers also reported similar moisture contents such as potato (79%), cassava (60%), WFSP (77%), and yam (70%) (USDA, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Usually, roots and tubers are consumed in fresh after boiling or minimal processing with traditional practices. Different researchers reported the various drying techniques for OFSP and converted into flour to the moisture content of &lt;11% (Rodrigues et al.., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0180" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The low moisture content is very important for OFSP flour to maintain long shelf life. These similar trends were reported in case of staple grains also, and usually at the time of harvesting, cereals possess moisture contents &gt;22% to 25% and dried to 9%–13% for long‐term storage (Liu, Chen, Wu, &amp; Peng, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The moisture content of OFSP reported variation in different studies; this may be related to the diversity in variety, agroclimatic conditions, agriculture practices employed, etc.
