<p class="p">Energy density is a very important property of the staple crops, for example, 344.52–375.05 kcal/100 g in OFSP (Endrias et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The energy of OFSP is comparable with the cereals such as maize (365.2 kcal/100 g) and rice (365 kcal/100 g); in comparison with the other roots and tubers, the energy composition of the OFSP was reported better. Due to this property, the OFSP is one of the choices for staple foods (Prentice &amp; Jebb,
