<p class="p">Very low concentration (&lt;1%) of the fat was reported in OFSP; usually, this trend is the property of roots and tubers (Lyimo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Mohammad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0138" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Rodrigues et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0180" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The fat concentration of the OFSP is even little better than other roots and tubers such as potato (0.09%), cassava (0.28%), WFSP (0.05%), and yam (0.17%) (USDA, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Usually, staple crops contain less concentration of the oils and fats; this is true in case of rice (0.66%) and wheat (1.54%). The fat concentrations directly influence the energy density of the food, but people with limited energy to avoid certain disease can consume OFSP (Hu, van Dam, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). However, people in underdeveloped countries in Africa are consuming OFSP more so, and supplementation of the oilseeds and high‚Äêenergy foods is highly recommended to certain vulnerable groups (need high energy) (Butte,
