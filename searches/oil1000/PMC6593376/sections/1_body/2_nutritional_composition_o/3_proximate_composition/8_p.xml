<p class="p">Crude fiber is one of the nondigestible carbohydrates, which provides the fecal bulkiness, less intestinal transit, role in cholesterol level reduction, and trapping dangerous substance like cancer‐causing agents, and also encourages the growth of natural microbial flora in gut (Dhingra, Michael, Rajput, &amp; Patil,

 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). These variations may be related to the varietal and agroclimatic differences of the crop. The crude fiber of OFSP is higher than potatoes (2.2%) and cassava (1.8%); however, the comparable concentrations of yam were reported in OFSP. In case of the staple cereals such as maize (7.3%) and wheat (12.2%), they reported high concentration of the fiber than OFSP (USDA, 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Usually, cereals contain outer bran layers, which are high source of the crude fibers. The good concentration of crude fiber is an advantage for OFSP consumers. Very limited studies are reported on soluble and insoluble fibers of OFSP, Huang, Tanudjaja, and Lum (
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) reported high concentration of the insoluble dietary fiber (1.35%–2.64%) compared to soluble (0.15%–1.00%), and this is a positive nutritional aspect of the OFSP.
