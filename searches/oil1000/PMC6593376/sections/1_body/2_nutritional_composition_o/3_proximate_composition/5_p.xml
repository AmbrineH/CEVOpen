<p class="p">Proteins are very important nutrients for structural, functional performers of different biomolecules in human body, and they provide the essential amino acids required for metabolism. The protein in the range of 1.91%–5.83% was reported in OFSP (Mohammad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31063-bib-0138" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Usually, roots and tuber are the poor source for protein, which is similar in case of the OFSP. The protein contents of the OFSP are in similar to those of potato (2%), cassava (1.4%), WFSP (1.6%), and yam (1.5). In contrast, the protein compositions of OFSP are very low as compared to the staple food grains, such as maize (9.4%), rice (7.1%), wheat (12.6%), and sorghum (11.6%) (USDA,
