<p class="p">Since bread is considered a staple food worldwide because of its nutritive value, low price and its simplicity of use, it is ideally suited for fortification with oilseeds. The impact of oilseeds on bread baking has been studied in many investigations. Oilseeds can be incorporated whole, crushed and as pressed oil, and their beneficial effect on health seems to depend on the method of addition [

Further, changes in dough rheology and the quality of final products, including their sensory acceptability, depends on whether they are incorporated whole or crushed. Other aspects, such as the oxidative stability of the enriched products, must be also considered [

In the case of chia and flax, the mucilaginous polysaccharide that these seeds exude when they are placed in aqueous medium can also be added to the formulation to provide advantageous technological properties in terms of food development. The hydration of grains or flours before their incorporation into the bread doughs, in order to extract these polysaccharides, can modify the rheology of the doughs and the quality of the breads [

These grains can also be added only on the surface of breads or other products, in which case the influence on the final product will be less. Differences in the development of breads have been reported based on the method of incorporation and the pretreatment of the oilseeds, among other things, and therefore there are still numerous challenges to solve in their use (oxidation of the lipids, the impact of the gluten network to the structure, etc.).
