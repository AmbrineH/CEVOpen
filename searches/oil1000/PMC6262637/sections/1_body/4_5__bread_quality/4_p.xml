<p class="p">The results also seem contradictory for gluten-free breads, something usual in this type of research since they depend on the flour/starch used as a base, the substitute for gluten and the hydration. It is known that the incorporation of insoluble fibers [

 <xref rid="B101-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] usually reduces bread volumes. In the case of oil, it can have a beneficial effect by reducing the consistency of the batters, which usually increases the volume of the bread to a certain limit [
 <xref rid="B102-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. All these investigations have been carried out on gluten-free breads with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), which can reach volumes similar to wheat breads and are very sensitive to changes in the formulation. In general, research shows a decrease in the volume of the breads and an increase in the hardness when chia flour was incorporated [

 <xref rid="B94-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], although Constantini et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] did not observe significant differences when they incorporated this flour to 10% in bread with buckwheat flour. However, in this study, no gluten substitute was used and the specific volume obtained was less than 1.5 mL/g, so that the doughs barely increased during the fermentation and baking processes. In contrast, the investigation of Sandri et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] showed specific volumes of 1.7 mL/g with xanthan gum and carboxymethylcellulose, and specific volumes of 6 mL/g using HPMC were reached in the research of Steffolani et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], which showed a greater reduction in volume with the incorporation of chia flour. Thus, changes are more appreciated when the specific volume of the control bread is greater.
