<p class="p">The effect of oilseed flours on breads is determined by their components. It is known that the incorporation of fibers [

 <xref rid="B95-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>] usually reduces the specific volume of the breadâ€™s original firmer textures. The effect of the incorporation of oils on breads depends on their added quantity. In small amounts and depending on the type of oil added the incorporation of oils can be beneficial, while in larger quantities they weaken the dough and have negative effects on the volume of the breads [
 <xref rid="B96-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Therefore, depending on the added product (wholemeal, protein concentrate, defatted flour), its composition and the amount added, the effects on the quality of bread may vary. Generally, a negative effect on the volume of the breads is expected after incorporation. When non-ground whole seeds are used, a minor effect is expected since not all of their components interact with the wheat flour.
