<p class="p">The shelf life of enriched breads is another important aspect to consider. Although it has barely been studied in the research carried out until now, it is known that loaves with lower volumes and higher hardness generally harden more quickly [
 <xref rid="B103-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Thus, the reduction of the volume of the loaves due to the incorporation of these seeds can accelerate the staling of the bread. Nevertheless, it is also known that lipids reduce the retrogradation phenomena of amylopectin [
 <xref rid="B104-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] and, therefore, the rate of hardening of the loaves [
 <xref rid="B105-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>], so when oilseed flours are incorporated and the specific volume of the loaves is maintained, it is possible that the hardening of the loaves is delayed. It has been shown that the incorporation of chia flour can delay the retrogradation of amylopectin, responsible for the staling of the loaves [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The incorporation of ground flaxseed also retarded bread staling [
 <xref rid="B98-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. However, in long-life breads the oxidation of these lipids and their effect on the oxidation of other lipids present in the product must be considered, especially when they are incorporated as flour. Thus, breads enriched with flaxseed meal presented a higher level of peroxides after 8 weeks of storage [
 <xref rid="B106-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. An accelerated lipid oxidation, particularly polymerization compounds, was shown in chia-enriched biscuits [
 <xref rid="B107-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. These problems can be partially solved with the incorporation of antioxidant substances [
 <xref rid="B108-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. However, the possible combinations should also be considered since sesame seed extract has been shown to be effective in protecting oils from oxidation [
 <xref rid="B109-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], and sesame oil has also been shown to be effective in delaying rancidity in oil of sunflower [
 <xref rid="B110-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>].
