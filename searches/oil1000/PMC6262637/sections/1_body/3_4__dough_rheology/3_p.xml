<p class="p">In the case of gluten-free doughs, the use of equipment such as the alveograph or the extensograph is not possible because they are based on the measurement of the characteristics that the gluten confers on the doughs, such as extensibility or tenacity. It is usual to analyse the gluten-free doughs by conventional rheology, such as in oscillatory tests. There is limited research related to this, but Moreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] observed that the incorporation of chia flour into doughs of chestnut flour reduced both the elastic and the viscous component. These results conflict with the observations of Zettel and Hitzmann [
 <xref rid="B93-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] in doughs of sweet bread, but in this study the chia flour was used to replace fats together with a greater incorporation of water, so the changes in the rheology cannot be attributed exclusively to the incorporation of chia flour.
