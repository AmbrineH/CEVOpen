<p class="p">The rheology of bread doughs gives us an idea of how they behave in different processes, and can also help us to predict some final characteristics of the breads. Current studies on the influence of oleaginous seeds and their flours on the rheology of bread doughs are limited, but we expect that there is an influence depending on their composition, since they are rich in oil, vegetable proteins and fiber. Thus, it is known that the addition of small amounts of oil or fat leads to greater flexibility and workability of the doughs, greater final volume, a finer alveolar structure, and a softer final texture [

On the other hand, the vegetal proteins modify the farinographic properties in a different way according to their type [

 <xref rid="B83-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], but in general they reduce the strength of the doughs and their extensibility. The incorporation of fiber usually increases water absorption, the mixing tolerance and the tenacity of the doughs, but reduces extensibility [

The type of incorporation must be also considered since, if oilseeds are incorporated as flour, their different components will interact with the components of the dough, will compete with them, or will establish synergies. However, if they are incorporated as seeds, although these seeds can also have an effect on the properties, their components will not interact since they will remain inside the seed coat.
