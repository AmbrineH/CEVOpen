<p class="p">In the farinographic analysis of doughs with chia at 5%, the incorporation of seeds does not modify the behaviour during the kneading but decreases absorption slightly [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. However, in this same research the addition of whole or low-fat chia flour increased the stability of the doughs, and when defatted chia flour was added the absorption also increased. Contrary to what was observed in this study, Steffolani et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported that a 5% addition of chia flour does not affect absorption, but it increases with a 15% addition. The incorporation of chia also reduced the stability of the doughs and increased the development time. The decrease in the stability of the doughs matches the observations of Koka and Anil [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] with the incorporation of flaxseed, Moreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] with chia flour, and Matthews et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] with the addition of different oilseed flours. A greater absorption of water was also observed with the incorporation of these flours in all these studies. In general, there seems to be agreement that the use of these types of flours does not modify the absorption or increase it, while the effect on stability is contradictory. The differences may be due to the different starting flours, the percentage and the type of oilseed flour used. In fact, the wheat flour used by Iglesias, Puig and Haros [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] presented lower stability values than those used by Steffolani et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] or Koka and Anil [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], making it easier to increase this stability. Regarding the variety of seed used, Svec et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] even observed that using different types of chia (white or black) modified the effect of these flours on the amylographic analysis, although, in both, the peak viscosity increased, the viscosity rise was faster and the pasting time decreased. These results coincide with what Verdu et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] observed by Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA), which has been attributed to the presence of mucilage. The incorporation of flax and chia flours also tends to reduce the extensibility of the doughs and the energy of deformation, measured with the extensograph or with the alveograph [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], which can cause problems in the use of the doughs or in the retention of gas during fermentation. In fact, Steffolani et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] observed that the gluten network of the doughs with 10% of seeds or chia flour was broken before the control dough, with gas escaping to the outside. This effect could be expected due to the dilution of the gluten located in the mixtures and responsible for these properties. Similar results have been observed due to the incorporation of lipids [
 <xref rid="B91-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] and products with a high content of non-gluten-forming proteins [
 <xref rid="B92-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>], which can inhibit the formation of the gluten network.
