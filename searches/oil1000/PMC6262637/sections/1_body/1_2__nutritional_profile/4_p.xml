<p class="p">Many studies have focused on the nutritional enrichment of bakery products through the incorporation of this type of seed or by-products, such as oils, proteins or other derivatives. In general, an increase in the content of nutrients present in the seeds, or their derivatives, is confirmed, since there are no losses or significant changes in them during the baking process. As for the incorporation of proteins extracted from these seeds, Mansour et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] observed that up to 22% replacement of wheat by pumpkin protein isolate is possible without adverse effects on bread quality. They also reported that the obtained breads have a higher level of protein, lysine and minerals, improving also the essential amino acid index. However, mineral enrichment was greater when the seed flour was incorporated. The study of El-Soukkary [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] confirmed these observations with isolated pumpkin seed protein and observed that the in vitro protein digestibility also improved. These effects are repeated with the incorporation of sesame proteins, but in this case, the maximum level of substitution was 18% [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The incorporation of sunflower seeds at levels of up to 16% allowed an increasing of the levels of tocopherol and certain minerals, such as Ca, Mg and Zn in normal and whole grain breads, as well as enriching them in fats with a high linoleic content [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The incorporation of chia, as seed or flour, increased the fiber content and omega-3 acids both in wheat breads and in gluten-free breads [

 <xref rid="B40-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Some researchers have also studied the inclusion of chia flour up to 14% and have observed an increase in the levels of ash, protein, fiber and lipids [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. These same authors observed a decrease in the total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and the level of triglycerides in rats when they were fed with these breads compared to those fed with breads without addition of flaxseeds. On the other hand, the incorporation of ground flaxseed hulls at levels lower than 5% was sufficient to increase significantly the antioxidant activity in breads [
