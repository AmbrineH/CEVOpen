 <xref rid="B8-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In their research, some varieties of pumpkin seeds were 30% lipids, while in the study by Seymen et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] the oil contents of pumpkin seeds were between 33% and 47% depending on the variety. Furthermore, these fats stand out for their low level of saturated fatty acids and for their high content of oleic acid in sesame seeds; linoleic acid (ω6) in sunflower, sesame and poppy seeds; and linolenic acid (ω3) in flax and chia seeds. In the case of pumpkin seeds, apart from their high linoleic acid level, their oleic acid content is also highlighted [

These seeds also have significant protein content (between 15 and 20%) and a fiber percentage higher than that of cereal grains, with fiber content of flax and chia seeds over 25%. In the case of chia, different studies have reported higher values of fiber (between 35–40%) depending on the variety, and of which more than 85% is insoluble fiber [
