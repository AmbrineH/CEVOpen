<p class="p">Mineral content is noteworthy. The high calcium content of sesame, chia and poppyseed; the iron content of sesame and poppyseed; the zinc content of pumpkin; and the magnesium, phosphorus and potassium contents of most of these seeds stand out, and are higher than in wheat. As a negative aspect, sunflower seeds have high sodium content. They also stand out for their high level of vitamins B and E. In particular, sesame is notable for its high levels of vitamin B6 and folates; flaxseed for its high level of thiamine and folates; chia for its high level of niacin; and sunflower for its high content of niacin, vitamin B6, folates and vitamin E. Some of these seeds also show a high content of antioxidants. Thus, chia has a high concentration of polyphenols derived from caffeic acid and other antioxidant substances [
