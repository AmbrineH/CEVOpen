<p class="p">Despite the clear evidence of the nutritional advantages of incorporating this type of seed in breads, the health benefits can sometimes depend on the method in which they are incorporated. Kuijsten et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] showed that milling the flaxseeds improved the bioavailability of the enterolignans, and therefore their nutritional advantages increased. Similarly, the reduction of the particle size by wet micronisation increased the oral bioavailability of lignan glycosides from sesame meal [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. However, when flaxseed products are incorporated into muffins or breads, the mammalian lignan production of flaxseed precursors depends on the time and dose, but not on the processing [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Although more research is needed in this regard, we must also consider the effects of this processing on the rheology of the doughs and the organoleptic quality of the breads. The stability of these products must also be considered during storage, something of great importance for industrial use. Although Malcolmson et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] observed good stability of the milled flaxseed stored at room temperature in paper bags with plastic liners during a four-month period, other studies have shown that when the particle size decreases, the oxidative stability of these products decreases too [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Therefore, when milled oil seeds are used, aspects such as particle size and packaging conditions must be considered in order to maximise the stability of these products.
