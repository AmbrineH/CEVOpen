<p class="p">The incorporation of oilseeds improves the nutritional profile of bread, increasing its protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and bioactive compounds. The use of oilseed mucilages has also been used successfully to replace the fat to produce healthier good quality breads. Therefore, the inclusion of these compounds in bakery products is of great interest, both in wheat products and in gluten-free products. However, it must be borne in mind that this inclusion modifies the rheology of the dough, depending on the way in which it is made (flour or seeds, prehydration or not) and the percentage used. Based on this, problems can result in changes to the final characteristics of the bread. To ensure the commercial success of these inclusions, it is necessary to consider the acceptability to consumers, which may vary depending on the type of inclusion and its percentage. In general, however, it seems that seed levels up to 15% can be obtained with good acceptability.</p>
