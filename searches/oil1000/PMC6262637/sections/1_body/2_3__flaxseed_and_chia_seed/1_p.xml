<p class="p">Chia seeds and flaxseeds are characterised by being very rich in mucilage. The mucilage of flaxseeds, consisting mainly of water-soluble polysaccharides, has a great water absorption capacity and rheological properties similar to those of guar gum [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In fact, flaxseed mucilages have been proposed as a substitute for gluten in the preparation of gluten-free breads in order to improve their acceptability against a mixture of pectin and guar gum [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Its composition includes a neutral fraction, composed of arabinoxylans, and an acid fraction composed of polysaccharides similar to pectin [
 <xref rid="B61-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. As with flax mucilage, chia mucilages are extracted in water, more easily if the temperature is high; when the proportion of water-seed increases, the saline content of the water decreases and the pH increases [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], so the conditions of the mixture can affect the interactions with this component. In this research, the hydration manages to extract mucilage with yields of 7%, somewhat lower than the maximum achieved with flax, which was slightly higher than 9% [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The chia mucilage has also been compared with guar gum and locust bean gum because of its high hydration capacity [
 <xref rid="B62-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and great thickening power [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Its structure corresponds to that of arabinoxylans, but with greater amounts of uronic acids than those of flax, imparting anionic characteristics to the macromolecule [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. On the other hand, its ability to increase the stability of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. In the case of flax mucilage, its good foam stability properties in aqueous solutions have also been demonstrated [
