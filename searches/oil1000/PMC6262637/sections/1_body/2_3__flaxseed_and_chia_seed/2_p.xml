<p class="p">Just like other hydrocolloids, the use of chia mucilage as a stabiliser in ice cream [
 <xref rid="B67-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] and as a substitute for fats in breads, cakes [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] or mayonnaise [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] has been proposed. The use of hydrocolloids with high water absorption capacity and thickening power, such as xanthan gum, in wheat bread increases the absorption of the doughs, the development time and stability in the kneading, generates more tenacious and less extensible doughs, and can increase the specific volume and the firmness of the breads [
 <xref rid="B72-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Similarly, guar gum has proved efficient in improving the volume of breads made with non-frozen and frozen dough [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This type of hydrocolloid has also been proposed to reduce water losses in storage, both of finished breads [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] and doughs and breads under refrigeration [
 <xref rid="B75-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Usually, gluten-free formulations have applied hydrocolloids to mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten [
 <xref rid="B76-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Among these hydrocolloids, those with high gas-holding capacity and high thickening power, such as guar gum or xanthan gum, have been suggested [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], and are some of the most widely used industrially. At a nutritional level, these gums are also interesting. Guar gum is capable of significantly decreasing the in vitro hydrolysis of starch, an effect that has been attributed both to guar galactomannan, which acts as a physical ‘barrier’ to alpha-amylase-starch interactions, and to the effect of guar gum on digesta viscosity [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Likewise, breads enriched with arabinoxylans can help control the glycaemic level in diabetics [
 <xref rid="B79-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. However, the incorporation of chia mucilage has only been able to reduce the glycaemic index estimated in the crust of pita breads, but to increase it in the crumb [
 <xref rid="B80-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. More research would be necessary but, in general, the use of chia and flax mucilage can be very interesting in baking, isolated or together with the flour or seeds, in which case its functionality will depend on hydration and its release from the original matrix to interact with the components of the dough.
