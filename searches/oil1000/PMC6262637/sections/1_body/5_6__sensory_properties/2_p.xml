<p class="p">As for breads enriched with oilseed flours, Verd√∫ et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] reported that bread enriched with 5% chia flour did not show significant sensory differences in respect to the control bread. This may be due to the low percentage of chia flour used. Coelho and Salas-Mellado [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] observed that the acceptability of enriched bread with oilseed flour is better than that of bread enriched with seeds, which they attributed to the higher specific volume of the bread with oilseed flour. However, in this research, they compared breads with 7.8 g/100 g of chia flour versus breads with 11 g/100 g of chia seeds, so the amount of chia could influence the evaluation of the consumers. Regardless, the use of prehydrated oilseed flours could be an option to improve the sensory properties of breads [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], probably due to the higher moisture level and less sensation of dryness, by releasing the mucilage prior to baking and increasing water retention during baking. In this respect, more research would be necessary in order to know the level of enrichment at which changes in the sensory properties become significant, since no agreement has been reached. The influence of enriched gluten-free breads with chia has been studied by authors such as Steffolani et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] and Sandri et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-07-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In both studies, no significant differences in terms of overall acceptability were reported in formulations with up to 15 g/100 g of chia flour or seeds.
