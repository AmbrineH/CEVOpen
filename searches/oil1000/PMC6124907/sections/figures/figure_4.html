 <p> The measured data and calculation results for the water-in-dodecane emulsions prepared for different emulsifying time. (a) The dielectric constant. (b) The dispersity factors and the average droplet size (measured by DLS). (c) The normalized droplet size distribution. The water content is 2.0 vol% and emulsifications were performed at a rotation speed of 10â€‰000 rpm. </p>
