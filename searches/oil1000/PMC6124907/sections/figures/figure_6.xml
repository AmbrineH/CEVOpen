  <title class="title">The measured data and calculation results for the water-in-dodecane emulsions with different rotation speed. (a) The dielectric constant. (b) The dispersity factors and the average droplet size (measured by DLS). (c) The normalized droplet size distribution. The water content is 2.0 vol% and emulsifications were performed for an emulsifying time of 2 min.</title>
