 <p> Dielectric constant of emulsions with different water contents. (a) Water-in-dodecane emulsions. (b) Water-in-hexadecane emulsions. (c) Water-in-crude oil emulsions. (d) Water-in-tar oil emulsions. Emulsifications were performed at a rotation speed of 10â€‰000 rpm and emulsifying time of 10 min. The blue line denotes the dielectric constant calculated by serial capacitor model, and the red line denotes the values predicted by Lichtenecker model. </p>
