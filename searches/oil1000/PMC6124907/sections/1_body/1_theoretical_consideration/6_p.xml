<p class="p">For a known emulsion composition, the dispersity factor 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> can be determined from the measured dielectric constants. The value of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is between 0 and 1, which can be understood as the degree of polydispersity of the water droplets. 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> = 1 denotes a monodispersed emulsion, while 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> = 0 suggests that the system has been fully separated into two phases. Hence, we can use the dispersity factor to describe the dispersity of real emulsion systems.
