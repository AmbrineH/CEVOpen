<p class="p">The dielectric properties of emulsions cannot be simply derived from the properties of the individual pure components due to the existence of interfacial polarization and local field corrections.

In fact, a size distribution of dispersed droplets will always exist in a real emulsion system, and previous studies demonstrated that the size distribution of micelles influences the permittivity of the mixture.
