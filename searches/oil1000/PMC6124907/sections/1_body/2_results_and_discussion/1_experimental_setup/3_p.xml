<p class="p">In this work, we measured the dielectric properties of emulsions using the microwave cavity perturbation technique. The attractive features of this approach are as follows: (1) it is a rapid measurement which takes only milliseconds, thus allowing this application to real time analysis and control; (2) instead of focusing on a single point, the microwaves penetrate the entire sample based on the sample holder dimension. Therefore, a reliable volumetric analysis of emulsions can be determined; (3) the microwave power level in the measurements is 0 dBm (
