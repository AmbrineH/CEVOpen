 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>) is made of aluminium and in a cylindrical shape. The cavity excitation is provided by two open-circuit SMA connectors coupled into the electric field at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The TM
 <sub class="sub">010</sub> mode is employed to establish a highly uniform E-field near the axis, resulting in a minimal depolarization of the sample in the measurement.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>. In the measurement, the sample was loaded into a quartz tube and placed in the centre of the cavity, since the inner tube radius (2 mm) is far smaller than the radius of cavity, the E-field applied to the sample can be regarded highly uniform.
