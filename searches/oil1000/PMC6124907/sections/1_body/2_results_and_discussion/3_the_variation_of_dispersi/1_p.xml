<p class="p">The droplet size distributions obtained by DLS are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>. The multiple peaks at 1 min indicate a broad size distribution of water droplets. With an increase in the emulsifying time, the distribution peaks have a negative shift and a narrower bandwidth, demonstrating the emulsion system is more uniform. According to energy dissipation theory, the droplet size distribution for emulsification in the turbulent regime is determined by the energy density, dimensionally related to the residence time, the rotator speed and diameter.

 <xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref> The average droplet size of dispersed phase should decrease with the increase of the emulsifying time, which is consistent with the measured DLS results.
