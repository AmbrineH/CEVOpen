<p class="p">The droplet size distribution of emulsions is influenced significantly by the rotation speed during emulsion preparation. We conducted both the microwave cavity analysis and DLS on water-in-dodecane emulsions prepared with different rotation speeds, and the measured data and calculation results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>. The dielectric constant of emulsions slightly increases with the emulsifying rotation speed, and correspondingly the dispersity factor rises from 0.37 at 10 000 rpm to 0.88 at 16 000 rpm. The energy density for emulsification increases with rotation speed, thus resulting in a smaller average droplet size. We note that the emulsions have a narrower distribution at a higher rotation speed, as illustrated in DLS size curves (
