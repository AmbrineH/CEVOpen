<p class="p">We also analysed a series of water-in-hexadecane emulsion samples prepared with various rotation speeds. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>, the dielectric constant as well as the dispersity factor rises with increasing rotation speed. The droplet distributions measured by DLS are consistent with the variation of the dielectric constant.
