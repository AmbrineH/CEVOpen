<p class="p">Therefore, we can verify that the dispersity factor most effectively describes the size distribution of dispersed droplets. A higher dispersity factor indicates a narrower droplet distribution and hence a more uniform emulsion. Importantly, the microwave cavity analysis is critically sensitive to the variation of droplet size distribution even at low water content due to the significant difference between the dielectric constant of water and oil. Although these measurements have been conducted at the ISM frequency of 2.45 GHz, it will also be possible to perform similar measurements on inhomogeneous mixtures of greater volume by increasing (proportionately) the size of the cavity, thus reducing the resonant frequency of the TM
 <sub class="sub">010</sub> mode. One such frequency within an ISM band is around 900 MHz, for which the host cavity will have an internal diameter of around 25.5 cm. We have found in other work that it is possible to have a sample tube with an internal diameter of up to 5 cm, with a pair of axial chokes, thus maintaining a very high 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic> factor. For such a 900 MHz cylindrical cavity of aspect ratio diameter to height of 1 : 1, this yields an active sample volume of up to 0.5 litres.
