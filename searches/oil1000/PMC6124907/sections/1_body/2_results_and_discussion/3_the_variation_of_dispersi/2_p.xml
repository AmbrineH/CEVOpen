<p class="p">The measurements were also performed on a series of water-in-hexadecane emulsion samples which were prepared for different emulsifying time. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5a and b</xref>, though the water content of emulsions is rather low (2.0 vol%), the measured dielectric constant increases considerably with the emulsifying time increasing, and the dispersity factor rises from 0.03 at 5 min to 0.89 at 15 min. The size distribution determined by DLS verified that the polydispersity of samples reduces with the emulsifying time (
