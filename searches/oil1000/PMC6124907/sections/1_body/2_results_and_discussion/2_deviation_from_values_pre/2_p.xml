<p class="p">Here we chose dodecane and hexadecane as model oils since their emulsions are transparent and can be accurately interrogated and analysed by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. The dielectric constants as well as the droplet size distribution of water-in-dodecane emulsions for different emulsifying time were investigated using the microwave cavity analysis and DLS. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, the measured dielectric constant is near the value predicted by serial capacitor model at emulsifying time of 1 min, suggesting that the emulsion system is non-uniform. Then the dielectric constant has a rising trend with the emulsifying time, and correspondingly the dispersity factor increases from 0.04 at 1 min to 0.66 at 20 min (
