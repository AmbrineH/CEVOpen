<p class="p">Initially we measured the dielectric properties of emulsions with different water contents (0â€“20.0 vol%) and compared the data with the values predicted by the mixing models. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, the dielectric constant of water-in-oil emulsions increases rapidly with the water content, because the dielectric constant of water is much higher than the value of oil phase. The sensitivity to the water content offers potential applications of this technique for multiphase flow meters.
 <xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> MATLAB R2017a was employed to calculate the dielectric constant of emulsions from the mixing models. The results show that for a certain water content, the values predicted by Lichtenecker model are higher than the values calculated from serial capacitor model. The deviation between the measured dielectric constant and the two limiting predicted values arises from the polydispersity of the water phase, thus we can directly investigate the dispersity of emulsions through the variation of measured dielectric constant.
