<p class="p">Water-in-crude oil emulsion samples with water content of 10.0 vol% were prepared for different emulsifying time, and a representative microscope image of these samples is shown in the ESI Fig. 2.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">â€ </xref> It can be observed that the water phase was extremely well dispersed in crude oil. The dielectric constants of these samples were investigated by the microwave cavity, and the measured data and calculation results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>. The dielectric constant of emulsions rises slightly with the emulsifying time, while the dispersity factor increases from 0.85 at 1 min to 0.98 at 20 min, indicating that the water-in-crude oil emulsions become more uniform as the emulsifying time increases.
