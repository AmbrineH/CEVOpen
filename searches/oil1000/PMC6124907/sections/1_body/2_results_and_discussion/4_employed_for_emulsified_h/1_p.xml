<p class="p">We also conducted the microwave cavity analysis on heavy fossil oil emulsions. Compared to paraffins, both the crude oil and tar oil have a rather complex composition, containing hundreds of compounds. Due to the opaqueness of emulsified oil, one cannot measure the droplet size distribution accurately using dynamic light scattering technique.
