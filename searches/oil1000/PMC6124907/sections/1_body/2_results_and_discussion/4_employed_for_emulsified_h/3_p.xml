<p class="p">The microwave measurements were also performed on a series of water-in-tar oil emulsion samples which were prepared for various emulsifying time. As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref>, the measured dielectric constant increases with the emulsifying time, and correspondingly the dispersity factor rises considerably from 0.42 at 1 min to 0.70 at 20 min. The variation of measured dielectric constant with the emulsifying time demonstrated that the microwave analysis is capable of characterizing heavy oil emulsions.
