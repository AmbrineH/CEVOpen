<p class="p">Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was also performed immediately after the emulsion preparation to measure the droplet size distribution using a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments). We performed each test for three times and irreversible sedimentation was not detected in such short period of measurement. A detection angle of 173Â° was used and 10 runs were carried out in each measurement. A GXML3030 Trinocular Reflected and Transmitted Light Microscope (GT Vision) was used to observe the emulsified crude oil in this work.</p>
