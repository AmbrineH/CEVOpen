<p class="p">The emulsions were prepared utilizing a high shear homogenizer with a maximum rotation speed of 24 000 rpm. A composite nonionic emulsifier was first dissolved in the oil phase, then a certain amount of deionized water was added, and shearing was performed at a fixed rotation speed. The emulsifier was a composite of Span 85 and Tween 85. In this study HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) = 4 gave stable water-in-oil emulsions. The volume fraction of emulsifier was 5 vol% in emulsion preparation. Dodecane (≥99%) and hexadecane (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Light crude oil was provided by Saudi Aramco, and coal tar was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The physical properties of the crude oil sample are shown in the ESI Table 2.
