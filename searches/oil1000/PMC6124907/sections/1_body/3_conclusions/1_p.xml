<p class="p">We hope to have illustrated the great utility and versatility of the microwave cavity perturbation technique to provide an accurate, non-invasive method for investigating the nature of emulsions, particularly the critically important dispersion properties in various stages of the emulsifying process. The systems investigated have ranged from model emulsions to fossil fuel emulsions, illustrating the great potential of this technique.</p>
