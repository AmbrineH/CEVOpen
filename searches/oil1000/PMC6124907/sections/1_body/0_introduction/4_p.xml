<p class="p">An alternative rapid and non-invasive method to characterise the dispersity of emulsions is reported here based on the interrelationship between the droplet size distribution and the characteristic dielectric properties of emulsions. An effective mixing model is proposed to correlate the dielectric constant of the emulsion system with the emulsion dispersity. For this, we have investigated the dielectric properties of emulsified oil having different water contents and droplet size distributions using a microwave cavity perturbation technique. The applicability of this technique for heavy oil emulsions is also demonstrated.</p>
