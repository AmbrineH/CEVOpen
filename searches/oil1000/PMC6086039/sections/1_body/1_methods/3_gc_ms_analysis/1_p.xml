<p id="Par19" class="p">Gas chromatographic analysis was performed on a 5975 Gas Chromatograph coupled with-mass spectrometer (Agilent, USA; SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey). Innowax FSC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was utilized as stationary phase while helium was utilized as a moble phase (0.8 mL/min). The volume injected was 0.1 μL with a split ratio of 40:1. The oven temperature of the GC was intialy set at 60 °C for 10 min, then increased to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, held constant for 10 min and thereafter increased to 240 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The temperatures of the injector and transfer line were set at 250 and 280 °C respectevely. MS detection was performed at 70 eV with scan mass range m/z 35–450.</p>
