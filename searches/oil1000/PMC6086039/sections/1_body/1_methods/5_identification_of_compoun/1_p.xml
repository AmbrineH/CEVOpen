<p id="Par21" class="p">The volatile oil components were identified by comparing the mass spectra with those of similar compounds in Adams library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>], Mass Finder terpenoid library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>], Wiley GC/MS Library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] and our own Baser Library of Volatile Oil Constituents, on the basis of their retention indices. The identification was completed by comparing the retention times with authentic reference standards and by comparing the retention index (RRI) relative to C
