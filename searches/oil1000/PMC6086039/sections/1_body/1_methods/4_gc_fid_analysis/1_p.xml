<p id="Par20" class="p">Analyses were carried out on an Agilent Technologies 6890 N GC system with flame ionization detector. The temperature of the FID was programmed to 300 °C. The same column utilized in GC–MS experiments as well as the same operational conditions were performed to a triplicate. Simultaneous auto injection was done to obtain equivalent retention times. The quantification (relative percentages) of the identified compounds was calculated from the FID peak area percent normalization.</p>
