<p id="Par25" class="p">The MIC values of the three essential oils against three Gram-positive, one Gram-negative and two fungi strains were estimated using micro-well dilution method as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] with modifications. With sterile round-bottom 96-well plates, duplicate two-fold serial dilutions of each essential oil (100 μL/well) were prepared in the suitable broth (Mueller Hinton or Sabouraud Dextrose broth) containing 5% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/v) DMSO to establish a range of concentrations (20 to 0.156 μL/mL) of essential oil. 100 μL (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL) of the bacterial or fungal suspension which was previously prepared in the proper broth, was then added in each well except those in column 10, 11 and 12, which used as negative controls for oil, saline and media sterility. The last well in each plate was served for bacterial or fungal growth without essential oil. After that the 96-well plates were incubated at the appropriate temperature for each strain for 24 h. The MIC of each oil was specified as the lowest essential oil concentration exhibiting no detectable bacterial or fungal growth. Gentamycin and nystatin with a range of concentrations of 125 to 0.97 μg/mL were used as a positive controls. For the determination of MBC and MFC (minimal bactericidal concentration and minimal fungicidal concentration), part of the liquid (5 μL) from each well that exhibited no growth was taken and incubated on agar plates at 37 °C for further 24 h. The lowest concentration that revealed no visible bacterial or fungal growth was considered as MBC or MFC.
