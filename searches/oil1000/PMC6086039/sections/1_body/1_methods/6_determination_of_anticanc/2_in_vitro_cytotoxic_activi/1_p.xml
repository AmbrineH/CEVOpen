<p id="Par23" class="p">The cytotoxic activity of the essential oils was assessed on cell viability using MTT-assay. This test measures the cellular viability based on reduction capacity of the viable cells to convert 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan crystals as previously described [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well) in growth medium (DMEM) into flat-bottom microdilution plates of 96 wells (in quintuplicates) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator for 24 h. The essential oils were added at different concentrations to each well while the medium in control wells was replaced by SFM (serum free medium) containing an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and incubated for further 24 h. The concentrations tested ranged from 1.97 to 250 μg/mL. After that SFM was removed and 100 μL of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for another 3 h to estimate cell viability. MTT solution was removed and 100 μL isopropanol was added to each well to dissolve the formed purple formazan crystals with shaking for 1 h at room temperature. At the end, the plates were read at 549 nm using a microplate reader (ELX 800; Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). The induced cytotoxicity was calculated by comparing the optical density (OD) values against those in control wells. Cytotoxicity was expressed as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>-value which was calculated as the concentration of the volatile oil inhibiting cell viability by 50%. Dasatinib was utilized as a positive control. All measurements were performed in triplicate and the means and standard errors were calculated.
