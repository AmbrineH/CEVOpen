<p id="Par33" class="p">MICs, MBCs and MFCs of the essential oils are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. As demonstrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, the essential oils exhibited variable degrees of bacterial and fungal growth inhibition (MIC-values: 0.137–4.40 mg/mL). The most sensitive microorganisms were the bacteria strain 
 <italic class="italic">Brevibacillus laterosporus</italic> and the fungal strain 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging between 0.137 and 0.55 mg/mL against almost microorganisms. MBC or MFC values were also exhibited and obtained one time higher than that of MIC’s with all essential oils (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
