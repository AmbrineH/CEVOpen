<p id="Par31" class="p">The results of the GC/FID and GC/MS are demonstrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. It showed the chemical composition of the analyzed oils, retention indices, percentages and identification methods. The identified compounds are listed in order of their elution on the HP Innowax column. The GC/FID and GC-MS investigation drove to the identification of 59, 60 and 42 compounds representing 89.0, 95.0 and 97.1% of the total essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus, P. asirensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> respectively. Maaliol (42.8%) was the major constituent in the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> while β–caryophyllene (13.3%) was the predominant constituents followed by α-pinene and spathulenol (8.6 and 8.7%) in 
 <italic class="italic">P. asirensis</italic> essential oil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> essential oil showed the predominance of α-pinene (46.2%) followed by borneol (20.7%) as major components (Table
