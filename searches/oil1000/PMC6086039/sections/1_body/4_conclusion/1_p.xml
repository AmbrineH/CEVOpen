<p id="Par42" class="p">Our results revealed that the chemical composition of the essential oils of the three 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species varied from each another. The GC and GC/MS analysis identified a high content of maaliol (42.8%) in 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic>, β-caryophyllene (13.3%) in 
 <italic class="italic">P. asirensis</italic> and α-pinene (46.2%) in 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic>. Furthermore, the results clearly provide evidence that the three essential oils possess remarkable cytotoxic and antimicrobial but moderate antioxidant activities. These data back the suggestion that the investigated 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species represent a hopeful source of cytotoxic and antimicrobial compounds. Further experiments are required to separate the active principles as well as in vivo investigations to prove their efficacy and safety for clinical use.
