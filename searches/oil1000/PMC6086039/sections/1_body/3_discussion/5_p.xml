<p id="Par39" class="p">In the current study, we observed promising cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities for the three essential oils. The cytotoxic activity of the oils was determined against three types of cancers (Hela, HepG2 and HT-29) using MTT test. All essential oils particularly those of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> showed remarkable cytotoxic activity against all tested three cancer cell lines. In general, literature data on 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> essential oils cytotoxicity are still scarce. Contrary to our results, a work presented by Ali et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] highlighted a weak cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> essential oil (18% at 100 μg/mL) against HT-29 tumor cells. Furthermore, in a recent study done by Amina and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>], maaliol was isolated from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> and showed the highest cytotoxic activity among the isolated compounds against MBDMB321, HT1080 and Hela cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 28.1, 25.9 and 27.1 μg/mL respectively. Thus, the great cytotoxic activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> essential oil could be mainly attributed to maaliol which predominated with 42.8%.
