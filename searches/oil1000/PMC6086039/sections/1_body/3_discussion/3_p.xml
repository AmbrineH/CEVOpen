 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic>, the oxygenated sesquiterpenes (60.8%) were determined as the major group, among which maaliol (42.8%) was found to be the main constituent (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Oxygenated monoterpenes (11.1%) followed in this essential oils as a second major group with camphor (7.2%) as a main component. Our results are partly in agreement with a recent published report by Khan and co-workers on the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> grown in Saudi Arabia who revealed the predominance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes too but with patchouli alcohol (55.5%) as a major component. Our results were not in agreement with previous studies on the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> grown in Yemen, Oman or Ethiopia where thymol (68.5%), carvacrol (46·8%) and camphor (40.9%) were identified as the major constituents respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Moreover, our results of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. asirensis</italic> was not in agreement with the data of a recent published study which revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">P. asirensis</italic> oil was mainly characterized by the presence of monoterpenoids (90.7%) where thymol (66.0%), followed by γ-terpinene (14.0%) represented the major constituents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Our results revealed that chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> was dominated by the presence of monoterpene hydrocarbons (57.8%) followed by oxygenated monterpenes (31.2%). α-pinene (46.2%) as well as borneol (20.7%) dominated in this oil and demonstrated the representatives for both monoterpenoid groups. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the chemical composition of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> grown in Saudi Arabia. Our results are partly in agreement with a previous reports on 
 <italic class="italic">P. barbatus</italic> essential oil which showed α-pinene (22.2 and 19.3%) as a major component [
