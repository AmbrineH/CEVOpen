 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> grown in Oman or Ethiopia exhibited similar or higher antimicrobial activity with MIC-values in the range of 7–62 μg/mL against various bacterial and fungal strains. Some previous studies support the hypothesis that certain essential oil components e.g. α-pinene, borneol, 1,8-cineole, maaliol and prostantherol produced from various plant species have antimicrobial activity [
