<p id="Par16" class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> (Family: Lamiaceae) speaks to a great and widely distributed collection of species with a variety of folkloric uses. This genus involves a group of about 300 species, spread in tropical and suptropical territories of Asia, Australia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> is represented in Saudi Arabia by seven species distributed in the South of the Kingdom [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. The species of this genus are well-known medicinal species used extensively for the treatment of different illnesses. A considerable assortment of traditional therapeutic uses of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> in Central and East Africa, India China and Brazil have been reported. The majority of uses are for intestinal disorders and liver stress, respiratory disturbances, heart diseases, malaria and central nervous system disorders [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species are rich in diterpenoids as well as essential oils which are reported to be responsible for various pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and antiplasmodial activities [

Thus, the particular aims of this study are to provide detailed data on the chemical composition, cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of three 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species namely 
 <italic class="italic">P. cylindraceus</italic> Hocst. ex Benth. (Synonym: 
 <italic class="italic">P. montanus</italic> Benth.)
