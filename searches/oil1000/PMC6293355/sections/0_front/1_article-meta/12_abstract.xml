 <p class="p">The potential impacts of fracking on the environment and health, as well as impacts on local communities and their “quality of life,” are well documented. This paper outlines the potential human rights impacts of fracking and argues for a human rights-based, participatory, and justice-based approach to regulation. In particular, it discusses the findings of the recent Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal session on human rights, fracking, and climate change, held in Oregon, United States, and the potential impact of the tribunal’s decision on other jurisdictions where fracking takes place, particularly England.</p>
