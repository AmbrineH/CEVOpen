<p class="p">The government of the United Kingdom (UK) is promoting the development of its unconventional natural gas resources in England, following the United States’ commercial success employing horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to extract shale gas.

 </xref> The UK commenced commercial drilling in the North of England on October 15, 2018, despite community concerns and legal challenges that suggest potential harm to human health, impacts on environmental quality, inadequate procedural fairness, and limited distributive justice.

 </xref> The UK does not have a written environmental constitution or any explicit environment-related provisions in the Human Rights Act of 1998, which draws its content from the European Convention on Human Rights. This lack of explicit recognition of environmental rights arguably makes it easier for the UK government to promote a pro-fracking agenda in England aligned with a political agenda rather than broader societal and environmental standards and safeguards. Despite calls for human rights impact assessments in relation to fracking, the UK government is resisting the development of further legislation largely on the grounds that it is confident the current regulatory regime is “more than robust enough” and due to its strong desire to promote technological development and industrial growth through the extraction of shale gas using fracking.
