<p class="p">The judges’ preliminary statement concluded that the successful “experiment” of the tribunal could be turned into a “flexible and powerful tool which could allow the struggles of the communities of the world” to be globally communicated and could promote effective solutions and justice.

 </xref> Therefore, although the judges’ final advisory opinion has yet to be rendered, the recent PPT session on human rights, fracking, and climate change provides an example of both why human rights mechanisms are key for the regulation of a new technology—particularly one with significant potential impacts—and how international human rights law and an open forum for presenting testimony can be an important tool for protecting citizens’ basic human rights. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates the role of civil society associations in bringing greater public accountability to global governance.

 </xref> In this manner, civil society bodies such as the PPT have the potential to enhance the transparency of global governance, encourage compliance by monitoring and reviewing global regulations, facilitate redress for evidenced harms and transgressions, and encourage the development of additional accountability mechanisms.

 </xref> The PPT is recognized and respected by the various interested parties—communities living near fracking, urban activists, government regulators, oil and gas companies, and others. For example, the third session of the PPT addressed industrial and environmental hazards and human rights and was held in 1992 in Bhopal and Bombay, India. The session, which built on earlier hearings in the United States and Thailand, was held in Bhopal—the site of the chemical disaster—in order to enable access to justice for the aggrieved parties.

 </xref> The tribunal can thus play a crucial role in ensuring access to justice and redress for aggrieved parties, as well as publicizing human rights transgressions and promoting justice.
