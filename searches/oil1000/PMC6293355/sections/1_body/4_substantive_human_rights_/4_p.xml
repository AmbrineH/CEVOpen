<p class="p">The right to water is relevant for our purposes because shale gas extraction has the potential to contaminate groundwater, streams, rivers, and lakes through the migration of chemicals used in fracking fluids to underground water sources; spillage during “frackfluid” handling; improper disposal of wastewater; and underground injection of wastewaters.

 </xref> All stages of the fracking water cycle have a potential impact on the quality of water resources, including drinking water supplies and, in turn, health. Furthermore, given that fracking fluid contains a mixture of chemicals, often not fully known, there is a risk of water contamination due to accidental surface spills and leaks.

 </xref> Moreover, during the flowback stage, fracking fluid returns to the surface along with any injected chemicals, but it can also bring to the surface toxic materials that occur naturally underground, including radioactive materials.

 </xref> Additionally, large quantities of water are required in the fracturing process, which can be particularly problematic in areas where water sources are already stressed (such as areas that suffer frequent droughts), affecting humans both directly and indirectly (for example, via impacts on the surrounding flora and fauna, which can have effects on the local area).
