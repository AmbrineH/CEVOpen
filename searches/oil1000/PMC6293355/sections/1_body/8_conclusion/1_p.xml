<p class="p">In the case of hydraulic fracturing to extract shale gas, where there is a potential for human rights violations as evidenced from cases in the United States and other countries, there is an important role for the long-established and respected PPT in promoting justice and ensuring human rights protections to the fullest extent. Particularly regarding the potential impacts of fracking on peopleâ€™s health and the environment, as well as the rights to social inclusion and access to participation, the expert opinion of a civil society body such as the PPT can help promote procedural justice and fairness by highlighting potential rights transgressions and acting as a global forum to promote redress. In this manner, the tribunal can fill crucial gaps in the regulation of contentious issues such as shale gas extraction and can set an important precedent for promoting and protecting international human rights.</p>
