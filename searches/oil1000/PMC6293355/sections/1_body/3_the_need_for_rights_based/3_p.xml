<p class="p">In the UK context, it can be argued that a technology such as fracking, which has the potential to adversely affect environmental and public health, should be evaluated through a human rights impact assessment and regulated under a framework of human rights protections.

 </xref> Questions posed in relation to the above are manifold and are largely equity based: Who benefits from the technology and who is set to suffer adverse impacts? What are the adverse impacts likely to be and how can they be mitigated or avoided, particularly when the technology and techniques are new to the UK? And has there been an open and public decision-making procedure that takes account of a variety of framings and views on the issues? Complementary to a human rights impact assessment approach would be the application of the precautionary principle—before fracking can be allowed to proceed—requiring that proponents of this technology undertake risk assessments to demonstrate what the related health, environmental, and other impacts might be. These processes encourage accountability and the halting of any activities that may damage the environment and human health.
