<p class="p">There are many existing human rights agreements at the international and regional levels, including the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights, the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, the 1987 African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Related mechanisms for accessing justice include the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights, and the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Some of these human rights agreements explicitly recognize a right to environment in some form (such as article 24 of the African Charter), while others do not (such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child)—however, the latter “allow” us to argue that the fulfillment of existing human rights is contingent on certain standards of environmental protection and other rights such as the right to health.
