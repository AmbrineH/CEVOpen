 </xref> In the North of England, homeowners and community residents have expressed concern over the undermining of their rights to property, to health, and to private and family life due to the lack of a legally required human rights impact assessment. The UK government has recently approved commercial extraction at the Preston New Road sites in Lancashire, England. It can be argued, however, that the regulatory regime does not address stakeholder concerns with respect to social rights and health risks, as it is concerned mainly with licensing, infrastructure, site health and safety, and the mechanics of drilling.
