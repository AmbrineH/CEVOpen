<p class="p">There have been many opportunities to develop a 
 <italic class="italic">sui generis</italic> human rights impact assessment for fracking in the UK (and perhaps this is on the to-do lists of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Irelandâ€™s devolved administrations, which do not currently permit fracking), but it does not seem forthcoming from the UK Parliament. The England and Wales regulatory framework for fracking emphasizes petroleum regulation and, to a lesser extent, planning (where construction of the well site requires planning permission, which may be linked to environmental impact assessments and public consultations that might provide space for procedural human rights considerations). There is arguably little scope for the consideration of environmental human rights concerns under current regulations, which are based largely on petroleum, minerals, and energy.
