<p class="p">In 1945, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations,” setting the scene for the normative landscape and codifying the basis for parameters in relation to the roles of states in the lives of their citizens.

 </xref> Here, human rights were codified to allow an individual to “be” and to “live” a fundamentally “free” life, subject to the social contract norms of civil society (criminal law and so on), with dignity and without arbitrary interference. A useful normative standard in interpreting the application of human rights law, particularly in an environmental context, operates around notions of consent, contract, capacity, and causation. Did I agree (“contract”) to be “interfered” with in this way? Do I have the capacity (including the opportunity) to make a decision (mentally or procedurally) about the way I am being affected by the decisions of others, and thus did I “consent” to the effects of said action or inaction? Where there is a lack of compromise, it is fair to say that there is likely to be an injustice or potential breach of human rights, or procedural unfairness. We attempt to explore these ideas in this paper within the context of fracking, analyzing certain notions of environmental rights and pollution.
