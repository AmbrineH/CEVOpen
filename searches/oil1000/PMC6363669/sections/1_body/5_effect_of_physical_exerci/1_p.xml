<p class="p">Physical exercise can have beneficial effects on general metabolism and physiology. Several rodent studies showed increased BAT activity and browning of WAT in rodents on exercise (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aldiss et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peppler et al., 2018</xref>). However, a systematic review concluded that regular exercise is not a major stimulus for increased BAT activity even though an increase may be observed in animals consuming high-fat diets or with low endogenous UCP1 levels (
