<p class="p">Several exercise-induced mediators have been suggested to play a role in browning of WAT in rodents. These include myokines such as Irisin, a hormone released by skeletal muscles whose levels increase following exercise (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boström et al., 2012</xref>), IL-6 (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knudsen et al., 2014</xref>) and β-amino isobutyric acid (BAIBA) (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>), etc. While the initial findings of existence of irisin were questioned due to non-specificity of the antibodies (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Atherton and Phillips, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Albrecht et al., 2015</xref>), a mass spectrometry-based analysis confirmed the presence of irisin in human plasmas and its increase following exercise (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, habitual physical activity was shown to be positively correlated with serum irisin levels (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buscemi et al., 2018</xref>) but a lower active BAT (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singhal et al., 2016</xref>). A systematic review of the literature has concluded that it may not be possible to conclude an association between physical activity and Irisin or PGC-1α because of lack of precision of available methods (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dinas et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, further research is needed to evaluate the effects of myokines on brown fat physiology and browning process, taking into consideration that trained individual may show a divergent response than untrained/sedentary individuals (
