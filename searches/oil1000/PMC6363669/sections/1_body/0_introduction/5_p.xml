<p class="p">Brown adipose tissue and UCP1 levels have been shown to be involved in body weight regulation, glucose, and lipid homeostasis in mice (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kontani et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feldmann et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stanford et al., 2013</xref>). Mice strains which have a tendency to be obese have comparable BAT levels and activity but diminished browning of WAT depots (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guerra et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xue et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, transplantation of BAT from healthy mice into the visceral cavity of apoE–/– mice led to a 20% reduction in atherosclerotic lesions (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kikai et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, transplantation of human beige tissue in mice significantly improved their metabolic parameters (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Min et al., 2016</xref>). Obese humans have reduced BAT compared to those with normal weight (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Orava et al., 2013</xref>) and the amount of detectable BAT correlated inversely with total, subcutaneous and visceral adiposity (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Individuals who are BAT-positive have a reduced probability of type 2 diabetes and obesity (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>). Another study employing retrospective analysis of FDG-PET/CT scans of 4852 patients showed that BAT-positive patients had lower visceral, subcutaneous and liver fat content (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brendle et al., 2018</xref>). BAT-positive individuals have better insulin-stimulated glucose disposal compared to BAT-negative individuals (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chondronikola et al., 2014</xref>). Among patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, those with higher BAT fraction had better metabolic profiles (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franssens et al., 2017</xref>). The activated BAT was shown to be associated with reduced arterial inflammation and fatty liver (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nam and Jun, 2017</xref>). Even in newborns, those with the higher BAT at birth were shown to have lesser fat-gain over the period of 6 months (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Entringer et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of BAT by cold-exposure was shown to be associated with improved glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity and reduced plasma FFA levels (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iwen et al., 2017</xref>), and lesser central adiposity (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Green et al., 2017</xref>). Activated BAT is also associated with other physiological benefits such as amelioration of obesity-associated reduction in male fertility (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu H. et al., 2017</xref>) and improved menstrual regularity in rat model of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, BAT recruitment has been suggested as an anti-obesity agent in humans (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yoneshiro et al., 2013</xref>). Individuals with active BAT weighed on an average 4 kg less than BAT negative individuals (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Leaner individuals had about 50% higher UCP1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, the UCP1 levels accounted for about 50% of BMI variance (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).
