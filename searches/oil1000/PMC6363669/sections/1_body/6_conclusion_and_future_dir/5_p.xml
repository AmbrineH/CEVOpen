<p class="p">Novel small molecule activators of BAT and brite cells are being developed, along with novel delivery systems such as functionalized nanoparticles (
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xue et al., 2016</xref>) and lipid nanocarriers (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zu et al., 2017</xref>). Such delivery systems hold promise for precise and efficient delivery of bioactives to their target site(s). Similarly, several dietary additives that activate BAT and browning have been reported. However, long-term studies with pharmacological and dietary treatments are needed. Future studies can also investigate the combined dietary and pharmacological treatments. Further research is likely to generate more information on BAT and brite biology and its interaction with various other physiological processes.
