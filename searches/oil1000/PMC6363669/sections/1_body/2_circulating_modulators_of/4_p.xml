<p class="p">Sex hormones play an important role in regulating brown fat function. As several studies have shown that females have higher BAT activity than males, it is likely that estrogen levels impact BAT activity (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frank et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced levels of estradiol (E2), an ovary-derived hormone, are associated with reduced BAT activity (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">López and Tena-Sempere, 2016</xref>) and E2 treatment can increase BAT activity by activating hypothalamic AMPK (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">López and Tena-Sempere, 2017</xref>). The roles of E2 in regulating thermogenesis were recently reviewed (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González-García et al., 2017</xref>). Pharmacological activation of estrogen receptor β(ER-β) was shown to increase BAT volume and energy expenditure (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ponnusamy et al., 2017</xref>). Progesterone, a hormone associated with gestation, was shown to cause a brown-to-white conversion of BAT in mice (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McIlvride et al., 2017</xref>). Removal of BAT prior to conception led to maternal and fetal hyperlipidemia and larger fetuses. Inhibiting follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a polyclonal antibody was shown to induce beiging, activate BAT and thermogenesis and reduce WAT (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu P. et al., 2017</xref>). BAT was shown to have the highest expression of Follistatin (Fst), previously known as FSH-suppressing protein. Overexpression of Fst was shown to increase BAT mass as well of browning of WAT (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that FSH has an inhibitory effect on BAT activity and browning. Castration was shown to increase browning of IWAT in mice (
