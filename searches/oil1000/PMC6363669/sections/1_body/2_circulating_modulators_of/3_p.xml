<p class="p">Increased thyroid hormone activity is known to promote energy expenditure. One study showed that both hypothyroidism, as well as hyperthyroidism, led to increased WAT browning in mice (
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weiner et al., 2016</xref>). The study showed that hyperthyroid mice had higher BAT mass and activity than the hypothyroid mice. The thyroid hormone T3 can increase SNS activity to BAT, increasing BAT activity (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">López et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment with T4 or administration of T3 to VMH was shown to be associated with the browning of WAT (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martínez-Sánchez et al., 2017a</xref>). In humans too, the cold-induced increase in energy expenditure was shown to be associated with circulating T3 levels (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gavrila et al., 2017</xref>). The action of T3 on BAT activity was shown to be mediated by a reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the VMH (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martínez-Sánchez et al., 2017b</xref>). Angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) was shown to play a role in T3-induced upregulation of browning genes in WAT (
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Than et al., 2017</xref>) and an AT2R agonist was shown to increase WAT browning. On the other hand, deleting the AT1aR was shown to be associated with IWAT browning (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tsukuda et al., 2016</xref>). Injection of angiotensin 1–7 peptide through a micro-osmotic pump was shown to increase in BAT size and UCP1 levels as well as increase thermogenesis in subcutaneous WAT without affecting UCP1 levels there (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morimoto et al., 2018</xref>). A thyroid receptor beta (TR-β) specific agonist GC-1 was shown to increase energy expenditure and prevent weight gain in rats (
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Villicev et al., 2007</xref>). The molecular mechanisms involved in the TH-induced increase in thermogenesis was reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weiner et al. (2017)</xref> and involves both direct activation of thyroid hormone receptors in the adipose tissues as well as indirectly through the activation of hypothalamic neurons. A recent study has identified the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) as one of the targets of T3 which regulates the UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes (
