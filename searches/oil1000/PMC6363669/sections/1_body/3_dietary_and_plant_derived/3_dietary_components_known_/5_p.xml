 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yoneshiro et al., 2012</xref>) as well as grains of paradise (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sugita et al., 2013</xref>) was associated with increased thermogenesis. Activation of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) by these compounds (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baskaran et al., 2016</xref>) leads to increased SNS activity to induce BAT (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saito and Yoneshiro, 2013</xref>). Selective ablation of inguinal WAT (IWAT) sensory neurons by capsaicin treatment was shown to reduce the norepinephrine turnover not only in the IWAT but also in the IBAT, and reduce UCP1 expression in IBAT (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, loss of TRPV2 was associated with impaired thermogenic response to β-adrenergic stimulation and poor cold tolerance (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2016a</xref>, 2). Expression of TRPV2 is significantly increased during brown fat differentiation, and TRPV2-agonists inhibited the brown adipocyte differentiation (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2016b</xref>). Human studies have shown that increased energy expenditure following capsaicin treatment was observed only in individuals with the active BAT (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Supplementation of vanillic acid also increases BAT activity (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). These studies have shown that BAT plays a role in the increased energy expenditure following intake of “hot” foods and have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, providing new targets to modulate BAT activity.
