<p class="p">To examine our nutrient calculation performance, we selected 3 Chinese food dishes for comparison analysis. The 3 dishes were garlic puree cooked pork leg, dry-fried string beans, and roast lamb, which were measured by chemical methods in a previous study [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Given a dish of Chinese food (weight = 100 g), we calculated its nutrient content as C={

 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, ..., 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 <sub class="sub">n</sub>}, where 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> is a nutrient such as energy, protein, fat, or carbohydrate. We used mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) [

 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, ..., 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>} obtained by chemical methods, where the Kjeldahl nitrogen method was applied to evaluate the protein content and the acid hydrolysis method was used to evaluate the fat content [
