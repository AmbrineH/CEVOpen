<p class="p">In Chinese diets, foods are cooked according to numerous recipes, and are classified as staple foods (eg, rice, steamed buns), cooked dishes (eg, cooked tomato with eggs), and soups (eg, egg drop soup). In this study, the RFID plates were used to carry the Chinese foods. We developed our dietary management system to automatically collect food consumption information (ie, food names and food frequency) but no personal information of the consumers (eg, sex, age, and smoking habits). The system further provided functions of food frequency statistics, food composition overview, and proxy indicators of dietary intake.</p>
