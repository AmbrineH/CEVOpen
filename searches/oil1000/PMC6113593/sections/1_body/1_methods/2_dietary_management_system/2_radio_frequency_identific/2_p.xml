<p class="p">We classified foods into 3 categories, put onto 3 types of plates: staple foods (eg, rice) are on plate 1, cooked dishes (eg, cooked tomato with eggs) are on plate 2, and soups (eg, egg drop soup) are on plate 3. The RFID chips embedded in the plates recorded information about the foods, including their name, price, and weight. When a diner checked out after choosing a plate of food, the RFID reader interacted with the plate, recording food consumption information by connecting the consumerâ€™s ID with the food information.</p>
