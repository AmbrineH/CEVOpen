<p class="p">To test the feasibility of the dietary management system, we applied it to collect data on 489 kinds of Chinese foods, which were consumed at lunchtime by our study participants from January 5 to February 15, 2016. We used these examples to test our system output at the population level, including consumed food distribution and preparation method distribution. To test our system at an individual level, we selected one participant who completed 20-day dietary data.</p>
