<p class="p">Our study had 3 main limitations. First, we estimated the weight of the food on each kind of plate by the type of plate and the food itself. We did not weigh exactly the consumed part on each plate. This may have affected the accuracy of our nutrient intake calculation. Second, the preparation methods used in Chinese cuisine affected the nutrient calculation results. Recent studies investigated the effects of cooking methods on specific foods [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We have not yet considered the effects of cooking method. Third, in Chinese food recipes, small amounts of auxiliary ingredients (eg, ginger and garlic) are commonly used. In this study, we ignored their nutrient contents in our calculation, which may have affected the nutrient analysis results. In our future work, we will consider the above factors such as precise weights and auxiliary ingredients to improve nutrient intake calculation accuracy. As the dietary management system was designed for clinical research and health consumers, user tests should also be conducted in future.
