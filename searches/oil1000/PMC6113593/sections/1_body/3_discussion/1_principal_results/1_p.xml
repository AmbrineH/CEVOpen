<p class="p">We developed a dietary management system to collect information on Chinese food using RFID technology. We applied the system to process real-world dietary data to test its feasibility. As shown in the preliminary results, the system can automatically record the Chinese foods carried by RFID-embedded plates and generate food frequency reports. With the support of the Chinese Recipe Database and China Food Composition Database, our dietary system broke down the cooked Chinese foods into their ingredients and nutrients. The system outputs included data on the frequency of the foods consumed and an overview of the composition of chosen foods, at both a population level and an individual level.</p>
