  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p class="p">Dietary management is important for personal health. However, it is challenging to record quantified food information in an efficient, accurate, and sustainable manner, particularly for the consumption of Chinese food.</p>

  <title class="title">Objective</title>
  <p class="p">The objective of this study was to develop a dietary management system to record information on consumption of Chinese food, which can help in assessing individuals’ dietary intake and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. We proposed to use plates embedded with radio-frequency identification chips to carry Chinese foods and collect food consumption data.</p>

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p class="p">We obtained food composition and nutrient (eg, carbohydrate, fat, fiber) data from the Chinese Recipe Database and China Food Composition Database. To test the feasibility of the dietary management system at a population level, we applied it to collect data on 489 Chinese foods that were consumed at lunchtime across 7 weeks by 10,528 individuals. To test individual-level output, we selected an individual participant with completed 20-day dietary data for analysis. We examined the system’s nutrient calculation performance by comparing the nutrient values of 3 selected Chinese dishes calculated by our method with the results of chemical measurements.</p>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">We collected the dietary intake for a group of 10,528 individuals aged from 20 to 40 years having lunch in a restaurant across 7 weeks. A total of 489 Chinese dishes were identified. We analyzed a specified customer’s diet recordings and broke his or her 20 lunch diet recordings down to ingredients and then to nutrient intake. We compared the nutrient value of a given Chinese dish (eg, garlic puree cooked pork leg) calculated by our method with the results of chemical measurements. The mean absolute percentage deviation showed that our method enabled collection of dietary intake for Chinese foods.</p>

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p class="p">This preliminary study demonstrated the feasibility of radio-frequency identification–based dietary management for Chinese food consumption. In future, we will investigate factors such as preparation method, weight of food consumed, and auxiliary ingredients to improve dietary assessment accuracy.</p>
