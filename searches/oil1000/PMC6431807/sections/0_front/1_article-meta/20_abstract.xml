  <title class="title">Aim:</title>
  <p class="p">The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and chemical effect of 
   <italic class="italic">Heracleum persicum</italic> essential oil (EO), nisin, 
   <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and their combination against 
   <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> both 
   <italic class="italic">in</italic>
   <italic class="italic">vitro</italic> and in Iranian white cheese model.

  <title class="title">Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">Chemical compositions of 
   <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. After production of Iranian white cheese, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration of EO and nisin and agar spot test of 
   <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> against 
   <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were evaluated.

  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">Hexyl butanoate (25.98%), octyl isobutyrate (17.82%), methyl butyrate (14.37%), and pentyl cyclopropane (12.77%) were the main components of the EO. MIC of the EO against 
   <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was 2.5 mg/mL. Combination of nisin (5.3 IU/mL) and 
   <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO (2500 µg/mL) showed increasing effect against 
   <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (fractional inhibitory concentration = 0.9), while a higher concentration of EO and nisin showed undesirable effect on the cheese flavor. Furthermore, a combination of 10
   <sup class="sup">12</sup> CFU/g 
   <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> with 
   <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO at the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (T12) showed acceptable sensorial and also antibacterial results in Iranian white cheese.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">Combination of 
   <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO, 
   <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic>, and nisin can be recommended as natural preservatives and flavoring agents in cheese.
