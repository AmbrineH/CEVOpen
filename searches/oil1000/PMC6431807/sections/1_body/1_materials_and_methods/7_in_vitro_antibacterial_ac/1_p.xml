<p class="p">Agar spot test was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> against mentioned pathogenic strain. 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> colonies that had been grown on MRS agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were inoculated on BHI agar containing 20 mM glucose and incubated at 37°C for 24 h under anaerobic condition (Anaerobic jar BBL, Cockeysville, Maryland, USA). After incubation, spots were transferred to the soft agar plates (BHI, 2% glycerol and 0.7% agar), which had been previously inoculated with 100 μl of 1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL of bacterial suspension. After 1 h at 37 °C in aerobic conditions, the plates were incubated for another 18-24 h at the aerobic condition, and the diameter of inhibition zone was measured by a caliper. Inhibition zones with a diameter of 1 mm or more were recorded as positive results [
