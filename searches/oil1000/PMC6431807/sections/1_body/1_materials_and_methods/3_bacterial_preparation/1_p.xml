<p class="p">The lyophilized cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> PTCC1165 were transferred into brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Merck, Germany) and incubated at 37°C for 18 h, with two consecutive transfers. Bacterial suspension was added to sterile cuvettes containing 5 mL of BHI broth, and the absorbance was determined at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer until achieving the concentration of 1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL (according to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity) and serially diluted to the desired concentration (1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL). The suspension was used for the inoculation of BHI agar or cheese samples.
