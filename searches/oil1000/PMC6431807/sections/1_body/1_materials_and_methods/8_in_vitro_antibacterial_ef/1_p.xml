<p class="p">To assess the combined effects of nisin and the EO, fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) value was used [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] as follows: Eight concentrations (five concentrations less than the MIC value, one equal with the MIC value, and two concentrations more than the MIC value) of 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO and nisin were prepared according to the microdilution method. Then, 140 μl BHI broth, 20 μl of bacterial suspension (final dose in each well: 1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>), 20 mL of the EO concentrations, and 20 μl of nisin concentrations were poured into each well. The microplates were shaken for 30 s at 2500 rpm and incubated at 35°C for 24 h. Then, the MIC values of the EO and nisin were determined, and the FIC value was calculated using the following equation:
