<p class="p">Fresh cow milk was pasteurized at a temperature of 72±2°C for 15 s and was used for the production of Iranian white cheese. Desired dose of 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> L 
 <italic class="italic">. monocytogenes</italic> per milliliter of BHI broth was added into each sterile container containing 5 L of milk at a temperature of 35°C. 0.5% of starter culture (Chr. Hansen R 704), including 
 <italic class="italic">L. lactis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">cremoris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. lactis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">diacetylactis</italic>, was added to the milk [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Three concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> (10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> and 10
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>) nisin (200, 400, and 800 IU/mL) and the EO (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL) were added to the milk samples according to the treatments in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table-1</xref>. Then, 0.02% of calcium chloride (CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) in 20 mL of distilled water was added and dissolved in the milk at 40°C. To improve the efficiency of the rennet, the milk temperature was held at about 35°C during the clot formation. After 1 h, the clot was cut into 1-2 cm cubic pieces, and it was rehydrated under the pressure of 10 kg for 6 h, according to the Iranian white cheese preparation [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Then, rehydrated clots were kept in 22% brine (w/v) for 8 h. Clots were then transferred into 12% sterile salt water and kept at 14-16°C for 15 days. Microbial (bacterial enumeration) and chemical (determination of dry matter, acidity, and fat) analyses were performed on days: 0 (immediately after inoculation of bacteria in milk), 3, 7, 15 (at the end of cheese ripening period at 14-16°C), 30, 45, and 60.
