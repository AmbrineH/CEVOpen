A concentration of 10 mg/mL of the EO was also prepared with methanol solvent. Then, 10 μl of the EO was spilled on each disk and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Finally, the diameter of inhibition zone around each disk was measured by a caliper. Antibiotics discs (ampicillin) were used as positive control [
