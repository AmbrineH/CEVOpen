<p class="p">Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were also determined by microdilution method using 96-well microplates. The EO was prepared at the highest concentration (80 mg/mL) by dimethyl sulfoxide (10%) solvent, and the serial two-fold dilutions were made in the concentration range from 0.31 to 80 mg/mL in nutrient broth. Then, 160 μL of BHI broth, 20 μL of bacterial suspension at concentration of 1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL, and 20 μL of the EO (the final volume of each well: 200 μL, the final concentrations of the EO: 0.03-8 mg/mL, and the final bacterial level: ~1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL) were poured into the wells. Controls (without the addition of bacteria and without addition of the EO) were also prepared. Microplates were shacked at 2500 rpm for 30 s and kept at 37°C for 24 h. The lowest EO concentration that prevented bacterial growth (no visible bacterial growth) was considered as MIC value. To determine MBC value, 5 mL from wells with no visible growth in the MIC experiment was inoculated on BHI agar. The lowest concentration of the EO with bactericidal effects (lack of growth on the BHI agar) was considered as MBC value [
