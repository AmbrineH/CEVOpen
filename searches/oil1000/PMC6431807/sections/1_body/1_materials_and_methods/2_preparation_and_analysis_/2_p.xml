 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO were determined by gas chromatography (GC) device (Agilent Technologies-7890A model) connected to mass spectrometry (MS) (Agilent Technologies-5975C model) with HP-5MS capillary column of 30 m (inner diameter of 0.25 mm and inner layer thickness of 0.25 μm). The initial temperature was set up at 60-280°C with a gradual increase of 4°C. The injection chamber temperature was 250°F and helium gas was used at a rate of 2 mL/min. Ionization energy parameters and temperature of ionization source were 70 eV and 270°C, respectively [
