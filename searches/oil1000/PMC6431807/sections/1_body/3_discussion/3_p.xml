 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">Heracleum thomsonii</italic> against fungi, and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was also evaluated, and a strong antibacterial effect of 
 <italic class="italic">H. thomsonii</italic> was reported, which could be due to the presence of significant amounts of different compositions such as “nerol” (87.9%) and “neryl acetate” (62.51%) [
