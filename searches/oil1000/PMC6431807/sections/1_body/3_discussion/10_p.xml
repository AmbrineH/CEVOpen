<p class="p">Lactic acid bacteria, compared to other gram-positive bacteria, are highly resistant against EOs [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Hence, the effect of nisin and 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> on pH and cheese production process should be taken into consideration. All concentrations of the EO and lower levels of probiotic had no significant effect on pH value of the samples, while significant changes of pH value were observed in treatments containing 400 and 800 IU/mL of nisin and treatments containing higher levels of probiotic (data not shown here). The sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria against nisin is one of the logical reasons for changes in pH of treatments, containing higher concentrations of nisin (400 and 800 IU/mL). 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> can also produce bacteriocins, affecting starter bacteria and modifying the cheese ripening process. In a study by Kykkidou 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], on Galotyri (Greek local soft cheese), lactic acid bacteria were sensitive to nisin, and along with the reduction of spoilage bacteria, the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactococcus</italic> strains was also reduced in cheese.
