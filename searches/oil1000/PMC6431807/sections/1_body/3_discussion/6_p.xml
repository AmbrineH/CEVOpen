<p class="p">Low stability of nisin at higher pH values has restricted its application in certain food products [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Therefore, nisin in combination with other natural antimicrobial is an innovative approach for its usage. According to the results of this study, combinational use of nisin with 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO showed stronger effects against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> than individual usage. There are no available published data about the application of nisin in combination with 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO against pathogenic bacteria, but there are reports about the use of nisin with other plant EOs and extracts. In a former study, the effects of organic extracts of garlic and nisin were evaluated on six strains of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in a model broth medium, and a synergistic bactericidal effect was observed [
