<p class="p">The results of the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> suggested a suitable inhibitory effect of this probiotic against tested pathogenic bacteria. In this regard, Strus 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] reported anti-pathogenic impact of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> strains against anaerobic pathogens of gastrointestinal tract. Niel 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] reported the treatment of neonatal diarrhea with probiotic 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and reported signs of improvement. Ogunbanw 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] studied the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. plantarum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. brevis</italic> by well diffusion method, and these organisms exhibited preventive activities against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> NCTC10418 and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> EF1. Products of the probiotic bacteria such as acetic acid and lactic acid prevent the growth of pathogens by changing the pH value as well as inhibition of adhesion and invasion to the epithelial cell by increasing the production of intestinal mucins [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> also showed antimicrobial potency against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> through creating growth inhibition zones in an agar spot test.
