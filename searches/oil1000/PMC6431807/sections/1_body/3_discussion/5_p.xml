<p class="p">A previous study showed that nisin had antimicrobial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in BHI broth; although antibacterial effect of nisin on 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> is strain dependent [

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] reported MIC value of nisin against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> as 250 IU/mL. Different reported MIC values for nisin might be due to the different applied media; for example, in the Tryptose Agar medium, microorganisms show higher MIC value because the presence of high amounts of divalent cations causes more resistance to nisin [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Nisin creates holes in the membrane cytoplasm and disables the proton motive force which stops the absorption of amino acids and small metabolites [
