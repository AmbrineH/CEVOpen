<p class="p">In the present study, the entire aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> were analyzed, and four components of hexyl butanoate (25.98 %), octyl isobutyrate (17.73 %), n-octyl-2 methyl- butyrate (14.37%), and pentyl cyclopropane (12.77 %) were identified as the main constituents of the EO. Despite the differences with other studies regarding EO compositions [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], aliphatic esters were the main constituents of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EOs. Climate, time of harvest, storage time, distillation method, and genetic differences are effective on the compositions and concentrations of plant EO [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Since EO application in foods is generally recognized as safe including 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and also based on the components detected in the GC analysis, this EO was chosen in this study.
