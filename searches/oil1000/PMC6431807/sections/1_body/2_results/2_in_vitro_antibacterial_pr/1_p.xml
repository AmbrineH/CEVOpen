<p class="p">Results of 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antibacterial properties of 
 <italic class="italic">H. persicum</italic> EO by disk diffusion method showed that growth inhibition diameters of EO (10 mg/mL) against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were 6.7±0.15 mm. The inhibition zone for ampicillin, as control positive, was 28.2±0.25 and 17.4±0.45 mm for each of the treatments, respectively. Both MIC and MBC values of the EO were 2.5 mg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. MIC and MBC of nisin against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were 200 and 300 IU/mL by both methods. Growth inhibition zone of 
 <italic class="italic">L. acidophilus</italic> was 13.2±0.15 mm by agar spot test.
