<p class="p">Immune system activity was assessed by measuring the antibody titers specific to the infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine that were present in the serum of the chicks at hatching (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20) and at D13 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20/group) and D34 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20/group) after vaccination (Experiment 2). Antibody titers were determined by ELISA using the ID ScreenÂ® IBV Indirect kit and the protocol described by the supplier (ID.vet, Grabels, France).
