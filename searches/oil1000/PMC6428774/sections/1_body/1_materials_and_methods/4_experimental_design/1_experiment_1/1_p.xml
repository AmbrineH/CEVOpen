<p class="p">After opening the incubator, 192 chicks were placed in pens (0.5 × 1 m) and allocated to either C group (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 96) or D group (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 96). Chicks were provided with feed and water (W) 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> in the pens from D0 to D13 for the C group and from D1 until D13 post-hatching for the D group. Chicks were allocated either to pens with water only (W groups) or to pens with water and one essential oil (3 EO groups), cardamom, marjoram, or verbena, i.e., four groups each for C and D placement conditions, giving a total of eight groups (six pens/group, four chicks per pen) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Each essential oil (EO) was placed at D1 in the EO-C and EO-D groups. Two bottles, one of water and the other containing one of the EO were available in each pen for the EO groups. Two bottles of water were available for the W groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The bottle position was changed every day for a week and every 2–3 days during the second week to prevent the chicks from getting used to the position of the bottles. The intake of water and of each EO was recorded at D1, D2, D4, D6, D9, and D13. Water and EO were changed each time intakes were recorded and filled up between two intake measures if necessary. Water and EO intakes were first compared between groups for the 13 days post hatching when EO were provided. Water and EO intakes were then expressed as a percentage of the total liquid intake since differences in this total were observed between C and D groups.
