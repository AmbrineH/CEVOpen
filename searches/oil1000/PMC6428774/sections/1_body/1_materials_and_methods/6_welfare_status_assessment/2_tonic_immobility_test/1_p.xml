<p class="p">Tonic immobility is a behavioral response modulated by frightening situations and its duration is considered to measure the level of fearfulness (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Tonic immobility was induced by restraining the animal on its back: the longer the bird needed to right itself (referred as TI), the more fearful the bird was. Four 7-day-old chicks per pen were placed on their back in a 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic>-shaped cradle and restrained for 10 s and the duration of tonic immobility was recorded. If a chick failed to right itself after 5 min, a maximum score of 300 s was recorded. If tonic immobility was not induced after five attempts, a score of 0 s was recorded.
