<p class="p">The avoidance distance test described in the Welfare QualityÂ® protocol was adapted to our experimental room to assess the human-animal relationship. The observer entered the pen and remained standing close to the door due to the small size of the pens which did not allow walking without greatly disturbing the chickens. The duration that was needed for at least three chickens (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12/pen) to come close to the observer (&lt;1 m away) was recorded. This test lasted 2 min and was performed in each pen at 23 days of age.
