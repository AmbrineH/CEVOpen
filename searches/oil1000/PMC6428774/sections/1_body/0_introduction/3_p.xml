<p class="p">In chickens, EO have been investigated as growth and health promoters and have been used as feed additives (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). In these studies, EO were included in feed and therefore chickens had no choice but to ingest them. If chickens were able to select EO with medicinal effects that were the most adapted to a challenging situation, their robustness would potentially be improved and drug use reduced.
