<p class="p">The postnatal period is a critical period for livestock. They have to cope with specific husbandry conditions, and exposure to adverse environmental conditions that may result in stress responses. Stress during early life can induce persistent changes in physiology, behavior, and immune phenotype (

Strengthening an animal's robustness, that is to say its capacity to adapt to environmental disturbances, during the postnatal period is a potential strategy to reduce the immediate, and long-lasting effects of stressful early experiences. It can also contribute to improving the animal's sanitary status and to reducing the use of antimicrobial drugs. One approach initially observed in wild animals is the stimulation of self-medication behavior (SM) or zoopharmacognosy. This has been defined as the ability of animals to select and use specific plants or substrates with medicinal properties to control or to prevent diseases (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>) or situations of discomfort. Forbey et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) defined self-medication (as homeostatic behavior. In farm animals, observations of SM have been reported in ruminants (
