<p class="p">As in the first experiment, there was a large variation in intake of each EO between pens, and there was a significant progression in the intake of EO between D1 and D12 for both the C and D groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>). There were no significant differences in the intake of verbena EO by the C group over time, but the intake by the D group increased significantly from the D1–D2 to D6–D9 period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>). The intake of cardamom EO by the chicks increased progressively and significantly between D1–D2 and D6–D9 for the C group and from D1–D4 to D6–D9 for the D group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref>). It was the same for the intake of marjoram EO from the period D1–D2 to D4–D6 for both groups of chicks (
