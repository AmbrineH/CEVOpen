<p id="Par16" class="p">Various separation techniques commonly used in chemical process industries have been applied for their separation, but no cost-viable process has yet been introduced with detailed process operation results. The currently suggested procedures include extraction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>], adsorption [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], membrane separation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>], pervaporation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>], and reverse osmosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Because of the low VFAsâ€™ content, the high operating costs of the suggested techniques limit their wide application for VFA recovery. Unless the large amount of water in the feed is efficiently removed, an operating cost reduction is infeasible with any of the existing recovery techniques. However, a solvent of low water solubility, capable of efficiently and selectively dissolving the VFAs, would allow the removal of the large amounts of water present in the feed at low operating cost.
