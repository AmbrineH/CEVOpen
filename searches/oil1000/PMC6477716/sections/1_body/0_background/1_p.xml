<p id="Par14" class="p">Bio-waste, municipal waste, and animal waste are good sources of bioenergy due to their abundance and cost, as well as to their sustainability and environmental benefits. Anaerobic fermentation for biomethane production has been widely used as a practical way for their disposal, and many urban processing plants are currently operated to deliver this methane as heating fuel. When the methane-producing process, methanogenesis, is separately operated from the short-chain-organic-acids producing process, acidogenesis, better control, and efficiency improvements of the whole anaerobic fermentation process are possible [
