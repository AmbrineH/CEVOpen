<p id="Par17" class="p">In this work, new solvents were studied for VFAs’ extraction from the fermentation-produced diluted water solution. The process of VFAs extraction, solvent recovery, and product purification was designed for high acid recovery and low-energy demand. The recovery performance, economic evaluation, and lifecycle assessment of the proposed process were studied and compared to other bio-based-products’ recovery processes.</p>
