<p id="Par30" class="p">The proposed process was composed of extraction and distillation. Environmental impact of the extractor was given only by solvent loss, because no energy was consumed there. On the other hand, environmental impact of the distillation was caused from solvent recovery and product purification by distillation consuming energy. In the proposed process, four eco-scores were calculated using unit scores suggested in the references of distillation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. The eco-indicator (EI99) of a material or process indicates its environmental impact based on all emissions and resource uses in terms of damage to human health, ecosystem quality, and resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. The cumulative energy demand (CED) calculates the primary energy demand for the generation of steam in distillation column [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. The best scenario in energy duty was based on continuous distillation using waste heat recovery and the worst case on batch distillation using boiler steam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Solvent production using energy of waste-solvent incineration was the best scenario in solvent loss, and the worst was using average European steam generation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. The LCA of this study counted heat duty and solvent loss.
