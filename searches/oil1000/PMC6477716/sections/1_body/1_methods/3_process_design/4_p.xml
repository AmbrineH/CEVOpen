<p id="Par27" class="p">The feed VFAs’ composition is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and, for the distillation columns design, the VFAs and solvents normal boiling points are also given in the table. Because of the wide distribution of VFAs in the feed, no single solvent extracted all the components at the same time. As explained above, two solvents were used: nonyl acetate for mainly high-carbon-number VFAs and hexyl acetate for acetic and propionic acids. The purification of high-carbon-number VFAs was simple and only one distillation column was needed for the purpose. In contrast, the strong interaction between acetic acid and water required an additional azeotropic distillation process to separate the relatively small amount of water and the solvent recycle. Apart from that difference, the VFAs’ separation processes with the two different solvents were identically designed.
