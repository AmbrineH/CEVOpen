<p id="Par25" class="p">Extractor design is simpler for an atmospheric pressure operation, because only one design parameter is required: number of trays. The number was selected, and equilibrium calculations gave the solution of the material and heat balances. The extraction liquid–liquid equilibrium computations used the NRTL model. Because no vapor phase was present in the equilibrium calculation, the operating pressure of the extraction column did not affect the liquid–liquid equilibrium, which simplified the column design. The binary parameters used in the NRTL model were taken mostly from the built-in HYSYS database: those unavailable in the database were estimated with the UNIFAC group contribution method. The experimental measurements of the liquid–liquid equilibrium in water/acetic acid/hexyl acetate were reported in Ref. [
