<p id="Par24" class="p">The studied extraction process was a conventional extractive separation: extraction and solvent recovery. Due to the large amount of water in the feed, the extract contained a small amount of water together with the extracted VFAs and the solvent. The solvent was separated from the VFAs and recycled to the extractor. As mentioned before, two solvents were employed, in two identical processes of extraction, solvent recovery and product purification. The commercial process-design software HYSYS (version 7.2) was used in the design [
