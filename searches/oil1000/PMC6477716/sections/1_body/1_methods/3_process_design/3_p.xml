<p id="Par26" class="p">In contrast, distillation column design requires one more design variable to adjust the product specification. The distillation column design for acetic acid separation had an additional restriction on the column profile: the distribution of the liquid compositions in the column trays could not cross the distillation boundaries, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, b. The distillation lines are determined by the liquid flow rate in the tray, and the tray profile must follow one of the lines. The separated distillation boundaries and the shape of the distillation lines restrict the free selection of liquid flow and number of trays. The process design was iteratively computed until the products satisfied the desired design targets of VFA recovery and wastewater quality.
