<p id="Par20" class="p">Many experimental results with extraction solvents have been reported, and computer-aided solvent-seeking tools, such as CAMD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] and COSMO-RS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], have been developed to utilize the databases compiled with those results. A few studies have focused on how to design ionic-liquid solvents based on the solute molecular structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. For our design, the extraction selectivities of the solvents were determined from their activity coefficients in infinitely dilute solutions, predicted by the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) model using the UNIQUAC Functional-Group Activity Coefficients (UNIFAC) parameters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. The UNIFAC parameters are estimated from the functional groups in the molecule [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>].
