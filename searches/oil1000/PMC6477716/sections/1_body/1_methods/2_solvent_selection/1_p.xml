<p id="Par19" class="p">Although extraction is efficient and, unlike distillation, does not consume much energy, its application is limited to having the proper solvent. Berg categorized extraction solvents in five groups by the strength of their affinity towards water and oxygen for hydrogen bonding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Basically, extraction requires mass transfer in two liquid phases with different distribution of the solute between the phases. Water and organic liquids, mostly water immiscible, provide a heterogeneous liquid that settles into two distinct liquid phases, allowing their easy separation. Finding the proper solvent has been a hurdle for a wider application of this efficient, no-energy-requiring, separation process.
