 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Being derived from fatty acids, their molecular similarity supports their selection as solvents for VFAs’ extraction. When the solvent is recovered from the VFA extract, for recycling, it is separated by distillation and some difference in their boiling points facilitates this processing. When the solvent was recovered from the VFA extract for recycling, it was separated by distillation and ˃ 20 °C difference in boiling points was preferred for easy separation. The large amount of water in the extraction feed means that the amount of solvent to be removed is much larger than that of the VFAs, which content is generally less than 2%. High-boiling-point solvents need elevated temperatures at the bottom of the distillation column, requiring high-pressure steam consumption. However, the vapor flow rate in the distillation column is significantly lower than for a low-boiling-point solvent. Especially, the vapor flow in the rectifying section of the column is minimal. The high-boiling solvent consumes less energy and the heat recovered by the cooling of the solvent recycle provides enough heat for preheating the feed to the solvent-recovery column. The recovered heat from the condenser of a low-boiling solvent is at low temperature and, thus, not suitable for use in feed preheating.
