<p id="Par23" class="p">Considering these two aspects, molecular similarity and high-boiling point, two solvents were selected for this study: nonyl acetate for high-carbon-number VFAs and hexyl acetate for low-carbon-number VFAs. A feed containing all fatty acids between acetic acid and caproic acid could not be extracted with a single solvent. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows how the solutes and solvents are similar in their chemical structures, comparing propionic acid to hexyl acetate and caproic acid to nonyl acetate. Although the lengths of the molecular chains are different, the constituent atoms are alike between solvents and solutes.
