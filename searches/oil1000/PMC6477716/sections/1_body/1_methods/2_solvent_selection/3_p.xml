 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Molecular simulation finds the location of the molecules in a cell, such that the sum of the potentials between solute and solvent atoms is the lowest, namely at equilibrium. When the chemical structures of solute and solvent are similar, their intermolecular potential decreases, resulting in more aggregation. As examples, in a study of protein interactions, the similarity increased the molecular interaction tendency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>], and a molecular simulation result showed that the aggregation of molecules was improved by molecular similarity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. In various previous reports, including bio-products separation, the similarity between solutes and solvents has been studied (TableÂ
