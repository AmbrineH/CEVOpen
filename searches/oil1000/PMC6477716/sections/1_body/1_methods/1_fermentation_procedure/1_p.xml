<p id="Par18" class="p">The raw material for VFAs’ recovery was the fermentation product of a diluted alginate solution. Brown alginate (25 g) was dried, ground, and placed in a 500 mL reactor with 225 mL of 3% sulfuric acid solution, and maintained at 120 °C for 250 min [

Anaerobic fermentation was carried out for 15.5 days with microorganisms obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Busan, Korea, under the conditions listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1). The VFA composition was determined by gas chromatography (Model GC-17A, Shimadzu, Japan,) using a capillary column (50 m × 0.32 mm × 0.50 µm) and a flame-ionization detector. The VFA composition was not significantly different from other studies regarding VFA fermentation, mostly ˂ 1%. The product composition of the other studies is summarized in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2. The fatty acid production rate depended on the fermentation microorganism. As listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2, the fermentation feed also affected VFA production, and the production rates among different fatty acids were largely influenced by the microorganism. High microorganism productivity improved economic feasibility of the VFA recovery process.
