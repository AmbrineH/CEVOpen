<p id="Par28" class="p">Recovery of VFAs is essential in their production from fermented product, because their total content in feed is very low and the recovery strongly affects the production cost of VFAs. The recovery is the ratio of a component amount in product to that in feed. There were separation techniques having different recovery according to carbon numbers in fatty acids. Solvent extraction and membrane separation showed that the higher the carbon number was, the more recovery was yielded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Therefore, a solvent or a system of solvents is necessary to recover at high rates for all fatty acids in feed. Economic feasibility of the proposed process in commercial application was evaluated with utility cost and solvent loss. The previous studies of VFAs’ production indicated that the separation and purification of the VFAs costed 60–80% of production cost [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, a lot of new separation techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>] have applied to the VFAs processes, but their operating cost was not low enough to be economical in practical processes.
