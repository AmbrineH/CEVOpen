<p id="Par29" class="p">Various combinations of pretreatment and fermentation condition produced a large distribution of VFAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. The biomass pretreatment enhanced the abundance of a certain class of microorganism during fermentation, which resulted in a specific distribution of VFAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Considering usage and market price of the acids, one can select a proper microorganism and fermentation condition for the most profitable process. The distribution and amount of VFAs were different due to fermentation microorganism, but the proposed process was modified by adjusting solvent amount for different feed. The process was designed for the recovery of all components between C2 and C6 fatty acids.
