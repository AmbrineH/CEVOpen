<p id="Par45" class="p">A new VFAsâ€™ separation-from-fermented-product process was proposed for less energy consumption. Two solvents were selected after considering chemical structure similarity, between VFAs and solvents, and boiling points. The proposed extraction, solvent recovery, and product purification processes gave 99% recovery and 99.5% product purity with 10% less investment and 62% reduced utilities cost compared to a similar process of fermented fatty acid production. Life cycle assessment indicated 70% less eco-scores than comparable bio-product processes.</p>
