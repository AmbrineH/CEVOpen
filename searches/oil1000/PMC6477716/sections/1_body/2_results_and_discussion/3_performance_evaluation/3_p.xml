<p id="Par38" class="p">Medium-chain fatty acids were fermented from wastewater, with products including C2–9 fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. These acids were produced by fermentation of acetic acid and ethanol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Household bio-waste was fermented to yield C2–8 fatty acids in total amounts between 8 and 31.5 g/L [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. The produced fatty acids were extracted using bio-diesel at a recovery of 90 and 95% for heptanoic and octanoic acids, respectively. These extracts were separated by distillation.
