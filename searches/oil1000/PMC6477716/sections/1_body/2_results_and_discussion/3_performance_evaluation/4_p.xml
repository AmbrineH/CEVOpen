<p id="Par39" class="p">Large-scale algae fermentation was conducted with a 300 L reactor at the author’s lab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Various conditions of fermentation resulted in wide ranges of distribution of C2–6 fatty acids, of which a similar condition to this study yielded 3.0 g/L, 1.15 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 0.5 g/L, and 0.3 g/L of acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and caproic acids, respectively. Though the VFAs amount was less than this study, their distribution was similar to the feed of the proposed process. As listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2, a 100 L reactor with kitchen waste produced another similar distribution of VFAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. When the feed composition is different from this study for the up-scaling process, the amount of solvents is adjusted to maintain VFAs’ recovery with the same arrangement of extractor and distillation columns to the proposed process. There were other separation techniques having different recovery according to carbon numbers in fatty acids. Solvent extraction and membrane separation showed that the higher the carbon number was, the more recovery was yielded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The recovery in the solvent extraction was 61–98% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, the recovery of this study was nearly complete with all the carbon numbers; 98% for acetic acid, 99% for propionic acid, and 100% for others.
