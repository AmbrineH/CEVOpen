 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. Separation by the direct distillation of the fermented product requires a large amount of energy due to the low VFAs’ content in water, generally 1–2%. The performance of the extraction and distillation process for the bio-product separation is determined by the solvent used in the extraction. The energy demand with the esters used in this study was compared with that of other solvents applied for bio-products and fatty acid separation, as listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The energy use in this study is only 34% of the lowest case use among various processes of either distillation-only or combined extraction–distillation. This significant reduction of energy demand by the proposed separation process is due to the solvents selected for this study. They separated almost all the water in the feed at the extraction stage, consuming no energy, so that only solvent recovery demanded energy. However, the solvent amounts used in our extraction were much lower than those used in other processes with high solvent-to-feed ratios of 5–8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Another source of energy savings was the high-boiling point of the solvents, which limited the energy-consuming vapor flow in the rectifying section of the solvent-recovery columns. Energy demand in distillation of very low content aqueous solutions depends on the amount of feed, because the thermal properties (heat of vaporization and boiling point) are close to those of water. When comparing separation performance, identical feed and product conditions are necessary for the suggested processes.
