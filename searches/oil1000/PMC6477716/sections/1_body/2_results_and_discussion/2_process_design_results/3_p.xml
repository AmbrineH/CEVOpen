 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Loss of nonyl acetate was not significant, because the small loss (0.3 kg/h) was recovered as product III at a rate of 0.2 kg/h. Loss of hexyl acetate was due to dissolution in the wastewater at a rate of 3.1 kg/h. When the wastewater, which flowed at approximately 10 ton/h, was extracted with cyclohexane at a rate of 250 kg/h, all dissolved hexyl acetate was recovered with the less expensive solvent at an overall loss rate of 5.3 kg/h. Provided that the wastewater containing hexyl acetate is recycled for fermentation in the next batch, the loss would be recovered and no make-up necessary.
