<p id="Par35" class="p">The in situ product recovery (ISPR) of VFA has been reported to increase the fermentation capacity and efficiency. The fermentation broth was circulated throughout the hollow-fiber membrane extractor, and the VFAs were recovered with an extractant and oleyl alcohol. The extracted VFAs were stripped with NaOH solution using the other hollow-fiber membrane recovery unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>], and the extracted acid was recovered by distillation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. When an appropriate solvent is used in the conventional extractor, complicated extraction equipment, including hollow-fiber membrane extractors, is not necessary. For grain or bio-waste feed, the fermentation broth containing fine solid particles necessitates the use of hollow-fiber membranes, as the particles cause clogging of pores. Because no acute toxicity has been reported for the proposed solvents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>], they were determined to be benign toward the fermentation microorganisms. Their ISPR application is feasible using a common extractor instead of a hollow-fiber membrane extractor, and the recovery and purity of the produced VFAs are higher than those of the current ISPR processes.
