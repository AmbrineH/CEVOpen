<p id="Par32" class="p">Because of the large differences in carbon numbers among the fatty acids to be separated, one solvent could not extract all the acids in the feed. Basically, two similar processes of extraction, solvent recovery, and product purification were implemented. However, the second process, separating mostly acetic acid, had a much more complicated purification process due to the high affinity between acetic acid and water, which required more distillation columns, including azeotropic distillation, and consumed more energy. A brief process flow diagram (PFD) describing the two processes of extraction, solvent recovery, and purification is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The numbers in the column indicate tray numbers counted from the top. The first column at top row is an extraction column with top feed inlet and bottom solvent inlet. A summary of the feed and solvent flow rates is shown in the PFD, and detailed flow rates of the constituent components are presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Tables S4 and S5. The structural information and operating conditions of the columns are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. All the water in the feed, except for a rate of 1.7 kg/h, was separated in extractor I and fed to the second extractor. The unseparated water was recycled from the distillation column process producing product I to the top of the first extractor. The middle distillation column at the top row of the PFD is a solvent-recovery column that separated the solvent as a bottom product and recycled it to the bottom of the first extractor. The last column separates recycled water and product I.
