<p id="Par33" class="p">Because nonyl acetate did not extract most of the acetic acid, more than ten times the amount of hexyl acetate was used at the second extractor, at similar stream flows. Because of the high affinity between acetic acid and water it carried out more water when the acids were extracted. The large amount of water removed most of the solvent from the extract and formed two liquid phases. Therefore, the extract distillation had to be an azeotropic separation, as shown by the second and third columns in the middle row of the PFD. The middle decanter, between the columns, separated organic and aqueous phases, after condensing their overhead vapors. All the water products were recycled to the extractor, as in the first section of the process. The bottom product from the first azeotropic column, containing product and solvent, was processed in two distillation columns as at the first section of the process. Because of a small amount of nonyl acetate carried from the first section, the last distillation column has three products, with recycle solvent as a side product. The difficulty of acetic acid solvent extraction was also observed with MTBE; the difficulty was lesser with propionic acid and the least with butyric acid [
