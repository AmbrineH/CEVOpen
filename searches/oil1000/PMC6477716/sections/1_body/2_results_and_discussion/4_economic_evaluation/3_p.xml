<p id="Par42" class="p">The proposed process was designed for the recovery of all components between C2 and C6 fatty acids, and it required $0.53/kg fatty acids as utility cost of separation and purification. The utility cost of separation and purification accounts 60% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] to 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] of whole production cost of acids. Considering mixed acid price of $2.70/kg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] and solvent loss equivalent to 3% of product amount, the utility cost is low enough to apply the proposed scheme to up-scaling processes.
