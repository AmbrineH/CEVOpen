<p id="Par41" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> tabulates the investment and utility costs with equipment names separated in two groups, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Because of the high affinity between water and acetic acid, the second section required more investment cost and more than nine times the utilities costs as compared with the first section, separating high-carbon-number fatty acids. For cost comparison, a similar process for 10,000 ton/year butyric acid production process was used, with investment cost of 8.47 million US dollars, and annual utilities cost of 13.5 million US dollars, at 2014 prices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. The costs were only calculated for butyric acid recovery. For investment-cost production-capacity adjustment, an equipment scaling-up exponent of 0.68 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>] was used. The listed costs in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> indicate that our proposed process required 10% less investment and had 62% less utilities cost than the fermented butyric acid process.
