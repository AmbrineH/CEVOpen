 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> summarizes the assessment results in four different scores, in the best and worst scenarios. Compared to various bio-products and fatty acid processes, the proposed VFAs’ process gets 70% lower eco-scores. Life cycle assessment was limited to the recovery process operation, but it could be significantly improved when the VFA source became from harvested bio-feed to bio-waste. Further development of VFA recovery processes can help to change discarded bio-waste to eco-friendly resource.
