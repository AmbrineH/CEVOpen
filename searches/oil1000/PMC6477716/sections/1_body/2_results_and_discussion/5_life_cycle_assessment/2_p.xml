<p id="Par44" class="p">In soybean bio-diesel production, various sustainability indicators were calculated, and their importance of severity in environmental impacts was rated. Oil extraction and purification had fifth significant impact among various processes of the bio-diesel production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Bio-diesel production from algae was analyzed for LCA, and extraction was responsible to 72% of total environmental impact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. In the production of bio-diesel derived from fatty oil, the global warming potential (GWP) was 2.04 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-eq/kg oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>], while that of VFA in the best scenario was 6.5 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-eq/kg VFA. The numbers in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> were of 1 kg feed basis, and 1 ton feed produced 9.66 kg VFAs. Considering low feed content in the fermented product, the difference was expected. The cumulative energy demand (CED) of this study was 36.2 MJ-eq/kg VFA, but that of the bio-diesel was 80.9 MJ-eq/kg oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Note that bio-diesel production includes biomass cultivation. The eco-indicator 99 in bio-diesel was 0.045 points/kg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>], and that of VFA was 0.103 points. Though the bio-diesel production included various other processes, such as agricultural cultivation, its feed had higher content of raw material than VFAs of fermented product. The eco-score UBP-06 of bio-diesel was 5005 points/kg, in which fatty oil cultivation took around a half [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>], and therefore, 2950 points/kg VFA of this study was comparable to the bio-diesel.
