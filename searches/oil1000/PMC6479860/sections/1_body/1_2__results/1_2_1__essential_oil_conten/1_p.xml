<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01315-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the studied plant samples were characterized mostly with similar EO yields. Populations “B” (1.03 ± 0.003%) and “BM” (0.78 ± 0.017%) contained the highest and lowest amount of EO, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01315-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). As the plant sample “B” was cultivated in the university’s garden and it was regularly irrigated, the highest EO content can be predicted.
