<p class="p">PCA is a mathematical procedure that transforms several correlated variables into various uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). PC1, PC2, and PC3 showed the highest variation of phytochemicals among the studied populations. PC1 explained 41.57% of total variation and had a positive correlation with α-bisabolol oxide A, (

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-spiroether, and negative correlation with (

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-γ-bisabolene. The second PC (PC2), with 24.98% of variance, demonstrated positive correlation with chamazulene, α-bisabolol oxide B, α-bisabolone oxide A and the EO content. Furthermore, PC3 represented positive correlation in the case of apigenin and luteolin, which accounted for 12.02% of the total variance (
