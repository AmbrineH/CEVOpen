<p class="p">To characterize and identify the different chemotypes of Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> populations, their EO compositions and main flavonoids (apigenin and luteolin) were submitted to cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01315-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the dendrograms allowed separating the 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> populations into three main groups, each representing a distinct chemotype.
