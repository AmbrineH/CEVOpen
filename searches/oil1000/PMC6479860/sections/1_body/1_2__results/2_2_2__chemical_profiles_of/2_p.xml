<p class="p">The cultivated sample “B” was rich in α-bisabolol oxide B (21.88%) and chamazulene (19.22%), while the percentages of these compounds were lower under the wild growth conditions. The blue colour of EOs in all samples except “S” represented their chamazulene contents, whereas, “S” due to lack of this compound showed a yellowish green colour. Accordingly, oxygenated sesquiterpenes (53.31–74.52%) were the predominant chemical group of EO constituents in all studied samples, excluding “S”, which was rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
