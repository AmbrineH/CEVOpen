<p class="p">Twenty μL of each extract (1 mg/mL) was separately injected into an analytical high-performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC) (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) by using an end capped Eurospher II 100-5 C18, Vertex Plus Column (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) (250 × 4.6 mm with precolumn) with particle size: 5 µm, pore size: 100 Å and temperature 30 °C; coupled to UV detector (Knauer GmbH-Smartline 2600, Berlin, Germany) at a wavelength range 190 to 500 nm (quantification at 330 nm), while MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O was applied as the mobile phase with a gradient system, increasing MeOH from 30% to 70% within 40 min, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min, at ambient temperature. Analysis was performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
