<p class="p">To extract the EOs, 60 g of each powdered sample was individually subjected to Clevenger apparatus (hydro-distillation method) for 3 h. The obtained EOs were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in refrigerator at 4 °C until analysis. Yields of extracted EOs were calculated by Equation (1):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">EO% = (EOs weight)/(dried plants weight) × 100
