<p class="p">Analysis of the samples was carried out using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a 5977B mass spectrometry detector. The GC instrument was equipped with a split inlet, working in a split ratio of 100:1 mode with a 30 m × 0.25 mm HP-5MS capillary column with a 0.25 μm film thickness and 0.25 μm particle size (temperature range: −60 to +320/340 °C). The injection port temperature was 250 °C. The oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 1 min and then programmed from 60 °C to 250 °C at 5 °C/min; then, the temperature was kept at 250 °C for 2 min. Helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and inlet pressure 35.3 kPa. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV, and the inert ion source (HES EI) temperature was set to 350 °C; the temperature of the quadrupole was set at 150 °C, while the MS interface was set to 250 °C. A scan rate of 0.6 s (cycle time: 0.2 s) was applied, covering a mass range from 35 to 600 amu.</p>
