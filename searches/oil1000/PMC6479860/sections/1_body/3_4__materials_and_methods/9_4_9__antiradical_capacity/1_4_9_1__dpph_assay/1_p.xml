<p class="p">Free radical scavenging activity of the plant extracts was assessed by DPPH assay [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The measurement was carried out on 96-well microtiter plates. In brief, Microdilution series of samples (1 mg/mL, dissolved in MeOH) were prepared starting with 150 µL. To gain 200 µL of sample, 50 µL of DPPH reagent (100 µM) was added to each sample. The microplate was stored at room temperature under dark conditions. The absorbance was measured after 30 min at 550 nm using the microplate reader. MeOH (HPLC grade) and ascorbic acid (0.01 mg/mL) were used as a blank control and standard, respectively. Antiradical activity was calculated using the following Equation (2):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">I% = [(A
  <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>/A
  <sub class="sub">0</sub>) × 100]
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the standard sample. Anti-radical activity of the samples was expressed as EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (concentration of the compounds that caused 50% inhibition). EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (µg/mL) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software version 6.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Each sample was measured in triplicate.
