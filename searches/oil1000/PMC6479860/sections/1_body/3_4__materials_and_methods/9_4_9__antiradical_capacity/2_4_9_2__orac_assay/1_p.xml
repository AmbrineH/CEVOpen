<p class="p">Twelve extracts were subjected to ORAC assay [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] with slight modifications. Microtiter plates (96-well) were used for measurement of the samples. Briefly, 20 µL of extracts (0.01 mg/mL) was mixed with 60 µL of AAPH (peroxyl free radical generator) (12 mM) and 120 µL of fluorescein solution (70 mM). Then, the fluorescence was measured for 3 h at 1.5-min cycle intervals with the microplate reader. The standard Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> was used. Activity of all samples was compared with rutin and EGCG as positive controls. Antioxidant capacities were reported as μmol TE (Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> equivalents)/g of dry matter.
