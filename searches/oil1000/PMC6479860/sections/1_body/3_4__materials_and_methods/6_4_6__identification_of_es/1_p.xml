<p class="p">Most of the compounds were identified using two different analytical approaches: (a) comparison of Kovats indices of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>â€“C
 <sub class="sub">24</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and (b) comparison of mass spectra (using authentic chemicals and Wiley spectral library collection). Identification was considered tentative when based on mass spectral data alone. In GC-FID and GC-MS, data acquisition and analysis were performed using Chrom-card
