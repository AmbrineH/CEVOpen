<p class="p">In the case of GC-FID analysis, the EOs were analyzed by Shimadzu GC-17A (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an FID detector and SGE™ BP5 capillary column (Trajan Scientific and Medical, Victoria, Australia) (30 m × 0.25 mm column with a 0.25 μm film thickness). The split mode in GC was a ratio of 1:100. Injector and FID detector temperatures were set at 280 and 300 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 1 min and then raised to 250 °C at 5.0 °C/min and held for 2 min, while the ambient oven temperature range was +4 to +450 °C. Helium gas was used at a flow rate of 1 mL/min as a carrier gas.</p>
