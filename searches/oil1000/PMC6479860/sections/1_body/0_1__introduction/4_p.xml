<p class="p">In the present study, EO compositions of twelve Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> populations collected from diverse regions were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. Since the main radical scavengers are phenolics, flavonoids being the major group within phenolics [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], by utilizing analytical HPLC. Antiradical capacities of the extracts with DPPH and ORAC assays were also compared. In order to make comparison, the plants were harvested at the same flourishing period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these populations.
