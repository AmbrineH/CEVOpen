<p class="p">In the literature, α-bisabolone oxide A was previously identified from 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> by different groups; for instance, the EO, diethyl ether and dichloromethane fractions of EO contained α-bisabolone oxide A, with 47.7, 57.7 and 50.5%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]; whereas the EO of an Estonian 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> sample was characterized by high bisabolone oxide A content (13.9%) [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This compound was the major EO constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> grown in Italy (9.2–11.2%) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], Iran (53.45%) [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The evaluation of the daily α-bisabolol oxide A content in 
 <italic class="italic">M. chamomilla</italic> EO revealed that the highest amount can be between 16:00–18:00 (55.41%) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Moreover, this aromatic phytoconstituent was isolated with three extraction methods (7.9, 42.3 and 50.5%) in EO of the species [
