<p class="p">In accordance with our findings, oxygenated sesquiterpenes (53.31–74.52%) are the most dominant EO compounds of the selected 
 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L. samples, which corroborates previous reports. The wild populations were significantly different compared with the cultivated sample (Bodgold) in EO composition. α-Bisabolone oxide A was mostly the major EO constituent in the populations.
