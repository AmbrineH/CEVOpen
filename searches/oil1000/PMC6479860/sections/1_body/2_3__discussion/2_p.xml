<p class="p">The abiotic factors (e.g., moisture, topography, temperature, and edaphic factors) highly impact the phytoconstituents variation, and/or biotic factors remarkably influenced the terpene biosynthesis pathways and chemotype profiles [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, the role of other ecological effects such as climatic factors (e.g., humidity, wind, atmospheric gases, and light), physiographic factors (e.g., steepness and sunlight on vegetation and direction of slopes), edaphic factors (the soil attributes), and biotic factors (e.g., the existence of lianas, epiphytes, parasites etc.) may also be considerable in chemotype variations.
