<p class="p">In accordance with our findings, oxygenated sesquiterpenes are the most dominant EO compounds of the selected 
 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla</italic> samples. Almost all plant populations contained apigenin and luteolin. Since the plant sample “Sarableh” indicated the most potent capacity to scavenge free radicals and its apigenin and luteolin contents were insignificant, its activity undoubtedly refers to the presence of other polyphenolic compounds. Due to high amounts of apigenin and luteolin, populations “Lali” and “Bagh Malek” can be considered as a rich source of these compounds. Our results confirm the effects of growth conditions on the quantity and quality of aromatic phytochemicals. More investigations are required to study the amounts of other polyphenolic compounds in diverse populations and the correlations between secondary metabolite contents, bioactivities and ecological effects.
