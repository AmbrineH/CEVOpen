<p class="p">However, many significant studies demonstrated that allelopathy possesses promising potential for use in agricultural production for economical and environmentally friendly weed management in agricultural systems. When developing new herbicides based on allelochemicals, extensive field trials are required to study various aspects of interaction thereof both with physicochemical properties of soil and soil microorganisms. Studies on the allelochemicals biosynthesis were started only recently, and it is necessary to expand work in this direction, as well as on transport and mode of action that could be used in future for improving allelopathic potential of trees using modern plant breeding techniques. For instance, little is known about production, storage, and movement of the ailanthone in the

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and we are unaware of any publications on the ailanthone biosynthesis genes. In addition, there are prospects in using plant residues of allelopathic trees as a mulch, as well as combined herbicides (at reduced rates), and allelopathic extracts. Although many allelochemicals were identified, only a few bioherbicides based on them were commercialized, which requires intensifying research on their chemical modification in order to improve their properties. The growing interest to environmental protection and organic agriculture in the world will contribute to the development of new pesticides based on natural allelochemicals.
