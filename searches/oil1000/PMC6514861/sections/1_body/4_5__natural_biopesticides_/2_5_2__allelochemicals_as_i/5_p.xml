 <xref rid="B329-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">329</xref>] has first synthesized novel amino alcohols and phosphoramidothionate derivatives from mimosine and evaluated their activity against termites. Mimosinol and deuterated mimosinol (D-mimosinol) had much higher (3040â€“ times) insecticidal activity than mimosine, which could be a result of tyrosinase inhibition, where as two phosphoramidothionate derivatives of mimosinol were up to 100 time more active than mimosine (comparable to the commercial insecticide rotenone), which may be attributed to the acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Such high activity makes mimosine derivatives potential candidate for novel bioinsecticides.
