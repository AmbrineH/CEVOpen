 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> is resistant to insect pests due to the high content of various secondary metabolites in its tissues. This was noticed a long time ago: for example, this plant has been used to control agricultural pest in China [

 <xref rid="B292-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">292</xref>] have shown that aqueous leaf extract demonstrated higher mortality compared aqueous root extracts, but the ailantone demonstrated highest aphid mortality. Thus, the insecticidal activity of ailanton is of interest for development of biopesticides.
