<p class="p">Allelochemicals that possess phytotoxicity in nature could act as potential natural bioherbicides. Compared to synthetic herbicides, they have several advantages: (1) they exhibit structural diversity and possess complex structures, (2) they are safe, as they quickly decompose, and (3) they have a different mode of action [

In addition, they might be used together with synthetic herbicides that could reduce probability of the herbicide resistance development in weeds and decrease dose of synthetic herbicides while maintaining the same efficiency [

From an ecological perspective, secondary metabolic compounds can be considered as chemical weapons to ward off predators and competitors for limited resources and contribute to explaining the ecological impact of their hosts (for instance,
