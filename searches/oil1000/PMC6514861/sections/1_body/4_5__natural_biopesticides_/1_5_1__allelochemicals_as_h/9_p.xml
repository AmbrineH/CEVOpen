<p class="p">Both of the above-described herbicides are based on allelochemicals from woody plants and were obtained by modifying them: cinmethylin—by reducing volatility of the 1,4-cineole and mesotrione—by increasing the leptospermone activity. In order to reduce volatility, but preserving or increasing phytotoxicity of 1,8-cineole, the most common component of the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil, its hydroxy and ester derivatives were obtained [
 <xref rid="B305-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">305</xref>]. Laboratory pre-emergence bioassays demonstrated that these substances inhibited germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium rigidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic>. The increased lipophilicity of the carboxylic acid portion of cineole ester derivatives did not affect the herbicidal activity, and they could be considered as environmentally acceptable herbicides [
 <xref rid="B305-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">305</xref>]. Additional experiments showed that reduced root and shoot growth effect of cineole derivatives were due to post-emergence activity rather than delayed germination [
 <xref rid="B306-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">306</xref>]. Phytotoxicity of ester derivatives may be due to metabolic cleavage of esters to hydroxy cineole and carboxylic acid within the plant [
 <xref rid="B306-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">306</xref>]. There is also another study that demonstrated herbicidal activity of propionate derivatives of mimosine against growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica rapa</italic>, but they were less efficient than original mimosine [
 <xref rid="B204-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. Recently, Duran et al. [
 <xref rid="B307-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">307</xref>] evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-acyl and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-alkyl derivatives of juglone with different linear chain lengths on wheat, four target and four weed species. It was shownd that lipophilicity and functional group were responsible for their activity change. 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-acyl derivatives were more active when changes were introduced at positions 5 and 2 in the naphthoquinone scaffold. As a result, three prospective 5-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-acyl juglones were selected for the further development of bioherbicides [
 <xref rid="B307-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">307</xref>]. The ailanthone derivatives have long been studied in medicine [
 <xref rid="B308-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">308</xref>], but their herbicidal activity has not been reported. An important factor in enhancing the herbicidal activity of allelochemicals can be various additives. For instance, the addition of a wetting agent to the 
 <italic class="italic">Wollemia nobilis</italic> extract increased the suppression of 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium rigidum</italic> as much as a 4-fold increase in the extract concentration [
