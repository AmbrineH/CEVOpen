 <xref rid="B294-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">294</xref>]: (1) via crop rotation, (2) as ground cover species, (3) application of plant residue on surface (mulching) or deep in the soil (green manure), (4) application of allelopathic water extracts, and (5) as new natural bioherbicides formulated from allelochemicals. Due to the long duration of the woody plant cultivation, direct use of the first two methods for weed control is not feasable, and only the last three of them are applicable. The first step in search for potential bioherbicides candidates is to evaluate the phytotoxic activity of vegetable tissue extracts in a laboratory.
