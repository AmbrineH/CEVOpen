<p class="p">Leptospermone (1-hydroxy-2-isovaloryl-4,4,6,6-tetramethyl cyclohexen-3,5-dione, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f017" class="xref">Figure 17</xref>) isolated from one of the plants of the 
 <italic class="italic">Myrtaceae</italic> family, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon citrinus</italic> Curtis, is another allelochemical used as a herbicide. It is a natural triketone inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) enzyme that leads to disruption in carotenoid biosynthesis and loss of chlorophyll [
 <xref rid="B300-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">300</xref>]. This was the most recently discovered and introduced new herbicidal mode of action for commercial herbicides [
 <xref rid="B301-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">301</xref>]. Since pure leptospermone was used at very high concentrations (9000 g/ha), it was used as the basis for synthetizing an analogue, mesotrione (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f018" class="xref">Figure 18</xref>), which was becoming efficient at 75â€“225 g/ha concentrations [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], as well as sulcotrione and tembotrione (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f019" class="xref">Figure 19</xref>). Mesotrione sold by Syngenta AG under the Callisto brand is used as a pre- and post-emergence herbicide in corn cultivation [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>]. No weeds have evolved resistance to HPPD inhibitors yet, but transgenic plants with resistance to this herbicide were generated [
 <xref rid="B302-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>]. Later, it was also discovered that large quantities of leptospermone are contained in the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Leptospermum scoparium</italic> J.R., G. Forst, allelopathic and invasive shrub originating from Australia and New Zealand [
 <xref rid="B303-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">303</xref>]. McCoy et al. [
 <xref rid="B267-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">267</xref>] suggested that juglone is a prime candidate for developing a novel bioherbicide, because its mode of action appeared to be distinct from that of any existing synthetic commercial herbicides.
