However, the problem lies in the fast evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds and threats to environment, human, and animal health. In addition, organic agriculture being a prominent direction and becoming increasingly popular lately does not generally imply the use of synthetic pesticides, including herbicides; and that is why weed control still remains rather problematic. Thus, development of new and safer herbicides for both traditional and organic agriculture is still remaining an important task nowadays. However, commercial herbicides have only approximately 20 modes of action, and no new modes of action were introduced in over 25 years [
