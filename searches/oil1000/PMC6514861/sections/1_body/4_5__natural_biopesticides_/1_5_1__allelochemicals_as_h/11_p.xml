<p class="p">The cost of raw materials for the production of active ingredients of herbicides should be relatively cheap, and this requirement is well met by the components of the eucalyptus essential oils, which in addition to isolation from natural raw materials can be obtained by chemical synthesis. This synthesis is difficult for mimosine and ailantone, but they are contained in relatively large quantities in the biomass of fast-growing trees, from where they can be easily extracted. Since juglone is synthesized in the phylloquinone pathway, green algae, cyanobacteria, or certain menaquinone-synthesizing bacteria can be used for its large-scale production [
