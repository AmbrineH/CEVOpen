<p class="p">Use of the plant residues of allelopathic plant species is especially prospective in organic farming. Mulch could limit the growth of weeds both due to physical characteristics (preventing exposure to light, reducing available moisture, etc.) and its allelopathic properties. Several invasive trees, e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic>, are especially appropriate plant species for using as potential source of mulch materials due to both their allelopathic properties and frequency in which they are removed following management activities [

Incorporation of plant residues into the soil as a bioherbicide green manure allows not only to fight weeds, but also ensures reduction of soil erosion and amelioration of soil physical properties, increases of soil organic matter and nutrient retention, thus reducing dependence on mineral fertilizers [
 <xref rid="B310-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">310</xref>]. At the same time, studies have shown that the litter of such allelopathic species as 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia holosericea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B311-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">311</xref>], Chinese fir ([
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus saligna</italic> [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] prevented the growth of the understorey species physically, and not chemically. It is possible that the litter, accumulated and slowly decomposed (especially in conifer species), is responsible for reduced natural forest regeneration.
