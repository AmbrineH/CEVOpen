In 1996, the International Allelopathy Society recommended the following, more wide definition of allelopathy: “any process involving the secondary metabolites produced by plants, microorganisms, viruses, and fungi that influence the growth and development of agricultural and biological system (excluding animals), including positive and negative effects” [

Allelopathy plays a significant role in forest ecosystems for the following reasons: (1) trees release allelochemicals for long periods, and they may accumulate in soil to toxic levels, (2) one or only a few species dominate in the forest plantations, (3) allelochemicals affect the understory, and for some species they can affect the undergrowth, and in some cases can even cause problems in natural regeneration, and (4) introduced highly productive exotic trees may increase accumulation of allelochemicals in soil due to the inability of the local microflora to degrade them [
