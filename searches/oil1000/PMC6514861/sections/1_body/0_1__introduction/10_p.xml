<p class="p">Plants are responding dynamically to changes in the environment through rapid induction and reversal of secondary metabolite production [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Terpenoids and phenolics in leaves and terpenoids in emissions are the secondary metabolites of forest trees most frequently studied in the context of their response to climate change [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The main changes are temperature increase and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content. Studies have shown that higher concentration of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases phenolics in foliage and in emissions, while warming has the opposite effect. In addition, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> together with warming increased phenolics in foliage, but reduced phenolics in woody tissues [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. It should be taken into account that climate change can also lead to changes in allelopathic activity. This fact is especially important for woody plants that have been cultivated in the same place for many years.
