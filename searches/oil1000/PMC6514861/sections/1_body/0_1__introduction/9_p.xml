<p class="p">Plants can vary significantly in their sensitivity to the same type of phytotoxin. It has been shown that herbaceous species in the 
 <italic class="italic">Ericaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aquifoliaceae</italic> families are very sensitive to the black walnut, while the members of 
 <italic class="italic">Liliaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Malvacea</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Taxaceae</italic> are highly tolerant, but the mechanism of tolerance to juglone is currently unknown [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The mechanism of this stability is unknown, but Orcutt and Nilsen [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] suggested the following protection options: (1) uptake reduction of allelochemicals at the surface of root, (2) compartmentalization of allelochemicals away from molecular target sites, and (3) detoxification of allelochemicals. It is known that plants that have been growing for a long time near the allelopathic species usually have a certain resistance. The study of these plants will help to understand the mechanisms of their protection.
