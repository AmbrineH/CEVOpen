<p class="p">Allelochemicals are the products of secondary metabolism and have no nutritional value. According to the different structures and properties, allelochemicals can be classified into the 10 categories: (1) water-soluble organic acids, straight-chain alcohols, aliphatic aldehydes, and ketones; (2) simple unsaturated lactones; (3) long-chain fatty acids and polyacetylenes; (4) quinines (benzoquinone, anthraquinone, and complex quinines); (5) phenolics; (6) cinnamic acid and its derivatives; (7) coumarins; (8) flavonoids; (9) tannins; and (10) steroids and terpenoids (sesquiterpene lactones, diterpenes, and triterpenoids) [
