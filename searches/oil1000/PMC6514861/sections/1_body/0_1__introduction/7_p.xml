<p class="p">The effect of the treesâ€™ allelochemics can vary from inhibiting to stimulating, which should be taken into account while selecting combinations of agricultural crops and trees for agroforestry systems. Autotoxicity is a type of intraspecific allelopathy, when plants release toxic chemicals into environment that inhibit germination and growth of the same plant species [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Autotoxicity is observed in woody plants in both natural forests and manipulated ecosystems, such as plantations. The ecological significance of autotoxicity lies in regulating plant population size over space and time, avoiding intraspecific competition and extending seed dispersal [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Under stress conditions, sensitivity to allelochemicals increases, and, thus, reducing the population size and, therefore, providing more resources to survivor plants [
