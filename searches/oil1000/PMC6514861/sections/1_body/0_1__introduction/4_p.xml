<p class="p">For effective action, allelochemicals must reach a certain concentration. Their release is influenced by such environmental factors as temperature, duration and intensity of rainfall, type of soil and soil humidity [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Degradation by soil microorganisms also plays an important role in the accumulation of allelochemicals. Most allelochemicals are rapidly biodegraded in the soil, especially phenolics [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The term ‘‘phytotoxicity’’ was introduced to distinguish allelopathy (as interactions occurring in natural environment) from studies of plant extracts or allelochemicals (purified or synthetized) under controlled conditions [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The most common method for assessing phytotoxicity is the Petri dish bioassay of extracts (leachates) on seed germination and seedling growth. Such studies are usually carried out on model plants, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic>, because of their rapid germination and genetic homogeneity. It allows comparing the results among different studies [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Evaluation of plants in the soil, in the greenhouse, is rare and even less often in field conditions. Evaluation in natural conditions is especially important for the reason that allelochemicals mainly act through the soil. For a short period of time, a contact exposure through leachates during rain or dew may be possible. In some species, it may be conducted directly through volatile compounds. It was proved that some volatiles (e.g., terpenoids in the eucalypt species) can be dissolved and absorbed by soil [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. This is especially important for woody plants which grow and accumulate allelochemicals in soil for a long period of time.
