<p class="p">Various biological, chemical, and environmental factors can influence the allelochemical effectiveness for a particular species, such as: (1) specific plant toxins affect only particular species; (2) time or plant density required to reach toxic concentrations; (3) seasonal variation in toxicity; (4) synergistic effects of several allelochemicals; and (5) adsorption, leaching, and degradation in soils [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Coder and Warnell [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] described more than a hundred tree species with allelopathic activity. The strongest allelopathic effects were found in representatives of the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Juglans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> and some conifer species. Most examples of allelopathy in trees are associated with exotic species that are rapidly becoming dominant in new ecosystems, such as Tree of Heaven (
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus altissima</italic> (Mill.) Swingle), which is considered as one of the worst invasive plant species in Europe and also listed as an invasive plant in North America and many other countries [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. At the global level, the invasion of alien organisms is considered the second largest threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Nowadays, allelopathy is considered to be the most important factor influencing invasion and spread of exotic plants [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The ‘‘novel weapons hypothesis’’ [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] suggests that an introduced species may have strong allelopathic effects on neighbouring plant species in a novel environment, because native vegetation has not evolved resistance to unique allelochemicals produced by the invader. Rabotnov [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] hypothesized earlier that allelopathy is more significant between plants that have not co-evolved together for a long time. This hypothesis is especially important in forestry, because allelopathy could be one of the important factors influencing the successful introduction of tree species in new regions [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Some trees that belong to the widespread plantation species are also invasive, such as eucalypts. As a result, due to the large areas occupied by these trees and because of their dominance, the significance of allelopathy of woody plants can reach the level of ecosystems.
