<p class="p">Many toxic secondary metabolites are stored in the plants producing them in an inactive form, and juglone is no exception. In 1950, Daglish [
 <xref rid="B264-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">264</xref>] showed that walnut nuts contain juglone as glycoside of 1,4,5-trihydroxynaphtalene and not as α-hydrojuglone, as previously suggested. Later on, various species from the 
 <italic class="italic">Juglandaceae</italic> family showed that juglone accumulates in their tissues in its glycosylated form, hydrojuglone glucoside (HJG; 1,5-dihydroxy-4-naphthalenyl-β-D-gluco- pyranoside) to reduce its autotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B265-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">265</xref>]. The release of juglone from glycoside occurs in plants in two stages: first, β-glucosidase catalyzes hydrolysis to hydrojuglone, which then is chemically oxidized to form a toxic juglone [
