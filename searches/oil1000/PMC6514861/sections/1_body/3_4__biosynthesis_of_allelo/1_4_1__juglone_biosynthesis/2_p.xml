<p class="p">In nature, 1,4-naphthoquinones can be synthesized in several ways, but juglone is synthesized in the 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-succinylbenzoate metabolic pathway, which consists of seven reactions leading to the formation of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA), from which phylloquinone is then synthesized in plants and menaquinones in bacteria [
 <xref rid="B265-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">265</xref>]. MÃ¼ller and Leistner [
 <xref rid="B266-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">266</xref>] showed that 1,4-naphthoquinone is involved in the biosynthesis of juglone in walnut and, apparently, the synthesis of juglone is carried out in two stages: first, decarboxylation of DHNA to 1,4-naphthoquinone, which then turns into juglone by hydroxylase [
 <xref rid="B265-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">265</xref>]. This assumption was confirmed by McCoy et al. [
 <xref rid="B267-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">267</xref>] who used the targeted metabolic profiling and comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study expression of the phylloquinone pathway in various organs of black walnut. It has been shown that the DHNA biosynthesis genes are expressed in roots to support production of metabolites other than phylloquinone. These results indicate that juglone is 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesized in black walnut roots from DHNA derived via the phylloquinone pathway [
