<p class="p">A large number of different terpenes and erpene synthase genes open a broad way for metabolic engineering of the composition of the essential oil, but at the same time make it difficult. To understand the reasons for the differences between the chemotypes of eucalyptus and other species with a complex composition of allelochemicals, it is necessary to study the expression of their biosynthetic and regulatory genes. For example, root-specific terpene syntase genes, recently discovered in
