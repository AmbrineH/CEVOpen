<p class="p">The terpene synthases control final products of the terpene cyclisation, and differential expression of its genes can reflect the differences between chemotypes (variants in chemical composition of essential oils) [
 <xref rid="B276-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">276</xref>]. Three distinct chemotypes were identified in 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus tricarpa</italic>: with dominance of monoterpenes (&gt;80% of all terpenes) or sesquiterpenes (&gt;55%), and low-to-medium proportions of sesquiterpenes (10–55%) [
 <xref rid="B276-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">276</xref>]. An even narrower classification of terpene chemotypes (for monoterpene compounds) may exist in 
 <italic class="italic">E. grandis</italic>. Either α-pinene or 1,8-cineole dominate among monoterpenes. They originate from different carbocations and are products of different terpene synthase genes [
 <xref rid="B279-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>]. At least five different chemotypes, including linalool-, borneol-, camphor-, cineole-, and nerolidol-types have been identified in 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum camphora</italic> L., which has allelopathic activity, and all parts of which are rich in essential oil [
 <xref rid="B285-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">285</xref>]. A metabolic analysis and transcriptome sequencing of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> were done relatively recently, and it was shown that terpene synthase and oxidoreductase activities could explain the differential accumulation of terpenoids between the two chemotypes [
