<p class="p">In other woody plants rich in terpenoids, the terpene biosynthesis genes were found to be less frequent. In the 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum camphora</italic> transcriptome 67 unigenes likely involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were identified [
 <xref rid="B283-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">283</xref>]. Data on the biosynthesis of terpenes in conifers is much limited. Mao et al. [
 <xref rid="B284-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">284</xref>] identified 372 unigenes involved in the oleoresin (viscous mixture of terpenoids) biosynthesis in loblolly pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus taeda)</italic>, but only 74 of them are involved in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis.
