<p class="p">The significant dependence of eucalypts on both amount and composition of the essential oils implies a great importance of regulatory genes in biosynthesis of terpenes. This is in agreement with the fact that many transcription factors are also located close to clusters of terpene synthase genes [
 <xref rid="B279-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>]. The terpene emission in 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> is known to come mainly from leaves, which have numerous the sub-dermal secretory cavities (glands), but also from other terrestrial parts, for example, from flowers to attract pollinators. This was confirmed by Kulheim et al. [
 <xref rid="B279-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>], which showed that the largest proportion of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. grandis</italic> terpene synthase genes was highly expressed in “green tissues” (mature and young leaves, floral buds, and shoot tips). The authors also discovered root-specific cluster of the terpene syntase genes, but the role of terpenes in these tissues remains unknown. He et al. [
 <xref rid="B250-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">250</xref>] demonstrated that there were no volatiles in soil water from root exudates produced by the laboratory plants and in the field samples.
