<p class="p">The metabolic pathway of mimosine has not been studied enough yet, and current data are not consistent. Mimosine was shown to be present at all stages of the early development of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> seedlings, and its accumulation changed both with time and under influence of such factors as light, mechanical damage, salicylic acid, and auxins [
 <xref rid="B268-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">268</xref>]. On the other hand, Rodrigues-CorrÃªa et al. [
 <xref rid="B215-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>] also studied the effects of stress factors on seedlings of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> spp. 
 <italic class="italic">glabrata</italic> and found that salicylic acid had no effect, while jasmonic acid, an ethylene-releasing compound, ethephon, and UV-C radiation increased mimosine levels in roots and shoots. At the same time, application of four jasmonate elicitors that mimic the herbivores and wounding stresses to the 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> seedlings caused no change in the content mimosine in leaves, but increased the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxypyridine, the product of the mimosine degradation, under jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine elicitation [
 <xref rid="B274-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">274</xref>]. This showed that mimosine belongs to the constitutive metabolite, while 3,4-dihydroxypyridine belongs to the inducible metabolite, and jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine elicitation might activate the degradation of mimosine into 3,4-dihydroxypyridine [
