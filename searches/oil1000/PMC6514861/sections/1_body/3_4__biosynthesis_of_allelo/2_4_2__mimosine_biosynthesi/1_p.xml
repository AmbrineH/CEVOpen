<p class="p">Mimosine is synthesized from 3,4-dihydroxypyridine and O-acetylserine by the mimosine synthase (EC 2.5.1.52), which is the isoform of cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase, OAS-TL), and the pyridine ring of mimosine appeared to be derived from lysine [
 <xref rid="B206-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. Biosynthesis of mimosine (Î²-substituted alanine) represents an important branching point between primary metabolism (cysteine biosynthesis for protein assembly) and secondary metabolism (mimosine accumulation) [
 <xref rid="B268-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">268</xref>]. The biosynthesis of these substances is identical to the formation of O-acetylserine, which is then catalyzed by the OAS-TL isoforms into cysteine or mimosine in the presence of sulfide or 3,4-dihydroxypyridine, respectively [
 <xref rid="B268-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">268</xref>]. The first attempt to isolate the mimosine biosynthesis gene was made in 2014, when Yafuso et al. [
 <xref rid="B269-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">269</xref>] isolated the OAS-TL gene from 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic>, expressed it in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and evaluated the possibility of a recombinant enzyme to synthesize mimosine and cysteine. However, it turned out that cytosolic OAS-TL is specific for only cysteine synthesis and does not catalyze mimosine formation. The 
 <italic class="italic">Mimosa pudica</italic> Mill enzyme has similar properties: the cloned cytosolic OASTL 1275 bp long cDNA expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, but enzyme produced cystein only [

 <xref rid="B271-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">271</xref>] was the first to obtain the enzyme involved in the synthesis of mimosine. They cloned the 1275 bp long cDNA for cytosolic Cy-OASTL from 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena leucocephala</italic>, and the resulting enzyme showed a dual function of cysteine and mimosine synthesis. Since the apparent 
 <italic class="italic">kcat</italic> for Cys production is more than six times higher than for the synthesis of mimosin, and the apparent 
 <italic class="italic">Km</italic> is 3.7 times lower, it is likely that for this enzyme synthesis Cys is the preferred route [
