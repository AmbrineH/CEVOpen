<p class="p">A thorough understanding of the mimosine metabolism pathway and its regulation under the influence of endogenous and external factors are fundamental to its metabolic engineering in order to create transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> plants. The high productivity and protein content of the 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> foliage can help to solve the problem of insufficient animal feed in developing countries, but this opportunity is limited by mimosine toxicity. Reduction of toxicity is possible in two waysâ€”either by blocking biosynthesis or increasing the degradation of mimosin, and here the enzyme mimosinase becomes important. In addition, in the case of using mimosine as a bioherbicide, knowledge of its biosynthesis is necessary to increase its content in 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> or in other plants.
