<p class="p">Mimosine accumulates in plants in large quantities, which requires much energy, as well as deposition of carbon and nitrogen resources. Negi et al. [
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>] estimated that if it were not for the synthesis of mimosine, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> plants would have increased by at least 20%. They suggested that mimosine acts as a source of carbon and nitrogen under stressful conditions, when the availability of nutrients becomes limited, and this explains the resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> to drought. Mimosine catabolites can be used as nutrients in root nodules, thereby playing a role in the leucocephala tree [
 <xref rid="B206-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. Regulation of mimosine accumulation by environmental factors also suggests its role as a nutritional reserve source [
 <xref rid="B268-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">268</xref>]. Enzymes were isolated from the 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> tissues that decompose mimosine to 3,4-dihydroxypyridine (3,4DHP), pyruvic acid, and ammonia (by CN lyase [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]) or to 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (by mimosinase [
 <xref rid="B272-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">272</xref>]). The herbicidal activity of 3,4 DHP was first shown by Xuan et al. [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">273</xref>] on the growth of seedlings of 
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic>, and it was about four times lower than that of mimosin. Smith and Fowden [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] suggested that the lack of effect of mimosine and dihydroxypyridine on growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> seedlings might be due to the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> to further metabolize dihyroxypyridine. This is evident from the absence of dihydroxypridine in the 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> seedling extracts. The gene encoding the mimosine-degrading enzyme was recently isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena leucocephala</italic> and described as C-N lyase [
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>]. The authors of this study suggested the compartmentization model according to which mimosine is synthesized and stored in the cytoplasm, while mimosinase is localized in the chloroplast, and the substrate becomes available for the enzyme under stress conditions (e.g., drought), which may cause damage to the chloroplast membrane. Further studies are needed to identify the dihydroxypridine degradation gene.
