 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> trees (Myrtaceae) are native in Australia and New Zealand and one of the fastest growing and highly productive trees in tropics and subtropics. They have been introduced into more than 120 countries and comprise one-third of the world’s total plantation area [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The allelopathic properties of eucalypts have long been known. Lerner and Evenari [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] showed in their laboratory experiments that leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus rostrata</italic> inhibited seed germination. Natural fog drip from 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> inhibits the growth of annual grass seedlings in bioassays [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Since then, the impact of different 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species was investigated in bioassays on different types of weeds, crops and tree species. May and Ash [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] showed that eucalypt extracts affected germination of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium</italic> species. They came to the conclusion that allelopathy was likely to be a cause of the understory suppression by the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species. Aqueous leachate of fresh leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> showed an inhibitory effect on two perennial weeds: 
 <italic class="italic">Cyperus rotundus</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Cynodon dactylon</italic> L. Pers. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Studies in the greenhouse confirmed that the leaf litter extract of 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic> had an inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Vigna unguiculata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cicer arietinum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cajanus cajan</italic>. Moreover, it inhibited the latter species to a greater degree. Therefore, eucalypt-based systems are not recommended for use in agroforestry [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The influence of the aqueous leaf leachate and leaf volatile of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus urophylla</italic> on seed germination and seedling growth of seven native and three exotic tree species was studied by Fang [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The allelochemical effects varied depending on the dose and tested species. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">E. erythrocorys</italic> L. caused an inhibitory effect on both weeds (
 <italic class="italic">Sinapis arvensis</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Phalaris canariensis</italic> L.) and a cultivated crop (
 <italic class="italic">Triticum durum</italic> L.). Seedling growth was a more sensitive indicator than seed germination [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Finally, the eucalypt allelopathic properties were investigated to control algae bloom, which degrades water quality by producing the most potent toxins, which is a serious threat. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] was the first to study the effects of leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus grandis</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">E. urophylla</italic> hybrids on the density of algae cells in mesocosm. Direct planting of eucalypts was significantly more effective, since, in addition to the isolation of allelochemicals, competitive absorption for macronutrients occurred as well. At the same time, plants or extracts had no adverse effect on diversity or abundance of the microbial community [
