<p class="p">Due to the longevity of woody plants, it can be assumed that their allelochemical properties may change over time. To test this assumption on the three species (
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne</italic>), aqueous root extracts and rhizosphere soil from 
 <italic class="italic">E. grandis</italic> plantations of different ages (2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-year old) were evaluated [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The extracts inhibited the germination and growth of plants, and the younger ones were affected to a larger degree. On the other hand, soil samples from 6, 8, and 10-year-old plantations demonstrated a remarkable stimulative effect on 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic>. Thus, when evaluating the allelopathy of woody plants, their age should be taken into account.
