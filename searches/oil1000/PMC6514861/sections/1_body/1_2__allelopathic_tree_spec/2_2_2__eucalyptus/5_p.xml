<p class="p">The discrepancy between laboratory and field experiment results was shown in studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus saligna</italic>. In the laboratory, the aqueous extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. saligna</italic> leaf litter severely reduced germination and growth of graminoid and forb species [

 <italic class="italic">E. saligna</italic> leaf litter on the establishment of grassland species 
 <italic class="italic">Paspalum notatum</italic> (Poaceae) and 
 <italic class="italic">Lotus corniculatus</italic> (Fabaceae) were not related to allelopathy but were mainly associated with the physical effects of litter [
