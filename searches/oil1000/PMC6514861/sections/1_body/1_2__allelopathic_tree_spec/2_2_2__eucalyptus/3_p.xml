<p class="p">Experiments for plant allelopathy are often evaluated at the morphological (assessment of germination and growth) and physiological levels (photosynthesis, respiration, and enzyme activity). The eucalypt extracts or leachates demonstrated various effects at the physiological level, such as a decrease in the respiration rate and protein, carbohydrates, and nucleic acid contents [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], a change of activity of various antioxidant enzymes [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], increased H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels, and electrolyte leakage of the seedling membranes [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Such reactions, in general, were observed also for allelochemicals of other plants. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were much less evaluated. Under the influence of leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> the 
 <italic class="italic">Hordeum vulgare L.</italic> plants demonstrated significant mitotic abnormalities such as disturbed metaphases and anaphases and chromatin bridge [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In another survey, the comet assay and semi-quantitative RT-PCR methods were used to assess the genotoxic impact of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> leaves on soybean genome [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The assay showed a steady increase in the frequency of DNA damage in soybean nuclei and changes in transcript amounts of cysteine proteases and specific inhibitors genes. This research showed that 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> allelochemicals can have variable genetic effects on soybean plant and ultimately caused growth delay and yield falling [
