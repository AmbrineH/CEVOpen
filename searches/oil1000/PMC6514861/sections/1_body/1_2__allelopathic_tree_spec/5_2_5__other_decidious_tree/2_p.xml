As a rule, these are tropical and subtropical species, some of which are used in ethnopharmacology. For example, it was shown that leaf extracts of the evergreen tree

 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron formosanum</italic>, an endemic species in the Taiwan Mountains, contains various phenolic phytotoxins and inhibited plant growth in greenhouse and laboratory experiments suggesting that it is associated with allelopathy [
