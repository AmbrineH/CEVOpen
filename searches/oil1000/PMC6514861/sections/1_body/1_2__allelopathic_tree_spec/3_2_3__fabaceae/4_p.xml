<p class="p">It is considered that the invasive properties of 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> are also caused by allelopathy, but the importance of this factor among others (i.e., direct competition, changing growth conditions and soil properties) has not been tested. The study in natural environment [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] suggested that the main factor affecting the establishment of both native and invasive species is shaded microhabitat in dense populations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic>, rather than changes in soil properties or allelopathy. The authors concluded that a negligible effect of 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> allelopathy implies a secondary role of allelochemicals during the invasion of this species in European forests. The results of this research contradicted the previous ones that showed a significant allelopathic effect on various plant species, which proves yet again the importance of field studies.
