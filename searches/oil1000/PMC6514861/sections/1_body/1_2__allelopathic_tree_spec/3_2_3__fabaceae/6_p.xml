<p class="p">There is another tree plant with allelopathic properties in the family of Fabaceae—
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena leucocephala</italic>. This fast-growing nitrogen-fixing tree, native in Mexico and Central America, is notable for its tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Its introduction as an animal fodder began in the 16th century from the Philippines, and since then it has spread widely across tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Due to its high nutritional value—the concentration of crude protein comprises about 30%—
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> is known as the “alfalfa of tropics” [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. However, high contents of anti-nutritional factors, such as mimosine and condensed tannin, can lead to a number of toxic symptoms in animals and limits nutritive value of its foliade [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The leaves and litter of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> inhibited germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Zea mays</italic> in laboratory and greenhouse studies [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. It was shown that phenols (a well-known group of allelochemicals) in the leaves and litter were responsible for the allelopathic effect. Evaluation of the influence of fallen leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> on a tree species 
 <italic class="italic">Albizia procrai</italic> and three crops 
 <italic class="italic">Vigna unguiculata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cicer arietinum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cajanus cajan</italic> showed that litter stimulated shoot growth in low doses and inhibited it in high doses [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The phytotoxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> against aquatic weeds has also been tested. Leaf disc assay with 
 <italic class="italic">Eichhornia crassipes</italic> (Mart.) Solms., an invasive aquatic weed in many regions of the world, showed that leaf leachate of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> enhanced electrolyte leakage, decline mitochondrial respiration and inhibits antioxidant enzymes in treated tissues [
