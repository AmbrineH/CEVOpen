<p class="p">Studies on allelopathy were also carried out on other types of acacia. Extracts of phyllodes from 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia melanoqlon R.Br.</italic> inhibited growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> rather than its germination [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], and flower extracts proved more phytotoxic than phyllodes against germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Dactylis glomerata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rumex acetosa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">A. mangium</italic> acueous leaf extracts inhibited germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Oryza sativa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. For the first time, the autotoxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> species has been shown in Noumi et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], where the aqueous extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia tortilis</italic> leaves in high concentrations significantly inhibited seed germination. At the same time, positive autoallopathy was shown for 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic>: the root growth was stimulated with its own extracts [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. One of the very few field studies on allelopathy in acacias was carried out on 
 <italic class="italic">A. pennatula</italic> in Nicaragua. Seedling survival of native tree species 
 <italic class="italic">Guazuma ulmifolia Lam</italic>., 
 <italic class="italic">Enterolobium cyclocarpum Griseb</italic>., and 
 <italic class="italic">Cedrela odorata</italic> L. under the canopy was about 20â€“30% lower than outside [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Seedling mortality increased with the advance of the dry season, although higher soil moisture conditions were under the canopy. The authors believed that 
 <italic class="italic">A. pennatula</italic> inhibits the growth of plants under the canopy with the help of allelopathy, reducing the relative weight ratio of roots, which is critical during the dry season.
