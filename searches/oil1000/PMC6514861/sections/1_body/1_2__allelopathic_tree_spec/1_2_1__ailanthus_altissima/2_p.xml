<p class="p">These experiments were carried out under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, but they have a number of drawbacks that can be overcome only by field tests, which allow to test the following: (1) accumulation and preservation of allelochemicals in soil, (2) toxic effects on coexisting species, and (3) change in allelochemical effects in space and time [

 <italic class="italic">Acer rubrum, A. saccharum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus rubra</italic>) in temperate forests of the United States. The effect was negative and species-specific. It was apparently influenced by both the differences between species, the response to allelopathy and changes in the availability of resources caused by the presence of
