<p class="p">Tree of Heaven (
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus altissima</italic> (Mill.) Swingle) from the 
 <italic class="italic">Simaroubaceae</italic> family is a deciduous tree native to northeastern and central China. Due to its decorative properties, 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> was introduced in Europe in the 1740s and the USA in the 1780s and has since spread widely across all continents except Antarctica [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> is very fast growing, possibly the fastest growing tree in North America [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It possesses high fecundity—it is able to multiply as seeds, up to 300,000 units per season from a tree—which extend up to 200 m followed by 100% germination, and can propagate vegetatively from stumps and roots [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> is highly resistant to pollutants and able to grow on poor soils, and contains allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. All these factors make it highly invasive, especially in areas that are disturbed by human activity, such as roadsides and railways, wastelands and deforestation, and only cold and shading can limit its appearance and spread [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The negative effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> on the growth of neighboring plants was noticed a long time ago. For the first time, its phytotoxicity was evaluated by Mergen [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], who in a greenhouse experiment found a reduction in the growth of seedlings of 35 species of gymnosperms and 10 species of angiosperms after treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> leaflet extract, and only 
 <italic class="italic">Fraxinus americana</italic> L. plants were not affected. Subsequently, the inhibitory effect of root bark powder was shown on 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and Lawrence et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] demonstrated that the extracts of the stem and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> inhibit the germination and growth of seedlings of both the test species 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> and those growing near 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic>—six herbaceous and one woody (
 <italic class="italic">Platanus occidentalis</italic>) species. Water extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> inhibited the germination and growth of radish seeds (
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> L.), watercress (
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> L.), portulaca (
 <italic class="italic">Portulaca olearacea</italic> L.) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], oats (
 <italic class="italic">Avena sativa</italic> L.), rapeseed (
 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">Oleifera</italic>), and sunflower (
 <italic class="italic">Helianthus annuus</italic> L.) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Leaf methanol extracts also inhibited germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus carota</italic> (carrot) roots depending on the concentration [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In addition to higher plants, extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> exerted an inhibitory effect in a dose-dependent manner on the cell density of the cyanobacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> and reduced the number of extracellular cyanotoxin microcystins [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In addition, greenhouse studies showed that the soil from 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> stands significantly inhibited germination and growth of the local species 
 <italic class="italic">Verbesina occidentalis</italic>, but did not affect the invasive in North America species 
 <italic class="italic">Dipsacus fullonum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The difference may be related to species specificity, but the authors suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> may affect native and non-native species in different ways, potentially promoting the spread of other non-native plants in the invasion affected community.
