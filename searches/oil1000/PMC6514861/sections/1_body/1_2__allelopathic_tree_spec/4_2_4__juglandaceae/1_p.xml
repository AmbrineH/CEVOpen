<p class="p">Walnut phytotoxicity is the oldest reported example of allelopathy. Roman naturalist and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder was the first to describe its inhibitory effect on surrounding vegetation in his

 <italic class="italic">Juglandaceae</italic> family, such as black walnut (
 <italic class="italic">Juglans nigra</italic> L.), also possess this ability. These plants’ allelopathy under the laboratory conditions was demonstrated almost 100 years ago, when Massey [
