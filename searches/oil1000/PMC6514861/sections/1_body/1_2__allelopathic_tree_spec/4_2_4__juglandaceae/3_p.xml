The preparation was inhibiting seed germination in Petri dishes and was causing complete loss when being treated with 20–43% concentration depending on the type in a greenhouse and with a 43% concentration when being treated under field conditions. The extract showed properties of systemic herbicide with xylem transport and had prospects as a pre-and post-emergence bioherbicide.
