<p class="p">Conifers differ from the angiosperm species mentioned earlier in the article. The latter ones were invasive, plantation or agricultural trees that are not threatened with a reduction in habitat and which usually use allelopathy against other species, then there is a different situation with conifers: as many natural coniferous forests are cut down due to their high commercial value, but their restoration is difficult. Unfortunately, natural regeneration doesnâ€™t occur at all or is very slow. Coniferous forests are usually characterized by lesser understorey vegetation and by regeneration problems, and one of the reasons for this is allelopathy, although other differences from angiosperms such as slower growth, later fruition, etc., also play a role. Allelopathy in conifers often manifests itself in the form of autotoxicity, and this has been reported for different conifer species [
