<p class="p">Apparently, the first observation about conifer congestion allelopathy appeared more than 300 years ago in Japan: Lee and Monsi [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] found an ancient document in which Banzan Kumazawa reported that red pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus densiflora</italic> Sieb. Et Zucc.) was harmful to crops growing under their canopy. More than 100 species are included in the 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus genus</italic>; and they are widely spread as native species throughout the entire Northern Hemisphere occupying large areas in South America, Australia, and New Zealand as plantation species. Understory vegetation under the canopy of pine trees in several species is rather poor, and this is not associated with shading, since pine forests are characterized by high intensity sunlight. Allelopathic interactions are assumed to play an important role under these conditions [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Much research on coniferous allelopathy is associated with various types of pine trees, possibly due to the great economic value of these plants. Allelopathic species of conifers are characterized by a large variety of allelochemicals, and therefore will be discussed in detail in the relevant chapter. Species with allelopathic activity studied since 2000 are presented in
