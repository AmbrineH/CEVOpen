<p class="p">The transgenic approach can also be used to study the allelopathic activity of plants. So far, it has been applied only on grassy plants. For example, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B363-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">363</xref>] demonstrated that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic>). Plants with this alteration were not allelopathic. Thus, these results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant. Later, RNA interference approach was used for suppression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene in rice genotype with high allelopathic potential [
