<p class="p">One of the directions is production of allelochemicals in bioreactors using plant cell cultures, but this technology is now economically justified almost exclusively only for the production of valuable pharmaceutical compounds. One of the most effective strategies for enhancing the biotechnological production of secondary metabolits is elicitation [
 <xref rid="B366-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">366</xref>]. Biotic and abiotic elicitors stimulate plant defense, including allelopathic, but for the application of this technology it is necessary to know in response to which factors plants stimulate production of allelochemicals. However, information on this topic in woody plants is rather limited.
