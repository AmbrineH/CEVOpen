<p class="p">The eucalypt was the first example of metabolic engineering of a woody essential oil plant. In 2010 Ohara et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> Dehnh. with constructs containing limonene synthase gene for localization of the enzyme either in the cytosol or in plastids. The plastidic and cytosolic expression of transgene yielded 2.6- and 4.5-times more limonene in leaf extracts than that accumulated in non-transgenic plants, respectively, but had only a small effect on the limonene emission from the leaves. Surprisingly, the limonene synthase expression induced the accumulation of 1,8-cineole and Î±-pinene, although formation of these two majour monoterpenes of
