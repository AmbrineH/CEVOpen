<p class="p">In addition to 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic>, there are also isolated reports on the assessment of allelopathy in transgenic plants of other tree species that do not have significant allelopathic activity. This is due to the fact that genetic transformation can cause a so-called unforeseen changes unrelated to the nature of the gene transferred. Allelopathic tests on 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> showed that the root exudates and leaf litter of field-grown transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Populus alba</italic> with xyloglucanase gene for increasing the cellulose content did not produce harmful substances [
 <xref rid="B354-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">354</xref>]. Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="B282-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">282</xref>] evaluated the allelopathic activity of leaves from 
 <italic class="italic">Populus tomentosa</italic> with the 
 <italic class="italic">DREB</italic> transcription factor under field conditions. Sandwich and the soil-mix methods with 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> seeds did not show significant differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic lines. At last, transgenic American chestnut (
 <italic class="italic">Castanea dentata</italic>) expressing an oxalate oxidase gene for fungal disease resistance was evaluated for potential allelopathy using five native species in its traditional habitat (grass, forb, shrub, coniferous tree, and deciduous tree) [
 <xref rid="B355-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">355</xref>]. Seed germination or total biomass of seedlings in the greenhouse were not significantly different in transgenic and non-transgenic leaf litter. From the data available today, it can be concluded that neither the targeted alteration of genes associated with allelochemical activity nor unforeseen changes in transgenic woody plants led to a change in their allelochemical activity.
