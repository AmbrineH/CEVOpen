<p class="p">Evaluation of transgenic eucalypts generated for commercial use also showed no changes in their allelopathic activity. The 
 <italic class="italic">E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> hybrid was transformed with either the

The analysis of yield or composition of essential oil from leaves harvested in 2009–2010 demonstrated that there were no significant differences between transgenic and non-transgenic trees in the field trials. In 2015, Brazil approved commercial use of the transgenic eucalypts with the

 <italic class="italic">E. grandis × E. urophylla</italic> hybrid line has been modified for freeze tolerance and sterility, which should not increase chemical exudates and leaching, by ArborGen (USA). Field trials confirmed the lack of evidence for allelopathic effects of transgenic plants on a variety of grasses and broad leaf weeds in test plots [
