<p class="p">The use of classical traditional breeding methods to increase allelopathy is still acceptable for herbaceous plants, but less efficient for trees. Modern biotechnology methods such as gene transfer or genome editing can be used. However, it is unlikely that trees with a complex composition of allelochemicals, such as eucalyptus, will be purposefully modified to change their allelopathic potential. As already shown, dozens of genes are involved in the synthesis of terpenes, and this process is still dependent on various external and internal factors. It is more likely that this will occur as a side effect of solving other, more economically feasible tasks, such as a change in the composition or yield of the essential oil. Purposeful change in allelochemical potential has a higher probability of use on species containing one major alleochemical, such as mimosine or juglone. To perform these tasks, it is necessary to understand genes involved in regulation and biosynthesis of allelochemicals. It may be necessary to obtain transgenic model plants to study these processes.</p>
