<p class="p">Due to the great economic importance of eucalypt - this is the main plantation tree - intensive research is being carried out on production of transgenic eucalypts. According to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, GMOs planted or released into the environment should not have any potential adverse effects on biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B343-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">343</xref>]. Thus, transgenic plants should also be evaluated for their allelopathic activity including transgenic eucalypts containing the 
 <italic class="italic">codA</italic> gene that increases salt tolerance. The 
 <italic class="italic">codA</italic> gene was isolated from the soil bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Arthrobacter globiformis</italic> and encodes choline oxidase enzyme that has no known direct allelopathic effects [
 <xref rid="B344-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">344</xref>]. However, transgenic plants are more tolerant to salt stress, and it is known that stressful conditions can change both the sensitivity to allelochemicals and their production.
