<p class="p">Although Coder and Warnell [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] have placed birch in a group of trees with slight allelopathic effects, a significant impact of genotype and ontogeny on birch shoot secondary chemistry was shown [
 <xref rid="B358-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">358</xref>]. It was shown that elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, characteristic of global climate change, increased phenolic compound contents in leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Betula pendula</italic> Roth [
 <xref rid="B359-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">359</xref>]. In addition, birch is one of the main hardwood species in boreal forests and promising for establishment of forest plantations including transgenic genotypes. It is not excluded that genetic transformation, especially affecting the primary metabolism pathway, can lead to an increased level of allelochemicals. In order to increase productivity, we transferred the 
 <italic class="italic">GS1</italic> gene from 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic>, encoding cytosol form of glutamine synthetase, main enzyme of nitrogen metabolism in plants, in 
 <italic class="italic">Betula pubescens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. pendula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B360-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">360</xref>]. The transgenic birch plants had an elevated content of glutamine, as well as glutamic and aspartic acids, and rooted more rapidly than the control plants due to increased auxin levels [
 <xref rid="B361-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">361</xref>]. In addition, open-air tests demonstrated that birch plants expressing the 
 <italic class="italic">GS</italic> gene use nitrogen more efficiently under nitrogen deficiency conditions [
 <xref rid="B362-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">362</xref>]. It can be assumed that altered levels of amino acids and auxins will lead to a change in the level of allelochemicals. Moreover, forest plantations are usually establsihed on poor soils, and the cultivation of plants in conditions of lack of nutrients is stressful. It is possible that such stress will increase both the release of allelochemicals by transgenic birch trees, and sensitivity to them in the surrounding vegetation.
