Metabolomic studies of these plants revealed strong changes in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, in particular the accumulation of glycosylated forms, which may indicate their cytotoxicity. It was also noted that lines with a high accumulation of glycosylated forms of phenolic compounds showed reduced growth (our unpublished results). Thus, suppression of lignin biosynthesis genes has affected the phenolic metabolism of transgenic aspen plants, which could change their allelopathic activity.
