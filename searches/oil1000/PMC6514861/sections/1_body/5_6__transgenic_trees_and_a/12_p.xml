<p class="p">Genetic engineering techniques can be used to enhance allelopathy of agricultural plants as a means of controlling weeds. This can be achieved by increasing their production in plants or changing the localization of their expression (for example, increasing the content in the roots) or seasonality. Their synthesis in plants where they were absent earlier is less likely. This direction requires the identification of genes that encode enzymes involved in synthesis of powerful allelochemicals and find out how expression of these genes is regulated.</p>
