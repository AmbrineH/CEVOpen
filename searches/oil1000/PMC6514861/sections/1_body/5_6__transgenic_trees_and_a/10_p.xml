<p class="p">The use of woody plants as models for the study of allelopathy has not been reported until recently. To facilitate allelopathic research, Stanisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B365-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">365</xref>] has first established apple transgenic hairy root cultures as a new tool for allelopathic assays in 2019. Authors transformed four apple cultivars by 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacteium rhizogenes</italic> and demonstrated the phytotoxic effects of hairy root exudates on shoot and root development and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings. Genetic transformation did not disturb secondary metabolite production in apple, and untransformed and transgenic root tissues had similar content of phenolic acids and flavonoids. As putative allelochemicals chlorogenic and caffeic acids and dihydrochalcones phloridzin and phloretin were identified [
 <xref rid="B365-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">365</xref>]. Obtaining a hairy root culture for plants with high allelopitic activity will allow a better study of the biosynthesis of these compounds and explore the possibilities of genetic manipulation of these processes.
