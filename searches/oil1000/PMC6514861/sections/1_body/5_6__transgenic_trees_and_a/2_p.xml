<p class="p">Initially, the effects of

 <xref rid="B345-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">345</xref>] or 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B346-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">346</xref>] were tested under net-house conditions. In addition, long term trials were carried out for transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B347-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">347</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B346-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">346</xref>] in Japan. Authors had evaluated the allelopathic effects of eucalypts on test species 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> using sandwich and soil mix methods, and no significant differences were found between the transgenic and non-transgenic plants. Kikuchi et al. [
 <xref rid="B345-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">345</xref>] also demonstrated no change in the qualitative composition of the volatile substances and the phenolic compounds in transgenic eucalypts compared to control plants. Later Gilani et al. [
 <xref rid="B348-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">348</xref>] studied allelopathic effects of essential oils from transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic> with another salt resistance gene, mangrin, on seed germination and early growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativa</italic> L. The results showed no significant inhibitory effects of transgenic plants. 1,8-Cineole and Î±-pinene were tested as major oil constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic>, and no variation was found between transgenic and non-transgenic lines. These results revealed that eucalypts that contained salt tolerance genes did not change their allelopathic activity.
