<p class="p">Autotoxicity could present a problem with other conifers. Schrenk spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea schrenkiana</italic> Fisch. Et Mey.) is the native species in Middle Asia and the mountains of Asia, where usually it creates pure forests. This species is of the utmost importance in the mountain ecosystems, because it plays an important role in water and soil conservation, but the natural regeneration of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> has been problematic [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. One of the possible reasons could be found in autotoxic secondary metabolites that are transferred to the soil with litter and root exudates and impede the growth of seedlings of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic>. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] demonstrated the autotoxicity of litter extracts from Schrenk spruce on seed germination and seedling growth of the same species. From the litter 17 compounds were isolated, including 10 phenolic acids (4-vinylphenol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acids, 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, gentisic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, Î²-resorcylic acid, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid), and ethyl hematommate. This study was carried out only under laboratory conditions, and tests under natural settings are needed to confirm the role of identified phenolic acids [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. From water extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> needles, the phenolic compound 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>) was isolated, which significantly inhibited growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> and the six agricultural crops under laboratory conditions [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. DHAP concentration seemed to be rather high in mature forest soil (0.51 mg/g dry soil) to inhibit the seed germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> and other co-occurring species. A similar composition, 4-hydroxyacetophenone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>), was isolated in throughfall, in water extracts of litter and organic soil layer under 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> and produced an inhibiting effect on root length of spruce seedling [
 <xref rid="B259-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">259</xref>]. Taking into consideration the great ecological importance of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic>, the following studies were focused on evaluating the autotoxicity alterations caused by global warming. Ruan et al. [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>] proved that with the rising temperatures the DHAP effect on seed germination of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> was changing from stimulation to inhibition depending on the concentration. Physiological mechanism of autotoxicity evaluation showed that the moderate concentration of DHAP increased antioxidant enzymes activities in order to protect against reactive oxygen species; but with high concentrations, the activity thereof was decreasing and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species could inhibit the 
 <italic class="italic">P. schrenkiana</italic> seedlings growth [
 <xref rid="B260-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">260</xref>]. This investigation revealed that autotoxicity of P. schrenkiana was affected by the climate warming.
