<p class="p">Allelopathic properties are known also for other conifer species. Needle extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Araucaria angustifolia</italic> inhibit germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> at high concentrations [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. The potential allelochemicals were identified as diterpenoids ent-kaurene and phyllocladene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f014" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>), and no phenolic compounds commonly associated with the allelopathic effect were detected in the extracts. The leaf extract of the Wollemi pine (
 <italic class="italic">Wollemia nobilis</italic>), another tree belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Araucariaceae</italic> family, inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium rigidum</italic> and wild radish (
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus raphanistrum</italic>) in laboratory bioassays and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. rigidum</italic> in soil trials [
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. The main constituents identified in the most phytotoxic fraction were terpenes and phenolics. Inhibiting effect of leaf and litter of 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus ashei</italic> Buchh. on the germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Bouteloua curtipendula</italic> (Michx.) Torr. was demonstrated using the “sandwich agar method” [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. In addition, aboveground dry mass of 
 <italic class="italic">B. curtipendula</italic> was nearly four times higher than in an intercanopy area compared to the dry mass in the understory and dripline (edge of the tree) in the field experiment, suggesting some negative influence by 
 <italic class="italic">J. ashei</italic>. Leaf and litter leachate and volatiles from leaf tissue contained monoterpenes camphor (the most abundant), bornyl acetate, and limonene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref>), which are potentially allelochemicals inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">B. curtipendula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Allelopathic activity was found also in one of the oldest living tree species, 
 <italic class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</italic>. A leaf extract inhibited the growth of four plant species, and an active substance was isolated and identified as the novel compound 2-hydroxy-6-(10-hydroxypentadec-11-enyl)benzoic acid [
