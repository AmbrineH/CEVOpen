 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic> by 49.7–57.6% and 34.2–39.7%, respectively, compared with the control, but their mixtures increased the growth only by 11.5–15.7% [

 <xref rid="B263-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">263</xref>] noticed that mixtures of phenolic acids and other organic compounds can cause inhibitory effects even though concentrations of individual compounds were well below inhibitory levels. Wang et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron formosanum</italic> allelochemicals: 10 μg/g soil of (-)-catechin combined with 10 μg/g soil of protocatechuic acid caused the inhibition of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> seed germination by 36.7%, while applied separately 750 μg/g soil of (-)-catechin inhibited germination only by 13.4%, and 10 μg/g soil of (-)-catechin had no effect at all.
