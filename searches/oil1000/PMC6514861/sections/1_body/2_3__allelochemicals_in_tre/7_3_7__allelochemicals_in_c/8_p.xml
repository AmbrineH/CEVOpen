<p class="p">Studies conducted in the recent years indicated also allelopathic properties of yew (
 <italic class="italic">Taxus baccata</italic> L.). Inhibiting effect of aqueous extracts from arils, leaves and bark on germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus L.</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cucumis sativus L.</italic> depended on a type of tissue and concentration and could be associated with the high contents of phenolic in the extracts [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. It was demonstrated in the ex situ pot experiments that addition of yew needles negatively affected seedling growth, but not seed germination suggesting that the absence of regeneration beneath mature yew canopies may at least be partly related to autotoxicity [

 <italic class="italic">Abies</italic>), hemlock (
 <italic class="italic">Tsuga</italic>), and cedar (
 <italic class="italic">Thuja</italic>) species were demonstrated. Germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds was inhibited with resin vesicle extracts, and damage of resin vesicle prior to stratification had negative effects on their own germination for most species [
