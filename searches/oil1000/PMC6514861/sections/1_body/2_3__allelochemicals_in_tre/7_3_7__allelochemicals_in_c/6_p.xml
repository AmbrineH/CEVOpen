<p class="p">In also should be mentioned that only in the field it is possible to evaluate allelopathic interactions between different types of trees in mixed plantations. Comparison of the Chinese fir monocultures with mixed-species stands containing both the Chinese fir and a broadleaf, non-N fixing species, 
 <italic class="italic">Michelia macclurei</italic> showed enhanced growth of Chinese fir [
 <xref rid="B262-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">262</xref>]. The authors observed reduction of autotoxicity through reduced release cyclic dipeptide from the Chinese fir roots and increased its degradation in the soil due to changes in composition of the soil microbial community. Similar positive effects were also presented in [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>], where in the Manchurian walnut plantations mixed with larch the growth of the autotoxic Manchurian walnut was improved. These field studies confirmed earlier greenhouse ones, where water extracts from root, bark, branch and leaf of 
 <italic class="italic">Larix gmelini</italic> with low and moderate concentrations accelerated the growth of one-year-old
