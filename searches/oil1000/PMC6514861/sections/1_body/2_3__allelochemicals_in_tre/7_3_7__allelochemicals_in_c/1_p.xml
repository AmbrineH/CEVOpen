<p class="p">Japanese red pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus densiflora</italic> Sieb. Et Zucc.) could be found in Japan, China and Korea and is characterized by sparse herbaceous vegetation compared with other forests that suggests the presence of allelopathic effects [
 <xref rid="B257-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>]. Aqueous methanol extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. densiflora</italic> needles inhibited root and shoot growth of seven plant species, including weeds 
 <italic class="italic">Digitaria sanguinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic>. Anabietane diterpenoid, 9α,13β-epidioxyabeit-8(14)-en-18-oic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>) was isolated from the extract, and it inhibited root and shoot growth of weed seedlings and could play an important role in the allelopathy of red pine [
 <xref rid="B257-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>]. Abscisic acid-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>) was later isolated from the 
 <italic class="italic">P. densiflora</italic> needles, which in bioassays was inhibiting the growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crusgalli</italic> seedlings at concentration significantly lower than its concentration in soil water of the pine forest, i.e., 0.1 and 2.5 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. Another paper demonstrated that aqueous methanol extracts of red pine soil also inhibited the root and shoot growth of six test species, but two other growth inhibitory substances, i.e., abietane type diterpenids, 15-hydroxy-7-oxodehydroabietate and 7-oxodehydroabietic acid were identified there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. These substances inhibited growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam. in aqueous solutions, and also growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic> Lam. when added to soil in natural concentrations under litter layer of red pine forest floor. Apparently, these substances are the products of degradation of resin acids that got into the soil under the pine trees through resin and defoliation by soil microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. Two allelochemicals from red pine needles [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B257-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>] were not found in the soil as main inhibitory substances, and their contributions in growth inhibitory activity of the red pine soil could be much less than abietic acid derivatives [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>].
