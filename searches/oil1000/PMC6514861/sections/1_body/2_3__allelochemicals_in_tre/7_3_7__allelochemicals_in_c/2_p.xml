 <italic class="italic">Pinus halepensis</italic> Miller is another relatively thoroughly studied allelopathic pine tree species. This species is distinguished for its ability to rapidly expand from forest plantations into surrounding natural vegetation in Mediterranean regions, which leads to creating monospecific woodlands with decreased biodiversity. Germination and growth of various plant species was inhibited by the 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> extracts [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>], and the release of potential allelochemicals (phenolic compounds) in leaf leachates or root exudates could influence secondary succession [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. The autotoxicity was also detected for 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. Fernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>] showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> allelochemicals composition differed depending on the plants age and tissue: needle leachates were composed mainly of oxygenated terpenoids, whereas roots mainly contained fatty acids. Young plant needles had the highest content of monoterpenes, suggesting their allelopathic role in facilitating the establishment of young pine stands, while high concentrations of caffeic acid in both young needles and old roots could play a key role in giving 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> a competitive advantage [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Apparently, it was these differences that caused different levels of autotoxicity discovered by Fernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. Differences in the content of terpene and phenolic allelochemicals depending on age were also shown on eucalyptus [
 <xref rid="B246-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. Effect of aqueous extracts from shoots of young 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> on germination and growth of 12 target species naturally present in fallow was specific for a species; and the microbial community present in natural soil reduced the toxicity of allelochemicals compared to the sterile soil [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. Aqueous extracts of young pine needles comprised nearly 50 compounds and mixtures predominantly consisted of phenolics, including those known phytotoxins such as gallic, 4-hydrobenzoic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric and caffeic acids, and fatty acids. Study of 12 species in the field demonstrated that their abundance decreased along the secondary succession with land closure due to pine colonization; and it should be mentioned that the abundance of four species decreased once pines were present [
