<p class="p">In rare cases, mimosine can be a stimulant. It was shown that mimosine at a concentration of 1 mM inhibited cell proliferation of major phytoplankton groups, but increased the cell number of dinoflagellates [
 <xref rid="B216-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>]. The growth of many dinoflagellate species under laboratory conditions is problematic, and mimosine can greatly enhance the isolation and culture of this group of phytoplankton. The data on autotoxicity of mimosine are ambiguous: it either did not affect the growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> seedlings [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], or only inhibited the shoot growth [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], or affected the germination of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mimosa pudica</italic>, another producer of mimosin, only in high concentration [
 <xref rid="B205-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. In soil, mimosine showed high biostabilityâ€”only 5.30 and 0.16% of mimosine decomposed after one and five days, respectively [
 <xref rid="B205-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. Thus, mimosine shows promise for use as a bioherbicide. To our knowledge, herbicidal activity of mimosine has not been evaluated in field, but it has been shown that
