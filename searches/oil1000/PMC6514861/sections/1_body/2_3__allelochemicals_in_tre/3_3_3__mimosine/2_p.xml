<p class="p">Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid structure analogue of dihydroxyphenylalanine with a 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone ring instead of a 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ring [
 <xref rid="B204-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. Mimosine is found in all parts of 
 <italic class="italic">L. leucocephala</italic>, but its content can vary by several dozen-fold: the lowest in xylem or developing flowers, the highest in mature seeds [

 <xref rid="B206-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. The mimosine content in the 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena</italic> leaves ranged from 2.77 to 5.75% of dry weight depending on variety [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>]. In another study with similar results amount of mimosine in leaves varied between 3.75 and 5.5% of dry weight depending on the type of leaves, season, and soil quality [
 <xref rid="B208-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>]. It was also shown that the mimosine content changes across the growth stages: as the leaves develop from non-flushed to mature, the mimosine content decreased from 38.8 to 11.1 µmol/g of fresh weight, whereas during seed ripening it increased from 19.7 to 171.3 µmol/g of fresh weight [
