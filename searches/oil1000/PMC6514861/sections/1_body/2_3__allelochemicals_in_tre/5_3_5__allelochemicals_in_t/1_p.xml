 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> alleochemicals can be divided into three groups: (1) essential oils (water-insoluble fractions); (2) phenolics (water soluble); and (3) water-soluble volatile fractions. Eucalypts are mainly known for their essential oils, which are widely used in pharmaceutics and cosmetology. These volatile substances regulate transpiration in plants, attract pollinating insects, protect plants from being eaten by animals, and impart resistance to pests and pathogens. Such a high biological activity of essential oils suggests their allelopathic effect. Essential oils are usually derived from the eucalypt foliage by steam distillation (hydrodistillation). They are represented by complex mixtures of monoterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>) and sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">15</sub>) with low levels of phenylpropanoids and acyclic hydrocarbon derivatives such as oxides, ethers, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones [

 <xref rid="B223-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>]. The composition of essential oils varies greatly in different eucalypts. In majority, the main components are monoterpenes 1,8-cineole (

 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic>, reaching 90%, and such oils are used in medicines, while the content of α-pinene usually does not exceed 20% [

The composition of the eucalypt essential oils can vary significantly not only depending on the type and variety, but also on geographic location, climate, soil, season, extraction method, and other factors that should be considered when conducting experiments.
