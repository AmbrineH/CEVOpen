<p class="p">Except for essential oils (water insoluble fractions) and phenolics (water soluble), another group of eucalypt allelochemicals is widely known and called water soluble volatile fractions. They have been studied relatively recently. Such fractions obtained during steam distillation of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus dundasii</italic> leaves demonstrated phytotoxicity against

Later, the compositions of the aqueous volatile fractions for four types of eucalypts were determined by gas chromatograph—mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 1,8-Cineole dominated (37.1–80.1%) in the compositions, while the other major components were isopentyl isovalerate, isomenthol, pinocarvone,

 <italic class="italic">Solanum elaeagnifolium</italic> Cav. The analysis of water soluble volatile fractions from other four eucalypt species also proved that they contained mostly 1,8-cineole (about 90%) [
