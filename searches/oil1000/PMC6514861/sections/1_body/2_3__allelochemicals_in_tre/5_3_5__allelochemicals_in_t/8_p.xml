<p class="p">It is known that the metabolic cost of the terpenoid biosynthesis due to their high level of chemical reduction is significantly higher than that of phenolics (3.11 and 2.11 g glucose/g metabolite), and, in addition, terpenoids are generally sequestered in complex secretory structures to avoid autotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B246-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>] are hypothesized that phenolics as the cheapest defence metabolites would predominate in the resource-limited seedlings, where as the most expensive terpenoidsâ€”in mature trees, once the costs of biosynthesis and foregone photosynthesis could be overcome by enhanced resource acquisition. They confirmed their hypothesis in studies on 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus froggattii</italic>, where they demonstrated that the ratio of total phenolics to total terpenoids significantly decreased in an exponential manner with plant ontogeny [
 <xref rid="B246-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. It is possible that the same situation is observed in other plant species containing phenolic and terpene allelochemicals. This once again confirms the importance of a long-term assessment of allelopathic effects for woody plants, since they largely depend on various environmental factors that may change significantly during the life of trees.
