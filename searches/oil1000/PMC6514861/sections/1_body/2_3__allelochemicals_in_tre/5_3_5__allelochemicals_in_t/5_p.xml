<p class="p">There are only a few studies where the phytotoxicity of various monoterpenes and their comparison were examined. They showed differences not only between different substances but also among isomers and substances with a similar chemical structure. Among the four monoterpenes, citronellol, citronellal, 1,4-cineole (

Despite the similarity of the structure, 1,4- and 1,8-cineole have different modes of action on two weedy plant species: 1,8-cineole severely decreased all stages of mitosis, while 1,4-cineole decreased only the prophase stage [
