 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl phenol was the strongest) and stimulatory at low concentrations. The effects on the root activities were more obvious. This fact can explain the poorer vegetation in the eucalypt plantations. This observation was confirmed in [

 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic> litter leachates, whereas the effect of litter leachate varied from stimulation to suppression for six species native to Australia (reduction in average by 1%). In the field conditions, the reduction of species composition, richness and height of plant communities under
