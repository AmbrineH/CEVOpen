<p class="p">In the research of the eucalypt phytotoxicity the main focus was made on essential oils and monoterpenes, but its allelochemistry is not limited to these substances. In the early 1970s, del Moral and Muller [
 <xref rid="B241-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>] stated that both terpenes and phenolic acids are important phytotoxic agents produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>. Later, the relation between the phenolic composition of the leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> and their allelopathic properties was shown by Souto et al. [
 <xref rid="B242-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">242</xref>]. The leachates of bark, fresh leaves and leaf litter of 
 <italic class="italic">E. tereticornis</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis, E. polycarpa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. microtheca</italic> showed the presence of coumaric, gallic, gentisic, hydroxybenzoic, syringic and vanillic acids, and catechol [
 <xref rid="B243-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">243</xref>]. Bioassay with leachates reduced the germination and the seedling length of 
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus mungo</italic> L., while phenolics may have an inhibitory, neutral or occasionally stimulating effect depending on the substance and concentration. The research of phenolics was increased in recent years. For the aqueous extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. saligna</italic> leaf litter, a correlation between the phenol content and phytotoxicity on grassland species was shown [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Phenolic compounds in leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">E. camaldulensis</italic> inhibited the growth and a number of plants physiological processes in laboratory and field studies, and the weeds reacted more strongly than crops [
 <xref rid="B244-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">244</xref>]. Monoterpenes and phenolic compounds have a different effect on the plants. Del Moral and Muller [
 <xref rid="B241-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>] reported that terpenes influence the annual grassland flora only after becoming adsorbed to soil particles, while the rains leach phenolics from litter into the soil. It was also suggested in [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] that phenolic derivatives may be leached by rainfall, but the phytotoxicity of monoterpenes of 
 <italic class="italic">E. saligna</italic> is determined by volatilization from leaf litter.
