<p class="p">The composition of volatile organic compounds in solutions obtained by a natural way was significantly different from solutions obtained by a steam distillation. In total, 28 potential allelochemicals were found in aqueous extracts of the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">E. grandis</italic>, and 38 were found in rhizospheric soil extracts, but 1,8-cineole was not found in them [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Twenty components, including alkane, aromatic ester, arene, and phenol, were found in both roots and the rhizosphere soils. This fact suggests that a significant proportion of allelochemicals in the soil can be released from the roots. These results are not consistent with data obtained in the research on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into water extracts during root exudation, foliage and leaf litter leaching, and leaf litter decomposition in the laboratory or from field soil around 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus urophylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B250-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">250</xref>]. The studies have proved that VOCs were not extracted from the root exudates in soil water, while 12 VOCs were identified in foliage, leaf litter leachates, and the leaf litter decomposition extracts, nine of which were identical, but differed in concentrations. Terpinen-4-ol prevailed in the compositions of both types of extracts, while 1,8-cineole was 19.8 in foliage and leaf litter, but 8.0% in the decomposited leaf litter extracts. These extracts significantly inhibited seed germination and seedling growth of
