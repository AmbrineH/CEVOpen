<p class="p">At the same time, the soil can significantly affect allelopathy: toxins can either accumulate or oxidize and lose their activity depending on the soil composition. It was shown that the inhibitory effect of the

 <italic class="italic">E. urophylla</italic> leaf leachates on 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica shinensis</italic> was more pronounced in the sterilized soils [

 <xref rid="B125-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] found that the soil microbiome biotransformed an allelochemical (-)-epicatechin (EC

 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron formosanum</italic>, into a more phytotoxic active compound, protocatechuic acid (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 4.3–4.4 mM). This study revealed the significance of the allelopathic interactions between plants and microorganisms in the rhizosphere.
