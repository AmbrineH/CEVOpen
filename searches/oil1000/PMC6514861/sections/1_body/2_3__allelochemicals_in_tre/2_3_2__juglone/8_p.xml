<p class="p">Joint cultivation of not only the nuciferous together with the herbaceous agricultural crops (agroforestry), but the use thereof in mixed plantations of forest species could be of interest. It also requires assessment of the allelopathic wood species compatibility with other trees; but due to the longevity of such plantations, accumulation of allelochemicals in soil should be taken into account, which is less important for the herbaceous crops. Juglone level in soil, and therefore its toxicity to plants, is determined by a balance between its entry through washing out from leaves, tree waste, roots exudation and its movement to the underlying soil layers and decomposition in soil. Juglone is slightly soluble in water, which limits its leaching in soil, but interaction with soil particles accompanied by microbial activity could reduce its concentration. Rietveld [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] reported that walnut allelopathy seemed to be a characteristic feature for poorly drained soils, where chemical and microbial oxidation was restricted, and with well-drained soils it could missing even for sensitive species. Later, bacteria that could degrade juglone were isolated from soil beneath the black walnut trees [
 <xref rid="B197-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>]. Von Kiparski et al. [
 <xref rid="B198-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">198</xref>] showed that juglone concentration in soil pore water did not exceed the inhibition threshold reported for typical intercrops such as maize and soybeans. In soil, juglone was exposed to both microbial degradation and abiotic transformation reactions. However, the authors reported that in black walnut plants substantial concentrations of juglone were released into the rhizosphere soils, and in acidic soils were low in organic carbon, and fertility juglone could be accumulated up to phytotoxic levels. Strugstad and Despotovski [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>] reported on the persistence of juglone in the soil; thus, after removing the walnut trees toxicity could persist for up to one year following removal. On the other hand, it was shown that juglone could be released from Manchurian walnut roots into the soil in a sufficient quantity, but it rapidly degraded due to interactions with soil factors [
 <xref rid="B200-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>]. All this indicates the need for long-term field tests to determine the optimal composition of mixed plantations under specific soil and climatic conditions. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B200-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] demonstrated that survival of Manchurian walnut seedlings was higher in the larch and mixed-species plantations than in the pure Manchurian walnut plantation, and they were growing better in greenhouses in larch and mixed-species soils than in the Manchurian walnut soil. The reason for the Manchurian walnut growth stimulation could lie in increasing the soil microbial populations and the enzyme activities under the larch root exudates influence. Other studies of Manchurian walnut (
 <italic class="italic">Juglans mandshurica</italic>) and larch (
 <italic class="italic">Larix gmelinii</italic>) mixed plantations showed that Manchurian walnut root orders under interspecific competition possess limited plasticity compared to larch [
 <xref rid="B201-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>]. The authors suggested that the Manchurian walnut “strategy” is based on competition via juglone exudation and not exploitative competition, resulting in a lower plasticity in uptake-related root traits.
