<p class="p">Unlike other wood allelopathic cultures, which phytotoxicity was firstly examined using extracts and filtrates, and only afterwards the effect of main components was investigated, with the walnut main attention being paid to juglone, the active substance, and not to the vegetable extracts. Juglone inhibited growth of coniferous species seedlings (
