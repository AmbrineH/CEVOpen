<p class="p">Juglone herbicidal activity was estimated by spraying potted plants including four types of weeds and wheat (

Chlorophyll contents were decreased with all the species, but to a lesser extent in wheat and barley compared to weeds. These differences could indicate a certain selectivity of juglone, since all weed species were dicots. It has been shown that the mature fruits of the Persian walnut (
