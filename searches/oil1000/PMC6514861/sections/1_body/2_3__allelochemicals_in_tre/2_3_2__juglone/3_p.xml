<p class="p">Juglone could be found in various parts of walnut trees: leaves, stems, fruit hulls, inner bark, and roots [

 <xref rid="B179-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>], the maximum concentration of juglone in black walnut trees was noted in fruits, in leaves it fell almost two-fold, in vegetative and flower buds by 5–7%, and in conducting tissues as unit percents and fractions of a percent of the content in fruits. Juglone content in the walnut kemel varied from 7 to 19 mg/100 g, and in the thin skin (pellicle)—from 190 to 727 mg/100 g depending on the variety [
 <xref rid="B180-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>]. While in the fresh walnut leaves the juglone content ranged from 13.1 to 1556.0 mg/100 g of dry weight [
 <xref rid="B181-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>]. Juglone content in annual shoots of four walnut varieties was increasing from the end of May, and reached its maximum in mid-July (average of about 200 mg/100 g DW). After that it was decreasing, and dynamics looked similar for all the varieties [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>]. Similar dynamics was demonstrated for walnut leaves: accumulation peak was observed in mid-July (48.2–108.0; average of 73.8 mg/100 g of fresh weight in nine grades) [
