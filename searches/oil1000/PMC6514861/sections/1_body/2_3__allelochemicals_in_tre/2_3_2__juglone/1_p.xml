<p class="p">Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) is the main allelochemical in the 
 <italic class="italic">Juglans</italic> genus. Juglone was first extracted in 1856 from a pericarp of walnut [
 <xref rid="B172-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]); and somewhat later it was synthesized, and its structure was determined [
 <xref rid="B173-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>]. Massey [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] suggested that the toxic for tomato plants compound made of the black walnut extract might be the juglone; and soon Davis [
 <xref rid="B174-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>] demonstrated for the first time that the substance from hulls and roots of black walnut that was toxic for tomato and alfalfa plant was juglone.
