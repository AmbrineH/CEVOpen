<p class="p">Numerous studies were conducted to study the juglone phytotoxicity mechanism. Studies performed using hydroponically grown 
 <italic class="italic">Zea mays</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Glycine max</italic> L. Merr. Soy plants showed that juglone inhibited the following physiological parameters: photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf and root respiration [

 <sup class="sup">+</sup>-ATPase activity, water uptake, and acid efflux [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Juglone decreased chlorophyll 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> contents and reduced some anatomical structures (xylem vessel and bundle radius of stem, stomata length and stomata number of the cotyledons) of the cucumber seedlings [

 <xref rid="B188-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">188</xref>] showed that exposure to juglone led to significant increase in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, lignin content and its
