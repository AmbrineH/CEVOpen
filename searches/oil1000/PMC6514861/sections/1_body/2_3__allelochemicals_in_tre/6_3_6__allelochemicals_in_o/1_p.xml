<p class="p">Woody plants may contain allelochemicals of different chemical nature. From leaf and litter of 
 <italic class="italic">Alstonia scholaris</italic> Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] isolated three allelochemicals that were identified as pentacyclic triterpenoids: oleanolic acid, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid. These compounds inhibited the seed germination and radicle growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Bidens pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic>, and field studies demonstrated that concentration of ursolic acid in the 
 <italic class="italic">A. scholaris</italic> soil was significantly negatively correlated with weed coverage during the summer and winter. In this work, it was demonstrated for the first time that triterpenoids have an inhibitory effect on photosystem II [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Another example is related to the quinolizidine alkaloids in legumes. For nitrogen-fixing plants in the Fabaceae family, the nitrogen is not a limiting element, and they differ from other species by the ability to accumulate nitrogen-containing allelochemicals—alkaloids (
 <italic class="italic">Lupinus</italic> spp.) or non-protein amino acid mimosine (
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena leucocephala</italic>). The quinolizidine alkaloids protect plants of the genus Lupinus from pests [
 <xref rid="B253-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">253</xref>], and it has long been known that they have allelopathic activity [
 <xref rid="B254-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>,
 <xref rid="B255-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">255</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">Lupinus</italic> species are usually herbs or low shrubs, but there is an exception—an arboreous lupine 
 <italic class="italic">Lupinus jaimehintoniana</italic>. This 5 to 8 m tall subdominant tree was discovered in south Mexico in the middle of the 1990′s [
 <xref rid="B256-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">256</xref>]. Villa-Ruano et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>] indentified for the first time five quinolizidine alkaloids in leaves, seeds, shoots and phloem of 
 <italic class="italic">L. jaimehintoniana</italic>, including lupanine (the most abundant), 5,6-dehydrolupanine, d-thermopsine, sparteine, and nuttalline (traces) and demonstrated the inhibiting effect of the semi-purified alkaloid extracts on the germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> seeds.
