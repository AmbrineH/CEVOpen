<p class="p">The role of volatile compounds (VOCs) of plants from the 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> genus on the environment was first reported by Souza-Alonso et al. [
 <xref rid="B218-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">218</xref>], who evaluated the impact of VOCs from various parts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> on plant development and identified them using GC and GC/MS. The composition of the volatile substances of leaves, flowers and litter differed both qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of 67 substances with a predominance of aliphatic compounds, nine of which were common to the three isolates, were detected. VOCs, mainly from flowers, where high levels of heptadecadiene, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-nonadecane, octadecene, and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-tricosane could be responsible for inhibition, reduced germination and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium subterraneum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium multiflorum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Medicago sativa</italic>. The increase in peroxidase activity and malodialdehyde content was noticed in two species, which suggests oxidative stress and membrane damage [

 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> flowers decreased germination and growth of their own seedlings, whereas throughfall leachate, on the contrary, stimulated the growth of their own roots [
