<p class="p">Later, similar studies with VOCs were carried out on 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia cyanophylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B219-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia longifolia</italic>, where the dense atmosphere under thick canopies could be associated with reduction in plant richness [
 <xref rid="B220-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>]. In both studies, significant allelopathic activity was shown against a number of plant species. The number of identified substances was lower: 51 in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cyanophylla</italic> and 59 in 
 <italic class="italic">A. longifolia</italic>. The composition of VOCs from 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> was rather similar to 
 <italic class="italic">A. longifolia</italic>, while in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cyanophylla</italic> it was significantly different from the other two species. Presumably, this is due not only to species-specificity, but also to different methods of extraction. Only single compounds, such as decanal, octanol, nonanal, and nonadecane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>), were present in all the species. The composition of VOCs varied significantly within various plant parts. Qualitative and quantitative differences between various parts of plants in VOCs composition, but the similar negative effects on seedlings suggest that they are caused by the entire set of VOCs rather than by a single compound [
 <xref rid="B220-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>]. All of these studies were carried out only under laboratory conditions thus field testing is required.
