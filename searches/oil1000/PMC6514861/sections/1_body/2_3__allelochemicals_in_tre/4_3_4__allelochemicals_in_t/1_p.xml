<p class="p">The allelopathic properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia dealbata</italic> and other 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> species have long been known, and Reigosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, gentisic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric, and ferulic acids may be responsible for its toxicity. However, the first study to identify non-volatile allelochemicals has been carried out quite recently. Analysis of the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. dealbata</italic> demonstrated that the leaves mainly contain resorcinol (phenol), maculosin (cyclodipeptide), moretenone (triterpene); while stigmasterol (steroid), D-Î±-tocopherol quinone (quinone), and lupanin (quinolizidine alkaloid) were identified in pods, and methyl 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-anisate (phenylpropanoid), 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>anisyl alcohol (phenylpropanoid), stigmasterol, and anisal (benzaldehyde) in flowers [

 <italic class="italic">A. melanoqlon</italic> showed a predominance of luteolin and apigenin (flavons) in roots, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol in leaves [
