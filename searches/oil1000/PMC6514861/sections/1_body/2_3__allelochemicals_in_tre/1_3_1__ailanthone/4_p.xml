<p class="p">The experimental results showed that ailanthone has a powerful herbicidal and post-emergence effect, which can be compared to synthetic herbicides such as glyphosate and paraquat [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. Its disadvantages include low selectivity and rapid degradation by soil microorganisms. It turned out to be toxic for both weeds and crops, both for monocots and dicots (to a greater extent), but some species from the

 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. Due to microbial activity, the ailanthone lost phytotoxicity after five days in normal soil, but kept it high for 21 days in sterile soil [
