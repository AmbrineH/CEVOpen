 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> produces a range of quassinoids, including ailanthone, amarolide, acetyl amarolide, 2-dihydroailanthone, ailanthinone, chaparrin, chaparrinone, quassin, neoquassin, shinjulactone, and shinjudilactone [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. In the mid-1990s, it was confirmed that the reason for the phytotoxic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> is ailanthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Its inhibitory effects on 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica juncea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eragrostis tef</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lemna minor</italic> were shown in bioassays [
 <xref rid="B166-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>], and then confirmed on 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. Later, De Feo et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] identified several additional quassinoid derivatives and showed that ailanthinone (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01636-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) also have an inhibitory effect on germination and growth of the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> L., and 
 <italic class="italic">Portulaca oleracea</italic> L. The most powerful allelochemical is ailanthone. Since the inhibitory effect of the extracts depended on the solvent and the plant organ, the authors suggested that the quality and quantity of allelochemicals may vary in different organs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic>. Ailanthone also demonstrated anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities [
 <xref rid="B167-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. Recently, a number of other metabolites has been identified in the cortex of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic>, among which tetracyclic triterpenoids (altissimanins) and terpenylated coumarin (altissimacoumarin) are of particular interest as potential allelochemicals [
