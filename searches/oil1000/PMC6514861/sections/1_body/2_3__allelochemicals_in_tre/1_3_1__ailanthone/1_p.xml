<p class="p">The tissues of various 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus</italic> species contain a large number of biologically active compounds, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, and volatile oils—about 200 in total [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Studies periodically discover new ones, for example, in the

 <xref rid="B162-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. Among them, the quassinoids stand out and represent highly oxygenated degraded triterpenes with a bitter taste, which can be found only in the
