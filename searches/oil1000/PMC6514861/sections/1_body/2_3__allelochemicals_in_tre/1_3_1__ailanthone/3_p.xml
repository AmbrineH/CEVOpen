<p class="p">The phytotoxicity of ailanthone suggested its use as a natural herbicide. Heisey [
 <xref rid="B169-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>] showed that the phytotoxin was mostly concentrated in bark of roots (up to 1 g/kg DW) and stems of 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic>. In the greenhouse, treatment with root bark extract of ailanthone at a dose equivalent of 0.5 kg/ha resulted in the complete death of five among seven plant species [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. Studies have shown that the post-emergence herbicidal activity of ailanthone was higher than pre-emergence one [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>,
 <xref rid="B166-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>]. Similar results were showed by the field tests. Post-emergence treatment of 17 species of weeds and crops with stem bark extracts led to the death or severe damage of most species in 5â€“6 days [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>]. Ailanthone, apparently, was not autotoxic because neither extracts [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] nor aylanton in the maximum dose of 8 kg/ha [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>] did not affect the growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">A. altissima</italic> plants, but the mechanism(s) of this phenomenon are unknown. Heisey [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-01636" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>] suggested acylation and glucosylation of ailanthone and subsequent compartmentalization in vacuoles.
