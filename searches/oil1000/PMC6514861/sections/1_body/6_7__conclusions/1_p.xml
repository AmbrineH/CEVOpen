<p class="p">In recent years, great progress has been achieved in study of allelopathy of woody plants. In addition, a number of new allelochemicals has been identified. Recent advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have played an important role in deciphering the metabolic pathways for a number of phytotoxins. However, in general, there are still not enough data on their biosynthesis, transport, excretion systems, and changes in the soil. The genetics of allelopathic processes in woody plants has been poorly researched. Studies conducted on biotechnological areas, obviously, are not enough. The wide distribution of the forest plantations, especially for species with pronounced allelopathic potential, such as eucalypt and acacia, and in new areas requires a comprehensive study. It is necessary to take into account the influence of various factors on the qualitative and quantitative allelochemical compositions. Such interactions as synergism and antagonism between different allelochemical substances should be evaluated. It is also necessary to use field tests and modern molecular research methods more widely. As for the forest ecosystems, the previously defined concept of allelopathy as a localized interaction of plants and plants through the release of allelochemicals has been expanded in recent years to a phenomenon at the ecosystem level. Therefore, it is necessary to apply modeling techniques taking climate change into account. These areas should be at the center of future research.</p>
