<p id="Par19" class="p">At the end of the experiment, all rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and sacrificed by cervical decapitation after overnight fasting for 12 h. Blood samples were collected from the femoral artery; the liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue (including the epididymal fat pads and perirenal fat pads) were surgically removed and weighed immediately. The blood samples were allowed to coagulate and were then centrifuged at 3000 
 <italic class="italic">r/min</italic> for 15 minutes. The serum was stored at -20 °C until analysis. The liver, kidney and adipose tissues were weighed, immediately placed on ice bags, and then stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. The naso-anal length (distance from nose to anus) of the animals was also measured on the 60th day before the animals were sacrificed. The animal experimental protocols were conducted according to guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Southeast University.
