<p id="Par25" class="p">The Lee index can reflect the level of body fat in an animal. All of the rats were analyzed, and the results indicated a significant increase in adipose tissue in the HFD-A and HFD-B groups. The Lee index of the rats in the HFD groups was significantly higher than that in the other groups, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Additionally, the Lee index in the GO-M, GO-H, OO-L and OO-H groups was significantly lower than that in the HFD-B group. Additionally, all of the epididymal fat pads and perirenal fat pads were dissected out and weighed; the actual and relative weights in the HFD-A and HFD-B groups were greater than those in the NC group. Compared with the HFD-B group, the epididymal fat pads in the GO-M, GO-H, OO-L and OO-H groups and the perirenal fat pads in the GO-H and OO-H were significantly lower in weight, and the ratios of adipose tissue to body weight in the GO-H, OO-L and OO-H groups were also significantly lower than those in the HFD-B group.
