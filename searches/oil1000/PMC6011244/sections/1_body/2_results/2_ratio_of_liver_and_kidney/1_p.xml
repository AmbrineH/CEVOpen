 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The ratio of liver to body weight was higher in the HFD-A and HFD-B groups than in the NC group, while the ratio of kidney weight to body weight was the opposite. Additionally, the ratios of liver to body weight in the GO-M, GO-H, OO-L and OO-H groups and the ratios of kidney weight to body weight in the GO-M, OO-L, OO-H groups were significantly higher than that in the HFD-B group.
