<p class="p">The water permeabilities of coating materials before and after the modification of PUs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>. The unmodified shells present a 23.6% water permeability. In contrast, the water permeabilities of PCU shells were significantly reduced to 11.0%, 10.0%, and 7.8%, after the modification by KH550, HTPMS, and KH550/HTPMS, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a). The water permeability varies with the ratio of KH550/HTPMS, and when the ratio of KH550/HTPMS is 0.3:0.7, the water permeability reaches the minimum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b). The decreased water permeability was associated with the increased cross-linking degree of modified PUs and the more compaction of cross-linking network structure. In fact, the cross-linking degree was increased significantly after the modification of the organic silicone, especially after the modification of the double organic silicone. On the other hand, the lowest water permeability of PU modified by KH550/HTPMS may also come from the different molecular weight of modifiers that makes the densification of cross-linking network structure of the modified PUs. The inactive components, the coating that reacts with the curing agents to form the PUs film, were fixed stable in the coating shells [
