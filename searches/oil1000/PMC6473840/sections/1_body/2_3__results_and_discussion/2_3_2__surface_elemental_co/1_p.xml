 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the XPS survey of PUs before and after the modification by KH550/HTPMS. Both PUs and K-H-PUs show three identical peaks at 284, 399, and 532 eV, which were distributed to carbon (1s), nitrogen (1s), and oxygen (1s), respectively. In contrast, two peaks at 101 and 153 eV were assigned to silicon (2p) and silicon (2s) in K-H-PUs [
