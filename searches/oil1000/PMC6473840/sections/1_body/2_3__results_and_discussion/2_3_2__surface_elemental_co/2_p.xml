<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the C1s peaks of the XPS spectra for PUs were fitted by a multipeak Lorentzian fitting program (XPS peak). The surface binding states of PUs before and after modification are C–C, C–N, C–O, and –COO. After it was modified by KH550/HTPMS, the C–O contents obviously dropped from 28.97% to 24.55%. Conversely, the C–N and –COO content increased from 14.80% to 16.05% and from 12.53% to 14.78%, respectively (
