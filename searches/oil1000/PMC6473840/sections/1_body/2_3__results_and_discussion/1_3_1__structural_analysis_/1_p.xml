<p class="p">The FTIR spectra of RO, ERO, and ARO are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a. In the FTIR spectrum of RO, the characteristic peaks at 3010 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1760 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to the C=C–H and C=O stretching vibrations, respectively. In the spectrum of ERO, the new peaks at 910 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a ERO at high resolution) and 3460 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were assigned to the stretching vibration of epoxy groups and hydroxyl group [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], respectively. At the same time, the peak at 3010 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was weakened, demonstrating that C=C–H bonds were partially oxidized to form epoxy groups. In the spectrum of ARO, the characteristic peak at 910 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> disappeared and the peak at 3460 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was obviously enhanced, indicating that a small amount of hydroxyl groups transformed from epoxy group by a ring-opening reaction, which means that the RO was successfully modified.
