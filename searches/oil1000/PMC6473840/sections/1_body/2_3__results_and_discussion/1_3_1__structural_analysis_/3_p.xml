<p class="p">To further confirm the formation of coating PUs, the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The peaks near δ = 7.5 ppm (2 and 3) indicate two kinds of hydrogen absorption peaks over benzene ring of isocyanate, respectively [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The peaks at δ = 4.1 ppm (5) represent the hydrogen of methylene carbons connected with benzene rings. In addition, the protons signals of 4 and 6 are from the methylene at different reaction ends of modified recycled oil. These results further support the successful fabrication of PU coatings. Notably, the peak of 7 appears in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectrum of modified PUs at δ = 6.1 ppm, indicating that the hydrogen absorption peak of the amide bond produced by the reaction of the amino group of KH550 with the isocyanate group. Moreover, the proton characteristic signals of KH550 and HTPMS could also be clearly found in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR of K-H-Pus; it shows that the two coatings modified with organic silicone were successfully prepared through the complete polymerization reaction as shown in
