<p class="p">In the FTIR spectrum of KH550 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b), the characteristic peaks at 1380 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1460 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to the stretching or bending vibration of C–N, C–H, and N–H, respectively [
 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In the FTIR spectrum of HTPMS, the peaks at 802 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1060 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1260 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and 3340 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were assigned to the Si–CH

 <xref rid="B31-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In the FTIR spectrum of MDI-50, the peaks at 2280 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicate the –NCO and benzene ring skeleton. In the FTIR spectrum of K-H-PUs, the peak at 2280 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> assigned for the –NCO group on MDI-50 was greatly weakened, and a new peak at the 3360 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> assigned for the –NH group appeared, which means the formation of PUs. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks at 802 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1060 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and 1260 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> mean that the organic silicone was successfully modified on PUs.
