 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, the cohesive film with a thickness of approximately 10 Î¼m was observed. Meanwhile, the existence of orientation along the particle surface was observed (arrow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b), originating from the sample preparation process, in which the sample received the force only in one direction during the coating process. Furthermore, the best interfacial could be seen clearly between the film and the urea granules. There was a protrusion on the surface of the coating which was caused by a brittle fracture process. The photograph of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows that the core urea particles fertilizers were released completely in aqueous solution and only left the PU coating materials. The integrity of the polyurethane coating remained intact after the complete release of urea. It is noted that the polyurethane has a good film-forming property and a complete coating on the surface of urea particles.
