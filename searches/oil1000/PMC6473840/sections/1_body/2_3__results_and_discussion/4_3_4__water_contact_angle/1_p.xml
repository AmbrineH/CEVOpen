<p class="p">The water contact angle images are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. It was found that the modified coating shell illustrated improves hydrophobic property. Compared to the unmodified shells, which the average value was 65.1° for contact angle, PCU shells modified with KH550/HTPMS have much higher contact angles of 103.4°, 105.5°, 102.6°, 102.6°, and 99.6° with the ratios of KH550/HTPMS as 0.1:0.9, 0.2:0.8, 0.3:0.7, 0.4:0.6, and 0.5:0.5, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The improved hydrophobicity is respected to be very important for the constant release behavior of the fertilizer. (The standard deviations are 0.84, 0.78, 0.64, 0.92, and 0.89, respectively.)
