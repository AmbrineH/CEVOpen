<p class="p">The nutrient release profile, estimated as the nitrogen cumulative dissolution rate versus time, was essential for the fertilizer release behavior with the modified PU as coating films. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> illustrates the effect of coating films on the nutrient release profile with the unmodified PUs and the PUs modified with KH550/HTPMS. Compared with the unmodified PUs, PCU shells modified by KH550/HTPMS have a much slower nitrogen release rate. This mainly comes from the increased hydrophobicity, the increased thermal stability, and the reduced water permeability. Especially, a higher thermal stability shows stronger chemical bonds, resulting in less influence of environment. It is noted that when the ratio of KH550/HTPMS was 0.3:0.7, the release percent of nitrogen at the first 15 days were the slowest constant and the release percent reached 50 percent after 30 days. As the water permeability of the coating material decreased, the hindrance of water entering the urea particles through the polyurethane coating increased, hence the longer of urea release period. The coated fertilizer has great potential research implication compared to some current studies where hydroxyl-terminated dimethyl silicone modified transgenic soybean oil as an bio-based coating materials for controlled-release urea fertilizers, in which the nitrogen release reached 60 percent after 30 days [
