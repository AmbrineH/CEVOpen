<p class="p">The stability properties and degradation behavior were also studied by techniques of TGA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a. The results show two different degradation stages starting at about 170 °C and 320 °C, which mainly comes from the decomposition of PUs and urea [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b, the first degradation stage of PUs occurred at 250–300 °C, and isocyanate and alcohol were produced; the second degradation stage occurred at 420–510 °C, and secondary amine, olefin, and CO

 <xref rid="polymers-11-00454-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the thermal stability properties of PU shells were apparently improved after modification with KH550/HTPMS. For example, the temperatures for 5 % and 50 % mass loss (according to the literature [

 <xref rid="polymers-11-00454-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Particularly, the decomposition temperature of PCU reached the maximum when the ratio of KH550:HTMS was 0.5:0.5; it was possibly because the Si–O bond required more energy to dissociate than the C–C and C–O bond.
