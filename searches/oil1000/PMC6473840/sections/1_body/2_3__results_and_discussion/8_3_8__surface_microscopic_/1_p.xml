Compared to the modified shells, the surface of the unmodified shells was rougher and with lumps, swelling significantly, and there were obvious holes after the release of urea which might be easier to allow water to enter the shell to dissolve the urea for N release. However, the surface roughness of the modified polyurethane coating decreases obviously after the urea release.
