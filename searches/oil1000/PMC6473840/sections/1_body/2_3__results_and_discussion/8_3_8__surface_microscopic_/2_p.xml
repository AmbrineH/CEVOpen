 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>f consists some small pores with uniform size and distribution, so the urea release is greatly hindered and the release rate is slow in the process. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>g, the surface pores of the PCU shells are the smallest, the size and distribution are more uniform, and the hole is almost invisible; hence the urea is the biggest obstacle in the release process where the release of N in the urea and the release rate is the slowest. Compared to the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>g, the surface pores of the PCU shells are larger and smaller in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>h, and the holes are obvious, so that the hindrance in the urea release process is smaller. These results are consistent with the cumulative release curve of N. The holes of polyurethanes were obviously decreased after the modification of the silicon, which may be the three-dimensional networks formed, and the urea is hindered in different degrees during the release process, thus slowing down the release rate of urea. With the size and distribution being more uniform with the pores in the polyurethane surface, the coating material had a lower water permeability and the water entering the particles through the coating was even more obstructed, so it took longer to dissolve the urea core. Therefore, the release period of N was longer.
