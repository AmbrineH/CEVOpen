 <xref rid="B28-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] with slightly modification. Typically, 150 g of recovered oil was added to a 3L-four-necked reaction kettle equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and water condenser. The system was heated at 80 °C in an oil bath under a nitrogen environment. Then, 25 g of peroxyacetic acid and 1 g diluted sulfuric acid (3 wt.%) were added to the system. After stirring for 2 h, the diluted NaOH aqueous solution was added into the system until the oil became neutral. After washing several times with saturated NaCl solution and distilled water, the epoxidation recycled oil (ERO) was obtained by vacuum distillation. Then, 75 mL ethylene glycol and 7.5 g aluminum chloride were added to ERO and heated for 2 h at 95 °C under nitrogen protection. Finally, the system was washed with distilled water to remove the unreacted ethylene glycol, and alcoholization-recycled oil (ARO) was obtained after vacuum distillation.
