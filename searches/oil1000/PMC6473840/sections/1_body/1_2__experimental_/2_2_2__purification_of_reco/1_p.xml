<p class="p">The major components of oils include high-grade fatty acid glycerides, various unsaturated acids, etc. Therefore, this work mainly utilized the recovered oils as raw material, and their degradation products formed during regular use, including food impurities, gels, etc., were removed by filtration to remain as the main components of pure oil. A certain amount of recovered oil was filtered several times and treated with phosphoric acid (0.8 wt.% of oil) for 8 h at 70 째C with stirring in an oil bath. Then, distilled water (10 wt.% of oil) was added to the oil, and the upper oil part was obtained after centrifugation. The oil was heated at 100 째C for a period of time and was neutralized with NaOH solution. A NaCl aqueous solution (6 wt.% of Oil) was added to the oil and stirred for 6 h, and then distilled water (10 wt.% oil) was added under stirring. After centrifugation, the obtained upper oil sample was obtained and heated at 110 째C for 1 h to remove water, and then an appropriate amount of acticarbons were added to remove the impurities. Finally, the recovered oil (RO) was obtained by hot filtration with an oil temperature at about 70 째C.</p>
