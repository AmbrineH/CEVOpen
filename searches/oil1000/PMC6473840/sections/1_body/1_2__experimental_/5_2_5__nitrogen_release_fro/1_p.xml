<p class="p">The nitrogen release experiments were performed according to the reference reported by Oertli et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] with slight modification. Typically, three replicates of 5 g of the PCUs sample and 200 g of soil were mixed uniformly, and then, the mixtures were put into a polyvinyl chloride pipe with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of 60 cm. At the bottom of PVC tube, a layer of thin gauze was equipped for filtration. At certain time intervals (every 5 days until 30 days), 100 mL of distilled water was added into the tube and the filtrate through the gauze was collected. In order to investigate the release behavior of the fertilizer, the nitrogen amount released from the PCUs samples was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy (TU-1810) by measuring the absorbance at the wavelength of Î» = 440 nm [
