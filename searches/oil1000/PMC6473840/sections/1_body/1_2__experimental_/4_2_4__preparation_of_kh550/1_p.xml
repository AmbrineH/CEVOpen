<p class="p">KH550/HTPMS (20 wt.% of oil) was added into the ARO with stirring at 80 °C for 2 h. The weight ratios of the KH550 and HTPMS were adjusted from 0.1:0.9, 0.2:0.8, 0.3:0.7, 0.4:0.6, to 0.5:0.5, respectively. The coating process was performed in a BYC-300 coating machine with the rotation speed and temperature of the coating drum at 60 rpm and 60 °C, respectively. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00454-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 150 g urea was added to the BYC-300 coating machine, followed by the addition of 5 g of the mixture of KH550/HTPMS/ARO, and then 2.7 g MDI-50 was added into the coating machine. The polyurethane materials coated urea (PCUs) was obtained after reaction for 10 min and then kept for another 24 h in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. For the control experiment, the double organic silicone-modified polyurethane materials (K-H-PUs) were obtained with the same conditions without urea. Especially, no final purification step was performed here because the isocyanate groups are excessive in comparison with the other reactive groups during the preparation process, and the ratio of excess isocyanate groups in the system is constant for each experiment, which ensures the reproducibility of the experiment and has little effect on the materials. The properties of the final materials depend on the synthesized polyurethane.
