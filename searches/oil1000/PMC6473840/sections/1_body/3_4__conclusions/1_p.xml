<p class="p">In summary, a novel bio-based PUs was fabricated from recycled oil modified by double organic silicone and utilized as coating films for controlled-release fertilizers. The slow and constant nitrogen release behaviors from the fertilizer could be attributed to the lower water permeability, higher hydrophobicity, and higher thermal stability of the PU coatings which were modified by KH550/HTPMS. The optimal weight ratio for KH550/HTPMS was 0.3:0.7 because of the slow release profile. The overall results showed that the recycled oil could be used in the slow release fertilizer, which not only reduced the loss of nutrients and prolonged the fertilizer cycle but also reduced the waste and improved the agricultural ecological environment.</p>
