<p class="p">Hogwash oil has a wide range of sources and a low cost. The large output is very harmful to people’s lives. For instance, more and more attention has been paid to the resource utilization of hogwash oil. Typically, hogwash oil is widely used in the field of surfactant, cleaning agent, biodiesel, and so on [

 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In other words, the hogwash oil can also be defined as the recovered oil; however, the recovered oil is often casually treated and ignored because it is innocuous and harmless, which causes waste of some resources and pollutes the environment. As our continued research is interested in the resource utilization of hogwash oil [

 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00454" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], herein, we developed the double organic silicone-modified recycled-oil-based polyurethane as a coating material to prepare degradable polymer coating urea for constant fertilizer release. The moisture, heat resistance, and sustained release properties of polyurethane materials (PUs) were investigated by modifying with hydroxyl-terminated polydimethyl silicone (HTPMS) and γ-Aminopropyl triethoxy silane (KH550). The results indicated that HTPMS improves the hydrophobicity of PUs for its low cohesive energy density and good water resistance [

Moreover, the presence of silicon plays an important role in all functions of the body and is directly related to the absorption of minerals. This degradable polymer coating urea is promising in protecting agricultural/ecological environment and also could make full use of recovered oil.
