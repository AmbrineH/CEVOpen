<p class="p">The use of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF), especially PCF, play an important role in the nutrient release profiles by providing obstacles to the mixing of nutrients with water [

Recently, biodegradable materials, which are environmentally friendly, have shown good results in maintaining the optimal controlled-release rate [

Particularly, coated fertilizer with biodegradable materials can not only enhance the absorbed nutrients in the fertilizer but also avoid the decrease of physical and chemical properties of the soil caused by nutrient loss [
