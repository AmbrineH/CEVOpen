<p class="p">The results also showed that reserpine significantly decreased the total antioxidant capacity of the brain and partially increased serum and brain levels of MDA. The use of Marze essential oil at 100 mg/kg significantly increased the reserpine-induced reduction in the brain TAC and decreased the reserpine-induced increase in brain MDA level. Our results are consistent with the results of other researchers who reported a decrease in the marker of oxidative stress after

 </sup> In another study, Khosravinia et al. (2013) reported that the addition of Marze essential oil to the drinking water of chickens significantly decreased the level of lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase compared to the control group.

 </sup> Samarghandian et al. (2016) reported the protective effects of carvacrol against oxidative stress induced by chronic stress in mice. Carvacrol significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the brain, liver and kidney tissues and improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes.

 </sup> Thus, it can be concluded that the positive effects of Marze essential oil on depression may be related to the increased activity of antioxidant defense system and prevention of oxidative stress in the brains of reserpined rats. In this regard, studies have shown that antioxidants could prevent the injury or death of nerve cells by reducing oxidative stress.
