<p class="p">The antidepressant effects of Marze (
 <italic class="italic">Satureja bachtiarica</italic> Bunge) were studied in reserpine-induced depression model in rats. Based on the results, reserpine significantly increased the immobility time in the forced swimming test and treatment with Marze essential oil at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly ameliorated the reserpine-induced changes. Other studies have also used reserpine to induce depression-like disorders and reported increased immobility time during the forced swimming test.
