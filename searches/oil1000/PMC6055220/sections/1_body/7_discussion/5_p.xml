<p class="p">In the present study, Marze essential oil showed the antidepressant effect against reserpine-induced depression. Some of the observed antidepressant effects of Marze essential oil can be attributed to its anti-oxidant activity. Its antidepressant effect may also contribute to the interaction of its main component, carvacrol, with GABAergic and dopaminergic system. However, it is recommended that the role of monoaminergic systems in the antidepressant effect of Marze essential oil be further studied using different agonist and antagonist. </p>
