<p class="p">The antidepressant effect of carvacrol has been shown in previous studies. In a study conducted by Melo et al. (2011), carvacrol significantly decreased the immobility time of physically stressed mice in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests. They reported that the antidepressant effect of carvacrol was not prevented with adrenergic and serotonergic antagonists, but prevented with dopaminergic antagonist. These results demonstrated that carvacrol shows antidepressant effects through the interaction with the dopaminergic system.

 </sup> In Melo et al. study (2010), carvacrol exhibited sedative and anxiolytic-like activities in plus maze and barbiturate-induced sleeping tests. The anxiolytic effect of carvacrol was significantly inhibited by flumazenil that shows the involvement of the GABAergic system.
