<p class="p">The results of behavioral testing (immobility during forced swimming test) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="IJMS-43-409-g001.tif" class="xref">figure 1</xref>. Compared with the control group, treatment with reserpine significantly increased the immobility time during the forced swimming test (P=0.02). Prescription of 50 and 100 mg/kg Marze essential oil as well as fluoxetine significantly ameliorated the reserpine-induced incremental changes in the immobility time during the forced swim (P=0.04, P=0.03, P=0.04, respectively).
