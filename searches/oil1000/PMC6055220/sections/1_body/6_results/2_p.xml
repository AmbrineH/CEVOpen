 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref> shows the results of serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) among different treatments. The analysis of ANOVA showed no significant difference for serum TAC among different treatments (P=0.69). The administration of reserpine decreased the serum TAC level compared with that of the control group, but not significantly (P=0.69). Prescription of Marze essential oil as well as fluoxetine increased the reserpine-induced changes in serum TAC, but not significantly (P=0.69).
