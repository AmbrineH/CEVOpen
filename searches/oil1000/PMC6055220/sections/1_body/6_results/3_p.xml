<p class="p">The results of brain TAC among different treatments are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 2</xref>. The administration of reserpine significantly (P=0.03) decreased the brain TAC level compared with that of the control group. Prescription of Marze essential oil and fluoxetine increased the brain TCA of reserpine treated mice. Such increase was significant at 100 mg/kg of Marze essential oil compared with that of reserpine, fluoxetine as well as 50 and 75 mg/kg MEO (P=0.04).
