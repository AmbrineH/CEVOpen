<p class="p">As presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 3</xref>, the analysis of ANOVA showed no significant difference for the serum MDA among different groups (P=0.43). Reserpine increased serum MDA compared with that of the control group, but not significantly (P=0.43). The use of fluoxetine or Marze essential oil at different concentrations decreased the reserpine-induced increase in the serum MDA, but these changes were not significant (P=0.43).
