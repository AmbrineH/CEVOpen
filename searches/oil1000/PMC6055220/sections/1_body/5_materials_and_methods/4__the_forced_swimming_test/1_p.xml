 </sup> Rats were forced swim for 15 minutes on the final day of administration. After 24 hours, the rats were forced swim again for 5 minutes and were videotaped for further behavioral analyses such as calculating the duration of immobility, swimming, and struggling using the forced swim scanâ„¢ software (Clever Sys. Inc., Reston, VA, USA). The definition of these different behaviors is based on the activity of the four limbs and the ratio of body area that was below or above the water surface.
