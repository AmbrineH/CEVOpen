<p class="p">GC-MS analyses were carried out using Agilent 5975 GC-MS system equipped with the HP-5MS fused silica column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D.), oven temperature 50-240 °C with a rate of 7 C/min, injector temperature 280 °C, carrier gas He with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, Ionization energy 70 eV, scan time 1 second, and mass range 40-300 amu. The essential oil compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those of a computer library, authentic compounds, or data published in the literature.
