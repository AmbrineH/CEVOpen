<p class="p">Three solutions were used for this measurement. Solution 1: 1.5 ml of sodium acetate and 8 ml of concentrated acetic acid, diluted to 500 mL with distilled water. Solution 2: 270 mg of Iron (III) chloride, dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water. Solution 3: 47 mg of treeazin, dissolved in 40 mL of HCl. The working solution was prepared by mixing 10 mL of solution 1, 1 ml of solution 2, and 1 ml of solution 3. Thereafter, 25 microliters of the serum sample were added to 5.1 ml of the working solution. The resulting mixture was incubated at 37 Â°C for 15 minutes and then the absorbance was measured at 593 nm.
