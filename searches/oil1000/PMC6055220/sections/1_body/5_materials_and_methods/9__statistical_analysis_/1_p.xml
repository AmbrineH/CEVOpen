<p class="p">All data were expressed as the mean±SD. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for the normality test. All data had P values greater than 0.05, which indicated the normal distribution of data. The homogeneity of variances was determined using the Levene’s test. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean between the experimental groups. In the case of homogeneous variances and in the case of non-homogeneous variances Duncan test and Dunnett’s T3 were used, respectively. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
