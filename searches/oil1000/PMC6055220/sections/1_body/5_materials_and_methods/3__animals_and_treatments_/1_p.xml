<p class="p">The experiments were performed on 48 adult male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g. Rats were kept under standard laboratory conditions (12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 22±2 °C) with free access to water and standard laboratory food. The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. The control group received normal saline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and the reserpinized group received reserpine (5 mg kg, i.p.) 18 hours before the behavioral test. The intervention groups received fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or Marze essential oil (50, 75, 100 mg/kg, ip) 18 hours after reserpine injection. Doses of essential oil were selected based on the previous study.

 </sup> The behavioral test was conducted 30 minutes after essential oil or fluoxetine injection. After performing the behavioral test, the animals were subsequently put under deep anesthesia, cardiac blood samples were collected, and the brain was removed and used for biochemical analysis. Blood was centrifuged and serum was separated and used for biochemical analysis.
