  <p class="p">Illustration of the continuum from contamination to wound infection. 
   <italic class="italic">Contamination</italic> is represented by the existence of non-replicating bacteria and is a common circumstance in chronic wounds; wound contamination does not promote impaired healing. 
   <italic class="italic">Colonization</italic> is the occurrence of replicating microorganisms without triggering host responses. 
   <italic class="italic">Acute colonization</italic> is characterized by the manifestation of replicating bacteria resulting in moderate local reaction; this increase of bioburden can delay wound healing. 
   <italic class="italic">Infection</italic> occurs when microorganisms are multiplying and have entered the tissue, producing a systemic host response.
