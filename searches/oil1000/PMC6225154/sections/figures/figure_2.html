 <p> Illustration of the continuum from contamination to wound infection. Contamination is represented by the existence of non-replicating bacteria and is a common circumstance in chronic wounds; wound contamination does not promote impaired healing. Colonization is the occurrence of replicating microorganisms without triggering host responses. Acute colonization is characterized by the manifestation of replicating bacteria resulting in moderate local reaction; this increase of bioburden can delay wound healing. Infection occurs when microorganisms are multiplying and have entered the tissue, producing a systemic host response. </p>
