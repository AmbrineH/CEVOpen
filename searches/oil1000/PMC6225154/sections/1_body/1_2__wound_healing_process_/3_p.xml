<p class="p">Each phase of the wound healing process is influenced by a series of essential mediators, like platelets and cytokines, inflammatory cells, cellular and extracellular matrix, proteinases, growth factors and inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Usually, the hemostatic and inflammatory stages take place immediately after damage, but the inflammatory stage may last for up to 6 days [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The proliferation stage is considered as the beginning of angiogenesis and the development of the extracellular matrix [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The remodeling stage typically initiates 3 weeks after damage and can take up to 2 years to fully settle [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Many details of the complex process of wound healing can be found in a recent report by Martin and Nunan [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. A comprehensive consideration of this sequence of stages, cells involved in each stage, time table, and molecular signaling, can consent for the maximum optimization of the healing treatment.
