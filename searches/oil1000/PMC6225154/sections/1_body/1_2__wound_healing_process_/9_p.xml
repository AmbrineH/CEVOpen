<p class="p">Infection in chronic wounds is frequently polymicrobial, boosting synergistic effects (both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms sustain the persistence and multiplication of each other). This collective effect can be usually supported by oxygen consumption; aerobic bacteria can encourage tissue hypoxia, building advantageous conditions for anaerobic multiplication. Once anaerobic species are established, they can obstruct phagocytosis of other microorganisms by producing short chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the nutrient flux from one bacteria may sustain the evolution and proliferation of another [

 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> are usually encountered growing simultaneously in co-cultures [

Numerous pathogens can stick together, forming biofilms, which are microbial masses surrounded by a polymeric environment, consequently evading the killing activity of antibiotics and host effectors. Biofilms can be considered as a physical obstruction to wound healing where the usual process of the inflammatory phase may be extended. It has been reported that bacterial by-products in the form of fatty acids can impede chemotaxis of neutrophils and phagocytosis of
