<p class="p">As soon as the skin is impaired, typical microorganisms of the normal skin flora and exogenous bacteria and fungi can soon gain access to underlying tissues, which offers a humid, warm and nutrient rich environment [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] for their development. However, when the healing is delayed, the normal microbiota of the wound changes and more aggressive microbial types are hosted [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Therefore, an open wound can be a favorable place for microbial proliferation and colonization. In the initial phases of chronic wound construction, Gram-positive entities, mostly 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, appear the most. In advanced phases, Gram-negative species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> sp.) are mostly present and are likely to enter the deeper skin layers, significantly affecting tissues. Additionally, cocci types are present in ~50% of chronic wounds [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. An infection at a wound site starts with contamination, and continues with (acute) colonization and wound infection (as represented in
