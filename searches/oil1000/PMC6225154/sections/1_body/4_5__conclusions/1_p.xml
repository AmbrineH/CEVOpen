<p class="p">Non-healing wounds due to infection causes still remain a dare to treat, and therefore to the design of advanced materials that could be used as wound dressings. Recent findings allow for the production of wound dressings that have the potential to become ideal candidates for the delivery of beneficial molecules and/or drugs to the wound site. In particular, in this review, we present the incorporation of several antibiotics, essential oils, honey and inorganic NPs, the last ones allowing the creation of composite materials for multi-pharmacological goals.</p>
