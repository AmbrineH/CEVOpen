<p class="p">To address the health issue associated to wound infections, different forms of wound dressings have been developed in order to protect the wound from contamination and also to accelerate wound healing. Lately, traditional wound dressings (such as bandages of cotton and wool) which passively offer wound safety, have been substituted by innovative dressings that are proficient in providing a favorable environment and distributing active ingredients to the wound to facilitate wound healing. In this respect, a plethora of materials and combinations, both synthetic or natural, have been utilized, with numerous formulations (e.g., sponges [
