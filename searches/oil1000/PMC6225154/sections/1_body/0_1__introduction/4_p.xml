<p class="p">Wound dressings are conventionally only applied to shield the wound from external contamination, but they could also be functionalized with different therapeutic complexes to be delivered to wound sites [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In contrast to traditional dressings (like bandages made from cotton and wool) that have no active function in the healing process, advanced wound dressings can be designed to take part in it, by means of incorporated active ingredients [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The integrated complexes must show a dynamic role in the wound healing process either as helping the removal of necrotic tissues, preventing/treating installed infections, or both. In this respect, dressings can be functionalized with many classes of antibiotics (such as quinolones [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], etc.) or other substances that exhibit antibacterial properties (e.g., essential oils) [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Antibiotic-embedded wound dressings are valuable in the management of local infections where high concentrations of antibiotics are needed locally [
