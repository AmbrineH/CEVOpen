<p class="p">Moreover, nanotechnology can be a genuine support in circumventing high-systemic doses. Nanotechnology represents a developing field that manipulates materials in the nanometer size range or molecular/atomic scale, and those materials can have many applications in regenerative medicine and preventing various diseases [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. When reducing a materialâ€™s size to nanoscale, its surface- to- area/-volume ratios will intensely increase, resulting into advantageous physio-chemical reactivity for countless medical applications. Some examples of medical uses include the developing of novel drugs and more operative drug delivery platforms, in vivo imaging, nanobiosensors, wound healing, etc. [
