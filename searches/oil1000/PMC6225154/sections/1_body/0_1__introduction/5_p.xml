The development of new antibiotics has decreased over the last years, with a small number of companies remaining active in these domains. In addition, antibiotic-resistant microorganisms have considerably increased, due, among others, to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics [

This antibiotic crisis is still in progress and affects antibiotic treatments used for both systemic and topical infections. For example, the treatment of chronic wounds (in case of diabetic foot, venous ulcers, and pressure ulcers) habitually involves long-term therapy. Given current problems posed by these infections, the antimicrobial potential of unconventional, non-antibiotic treatments has a renewed interest. In particular, the role of natural agents, especially essential oils [
