The most common and inevitable impediment to wound healing is the installation of an infection, mostly in the case of chronic wounds. Although bacteria are a common part of the intact skin microbiota and wounds, a critical threshold of existing bacteria and the formation of a biofilm may impede wound healing [

Due to these facts, regardless of recent progress in the management of wounds, bacterial and fungal infections are still considered as one of the most collective and painful states which lead to significant mortality and morbidity [
