<p class="p">A wound can represent a simple or a severe disorder to an organ (such as the skin) or a tissue and can spread to other tissues and anatomical structures (e.g., subcutaneous tissue, muscles, tendons, nerves, vessels, and even to the bone) [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Among all human body (HB) organs, the skin is without doubt the most exposed to impairment and injury, scratches, and burns. By damaging the epithelium and connective structures, the HB’s capability to provide protection from the outer environment is weakened. It is therefore imperative to refabricate a functional epidermis or even other layers of skin. This happens by a cascade of intersecting phases, known as wound healing or wound repair. The repair is reached by the HB’s capacity to substitute lost skin structure with a viable one, and by the formation of a scar.
