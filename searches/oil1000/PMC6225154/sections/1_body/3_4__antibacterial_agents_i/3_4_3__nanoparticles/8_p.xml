<p class="p">Although there are many methods for producing clinically safe NPs, their extrinsic properties can cause damage to the human body. In common with various drug treatments, the overexposure to NPs could lead to undesirable side effects. For example, the dispersal and accumulation of NPs into body organs (such as the brain, lungs, kidneys and skin) can trigger toxicity to the host. In order to avoid these risks, in vivo bio-distribution and safe degradation profile studies are crucial in advance to the clinical application of non-biodegradable NPs [

Moreover, these studies are vital for verifying NPs (residing from wound dressings) retention into skin layers, undesirable responses of the skin towards NPs (such as inflammation and foreign body reaction) and to track any subsequent escape of NPs into the bloodstream.
