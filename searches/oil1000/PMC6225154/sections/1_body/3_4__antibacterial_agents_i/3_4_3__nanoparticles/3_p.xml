<p class="p">Many of the aforementioned NPs alone or functionalized with diverse antimicrobial compounds (such as antibiotics and natural products) have been used for applications in wound healing. Ag NPs have received extensive consideration by the scientific community owing to their inhibitory action towards ~650 microbe species and against antibiotic resistant bacteria [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Ag NPs can inhibit the bacterial reproduction by denaturing bacterial DNA which leads to bacterial cell alteration and finally to cell death [
 <xref rid="B154-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. The toxicity of Ag and Ag nanoforms can eradicate microorganisms; likewise, it can have the same effect on healthy human cells. It has been found that Ag has a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect on human dermal fibroblast cells [
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. With the expansion of nanotechnology, specialists were able to establish a therapeutic window that boosts antimicrobial properties of Ag, and decreases itâ€™s minimum inhibitory concentration as well as reducing toxicity to normal human cells [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. Therefore, many wound dressings containing Ag (such as Acticoat, Bactigrass, Tegaderm, Fucidin, PolyMem Silver) have been accepted for introduction in the market by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Among metallic NPs, Ag NPs are extensively applied in formulating ointments for burns and wound dressings used in pressure ulcers [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>]. In a latest study using human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, Ag NPs action considerably diminished levels of inflammatory cytokines and encouraged healing [
