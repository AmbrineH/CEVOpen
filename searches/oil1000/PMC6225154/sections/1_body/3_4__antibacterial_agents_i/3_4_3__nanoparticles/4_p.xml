<p class="p">A large number of studies are now focused on formulations of wound dressings made from chitosan hydrogels that incorporate and release nano-Ag and Ag NPs [

 <xref rid="B166-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>]. Our group used Ag NPs to coat polyester-nylon wound dressings for reducing the risk of exogenous wound related infections caused by 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacterial strains. The in vitro and in vivo studies proved that tested NPs applied as coating allowed the normal development of cultured fibroblast cells and showed toxicity within a mouse model. The modified and viable cells count analyses proved that the modified wound dressing had an enhanced inhibitory activity against bacterial colonization, and biofilm growth, especially against
