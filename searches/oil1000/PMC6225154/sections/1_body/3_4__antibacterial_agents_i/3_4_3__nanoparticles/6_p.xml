<p class="p">Our group created a novel nano-modified coating for wound dressings, constructed on functionalized ZnO nanostructures and orange oil. The antibacterial efficiency of obtained nanocomposite was tested against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Results revealed the effectiveness of obtained nanostructures against both planktonic and adherent bacteria, but the effect was more intense against the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strain [
 <xref rid="B176-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. In another study [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>], castor oil was used as a matrix material for the development of nanocomposite films filled with different amounts of chitosan-modified ZnO nanoparticles. The microbicidal properties of developed films were evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Micrococcus luteus</italic>. The antibacterial action towards the last two strains was stronger than that towards 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, cell viability records shown that composites with chitosan—ZnO loading ≤ 5.0 wt % do not present toxic effects against the tested human dermal fibroblasts. The in vivo healing study demonstrated that wounds treated with castor oil/chitosan-ZnO healed much earlier than castor oil- and gauze-covered wounds, and exhibited a higher content and better aligned collagen arrangement.
