<p class="p">When a NP encounters a bacterial cell wall, it can accomplish its bactericidal effect by discharging toxic metal ions or by generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. When in intimate contact with bacterial cells walls, negatively-charged groups originated at bacteria surfaces attract positively-charged NPs. At that time, van der Waals forces, receptor-ligand, and hydrophobic interactions are established and the cell wall absorptivity is changed by the establishment of “holes” in bacteria’s surfaces [

 <xref rid="B148-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. In addition, NPs can also penetrate the cell wall, affect metabolic paths, disrupt mitochondria and can also affect proton efflux pumps subsequent with a pH modification and a membrane’s surface charge disorder [

 <xref rid="B149-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. Bacteria species sensitivity is not only linked to the structure of their cell walls. Extra factors can affect the weakness or tolerance of bacteria to NPs treatment. The mechanisms of NP toxicity are very complicated but are usually determined by the composition, surface modification of NP, intrinsic properties, and bacterial species. For instance,

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> are less susceptible [
