<p class="p">Tea tree EO was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial on chronic human wounds complicated by MRSA strains. In an uncontrolled, open-label, pilot study for testing the effectiveness of tea tree EO, Edmondson et al. [

From 19 patients, 11 were treated with a water-miscible tea tree oil (3.3%) solution which was applied at each dressing change. Even though 8 out of 11 wounds were reduced in size after treatment, the infection was not fully eradicated. In a recent study, Lee et al. [

Infections occurred in 14 out of 16 patients treated with tea tree EO, were entirely eradicated after 4 weeks of treatment. Additionally, regarding the wound healing process, 16 colonized wounds in the tea tree oil group closed in 28 days, as compared to the control group. Moreover, tea tree EO is used to produce a commercially available hydrogel dressing, namely Burnaid
