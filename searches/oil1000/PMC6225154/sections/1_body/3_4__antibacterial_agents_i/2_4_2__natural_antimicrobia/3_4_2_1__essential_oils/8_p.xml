 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (commonly known as lavender) has been used in traditional medicine worldwide. It has been proved that the EO of lavender efficiently inhibits growth of infection-producing microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of lavender EO (LO) was attributed to its major components, linalool and linalyl, but the chemical composition and antibacterial action of lavender EO is mainly dependent on the lavender samples source [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. In this respect, an interesting study has been presented by Imane et al. [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] who reported on the chemical composition and antibacterial effect of lavender EO. Their EO confirmed the presence of high amounts of linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, and camphor. Moreover, in vitro tests demonstrated a strong antibacterial activity and inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 3.33, 1.33 and 42.67 Î¼L/mL [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Nevertheless, lavender EO was proposed to be used for the treatment of surface infection in the form of a prophylactic or topical application [
