<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> genus (commonly known as oregano) has ~39 species, from which 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> L. is the most considered in many scientific studies [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Oregano EO has been reported to have several biological activities, like antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antimutagenic, which are correlated with the presence of thymol and carvacrol in its composition [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that EO can be used in the treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MRSA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacterial infections [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. In a work by Liakos et al., cellulose acetate electrospun fibers have efficiently incorporated oregano EO for applications as improved antimicrobial wound dressings. Moreover, while analyzing the in vitro development of bacteria and biofilms, the authors observed the inhibitory effect on all tested strains at all studied EO concentrations (1% and 5%), but this effect is significant when the amount of 5% oregano EO was used for the design of cellulose acetate fibers. Tests performed on fibers formed with oregano EO revealed a very good antibacterial activity against all tested microbial strains with the potency decreasing as follows: 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
