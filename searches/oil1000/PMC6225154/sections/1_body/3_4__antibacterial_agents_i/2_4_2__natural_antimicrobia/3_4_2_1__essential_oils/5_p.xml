<p class="p">There are encouraging data for the treatment of wound infections with tea tree EO integrated into various functional dressings. For example, an electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nonwoven mat covered with a layer of chitosan and containing tea tree EO were produced and investigated in vitro [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. In vivo tests were performed by skin subtraction having dimensions of (1.2 × 1.2) cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> on the back of the C57BL6/J mice in non-infected and infected animal models. After 7 days post-treatment, bacterial levels were found to be lower for the nonwoven mat with 10 μL concentration of tea tree EO-treated groups than the control: 81.6 ± 18.1% and 93.7 ± 9.57% decrease of bacterial contents, as compared to the control group [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, respectively. The present study reported that films exhibited antimicrobial activity against all strains and this activity is enhancing with the content of tea tree EO in films. Furthermore, films were non-toxic to L929 fibroblasts and sustained their growth [
