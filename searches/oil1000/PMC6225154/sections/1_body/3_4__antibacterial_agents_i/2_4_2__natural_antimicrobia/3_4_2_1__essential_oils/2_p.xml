<p class="p">Various studies pointed towards the fact that the antimicrobial action of EO integrated in wound dressings can be ascribed to their different constituents (like cinnamaldehyde, geraniol, thymol, menthol and carvacrol, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B103-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. The amount and the presence of these constituents into EO is highly dependent on the extraction procedure (e.g., hydrodistillation, microwave assisted extraction, steam distillation, microwave-generated hydrodistillation, microwave steam diffusion and ultrasound assisted extraction) [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Diverse published papers on EO that designate the antimicrobial activity of EO to phenolic compounds (specifically to thymol and carvacrol) explain in detail the mechanism through which these compounds act on bacteria. For example, Kavoosi et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>], stated that EOs attack lipids and phospholipids existing in cell membranes and in the bacteria cell wall, causing cytoplasm outflow, pH decrease, and impairment of cellular processes (such as ATP biosynthesis, DNA transcription and protein synthesis). Other group described that EOs disrupt the purpose of the cytoplasmic membrane, by interfering with the dynamic transport of nutrients through the cell membrane, and coagulation of bacteria cell matters [
