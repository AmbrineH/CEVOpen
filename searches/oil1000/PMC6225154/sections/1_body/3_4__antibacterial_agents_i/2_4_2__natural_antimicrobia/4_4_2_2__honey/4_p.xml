<p class="p">Manuka honey, which is obtained from the Manuka tree and comprises a non-peroxide, non-degradable by the action of catalase component, can sustain its antibacterial activity in biological fluids [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The antibacterial properties exerted by Manuka honey are not only attributed to the hydrogen peroxide but also to the high amounts of the antibacterial compound, methylglyoxal, present in its chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. It was found that Manuka honey impedes the growth of MRSA and 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic>, along with tested gram-negative strains (such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] and eludes biofilm establishment on the wound site [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. Considering the beneficial multifaceted properties of this specific type of honey, in terms of the anti-inflammatory activity, wound repair efficacy and antibacterial properties, many research groups fabricated Manuka honey dressings. Minden-Birkenmaier et al. focused their study on fabrication and characterization of Manuka honey-containing poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofiber scaffolds to be applied as wound dressings and precursors to tissue-engineered skin. The obtained results confirmed that honey positively influenced in vitro fibroblasts infiltration into the scaffold, while inhibiting the growth of

 <xref rid="B141-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Moreover, Yang and coworkers, incorporated Manuka honey as a functional antibacterial agent in an electrospun membrane produced with silk fibroin. The obtained fibrous matrices exhibited antibacterial activity against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-23-02392" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. In a study by Tavakoli et al., a highly concentrated honey-Poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid hydrogel was produced not only to promote antibacterial activity, but also to prove its biocompatibility. It was observed that the honey/Poly (vinyl alcohol) hybrid effectively encouraged the wound healing process by establishing a thin layer of hydrophilic gel that reduces the risk of contamination. Same dressing proved to be effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> pathogens [
