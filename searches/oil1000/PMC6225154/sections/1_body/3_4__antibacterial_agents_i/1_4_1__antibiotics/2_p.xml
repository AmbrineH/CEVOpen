<p class="p">These classes of antibiotics can obstruct some functions and/or the metabolic path of the bacteria through one of the following four pathways: inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis, blockage of key metabolic pathways, interference on protein synthesis, and inhibition of nucleic acids synthesis [
