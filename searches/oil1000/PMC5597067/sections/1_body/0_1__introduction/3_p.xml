<p class="p">The quality of essential oils produced from fingered citron is highly dependent on its chemical composition, as well as associated bioactivities [
 <xref rid="B11-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. During the course of processing the peels of mature fruits, different isolation techniques can not only result in different oil yields, but can also have noticeable effects on chemical composition and other related oil qualities [

 <xref rid="B13-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, owing to potential commercial applications, there have been several investigations that have attempted to demonstrate the composition and stability of characteristic aromas, and to determine possible bioactivities, such as those which are antimicrobial or antioxidant [

 <xref rid="B15-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The GC-MS analysis of oils from Japanese fingered citron showed that β-ionone, one of the aroma components with a very low odor threshold (7 ng/L), was responsible for the characteristic osmanthus-like aroma of the fruit [
 <xref rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, more recent studies have determined the characteristic aromatic components of essential oils from the Jinhua district of China, the results of which, using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), have demonstrated that α-pinene and α-bergamotene were the principal contributors to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil [
