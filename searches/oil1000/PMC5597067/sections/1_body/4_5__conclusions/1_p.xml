<p class="p">In this work, the influence of different isolation methods on the chemical composition and bioactivities of the fruit peel oil from fingered citron were studied in detail. The various isolation methods included significantly different pressures, temperatures, and duration times, which have the potential to affect the reaction rates of interconversion, such as rearrangement, isomerization, and dehydrogenation. Compared to the oils obtained from other isolation methods, the vacuum distillation oil possessed a comparatively high ability to maintain more characteristic components and fewer oxygenated products (cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids). In addition, the bioactivity screening assays showed that the ultrafiltration oil displayed notable in vitro antimicrobial activity against some bacteria and mold, while vacuum distillation oil had a relatively high antioxidant activity. In sum, the vacuum distillation method, combined with the juice production of high-quality fingered citron oil, could be thought of as one of the most promising techniques for the fine-processing of citron fruits.</p>
