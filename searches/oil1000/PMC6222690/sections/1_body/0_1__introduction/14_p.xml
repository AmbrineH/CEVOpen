Although the content of monoterpenes represented 65.7–89.1% of the oil samples, some chemical constituents were remarkably different. For example, α-pinene ranged from 18.2% to 38.9%, δ-3-carene from 0.0 to 6.1%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene from 0.1% to 10.3%, limonene widely ranged from 3.7% to 44.5%, 1,8-cineole from 5.8% to 24.8%, γ-terpinene from 0.5% to 5.8%; terpinolene from 0.0% to 5.9%. Linalool widely ranged from 0.4% to 14.7%, terpenyl acetate from 0.1% to 5.4%, and geranyl acetate from 0.2% to 13.0%. The berries showed a moderate amount of sesquiterpenes representing 5.0% of the entire oil at the most.
