Seven samples (identified by numbers) were collected in two different stations and fruit volatiles were extracted by HS/SPME. Thirty-one volatile compounds were identified in fruits. The lowest hexanal percentage was detected in type 2, while the highest was detected in type 4. Four ester compounds were detected in white myrtle types, whereas no ester was identified in black myrtle types. Linanyl-butyrate and linanyl-acetate were detected with higher percentages. Alcohols were detected as major compounds except type 16, whereas, terpenes compounds were detected as major compounds in type 16.
