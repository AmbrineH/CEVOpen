Eighty components have been identified and quantified. The yields of the hydrodistilled oils were obtained for unripe and ripe fruits: 0.5% and 0.02% respectively. They found that during ripening the concentration of the main constituents changed: e.g., 1,8-cineole increased from 19.5% to 61.5% while myrtenyl acetate decreased from 33.0% to 0.1%.
