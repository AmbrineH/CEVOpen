The level of genetic variability was high. The genetic data were compatible with the notion that myrtle has a mixed pollination system, including both out-pollination by insects and self-pollination. The candidate cultivars may represent an appropriate basis for directed breeding. All these selections are cultivated in Fenosu (Oristano) experimental field and represent a wide population usable to investigate chemical variations in these genotypes. In this field the production of different chemical profiles, in all parts of these plants, are regulated only by genetic differences because environmental condition is the same for all populations. In this view, considering the low level of information on the chemical composition of myrtle berries essential oils and the importance of these to determine the flavor of myrtle industry products, we investigated the chemical variation of berries essential oils with the aim to standardize the potential use of every clone selection.
