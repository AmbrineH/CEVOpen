 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02502" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] studied the Croatian myrtle fruit oils along the year and found that myrtenyl acetate (12.2–33.2%), 1,8-cineole + limonene (10.9–21.1%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (4.0–15.3%), and linalool (4.7–7.7%) were the major constituents. Among them, linalool showed minimal quantitative changes. During the collecting period, high concentration of myrtenyl acetate was detected in September, while the concentrations of the four other quantitatively important compounds were highest in February, when the concentration of myrtenyl acetate was lowest. In this period, the fruit oil yields varied from 0.03 to 0.13%.
