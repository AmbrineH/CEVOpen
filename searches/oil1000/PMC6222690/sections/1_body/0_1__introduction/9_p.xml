Twenty-four constituents were identified, representing 89.5% of the berry oil analysis, the main components being: linalool (36.2%), followed by estragole (18.4%) and 1,8-cineole (11.4%). The oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant chemical group (71.2%), followed by the sesquiterpenoids (16%). Monoterpenes (1.7%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (0.4%) were very low. Berry oil is characterized by a great amount of linalool, estragole, 1,8 cineole and an appreciable amount of bergamotene and
