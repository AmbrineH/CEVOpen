<p class="p">GC/MS: MS analyses were carried out with an Agilent Technologies model 7820A connected with a MS detector 5977E MSD (Agilent), and using the same conditions and column described above. The column was connected to the ion source of the mass spectrometer. Mass units were monitored from 10 to 900 AMU at 70 eV. In the identification procedure we considered only the peaks from 40 to 900 AMU.</p>
