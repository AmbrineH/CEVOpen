<p class="p">Samples of 0.2 μL (volume injection) were analyzed, diluted in hexane using 2,6-dimethylphenol as internal standard. Injection was performed using a split/splitless automatic injector HP 7673 and helium as carrier gas. Several measurements of peak areas were performed with a HP workstation with a threshold set to 0 and peak width to 0.02. The quantization of each compound was expressed as absolute weight percentage using internal standard and response factors (RFs). The detector RFs were determined for key components relative to 2,6-dimethylphenol and assigned to other components based on functional group and/or structural similarity, since oxygenated compounds have lower detectability by FID (Flame Ionization Detector) than hydrocarbons. The standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and Merck grade) were &gt;95% also, and actual purity was checked by GC. Several response factor solutions were prepared that consisted of only four or five components (plus 2,6-dimethylphenol) to prevent interference from trace impurities. It is known that the oxygenated compounds have a lower sensitivity than the hydrocarbons to FID, we have calculated the response factor using a standard mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol, neral, geranial, geranyl acetate and caryophyllene; in this mixture terpene accounted for 92% of the mixture, aldehydes 5% and alcohols, esters and sesquiterpenes 1% each. In our analyses we obtained that the RF of hydrocarbons was equal to 1 while for alcohols it was 0.80 and for esters 0.71. For this reason, we have multiplied the experimental data obtained for the following correction factors: hydrocarbons for 1, aldehydes and ketones for 1.24, alcohols for 1.28 and esters for 1.408.
