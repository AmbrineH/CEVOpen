<p class="p">The essential oil content of myrtle berries is quite low with respect to the yields that may be recovered by leaves or flowers of the same plant. Moreover, in six genotypes yields obtained with the hydrodistillation extraction system were insufficient for sample analysis. However, the importance of the essential oil composition for organoleptic properties of myrtle berries or of food and medicinal products obtained from their biomass is fundamental. </p>
