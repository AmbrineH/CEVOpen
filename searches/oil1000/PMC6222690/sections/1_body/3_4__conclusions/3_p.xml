<p class="p">Most value of the myrtle products is on their fragrance and permanence of the aromatic compounds of the berries in the processed foods, such as the typical myrtle liqueurs [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02502" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The research carried out provides new information on the recurrence of some aromatic profiles in the genotypes selected from the wild populations growing in Sardinia, and the directions for the possible replication in the cultivation of the candidate clones showing the most appreciable chemical composition of the berry essential oil. Considering the increasing development of the myrtle as a new crop, in the next future will be possible to increase the quality value of yielded biomasses also by combining the aromatic profiles of the cultivated clones, to obtain the most appreciated or beneficial results.
