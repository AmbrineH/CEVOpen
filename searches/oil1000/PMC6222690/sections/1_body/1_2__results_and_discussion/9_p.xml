<p class="p">Finally, we detected both the presence of previously described chemotypes or associations of main components and the original nature of some chemical profiles not previously reported for myrtle berries. This was the case of RUM12 with prevalence of metyleugenol, trans-caryophyllene oxide and dihydroeugenyl pentanoate, a recently described compound for the myrtle leaf and flower essential oils [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02502" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and 38 other compounds in a very complex essential oil. Other genotypes showed chemical profiles of the essential oils absolutely originals: CPT3 with neryl acetate,

 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-selinene as main components; V7 with 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-humulene,
