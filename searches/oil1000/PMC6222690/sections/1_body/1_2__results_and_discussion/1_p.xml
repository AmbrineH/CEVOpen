<p class="p">In our studies, we consider 47 different candidate clones: only five of 
 <italic class="italic">leucocarpa varietas</italic> and the most part of 
 <italic class="italic">melanocarpa varietas</italic>. The yield of essential oil of the berries was highly variable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02502-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Six candidate clones did not have enough quantity of fruits to guarantee a correct random harvesting and oil yield. LAC10 and TEL2, do not seem to produce essential oils in appreciable amount, while CPT5, RUM15, RUM13 and 6/2 gave yields around 0.005g·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, but the investigation has not resulted in a GC chromatogram associable to typical components of essential oils but only to hydrocarbons probably attributable to waxes. The highest yield of essential oil was observed in the LAC31 genotype with 0.55 g·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while the samples BOS1, MON5, RUM4, RUM10, V4 and V8 showed values above 0.20 g·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and most of the genotypes under 0.10 g·kg
