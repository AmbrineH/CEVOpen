<p class="p">The studied population of candidate clones had a high variability among genotypes and data on chemical composition of essential oils were quite different with respect to previously published data on samples from Sardinia and different other areas of Mediterranean region [

The recurrent association of main compounds was among α-terpinyl acetate, geranyl acetate, methyl eugenol and α-terpineol, as markedly evidenced in the candidate clones RUM6, BUB95, RUM20, CPT4, V9, V12, LAC1, ORS2, ORS3, SIN2, and PSF1 and only partially reported by other authors for Sardinia myrtle berry essential oils [

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole, as reported for the selections RUB3, V8, RUM10, CPT6, V4, and BOS1; and that of limonene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, and geranyl acetate, characterizing RUM13, RUM14, and RUM4B. The association between linalool and geranyl acetate was also observed as characteristic of V17, V19, and V20.
