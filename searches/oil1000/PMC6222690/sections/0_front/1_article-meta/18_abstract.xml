 <p class="p">Myrtle (
  <italic class="italic">Myrtus communis</italic> L.) is a shrub spontaneously growing in the Mediterranean area. The leaf and fruit content of essential oils and phenolic compounds justify the wide use of the plant as medicinal and aromatic. Because of overexploitation of wild plants, a domestication process is in progress in different regions and the influence of the genotype variability on the chemical composition of fruit essential oils may be useful to breeding programs. Consequently, the analysis performed on a selected group of candidate clones growing in the same field collection in Sardinia is the object of this report. Forty-seven selections provided fully ripe fruits for essential oil extraction by hydrodistillation and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Only five candidate clones showed white fruits. The highest yield of essential oil was observed in the LAC31 genotype with 0.55 g·kg
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while the samples BOS1, MON5, RUM4, RUM10, V4 and V8 showed values above 0.20 g·kg
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and most of the genotypes under 0.10 g·kg
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Geranyl acetate was the compound with the highest relative abundance. The second compound for relative abundance was the 1,8-cineole. Other compounds with high relative abundance were 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpinyl acetate, methyleugenol, linalool, 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol, 
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-humulene, 
  <italic class="italic">Trans</italic>-caryophyllene oxide, and humulene epoxide II.
