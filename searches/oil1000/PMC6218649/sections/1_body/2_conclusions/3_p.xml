<p id="p0110" class="p">In conclusion, it was observed that despite having used an oil in which the oxidative processes were certainly in place, the subsequent oxidation kinetics appear very different when the experimental parameters (temperature and packaging) were changed. This fact suggests that not only the storage conditions can prevent oxidation processes from occurring, but they can even be usefully used to slow down almost to block them. Although starting from a point where the radical processes were certainly established (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), once the preservation conditions were modified, the kinetics of degradation were consequently significantly different.
