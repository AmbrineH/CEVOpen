<p id="p0190" class="p">The homogeneity of variances for all the parameters was evaluated by Barlett's test. Results were expressed as means. The statistical analysis was carried out with Costat version 6.400 (2008 CoHort software). One-way ANOVA was independently applied to the data to evaluate the storage condition effect, and LSD post-hoc test was carried out. For each oil, at each sampling time significant differences among the mean values were assessed on the basis of the least significant difference test at 0.05 level of significance.</p>
