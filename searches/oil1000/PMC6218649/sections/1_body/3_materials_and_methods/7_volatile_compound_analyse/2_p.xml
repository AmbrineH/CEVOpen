<p id="p0170" class="p">The volatile fraction of the EVOO samples was analyzed by head-space Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) using SPME devices (Supelco, Bellefonte, Pa, USA) coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm) to sample the headspace of olive oil. Prior to analysis, each sample was left to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature before the fibre insertions. After the equilibration time, the septum of each vial is perforated by the holder (syringe) and the fibre is exposed to the head space of the sample for 30 min at room temperature. Once the sampling is complete, the fibre is retracted into the holder and directly injected in the GC–MS apparatus for separation and analysis. Blanks were performed before each first SPME extraction and randomly repeated during each series. Quantitative comparisons of relative peaks areas were performed between the same chemicals in the different samples.</p>
