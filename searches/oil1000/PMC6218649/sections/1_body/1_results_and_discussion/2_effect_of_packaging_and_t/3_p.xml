<p id="p0045" class="p">During storage time, different packaging conditions did not affect free acidity, which remained always below the LL EVOO (data not shown). This indicates that in no case hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol matrix occurred significantly, although an impact on PV and quality parameters related to the oxidation level (K232 and K270) could be detected (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>A–C). In particular, in the sample stored in tinplate tin at 26 °C (TT26) PV increased by 48 and 77% after 78 (t2) and 125 days (t3) of packaging, respectively (
