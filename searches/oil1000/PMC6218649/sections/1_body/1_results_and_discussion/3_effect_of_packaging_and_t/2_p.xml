 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecene and (
 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-α-farnesene showed values higher than 3%. These results agree substantially with those reported by 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ouni et al. (2011)</xref>, although qualitative and quantitative differences in composition are tightly dependent on the levels and activity of enzymes involved in the synthesis of volatile compounds, in its turn genetically determined. Moreover, the production of these metabolites changes in relation to the ripening degree and storage time of fruits, as well as the operative conditions used during oil extraction (
