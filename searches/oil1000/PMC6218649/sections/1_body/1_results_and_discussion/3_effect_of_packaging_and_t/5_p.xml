<p id="p0075" class="p">The aliphatic ketone 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one increased during storage in TT, showing increases by 3.3 and 4.5-fold at 6 and 26 Â°C, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). It can be suggested that oxidation of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol by sulcatone reductase may be induced by the TT packaging.
