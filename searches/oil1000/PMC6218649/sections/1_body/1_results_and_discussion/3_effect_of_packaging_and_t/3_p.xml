<p id="p0065" class="p">Virgin olive oils maintained an almost similar volatile composition in all storage conditions (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), although hierarchical cluster analysis identified two statistical units (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In particular, the first one gathers together t0, GG6 and GG26 (greenish glass at 26 °C), which show great similarities among them, confirming that glass allows to better preserve oil characteristics. Furthermore, in both clusters the oil stored at higher temperature show the greater distance from t0, suggesting that the volatile composition of oil vary faster when storage temperature increases.
