<p id="p0100" class="p">Based on Pearson's correlation coefficients, positive sensorial attributes showed strong correlations with some chemical parameters such as BI and phenolic content (PC) involved in the delay of deteriorative processes occurring during EVOO storage (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Thus, whole pleasantness, green fruity as well as olfactory sensations of grass, leaf, artichoke and tomato were positively correlated with BI and PC. In contrast, the same sensorial attributes were negatively correlated with quality parameters related to the degradation of the lipid matrix. In particular, sensations of leaf, artichoke and tomato showed to be negatively strongly correlated with FFA, PV and the spectrophotometric indices K232 and K270 (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Because of oxidation processes, the rancid flavour as well as the evolutionary state resulted, instead, positively strongly correlated with the above physiochemical indices, whereas the evolutionary state was negatively correlated with BI and PC (
