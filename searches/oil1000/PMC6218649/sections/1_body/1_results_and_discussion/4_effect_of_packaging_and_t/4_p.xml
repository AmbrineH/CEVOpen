<p id="p0095" class="p">However, in all oil samples the analysis of overall descriptors showed that perception of the oil evolution increased, whereas whole pleasantness and green fruity decreased at the end of storage period in comparison with t0 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>A). Notwithstanding samples stored at 26 °C were the most affected, oil stored in GG at 6 °C showed a two-fold increase in the evolutionary state and decreases in whole pleasantness and green fruity perception by 27 and 43%, respectively, compared to t0 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>A). This indicates that even storage at low temperature cannot avoid the loss in positive sensory attributes characteristic of EVOO (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bertuccioli and Monteleone, 2014</xref>). However, GG6 was the only sample that maintained olfactory sensations of grass, leaf, artichoke and tomato at values close to what observed at t0 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>B). Generally, TT26 was the sample more affected by storage conditions (Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and the concomitant decrease in (

 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In fact, volatile compounds responsible for the green attributes of virgin olive oils are produced through the enzymatic oxidation of linoleic and linolenic acids (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Angerosa et al., 1999</xref>). TT26 also showed the highest presence of rancid flavor (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>C) indicating that, under these storage conditions, oxidation processes took place in agreement with the increases in PV, K232 and K270 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>A, B, C). Thus, temperature represents a critical feature for the oxidative changes taking place in EVOO, oxidation being the main responsible for the qualitative deterioration of olive oil since it brings to the development of off-flavors and thus to “oxidative rancidity”. This latter is, in turn, counteracted by the oil antioxidant activity due to the presence, among the others, of polyphenolic compounds which decreased in comparison with t0 (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), thus decreasing EVOO shelf-life (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bendini et al., 2007</xref>). GG6 was the only sample which did not present defects, whereas in TT6 (tinplate tin at 6 °C) and GG26 rancid flavor had an intensity 3-fold lower than in TT 26 (
