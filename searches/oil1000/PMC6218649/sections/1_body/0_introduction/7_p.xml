<p id="p0035" class="p">The present research aimed to evaluate the effects of packaging and storage conditions on a EVOO as it occurs in most points of sale, that is the usual storage of oil in tanks under nitrogen for a more or less long time (also for several months), after which the packaging and the sale. Since this period (in particular from the bottling phase till to sale) is very critical for the oxidation processes, we think that this moment is one of the most suitable for assessing the ability of the packaging and storage temperature to slow down the oxidation evolution of EVOO, and for this reason we studied the effects of packaging and storage temperature on the shelf life of EVOO, initially stored in stainless steel silos under nitrogen at 12–18 °C, observing the evolution of its chemical and sensory characteristics after packaging. An innovative approach based on the overlapping of information deriving from both chemical and sensorial analysis was used. In order to simulate conditions similar to the market storage, the two most commonly used packaging containers for olive oil, namely tinplate tin (TT) and greenish glass (GG). To evidence the influence of storage temperature on oil evolution, a low-temperature (T = 6 ± 1 °C) was compared with the room temperature condition (T = 26 ± 1 °C) mostly adopted for EVOO storage in sale points.</p>
