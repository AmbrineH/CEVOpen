<p id="p0015" class="p">Oxidation is the main responsible for deterioration of olive oil quality, in turn counteracted by the antioxidant activity determined by the presence of polyphenolic compounds and tocopherols, which increase its shelf-life. The main fraction susceptible to oxidation is the lipid one, which degradation gives rise to the production of carbonyl and aldehyde compounds that lead to the development of off-flavors and, at the end, to “oxidative rancidity”. Auto-oxidation further contributes to the degradative processes of the olive oil. This occurs even in the absence of light, following a free radical mechanism where, initially, the absorption of oxygen results in the formation of hydroperoxides. When the olive oil is exposed to light, photo-oxidation occurs through the action of natural photosensitizers such as chlorophyll, which reacts with triplet oxygen to form excited state singlet oxygen. As a consequence, storage and packing conditions of olive oil become of primary importance (

In fact, to maintain the designation “extra virgin” or even “virgin”, lipid oxidation products (i.e. hydroperoxides, conjugated dienes and trienes) must not exceed maximum threshold limits, and/or rancid off-flavors must not occur (
