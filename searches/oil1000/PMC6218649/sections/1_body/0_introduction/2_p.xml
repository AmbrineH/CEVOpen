<p id="p0010" class="p">The quality of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) depends on a process that begins with the olive ripening and finishes with the packaging. Thus, it is necessary to take care not only of agronomical practices, raw material, harvesting, fruit storage and extraction technology, but also of each factor, which can affect its commercial life. In particular, oxygen, light and temperature are responsible for increasing deteriorative processes in EVOO as a consequence of oxidative and hydrolytic reactions (
