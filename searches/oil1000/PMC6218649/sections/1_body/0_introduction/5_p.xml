<p id="p0025" class="p">Packaging can directly influence olive oil quality by protecting the product from two of the main factors inducing oxidative deterioration: oxygen and light (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lanza et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is essential to avoid the contact with inadequate materials such as metal containers which can initiate oxidative degradative reactions (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sgherri et al., 2018</xref>), thus affecting the shelf-life of the oil. For this reason, metal containers which offer the advantage of total protection against light, oxygen and water vapor, are now made of tin plate or tin-free steel based on chromium instead of aluminum or aluminum alloys. The inside of the tin is also coated with resins which protect the metal surface against corrosion (
