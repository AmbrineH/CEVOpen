<p class="p">Applications of ‘‘different shade levels and mulch types” influenced the growth, yield attributes and quality of essential oil of damask rose under the mid hill conditions of Western Himalayas. The open sunny conditions and black polyethylene mulch promotes the production of major secondary metabolites of damask rose. Since the adaptation of plants to shaded conditions have reduced the yield attributes, hence from the studies we concluded that plants grown under open sunny condition with black polyethylene mulch produced higher yield and good quality of damask rose.</p>
