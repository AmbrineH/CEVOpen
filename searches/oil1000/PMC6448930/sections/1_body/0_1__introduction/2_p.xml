<p class="p">Light is one of the most important environmental factors for plant growth and development [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Different light intensities influence plant growth, leaf gas exchange, and water use efficiency. In aromatic crops, different light intensities have been demonstrated to alter essential oil content and composition. The substantial amount of light energy is required to reduce carbon which combines with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> producing oxygen, carbohydrates, ATP and NADPH. The sugars converted into amino acids, hormones, and secondary metabolites. However, plants grown under shade level leads to reduce the stomatal conductance, photosynthesis rate, ATP synthesis, carbon assimilation and plant growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The study of microclimate modification by using different green shade nets found that different crops behaved differently under shade conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. These variations in the microclimate modify the rate of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation and photosynthesis, consequently, crop growth and productivity. Crop yield and productivity can also be increased by application of mulch in the soil as it improves soil conditions for plant growth, including soil temperature, soil moisture, weed control, reduction in leaching of fertilizers [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Mulching is also known to buffer soil temperature, increases early production and higher yields along with better quality; enhance water and fertilizer use efficiency and decrease the incidence of pests [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, different types of mulching materials are used to change the micro environment along with the improvement of crop growth and yield.
