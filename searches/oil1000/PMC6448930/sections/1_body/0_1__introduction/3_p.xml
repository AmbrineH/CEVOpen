Modification of microclimate by shade and mulch is an alternative approach to meet the increasing demand of damask rose under such conditions. However, the effects of shade level and mulch type on

In view of the above facts, an experiment was conducted to study the effect of shade level and mulch type on growth, flower yield, essential oil content, and composition of damask rose under mid hill conditions of Western Himalayas.
