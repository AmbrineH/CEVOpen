<p class="p">Damask rose variety Jwala was used to study the effect of microclimate modification during 2015–16 to 2016–17. The soil of the experimental field was silty clay in texture (10.76% sand, 55.48% silt and 33.76% clay), acidic in reaction (pH 5.25), low in organic carbon (0.2%) and exhibited a low availability of nitrogen (49.6 mg/kg of soil), low phosphorous (3.1 mg/kg of soil) and high potassium (182.2 mg/kg soil). Application of nutrients NPK was applied in the ratio of 120:60:40 kg/ha through fertilizer urea (46% N), single super phosphate (16% P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>) and muriate of potash (60% K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), respectively. The experiment was laid out in a split plot design (SPD) with four replications. The agro-shade net houses (shade level) were organized in main plots, while the different mulches were subjected to sub-plot. Shade houses (3 m height x 12 m width x 22 m length) were constructed on a 0.2 ha section of an open field at the Chandpur farm of the institute. Green polypropylene shade fabrics of different mesh gauges were erected on frames to simulate shade treatments: 25 and 50%. Frames without shade fabric served as control (i.e., 0% shade). The shade houses were placed on ground cover in the open field, 2 m a part to prevent treatment overlap.
