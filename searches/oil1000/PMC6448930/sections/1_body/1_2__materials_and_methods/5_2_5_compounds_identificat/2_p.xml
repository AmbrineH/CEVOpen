<p class="p">The composition of rose oil samples was evaluated by a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and DB-5 (J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, USA) fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, i.d.;0.25 μm film thickness). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at the column with the velocity of 1.24 mL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> flow rate. The oven temperature was programmed at 40°C for 4 min and then increased at the rate of 4°C min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> from 40–220°C. The temperature of injector and detector was maintained at 250°C and samples were injected in split mode. The compounds were identified based on retention indices and peak area percentage of the chromatogram. Retention indices (RI) were calculated by using homologous series of n-alkanes (C8–C24), and then compounds were identified by comparing R.I values, mass spectra, and library databases of NIST-MS (National Institute of Standards and Technology-mass spectral) database [
