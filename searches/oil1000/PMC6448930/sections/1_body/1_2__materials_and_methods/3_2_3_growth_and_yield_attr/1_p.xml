<p class="p">Biometric observations were recorded at the time of flowering. Growth information on plant height (cm), numbers of branches plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, plant spread (cm) and leaf area index (LAI) was recorded. Five plants plot
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> were selected for recording plant height, plant spread, number of branches plant
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, and leaf area. Plant height was measured from the ground level to tip of the top leaf. Plant spread was recorded in North-South and East-West directions. Yield parameters

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (g) flower yield (kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), essential oil yield (kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), essential oil content (%) and essential oil components were recorded. Plant height and leaf area index (LAI) was measured with the help of measuring scale and digital plant canopy imager CI-110/120, respectively. Photosynthetically Active Radiations (PAR) under each shade and mulch treatment was measured during the flowering season with a LI-190 quantum sensor (LI-COR, Inc., USA). The observations were taken around 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM after each interval of two hours as the sun’s angle to normal (zenith angle) is less than 2°C on most days of observations. Each reading was expressed as μmol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>m
