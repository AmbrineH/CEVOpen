<p class="p">Damask rose flowers were collected separately from each treatment during April and mid of May months of the crop season. In each treatment, 1000 g flowers were used for distillation. Damask rose flowers were harvested early in the morning (5:00–7:00 AM) by manual plucking and were immediately hydro-distilled in the Clevenger type apparatus within 10 minutes after harvest to prevent the loss of volatile compounds from the flowers. The ratio of flower and water was 1:2 (w/v) and the essential oil content of damask rose was measured as mL and % ratio (v/w) on the fresh weight basis. Essential oil yield (kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was calculated by multiplying fresh flower yield, essential oil content and specific gravity (0.85) of rose essential oil. The extracted essential oil samples were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and were stored at 4°C before analysis. Three replicates were used to identify the essential oil composition through GC and GC-MS.
