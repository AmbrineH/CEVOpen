During both the years, plant height was significantly higher under black polyethylene mulch (129.9and 139.1 cm), as compared to control. Results were in accordance with the studies of sweet-scented geranium and stevia in which plant height increased in mulched conditions as compared to control [

 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. This is due to increased temperature under black polyethylene mulch that has enhanced the microbial activity of nitrifying bacteria that access the nitrification and nitrate to plant roots under soil [

 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Significantly higher numbers of branches were recorded under black polyethylene mulch followed by organic and without mulch (control) during both the years. During the first year, organic mulch recorded significantly higher plant spread (N-S and E-W direction) followed by black polyethylene mulch and control. However, during the second year, plant spread in both directions was significantly higher in black polyethylene mulch followed by organic mulch and control. Similar results were reported in the studies of African marigold in which maximum plant spread was recorded in plastic mulch [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Plant growth is influenced by the use of mulch, such as moisture content, reduced competition for light and availability of nutrients, absence of weeds, pest reduction and increased soil temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. LAI was not affected significantly by different mulch during both the years.
