<p class="p">Eighteen components of damask rose essential oil from different nine treatments were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) for analyzing compositional and different treatments variation. PC-1 and PC-2 contributed to 45.4 and 31.5% of variance which jointly explained 76.9% of total variance (
