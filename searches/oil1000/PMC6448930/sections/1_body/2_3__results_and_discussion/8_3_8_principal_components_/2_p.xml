<p class="p">Four distinct clusters were observed in score plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214672.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Cluster I (0% PM) explained higher concentration of citronellol in open sunny condition with the applications of black polyethylene mulch. In Cluster II (25% PM, 50% OM and 50% PM) concentration of citronellol, trans-geraniol and geranyl acetate was found higher in 25% shade level with the application of black polyethylene followed by 50% black polyethylene and organic mulch. Cluster III (25% WM and 25% OM) showed that under mulching conditions, higher concentration of trans-geraniol, geranyl acetate, nonadecene, nonadecane and heneicosane were observed. In cluster IV (0% WM, 0% OM and 50% WM) plants grown under open sunny conditions along with the application of mulch, produced the higher concentration of citronellol and trans-geraniol. However, percentage of these major compounds decreased under 50% shade level (
