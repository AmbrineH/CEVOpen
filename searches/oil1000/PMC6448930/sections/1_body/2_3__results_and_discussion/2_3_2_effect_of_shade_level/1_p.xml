<p class="p">Microclimate modification significantly influenced crop growth and yield of damask rose. The plants grown under shade conditions were taller than those grown under open sunny conditions. The growth parameters were significantly affected by different shade levels during both the years (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Plant height was significantly higher under 50% shade (137.4 and 144.7 cm), as compared to 25% shade (125.2 and 127.4 cm), and control (100.3 and 119.7 cm), during both the years. This may be due to the fact that plant grown in shade resembled etiolated plants, which have an unwanted tall appearance and are more apical dominant. It also produces a phototropism response to modify plant growth and development to receive enough light [

 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Numbers of branches were 31.4 and 22.8% higher in open sunny conditions as compared to 50% shade level during 2015–2016 and 2016–2017, respectively. This may be due to the absorption of lesser PAR under shade conditions that have reduced the photosynthetic and respiration rate that usually inhibits plant growth and productivity by affecting the gas exchange as compared to full sunlight [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. During both the years of studies, plant spread (N-S) was significantly higher in 50% shade level as compared to open sunny conditions (control). Significantly, lowest plant spread was recorded under open sunny conditions which might be due to higher absorption of PAR, that had enhanced the photosynthetic rate compared to shaded conditions (
