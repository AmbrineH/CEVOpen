<p class="p">Interaction effect of shade level and mulch type on numbers of flowers plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were found significant during both the years (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Plants grown under open sunny conditions recorded significantly higher numbers of flowers plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> as compared to 25 and 50% shade level at each mulch type. Black polyethylene mulch recorded significantly higher number of flowers plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> as compared to organic mulch and control at each shade level. In all treatment combinations, black polyethylene mulch under control produced significantly higher number of flowers plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Interaction effect of shade and mulch factors on fresh flower yield of damask rose was found significant during both the years. Open sunny conditions produced significantly higher flower yield, however, shaded condition of 50% level produced significantly lower flower yield. Plants under open sunny conditions produced significantly higher flower yield with black polyethylene mulch. The different mulch produced significant difference with different light intensities. Black polyethylene mulch, produced a significantly higher flower yield followed by organic and without mulch, respectively in open sunny conditions.
