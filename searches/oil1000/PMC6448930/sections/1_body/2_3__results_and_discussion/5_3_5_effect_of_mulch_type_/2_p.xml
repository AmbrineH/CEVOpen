<p class="p">Plants mulched with black polyethylene, produced significantly higher flower yield (3149.2 and 3172.7 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) as compared to organic mulch (2576.7 and 2753.2 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and without mulch (1805.0 and 2278.1 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), respectively, during both the years. Black polyethylene mulch, recorded an increase of 74.5 and 39.3% as compared to without mulch, respectively. Mulch types, could be attributed to water use efficiency, alter the soil temperature and soil moisture content, proper utilization of nutrients which might favor the environmental conditions for the plant. The results obtained were consistent with the studies of
