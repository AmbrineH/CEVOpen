<p class="p">Among mulch types, black polyethylene mulch recorded significantly higher number of flowers as compared to organic mulch and control during both the years. Black polyethylene mulch, registered 72.0 and 36.4% higher number of flowers as compared to control, during 2015–16 and 2016–17, respectively. It might be due to favorable soil temperature and a moisture condition that has enhanced the microbial activity in the soil resulting in enhanced nutrient availability and physiological activities of plant which ultimately resulted in the higher number of flowers [
