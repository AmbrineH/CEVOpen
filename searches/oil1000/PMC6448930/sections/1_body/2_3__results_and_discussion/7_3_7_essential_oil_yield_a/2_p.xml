<p class="p">The percentage of oxygenated monoterpene and sesquiterpene components like citronellol, geranyl acetate, linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-rose oxide were higher in open sunny conditions as compared to 25% shade and 50% shade level (

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-geraniol followed by organic and without mulch. This may be because of biosynthetic activation of pathways of essential oils due to light which depend on the carbon chain obtained by photosynthetic light [

The variation in the compounds of damask rose essential oil may be related both to the availability of light and favorable soil temperature and soil moisture, since the quality of essential oil is determined by favorable environmental conditions in the productivity of secondary metabolites of essential oil crops [
