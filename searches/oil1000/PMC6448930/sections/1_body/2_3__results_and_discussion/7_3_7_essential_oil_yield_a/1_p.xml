 <italic class="italic">damascena</italic> led to the identification of twenty six compounds. The total area percentages of damask rose components were 88.8 to 95.3%. The components were grouped into oxygenated monoterpene (53.2 to 68.0%), oxygenated sesquiterpene (3.6 to 6.3%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (3.0 to 4.9%) and aliphatic hydrocarbon (16.1 to 31.8%) (
