<p class="p">Yield attributes of damask rose were significantly affected by shade level and mulch types (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Significantly higher numbers of flowers were recorded under open sunny conditions as compared to 25 and 50% shade level during both the years. Light affected chlorophyll content, photosynthetic enzyme activity, stomatal opening, and the distribution of carbohydrates in plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. A perusal of data presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> revealed that fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was significantly affected by shade level and mulch type. At 50% shade level, fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was found significantly lowest (105.3 and 207.2 g), however, control recorded significantly higher fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (511.3 and 381.6 g), respectively, during both the years. During the second year of study, fresh flower weight per plant was found at par with control and 25% shade level. It may be because of the lesser weed growth, more numbers of branches and numbers of flowers resulted in higher fresh flower weight under open sunny conditions and 25% shade level. Similar results were observed in clary sage in which fresh weight biomass was reduced with increase in shade level [
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Reduction in light intensity reduces the rate of photosynthesis and rate of the growth. While, more vegetative growth, lesser numbers of flowers resulted in significantly lesser fresh flower weight plant
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> under 50% shade conditions [
