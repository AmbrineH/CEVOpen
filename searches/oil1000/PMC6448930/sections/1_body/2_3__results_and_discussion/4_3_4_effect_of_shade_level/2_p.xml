<p class="p">Plants grown under open sunny conditions produced significantly higher flower yield during both the years (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). During the first year, open sunny conditions recorded significantly higher flower yield (4544.7 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) than 25% (2050.3 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and 50% shade level (936.1 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), respectively. During the second year, plants under open sunny conditions registered significantly higher flower yield as compared to 50% shade level but remained at par with 25% shade level. It may be attributed to the favorable environment for increased numbers of branches consequently increased the numbers of flowers that resulted into higher flower yield. The essential oil obtained by hydro distillation in Clevenger-type apparatus was influenced significantly by different shade levels and mulch types (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Significantly higher essential oil yield was recorded in open sunny conditions as compared to 25% and 50% shade level during the first year of study. Similarly, during the second year, essential oil yield was significantly higher in control as compared to 50% shade level but remained at par with 25% shade level. This may be due to the higher flower yield and essential oil content under control and 25% shaded conditions as compared to 50% shade level (
 <xref rid="pone.0214672.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The production and quality of essential oil of medicinal and aromatic species responds differently to shade conditions due to genetic makeup and environmental conditions. Essential oil yield of
