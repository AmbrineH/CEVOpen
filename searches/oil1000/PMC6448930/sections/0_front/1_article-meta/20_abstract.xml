 <p class="p">A field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, India for two consecutive years (2015–16 and 2016–17). The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis whether different shade level and mulch type would influence the growth, flower yield and essential oil profile of

  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, flower yield, and essential oil yield were significantly higher under open sunny conditions as compared to 25% and 50% shade levels. However, plants grown under 50% shade level recorded significantly higher plant height (cm), plant spread (cm) and the lowest numbers of branches as compared to control. Among mulches, black polyethylene mulch recorded significantly higher growth, and yield attributes of damask rose as compared to other mulches. Black polyethylene mulch recorded 74.5 and 39.2% higher fresh flower yield as compared to without mulch, during 2015–16 and 2016–17, respectively. Correlation studies showed a positively significant correlation between quality and quantity traits. A total of twenty-six essential oil compounds were identified which accounted for a total of 88.8 to 95.3%. Plants grown under open sunny conditions along with the applications of black polyethylene mulch produced a higher concentration of citronellol and
