 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] guideline. The bacterial suspensions were made by inoculating a fresh stock culture of the test bacteria strains into tubes containing 5 mL of sterile Luria- Bertani broth and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Active cultures grown overnight in sterile Luria- Bertani broth were inoculated into Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, single colonies were transferred from MHA plates into 4 mL of normal saline solution determined spectrophotometrically at 580 nm as previously reported by Duarte et al., [
