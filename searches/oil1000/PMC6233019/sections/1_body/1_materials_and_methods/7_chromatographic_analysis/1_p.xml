Nitrogen and synthetic air (White Martins Gases Industriales Ltda., 99.99% purity) were the carrier gases, with a 1.5 mL/min flow rate. A diluted sample (0.4 mL) in dichloromethane (1:10; Merck) was injected. The sample components were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the mass spectra and retention indices of linolenate methyl ester (ω-3), linoleatemethyl ester (ω-6) and oleatemethyl ester (ω-9) standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, St. Louis, MO, USA).
