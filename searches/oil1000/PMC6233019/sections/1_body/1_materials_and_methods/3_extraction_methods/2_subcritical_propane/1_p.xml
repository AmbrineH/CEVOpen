<p class="p">The extraction occurred in the packed bed extractor using propane with 99.97% purity (White Martins Gases Industriales Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) in a subcritical state. The extraction equipment consisted of a solvent reservoir, two thermostatic baths (521/3D; Nova Ética, Vargem Grande do Sul, SP, Brazil), one syringe pump (500D; Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) and a 62.8-mL jacketed extraction vessel. Evaluation conditions were: 20, 40 and 60 °C and 8·10

 <sup class="sup">7</sup> and 1.2·10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> Pa. All extrac-tions required a constant 2 mL/min flow rate. Ground linseed powder (16 g) was placed into the extraction vessel (a heating jacket with a thermostatic bath, model SE 100AG; Servilab, Le Mans, France), supported by two 150 mesh wire disks at both ends. The solvent was pumped at a constant flow rate into the extraction chamber and kept in contact with the bed and samples until reaching the desired extraction pressure. Extraction lasted for 90 min. After that, the solvent feed was interrupted and the valve located at the bottom of the chamber was opened, obtaining the extracted oil mass. The micrometric expansion valve was wrapped in the temperature controller (HW 1440; Coel, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) to keep at a constant 55 °C. Linseed oil yield (%) was calculated using the following equation:

 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> is the yield of linseed oil (in %), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>(seed powder) is the seed powder mass and 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>(extracted oil) is the mass of oil extracted at the process end. All extractions were performed in triplicate.
