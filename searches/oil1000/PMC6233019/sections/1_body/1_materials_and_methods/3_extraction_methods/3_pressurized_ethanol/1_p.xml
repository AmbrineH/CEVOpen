<p class="p">For pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) the measuring cylinder containing ethanol (99% purity; Vetec, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) was connected to the HPLC pump (Lab Alliance Series III, New York, NY, USA) with two thermostatic baths (521/3D; Nova Ética). Evaluation conditions were: 20, 40 and 60 °C and 8·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> and 1.2·10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> Pa. All extractions required a constant 2 mL/min flow rate, using 16 g sample in the extraction cell. During the extraction step, the sample was loaded into the cell and the solvent was added at an operational pressure, until reaching the operational temperature. When the pressure reached the desired value, pump pressure was interrupted, and the system was isolated by closing the valve that releases the liquid to the pump, keeping it pressurized for 15 min. Then, the pump was once again engaged, the micrometric valve was opened starting the extraction. Extraction lasted 90 min, and samples containing oil and ethanol were placed in an oven coupled to a vacuum pump (Quimis) at 50 °C, for solvent evaporation. Yield was calculated using Eq. 1. All extractions were performed in triplicate.
