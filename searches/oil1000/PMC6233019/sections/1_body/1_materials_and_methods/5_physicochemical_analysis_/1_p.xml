<p class="p">Acidity, refraction index, and density of the oil obtained with both extraction methods and the commercial oil were analyzed according to the methods described by the Adolfo Lutz Institute, São Paulo, Brazil (

 </xref>). All physical and chemical analyses were performed in triplicate. Titratable acidity was determined by titrating a sample with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH; Synth, Diadema, SP, Brazil) and phenolphthalein as indicator. The refractive index was measured with an Abbé refractometer (Delta, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Density was determined using a density bottle (4500 density meter; DMA, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) at 25 °C.
