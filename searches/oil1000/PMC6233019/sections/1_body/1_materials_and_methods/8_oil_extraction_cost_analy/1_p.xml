<p class="p">It is important to determine the relationship between the high extraction yield using propane and production costs. Based on the information generated by CONTAGRI software (

 </xref>) the economic analysis generally depends on the total fixed and variable costs. In this way, the production costs included fixed and variable costs such as the raw material (seed), chemicals, reagents and gas (propane), equipment investment, and labour cost. Cost analysis of 16 working hours a day and 240 days a year of extraction unit operation took into consideration 1% for repair and maintenance, 10% for depreciation and 2% interest over a 10-year period.
