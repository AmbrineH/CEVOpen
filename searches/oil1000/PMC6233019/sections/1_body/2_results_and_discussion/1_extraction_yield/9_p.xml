<p class="p">Statistically treated results of linseed oil extraction with pressurized ethanol showed that both pressure and its interaction with temperature had a significantly positive effect (p&lt;0.1), observable in the Pareto chart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The correlation coefficient was 0.92 and the F calculated was 1.44 times lower than the F tabulated value, hence, neither validating the model nor allowing the contour curve construction. Based on that, in order to increase the yield, the extraction time was prolonged to 3 h under the experimental design central point conditions (40 Â°C and 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> Pa). The improvement in the yield was 12.3%; however, even lower than in the extraction with subcritical propane (28.4%).
