<p class="p">Extraction using pressurized ethanol was performed under similar experimental conditions as the one using subcritical propane. The experimental design results (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) showed that the highest yield (approx. 8%) was obtained at the central point (assays 5, 6 and 7). According to 
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the extraction using pressurized ethanol showed a lower yield than those using subcritical propane and organic solvent (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane), which could be due to a short-chain alcohol that did not present any good solvency for triglycerides under the applied conditions. Besides that, this process requires, after extraction, an additional step for ethanol removal
