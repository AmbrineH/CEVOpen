<p class="p">In this work, the ω-6/ω-3 family polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio was around 0.24. An ω-6 to ω-3 essential fatty acid ratio of approx. 1 is considered nutritionally adequate (

 </xref>). A lower ω-6/ω-3 fatty acid ratio is more desirable in reducing the risk of chronic diseases since polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered essential to the human body with nutritional advantages as long chain fatty acid (linoleic and linolenic acids) precursors. They can improve the brain, heart and immune system performance in humans, as well as have suppressive effects on the onset of cardiovascular, inflammatory and cancer diseases (
