 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The remaining 14% may be related to the amounts of both palmitic and stearic acids. Studies in the literature of fatty acid composition from linseed oil showed 45.1–73.4% linolenic, 11.9–20% linoleic, 17.1–24.3% oleic, 4.6–6.9% palmitic and 0.25–4.6% stearic acids (
