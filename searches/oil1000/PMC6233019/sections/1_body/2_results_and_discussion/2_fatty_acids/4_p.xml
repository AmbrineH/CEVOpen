<p class="p">There were no statistical differences in the amounts of essential fatty acid esters obtained with the organic solvent and mechanical pressing, whose major component was linolenate (approx. 55%), corresponding to the ω-3 fatty acid, followed by oleate (19%) (matching the ω-9 fatty acid). Such results corroborated those found in the literature. Pradhan
