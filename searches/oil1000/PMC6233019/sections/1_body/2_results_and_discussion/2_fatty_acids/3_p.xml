<p class="p">The statistical analysis of extraction using pressurized ethanol did not show any significant differences among acid esters, whereas the extraction with subcritical propane resulted in significant differences in linolenate (ω-3) and linoleate (ω-6) concentration. Extraction yields demonstrated that the concentrations of ω-3, -6 and -9 from linseed oil extracted using pressurized ethanol were similar to the ones found using subcritical propane (
