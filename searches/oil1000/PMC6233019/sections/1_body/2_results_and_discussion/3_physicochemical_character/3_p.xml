<p class="p">Linseed oil acidity was statistically different among all extraction methods studied. The highest (1.76%) and lowest (0.95%) values were obtained using pressurized ethanol and subcritical propane, respectively. The highest acidity values were found after extractions with organic solvent (1.46%) and pressurized ethanol (1.75%). Such results were obtained since heating was used in both methods. Extractions using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (68 Â°C) and pressurized ethanol have a solvent evaporation step after the extraction. Heating can cause a triglyceride chain break during extraction, hence increasing acidity through fatty acid release (
