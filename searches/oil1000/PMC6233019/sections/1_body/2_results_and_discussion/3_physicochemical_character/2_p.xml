 <xref rid="t4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the density and refractive indices were not statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) for all linseed oil samples using the different extraction methods, as confirmed by Tukeyâ€™s test, with 95% confidence level. According to the Adolfo Lutz Institute, Brazil (
