<p class="p">Vegetable oil industrial production uses mechanical press extraction. This method allows the utilization of residual cake, with low initial operation costs, and eliminates contaminants. However, it is not an efficient extraction process, extracting less than 70% oil content from the seed (

 </xref>). Extraction with organic solvents (hexane, ethanol, heptane and isobutene) in industrial plants yields around 99% oil. However, this process shows a series of disadvantages including time-consuming procedures, low selectivity, solvent contamination and degradation of key bioactive components (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>). Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with solvents occurs at temperatures above boiling point, when pressure in the extraction system increases. Pressure reduces solvent surface tension, which improves penetration into the matrix pores, resulting in rupture and increase of mass transfer, thus improving extraction efficiency (
