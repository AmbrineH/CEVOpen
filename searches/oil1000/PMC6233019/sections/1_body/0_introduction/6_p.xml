<p class="p">Due to linseed oil potential, studies to maximize production and improve oil quality by increasing the content of fatty acids are vital. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate three different linseed oil extraction methods (SFE, PLE and Soxhlet), in terms of yield, essential fatty acid content and physicochemical quality, in comparison with commercial oil.</p>
