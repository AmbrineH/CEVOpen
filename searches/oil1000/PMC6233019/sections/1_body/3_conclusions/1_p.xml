<p class="p">Physicochemical analyses of density and refractive index of oil samples obtained using the different extraction methods were similar. All extraction methods gave similar fatty acid ester profile. The subcritical propane was an efficient method for brown linseed oil extraction achieving good yield, maintaining the quality and quantity of fatty acids at mild temperature and pressure conditions, and completly removing the solvent from the final product. Since extraction using subcritical propane was economically feasible on a laboratory scale, an industrial scale process is recommended for capacity increase.</p>
