 <p class="p">This work aims at characterizing linseed oil obtained using different extraction methods (hexane, subcritical propane and pressurized ethanol), and comparing the results with commercial linseed oil extracted by cold mechanical press method. An experimental design helped to evaluate temperature and pressure effects on the oil extraction using propane and ethanol. Gas chromatography assisted in evaluating the essential fatty acids. There were no significant differences among the ω-3, 6 and 9 fatty acids from linseed oil obtained using the different extraction methods. Only the acidity of linseed oil extracted by subcritical propane (0.956%) showed significant differences among the physicochemical parameters. Extraction using organic solvent (Soxhlet) gave a 36.12% yield. Extraction using subcritical propane at 10
  <sup class="sup">7</sup> Pa and 40 °C for 1.5 h gave a better yield (28.39%) than pressurized ethanol (8.05%) under similar conditions. Linseed oil extraction using subcritical propane was economically viable, resulting in a 124.58 US$/L product cost. The results present subcritical propane extraction as a promising alternative for obtaining linseed oil at mild temperature and pressure conditions, without losing quality and quantity of fatty acids such as ω-3, 6 and 9.
