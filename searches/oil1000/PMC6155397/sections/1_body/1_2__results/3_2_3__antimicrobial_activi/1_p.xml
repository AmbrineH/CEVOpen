<p class="p">The antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition zone diameters (IZD) and MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values by the microdilution method. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00381-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The inhibition zone diameter of almost 15 mm was indicative of a good antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the corresponding minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was equal to 0.512 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Thus, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> showed a strong antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive and negative bacteria with MIC values of 0.270 mg/mL (IZD: 15.1–15.4 mm) and 0.150–0.480 mg/mL (IZD: 9.0–21.8 mm), respectively. The best activities were observed against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with an MIC value of 0.150 mg/mL (IZD: 21.8 mm) followed by 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, it did not have a significant activity against the fungus (MIC: &gt;0.5 mg/mL).
