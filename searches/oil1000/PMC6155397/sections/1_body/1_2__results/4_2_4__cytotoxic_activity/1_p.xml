<p class="p">General cell toxic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> essential oil were evaluated by using the MTT assay against HepG2 cells (liver hepatocellular cell line) and MCF-7 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line). All cell lines were subjected to increasing concentrations of essential oil for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00381-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00381-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The essential oil exhibited a significant growth inhibition against the examined human cancer cells and induced a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect at concentrations ranging from 0.016â€“2 mg/mL. The oil was found to be able to inhibit HepG2 cells (liver hepatocellular cells), with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.072 mg/mL (Table 4), as well as MCF-7 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.188 mg/mL (Table 5) after 72 h of incubation.
