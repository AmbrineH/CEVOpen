<p class="p">The DPPH test aimed to measure the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) by the donation of hydrogen atoms or electrons [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The effect of the oil on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene), used as positive control, and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were determined. The scavenging effect of the essential oil and standard BHT on the DPPH radical expressed as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values was 0.451 mg/mL for
