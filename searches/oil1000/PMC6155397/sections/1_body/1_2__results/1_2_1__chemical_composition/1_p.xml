 <xref rid="molecules-22-00381-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. GC-MS analyses revealed that the essential oil had a complex chemical profile. Separation of volatile components was accomplished by using a polar column (HP-5 MS). A total of fifty-six compounds represented 97.2% of the oil. The main fraction of the essential oil consisted of monoterpenes (60.6%), represented by oxygenated compounds (56.4%) and hydrocarbons (4.2%). The essential oil composition was dominated by blumenol C (49.7%), β-cedrene (6.1%), limonene (3.8%), α-guaiene (3.3%), cryptone (3.1%), and α-cyperone (2.7%).
