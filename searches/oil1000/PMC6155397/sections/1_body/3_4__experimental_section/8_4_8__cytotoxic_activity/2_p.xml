<p class="p">Then, 10 μL of MTT was added to each well (5 mg/mL) and the incubation was continued for a further 2 h. 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance (A) was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan Ascent microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The assay was realized in triplicate as a cell viability index. The percentages of cell growth were calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Cell growth (%) = [A (sample)/A (control)] × 100%
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
