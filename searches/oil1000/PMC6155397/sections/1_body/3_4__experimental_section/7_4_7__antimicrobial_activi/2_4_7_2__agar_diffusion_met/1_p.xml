<p class="p">The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> were assessed using paper disk agar diffusion, according to the method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard, with some modification [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Absorbent disks (Whatman disk of 6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 15 μL of essential oil or chloramphenicol, ampicillin, or ketoconazole as a positive control and were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the inhibition zone, by examining the disk diffusion plates from the back, viewed against a black background and illuminated with reflected light. With a caliper, the diameter of each zone of inhibition was measured and recorded to the nearest whole millimeter. This is the diameter of the zone visibly presenting the absence of bacterial growth, including the 6 mm disk.
