<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for all oils by using the microplate dilution method [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Stock solutions of the oils and the standard antibacterial compound chloramphenicol were prepared in the Mueller Hinton Broth liquid medium, and stock solutions of the oils and standard antifungal compounds ampicillin and ketoconazole were prepared in the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) liquid medium. Serial dilution of the initial concentrations were prepared on 96-well microlitre plates containing equal amounts of distilled water. The microbial suspension concentration was standardized to McFarland No. 0.5 after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. Cultures were mixed with essential oils and were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC: mg/mL) was detected as the minimum concentration where microbial growth was missing. 1% 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was used as an indicator of microbial growth. In order to facilitate the dispersion of the essential oil in the aqueous nutrient medium, it was diluted with Tween 20, at a ratio of 15%. The negative control containing only Tween 20 was not toxic to the microorganisms [
