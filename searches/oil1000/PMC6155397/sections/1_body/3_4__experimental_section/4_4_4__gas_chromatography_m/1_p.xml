<p class="p">GC-MS analyses were carried out using a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent) fitted with an HP-5MS fused silica column, interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5975C mass selective detector operated by HP Enhanced ChemStation software (Agilent). The oven temperature was programmed from 60–280 °C at 5 °C/min using helium as a carrier gas at 1.2 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C; the injection volume was 0.2 μL of 1% solution prepared in n-hexane; split ratio 1:50. GC parameters were the same as above; Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV. The mass range was from
