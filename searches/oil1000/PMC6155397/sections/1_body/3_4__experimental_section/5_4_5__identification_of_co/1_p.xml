<p class="p">The oil components were identified from their GC retention indices (RI) obtained with reference to n-alkanes series on a HP-5MS column, and comparison of their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns by computer matching with the Nist 8.0 Mass Spectral Database for GC-MS. The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on GC peak area (FID response) without using a correction factor. The result of the analysis is shown in
