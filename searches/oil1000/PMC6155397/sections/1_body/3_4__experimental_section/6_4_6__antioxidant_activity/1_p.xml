<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was determined with the DPPH radical protocol [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. DPPH is a well-known radical and a trap for other radicals. Therefore, the rate reduction of a chemical reaction upon addition of DPPH is used as an indicator of the radical nature of that reaction. Because of a strong absorption band centered at about 520 nm, the DPPH radical has a deep violet color in solution, and it becomes colorless or pale yellow when neutralized. This property allows visual monitoring of the reaction, and the number of initial radicals can be counted from the change in the optical absorption at 520 nm or in the EPR (Electron Spin Resonance) signal of the DPPH [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Free radical scavenging activity of the essential oil was measured by a spectrophotometer at 517 nm. A methanol solution of DPPH was prepared immediately before the assay. Various concentrations of each 2 mL sample (0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250, 0.300, 0.350, 0.400, 0.450, 0.500 mg/mL) were added to 2 mL of DPPH solution. The reaction mixture was shaken and allowed to stand for 30 min in the shade. The absorbance of the samples was measured by a spectrophotometer at 517 nm and calculated by the following equation: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">DPPH radical scavenging activity = (A
  <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">0</sub> × 100%
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the control (blank, without extract) and A
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture with the essential oil. In this assay, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a standard antioxidant to validate the assay. The experiment was repeated three times. The result of the antioxidant activity test is shown in
