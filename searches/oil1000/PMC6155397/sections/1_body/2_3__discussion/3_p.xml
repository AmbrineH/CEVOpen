<p class="p">The results from the growth inhibition zone diameters (IZD) and the MIC values indicated that the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> had strong inhibitory effects against all Gram-negative bacteria and certain Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.270 mg/mL (IZD:15.1–15.4 mm) and 0.150 mg/mL (IZD: 9.0–21.8 mm), respectively. 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was the most sensitive strain with an MIC value of 0.150 mg/mL (IZD: 21.8 mm) followed by

 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses an intrinsic resistance, which is associated with the nature of its outer membrane to a wide range of biocides. The outer layer of the Gram-negative outer membrane is composed primarily of lipopolysaccharide. This forms a hydrophilic permeability barrier which provides protection against the effects of toxic agents [

 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa.</italic> It is well known that essential oils and their components show a better antimicrobial effectiveness against Gram-positive bacteria. Due to the composition of the outer membrane, essential oil can not only alter such structures but can penetrate within the cell, leading to alterations such as the denaturation of proteins and enzymes, the “unbalance” of the K
