<p class="p">This work reports on the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> essential oil. It shows cytotoxic activities on breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 (0.188 mg/mL, IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) and hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (0.072 mg/mL, IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). The results quite modestly display that the oil does affect the growth of these tested cancer cell lines. From this, certain antitumor activity can be expected but remains to be further explored. The toxic activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> against the tested bacteria could be attributed to the presence of significant amounts of limonene (3.8%), β-cedrene (6.1%), α-cyperone (2.7%), and myristicin (1.2%). In previous studies, the principal metabolites of limonene are 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-carveol, a product of 6-hydroxylation, and perillyl alcohol, a product of 7-hydroxylation by the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 cytochromes in human liver microsomes [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Perillyl alcohol has been investigated for its pharmacological activity as a dietary chemotherapeutic agent. They are viewed as novel therapeutic options in some CNS neoplasms and other solid tumours, particularly for the treatment of gliomas [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The cytotoxic activities of perillyl alcohol and limonene metabolites are likely due to their antiangiogenic activities, hyperthermia inducing effects, as well as negative apoptosis regulation and Ras (Renin-Agiotensin System) pathways [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Moreover, β-cedrene is considered to be a powerful antimicrobial and antitumor agent [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. α-Cyperone has been shown to alleviate lung cell injury caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, to be effective against 
 <italic class="italic">E.</italic>
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic>, and to act as an anti-inflammatory agent [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Myristicin is a naturally occurring alkenylbenzene compound found in nutmeg, and it induces cytotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells by an apoptotic mechanism [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Moreover, besides the contribution of specific constituents, the synergism between various components of the essential oil could play an important role in the cytotoxic effect verified in this study against HepG2 and MCF-7 cells.
