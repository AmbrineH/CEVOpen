<p class="p">To our knowledge, there are no literature reports on the chemical composition and biological activities of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla.</italic> Thus, our findings are of interest. In this study, the oxygenated monoterpenes (56.4%) were revealed as predominant over the monoterpene hydrocarbons (4.2%). The oil was found to contain primarily blumenol C (49.7%), β-cedrene (6.1%), limonene (3.8%), α-guaiene (3.3%), cryptone (3.1%), and α-cyperone (2.7%). Blumenol C was first isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Podocarpus blumei</italic> in 1972. The absolute stereochemistry of blumenol C was then determined as (6
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>,9
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>) by the chemical conversion of a related compound. Its glucoside, i.e., blumenol C glucoside, was then isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Epimedium grandiflorum</italic> var.

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This compound is used in traditional medicine and in cosmetic products. Moreover, cedrene is found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of CYP2B6-mediated bupropion hydroxylase [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Another main component is limonene, which is common in cosmetic products. As a flavouring compound, limonene is used in food manufacturing and certain medicines, e.g., as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids. In natural and alternative medicine, it is marketed to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Additionally, limonene is being increasingly used as a solvent for cleaning purposes, such as the removal of oil from machines [
