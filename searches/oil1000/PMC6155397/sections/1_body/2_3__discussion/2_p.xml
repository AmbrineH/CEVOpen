<p class="p">In the radical scavenging activity assay, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> displayed weak activity. Essential oils are quite complex mixtures composed of a great variety of compounds. Generally, because of this complexity it is difficult to explain their activities. Many reports on the antioxidant potentials of essential oils often refer to concepts such as synergism, antagonism, and additivity [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The chemical components of the oil were dominated by blumenol C (49.7%), Î²-cedrene (6.1%), and limonene (3.8%), which displayed low inhibition of free radicals. The antioxidant property of the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> essential oil stands out when compared to the 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> oil, since its IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value is 0.065 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. It could be inferred that the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> oil is mainly due to the presence of its major compounds, namely 1,8-cineole (63.8%). 1,8-cineole showed various degrees of reducing power, radical scavenging, chelating, in addition to its DNA-protective capacity [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-00381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Moreover, the high value of the reducing power indicated that the essential oil components are able to act as electron donors and reduce the oxidized intermediate of lipid peroxidation so that they can act as primary and secondary antioxidants [
