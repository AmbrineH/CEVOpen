<p class="p">There were no literature reports on the chemical composition and biological activities of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla.</italic> Therefore, we used the hydrodistillation method to collect the oil, and we identified the chemical composition of the oil by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detection) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer). Furthermore, the essential oil was investigated for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities.
