<p class="p">Our research provide evidence that the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> can be considered as a good source of bioactive compounds such as blumenol C. Moreover, the results indicate that the oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> exhibits antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> with an MIC value of 0.15 mg/mL, and also some antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with an MIC value of 0.27 mg/mL. It may thus have a certain potential to cure gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and neonatal meningitis.
