<p class="p">Due to no previous knowledge, we identified the chemical components of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> by using GC-MS. Furthermore, we studied its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities. The oil was shown to possess high levels of oxygenated monoterpenes with strong antibacterial and antitumor potential which might be due to the presence of blumenol C (49.7%), cedrene (6.1%), and limonene (3.8%), potentially leading to its ecofriendly and beneficial utilization in pharmaceutical applications.
