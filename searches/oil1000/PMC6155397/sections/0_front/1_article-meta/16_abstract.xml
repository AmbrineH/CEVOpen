  <italic class="italic">,</italic> an erect shrub, was widely used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat dysentery, appendicitis, and infections. In this study, the essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> Turcz. was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC (Gas Chromatography) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer). Fifty-six compounds were identified in the oil which comprised about 97.2% of the total composition of the oil. Major components of the oil were blumenol C (49.7%), β-cedrene (6.1%), limonene (3.8%), α-guaiene (3.3%), cryptone (3.1%), and α-cyperone (2.7%). Furthermore, we assessed the in vitro biological activities displayed by the oil obtained from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic>, namely the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For this, the IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was estimated to be 0.451 mg/mL. The essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> exhibited considerable antibacterial capacity against 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> with an MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) value of 0.15 mg/mL, along with noticeable antibacterial ability against 
  <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with an MIC value of 0.27 mg/mL. However, the essential oil did not show significant activity against fungus. The oil was tested for its cytotoxic activity towards HepG2 (liver hepatocellular cells) and MCF-7 Cells (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line) using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, and exerted cytotoxic activity with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.072 and 0.188 mg/mL for 72 h. In conclusion, the essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">P. microphylla</italic> is an inexpensive but favorable resource with strong antibacterial capacity as well as cytotoxic activity. Thus, it has the potential for utilization in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.
