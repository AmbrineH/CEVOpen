  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">The genus 
   <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> comprises 150 species, most of which have interesting medicinal properties. 
   <italic class="italic">Lippia sidoides</italic> (syn. 
   <italic class="italic">L. origanoides</italic>) exhibits strong antimicrobial activity and is included in the phytotherapy program implemented by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Since species of 
   <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> are morphologically very similar, conventional taxonomic methods are sometimes insufficient for the unambiguous identification of plant material that is required for the production of certified phytomedicines. Therefore, genetic and chemical analysis with chemotype identification will contribute to a better characterization of Lippia species.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Amplified Length Polymorphism and Internal Transcribed Spacer molecular markers were applied to determine the plantsâ€™ genetic variability, and the chemical variability of 
   <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> spp. was determined by essential oil composition.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">Amplified Length Polymorphism markers were efficient in demonstrating the intra and inter-specific genetic variability of the genus and in separating the species 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">L. lupulina</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">L. origanoides</italic> into distinct groups. Phylogenetic analysis using Amplified Length Polymorphism and markers produced similar results and confirmed that 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">L. lupulina</italic> shared a common ancestor that differ from 
   <italic class="italic">L. origanoides</italic>. Carvacrol, endo-fenchol and thymol were the most relevant chemical descriptors.

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">Based on the phylogenetic analysis it is proposed that 
   <italic class="italic">L. grata</italic> should be grouped within 
   <italic class="italic">L. origanoides</italic> due to its significant genetic similarity. Although Amplified Length Polymorphism and Internal Transcribed Spacer markers enabled the differentiation of individuals, the genotype selection for the production of certified phytomedicines must also consider the chemotype classification that reflects their real medicinal properties.
