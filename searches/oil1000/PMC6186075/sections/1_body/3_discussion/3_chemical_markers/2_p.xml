<p id="Par37" class="p">The chemotypes may be associated with the diverse biotic and abiotic stimuli to which each of the individuals had been subjected, which led to the creation of a complex biological system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. It is clear that nowadays the taxonomic identification of plants frequently rely on molecular biology techniques, especially when plants exhibit very similar morphological characters. In regards to medicinal plants, the use of chemical markers becomes essential if we consider that the biological activity can, most of the time, be related to a specific chemotype. Therefore, when any species is employed in the production of certified phytomedicines, the plant material must be identified taxonomically and the chemotype identified to assure the biological activity of the extract.
