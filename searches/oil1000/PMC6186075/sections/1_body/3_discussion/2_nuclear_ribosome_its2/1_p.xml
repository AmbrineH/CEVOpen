<p id="Par32" class="p">The results presented herein show that species in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Glandularia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Junellia</italic> may be considered genetically similar as were forming one group (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), thus confirming former results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the species used as an outgroup, 
 <italic class="italic">Phyla</italic> canescens, showed clear genetic divergence from 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Glandularia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Junellia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic>, even though the separation of these genus has been proposed based on increased morphological descriptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>].
