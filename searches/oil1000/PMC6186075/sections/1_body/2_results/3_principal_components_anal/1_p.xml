<p id="Par28" class="p">The application of PCA analysis allowed individuals to be grouped according to their different chemical profiles and enabled the seven original chemical descriptors, namely carvacrol, 
 <italic class="italic">endo</italic>-fenchol, thymol, β-caryophyllene, isoborneol, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene, and bicyclogermacrene, to be reduced to the first three (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Endo</italic>-fenchol (PC1) and carvacrol (PC2) accounted for most of the total variation (86.36%), with the first and second components contributing factors of 0.69 and 0.17, respectively, while the contribution of thymol was minimal (only 0.063). Considering all the analyzed individuals, 72% contained carvacrol and 16% contained 
 <italic class="italic">endo</italic>-fenchol; since no individuals contained both carvacrol and 
 <italic class="italic">endo</italic>-fenchol, the quantification of these two components would cover 88% of the analyzed samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
