<p id="Par23" class="p">The measure of shared variance between the genetic and geographic variables for individuals in group 3 showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.80; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.46), while the isolation by distance showed the existence of gene flow across group 3 (
