<p id="Par26" class="p">The phylogenetic analysis based on the species from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana</italic> (A), 
 <italic class="italic">Glandularia</italic> (B), 
 <italic class="italic">Junellia</italic> (C), and 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> (D) demonstrated separation of the three branches into four principal clusters with 83%, 93%, 85%, and 96% bootstrap, respectively. In the 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana</italic> group, 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia lupulina</italic> (L165) and 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia alba</italic> (L120, L121, L122, L128), divided into subgroups with a bootstrap of 71% and 83%, respectively, were also identified. The group of 
 <italic class="italic">Glandularia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Junellia</italic> was clearly subdivided into two groups: one belonging to the species of 
 <italic class="italic">Glandularia</italic> and another to the 
 <italic class="italic">Junellia</italic> subgroup.
