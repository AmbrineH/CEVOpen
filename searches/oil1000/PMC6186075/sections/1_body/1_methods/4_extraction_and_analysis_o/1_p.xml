A mixture of essential oil/ethyl acetate (v/4v) was analysed using gas chromatograph Varian, model 3900 (Palo Alto, CA, USA), coupled with a Saturn 2100T ion trap mass selective detector and equipped with a non-polar DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm). The analytical conditions were: carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; oven temperature 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; injector temperature 240 °C; detector temperature 230 °C; injector split ratio 1:20; injection volume 1 μL; ionization voltage 70 eV. Individual components of oil samples were identified from their Kovats retention indices [
