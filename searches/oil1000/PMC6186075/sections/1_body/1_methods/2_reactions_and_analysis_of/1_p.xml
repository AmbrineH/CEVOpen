<p id="Par17" class="p">Samples from all 141 genotypes were analyzed according to the method of Vos et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA (300 ng) was digested with 
 <italic class="italic">Eco</italic>RI/
 <italic class="italic">Mse</italic>I enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, US) at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by inactivation at 70 °C for 5 min. Resulting DNA fragments were ligated to adaptors complementary to the restriction enzymes recognition sites and the ligation products were then diluted 6× with deionized water. In the first round of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pre-selective amplification was achieved with primers 
 <italic class="italic">Eco</italic>RI + 1 (50 µM) and 
 <italic class="italic">Mse</italic>I + 1 (50 µM). The pre-selective products were diluted 10× with deionized water and a second round of PCR was carried out using marker primers fluorescently tagged with IRDye
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The selected marked primers were those that generated the largest number of polymorphic bands. Genotyping of individuals was performed using a 4300 DNA Analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) while data alignment was accomplished with the aid of Saga
 <sup class="sup">MX</sup> Automated AFLP Analysis software version 3.3 guided by molecular weight markers in the range 50–700 bp. A binary matrix was constructed based on a 1/0 score for the presence/absence of each electrophoretic band. The genetic distance was calculated from the binary matrix using Jaccard indices, whereas the dendrogram was constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) clustering technique with 1000 permutations and Free Tree software version 0.9.1.50 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>] and visualized through TreeView X program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. The genetic structure of genotypes was established by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using the software GenAlEx version 6.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] and STRUCTURE version 2.2.4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>], which generated a posterior distribution based on Bayesian and admixture models. Each analysis comprised a “burn-in” of 200,000 interactions followed by a run length of 500,000 interactions and five independent runs for each 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> value (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 1 to 7). The most probable number of genetic groups was determined from the Δ
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> value [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The correlation between genetic and geographical data was performed using the Mantel test and the POPGENE 32 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] and GENES version 2009.7.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] programs with 1000 simulations.
