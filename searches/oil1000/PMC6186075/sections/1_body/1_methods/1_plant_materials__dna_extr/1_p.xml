<p id="Par16" class="p">We used 141 accessions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) comprising six 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> species; although 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sidoides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. origanoides</italic> are synonymous, they were considered, for the purposes of this study, as they were classified. Thirty-seven of these accessions were from the medicinal plants germplasm bank (Ribeirão Preto University, Brazil) and 104 were collected in the medicinal botanical garden of Nature Pharmacy, Brazil, with voucher numbers; 1340; 1350;1351; 1353; 1355; 1359; 1360; 1362–1365; 1368–1376; 1378–1380; 2000–2015; 2017–2112; 2114; 2471; 2473–2475. Sampling permission, for both locations, were obtained from by the Brazilian Council for the Administration and Management of Genetic Patrimony (CGEN) of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (MMA) by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq—CGEN/MMA Process #: 02001.005059/2011-71). Fátima R. G. Salimena (Juiz de Fora Federal University, Brazil) identified all samples. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 0.15 g of frozen leaves using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. The DNA integrity was determined by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and the concentration and quality of the isolated nucleic acid was determined by a NanoPhotometer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> P360 spectrophotometer (Inplen, Westlake Village, CA, USA).
