<p id="Par12" class="p">However, the taxonomic classification of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic> remains incoherent mainly due to the morphological variability within the genus and the existence of a great number of nomenclatures for this species resulting in classification dualism, both of which can be explained if we consider the interaction between the genotype and the environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. In this context, studies aimed at evaluating the genetic structure of the genus through analysis of molecular markers could be useful in classifying species into clusters according to their genetic similarities.
