 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] developed a phylogenetic classification based on the secondary metabolites produced by Fabaceae, Solanaceae and Lamiacea families. The author considered that the ability or inability to produce a specific metaboliteâ€”shown by different members of related phylogenetic groups, are the result of differential expression patterns that reflect specific plant strategies for adaptation that were incorporated into the phylogenetic structure.
