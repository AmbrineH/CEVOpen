<p id="Par14" class="p">The supplementation with EPA-rich oil delayed tissue repair on the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> and 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> days after wounding in relation to the control group, based on wound area percentage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). The histological analyses of wounds revealed that the EPA group presented a larger longitudinal wound diameter than the control group on the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> day after wounding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>, arrows), corroborating the macroscopic analysis. Although the total healing time was not affected by EPA, at 21 days after wounding, animals that received EPA-rich oil presented packed parallel layers of collagen, whereas in the control mice there was a basket-weave organization of collagen bundles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>). Moreover, qualitative analysis showed that there were more hair follicles on control skin than in the EPA group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>) indicating a delay in the return of skin function in EPA mice. Control group showed thick collagen fiber deposition and fasciculate orientation (detail), thin squamous stratified epithelium and bulbs of hair follicles and sebaceous glands at the lesion area. EPA group showed impaired thick collagen fiber deposition and mixed orientation (detail), thicker squamous stratified epithelium and scarce presence of bulbs of hair follicles and sebaceous glands at the lesion area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>).
