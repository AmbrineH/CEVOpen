<p id="Par21" class="p">Then we analyzed the cytokine profile through the wound healing process. EPA reduced the concentrations of IL-1β and increased TNF-α 1 day after skin wounding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3D</xref>). On the other hand, EPA increased IL-10 concentrations at the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> day until the 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> after wounding. There was also an increase in IL-6 concentrations at this time point in scar tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3D</xref>). We observed no alterations in MMP9 concentrations at the times analyzed. However, supplementation with EPA-rich oil decreased TIMP-1 levels on the 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> and 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> days after lesion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3D</xref>).
