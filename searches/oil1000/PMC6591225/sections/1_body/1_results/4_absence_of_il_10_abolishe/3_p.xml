<p id="Par26" class="p">The M2 population of the wound at the 10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day was analyzed by flow cytometry and we observed no difference between the IL-10
 <sup class="sup">−/−</sup> mice and IL-10
 <sup class="sup">−/−</sup> mice treated with EPA-rich oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref>). These results suggest that the increase of M2 in the animals supplemented with EPA may be related to the increase of IL-10 at 3 and 7 days after tissue injury.
