 </sup> our next step was to evaluate the fatty acid composition of skin after oral administration of EPA-rich oil. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C–F</xref>, the EPA group had higher incorporation of ω-3 fatty acids, mainly docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5ω-3) and DHA into the phosphatidylcholine (PC) fraction of skin and higher incorporation of DHA into the phosphatidyletanolamine (PE) fraction in relation to the Control group. There was lower incorporation of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4ω-6) in both fractions in the EPA group when compared to the Control group. The ω-6/ω-3 ratio was also lower in both skin lipid fractions in the EPA group. Thus, the experimental protocol used was effective in modifying both the serum and skin fatty acid composition throughout the experiments.
