<p id="Par11" class="p">After 4 weeks of feeding the oil, a wound was induced in the animal’s dorsum and blood samples were collected at specific time points (3, 7, 10 and 21 days) for the analysis of serum fatty acids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A,B</xref>). During the inflammatory phase (3 days), we observed a 6-fold increase in EPA (20:5ω-3) and a 33% increase in DHA (22:6ω-3) concentrations in the EPA group when compared to the control animals (C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>). No alterations were observed in the concentrations of ω-6 fatty acids in serum. We also calculated the ω-6/ω-3 ratio and the EPA group had a lower ratio throughout the wound healing process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>).
