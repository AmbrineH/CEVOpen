 </sup>. Mammalian skin is divided into epidermis that contains keratinocytes, and dermis composed of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). In ECM, collagen, laminins, and elastic fibers provide flexibility; whereas glycosaminoglycan, proteoglycans and hyaluroan stabilize growth factors and the three-dimensional space by their high water-binding ability

 </sup>. Skin has appendages (hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands) and nerves, sensory corpuscles and vasculature. The dermis and skin appendages have important roles in the reepithelialization process because they provide nutritional and mechanical support and supply progenitor cells for the restoration of the epidermis after wounding

 </sup>. Skin homeostasis is provided by the epidermis, dermis and ECM through the interaction between keratinocytes, fibroblasts and resident immune cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes
