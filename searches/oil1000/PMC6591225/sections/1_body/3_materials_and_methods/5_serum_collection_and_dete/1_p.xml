<p id="Par61" class="p">Blood was collected at 3, 7 and 21 days after the surgery: after thoracotomy, the blood was collected by cardiac puncture from the left ventricle. Blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The serum was used for fatty acid determinations. Total lipid was extracted from serum and from skin into chloroform:methanol (2:1 vol/vol) as were described
