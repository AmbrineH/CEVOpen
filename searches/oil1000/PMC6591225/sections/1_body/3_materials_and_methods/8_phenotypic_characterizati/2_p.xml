<p id="Par68" class="p">The resulting cell suspension (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells) was washed twice with PBS containing 1% albumin and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. CD45-FITC, Ly6G-PE, F4/80-APC-Cy7, CD11c-PE, CD206-APC, TCRb-PE-Cy7, CD4-APC, CD8-PE conjugated specific antibody was added to this suspension (1:10) and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min protected from light. Negative control cells were incubated with the non-reactive labeled IgG antibody. After this period, the cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed on the BD-FACS Accuri flow cytometry® (BD Bioscience, Maryland, USA), and the fluorescence was determined by the specific filters for each fluorochrome. One hundred thousand events were acquired per sample in histograms. Histograms were analyzed using BD Accuri software (BD Bioscience, Maryland, USA). The gate strategy is shown in Supplemental Fig.
