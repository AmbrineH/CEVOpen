<p id="Par70" class="p">Wound tissues removed at 0 hours, 1, 3 and 7 days after wound induction were immediately packed in dry ice and kept frozen (−80 °C) until they were homogenized. For homogenization, phosphate-buffered saline was supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics®, Mannheim, Germany). Tissue (100 mg) was homogenized with a Polytron PT 1200 (Kinematica®, Lucerne, Switzerland). Samples were then sonicated for 1 minute and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min

 </sup>. The concentrations of cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL-1, IL-6 and IL-10), growth factors (VEGF), collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), in the supernatants, were assessed by ELISA using the Duo Set kit (R&amp;D System®, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The concentrations were normalized by the amount of protein in the samples, determined by the method were described
