 </sup>. Briefly, the slides were incubated with Sirius Red solution dissolved in aqueous saturated picric acid for 1 h, washed in tap water, incubated for 15 min in hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. The sections were then examined and imaged using a Leica stereoscopic microscope (MZ10F, Wetzlar, Alemanha) coupled with a Leica camera (DFC310 FX, Wetzlar, Alemanha) and Olympus microscope (U-LH100HG, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) with images representative of the histological structures registered in digital image capture and analysis system (Camera: Olympus/U-TVO.63XC/T2, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan).
