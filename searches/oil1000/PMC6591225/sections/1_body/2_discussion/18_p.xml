<p id="Par47" class="p">The effects of IL-10 on wound healing process are dose-dependent, as demonstrated by Gordon 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2008). In this study, the adenoviral-mediated overexpression of IL-10 prevented scar formation. In a titer experiment, it was demonstrated that the ideal IL-10 concentration achieved to improve the healing was 831, 4 pg/ml

 </sup>. This means that IL-10 concentrations above or below this value compromises the healing process. Considering that, in our study, the highest IL-10 concentration, measured at wound site, was ± 116 pg/mg of protein, it means a 8-fold less IL-10 in our work than in Gordon’s study.
