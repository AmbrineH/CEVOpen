<p id="Par42" class="p">The elevation in IL-6 concentrations at the 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day may be related to the increase of M2-macrophages, since IL-6 has a pleiotropic action. IL-6 has a dual function in the immune system: it exerts a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effect depending on the microenvironment

 </sup>. Although IL-6 is commonly associated with proinflammatory functions and is implicated in the pathogenesis/pathophysiology of numerous inflammatory diseases, it may potentiate the polarization of alternatively activated macrophages based on increased expression of markers: arginase-1, Ym1, and CD206, through IL-4 and IL-13Â stimulation

 </sup>. In the study by FU 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., (2017), a positive correlation was demonstrated between the number of M2 macrophages (CD163
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>CD206
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) and IL-6 production. This effect may be due to the greater activation of STAT3
