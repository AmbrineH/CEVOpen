<p id="Par45" class="p">Considering the significant increase in IL-10 concentrations during the wound healing process in the EPA group and the effects of this cytokine on the inflammatory response, we hypothesized that IL-10 could have a central role in the effects of EPA on wound healing. This hypothesis was confirmed since when IL-10
 <sup class="sup">−/−</sup> mice were treated with EPA-rich oil, the healing time was normalized and the collagen organization was improved (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These observations are suggestive that decreased synthesis and/or altered molecular assembly of ECM components in the EPA-group may be due to the increase in IL-10.
