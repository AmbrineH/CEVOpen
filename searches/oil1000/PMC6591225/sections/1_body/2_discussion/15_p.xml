 </sup>. Considering that in a wound there are different cell types, in different stage of activation (M1 and M2 for example), as demonstrated in the present study, the interpretation of cytokines concentrations is much more complex than in a cell culture study. It is know that microenvironment influences the biology of the entire tissue
