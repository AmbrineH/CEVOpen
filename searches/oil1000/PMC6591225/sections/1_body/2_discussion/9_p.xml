 </sup>. In this model, macrophage phenotypes are designated as primary colors (red, yellow and blue). The interconnection among the primary colors generates the secondary colors such as green. So, secondly in this model the green color represents macrophages that share functions of wound healing and regulatory macrophages, for example
