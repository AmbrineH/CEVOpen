<p id="Par52" class="p">Taken together, our results demonstrate that EPA had a predominantly anti-inflammatory character, demonstrated by elevation in CD45
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>F4/80
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>CD206
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> cells and the increase in IL-10 concentrations in scar tissue. IL-10 seems to have a deleterious effect on wound healing and on collagen organization in healthy animals. Collectively, findings from this study enhance our understanding of EPA-rich oil effects on wound healing.
