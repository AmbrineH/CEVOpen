<p id="Par49" class="p">There are few studies that investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on collagen biology. It is know that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) regulates numerous biological processes, among them, collagen synthesis

 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) demonstrated that loss of PPAR-γ is associated with up regulation of collagen synthesis, at least in part, due to the TGF-β pathway
