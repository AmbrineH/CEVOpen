<p id="Par32" class="p">There are few studies showing the effects of ω-3 fatty acids on wound healing and the conclusions are inconsistent. In beagle dogs fed with a menhaden oil rich diet (the ω-6/ω-3 ratio was 0.3 compared with a control diet with the ω-6/ω-3 ratio of 7.7), there was a reduction in epithelialization and contraction of the wounds

 </sup>. On the other hand, in Sprague-Dawley rats, lipid emulsion administration improved the wound healing process due to a reduction in swelling around the wound in the early stages and increase of new vessel formation on granulation tissue in the proliferative phase

 </sup>. However, the lipid emulsion used was composed by 30% of soybean oil, 30% of medium-chain triglycerides, 25% of olive oil and 15% of fish oil

 </sup>. Thus, the effects observed in wound healing can be due to the mixture of oils, since we and others already demonstrated that omega-6 fatty acids, found in soybean oil, can improve the healing process

 </sup>. In this study, the formulation with ω-3 fatty acids contained other nutrients such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and arginine, that may influence the tissue repair process. On the other hand, healthy male and female volunteers (ages 18–45 years) that were supplemented with EPA (1.6 g) and DHA (1.1 g) daily during 4 weeks and submitted to blister wounds, had increased IL-1β concentrations in the blister fluid and had prolonged healing time, when compared to the placebo group that received mineral oil
