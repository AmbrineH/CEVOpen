 <p> Immunophenotyping and cytokine profile of wound tissue in the control group (C, Black bar) and EPA-group (EPA, grey bar). ( A– C) Percentage of positive neutrophils (CD45 +Ly6G +), M1 macrophages (CD45 +F4/80 +CD11c +), M2 macrophages (CD45 +F4/80 +CD206 +), T helper lymphocytes (CD45 +TCRb +CD4 +) and T cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD45 +TCRb +CD8 +) were quantified by flow cytometry in scar tissue harvested: ( A) before skin lesion (unwounded); ( B) 3 days after wounding and; ( C) 10 days after wounding. ( D) Concentrations of interleukin 1-β (IL- β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), keratinocyte chemoattractant (CXCL1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhbitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in wound tissue was analyzed by ELISA in tissue collected 1, 3 and 7 days after wounding (n = 5–12 animals/group). Values are expressed as mean ± SD. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001 indicates significant differences in relation to control as indicated by t Test and Mann Whitney posttest. </p>
