  <p class="p">Wound closure and dermal architecture of late granulation tissue (21 days after lesion) in the control group (C, Black bar) and EPA-group (EPA, grey bar). (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Wound area percentages during the experimental period and representative photos of wounds during the experiment (n = 7–9 animals/group). Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. *p &lt; 0.05 indicates significant differences in relation to the control as indicated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post-test. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Progression of the re-epithelium is indicated by arrows and graphs of wound diameter (mm) on skin harvested at 3 and 10 days (n = 4–5 animals/group). Scale bar: 1 mm. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. *p &lt; 0.05 indicates significant differences in relation to the control as indicated by test 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic> and Mann Whitney post-test. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Representative photomicrographs of skin stained with picrosirius and hematoxylin. The examination without (left) and with (right) polarized light revealed the organization and heterogeneity of collagen fiber orientation, squamous stratified epithelium (asterisk) and bulbs of the hair follicles (black arrowhead) and sebaceous glands (white arrowhead) in 21
   <sup class="sup">st</sup> day after lesion induction (n = 3–5 animals/group). Scale bar = 50 µm.
