 <p> Fatty acid composition of serum and unwounded skin throughout experiments in the control group (C, black bar) and EPA-group (EPA, grey bar). ( A) Omega-3 and omega-6 concentrations in serum. ( B) Omega-6/omega-3 ratio in serum. ( C) Omega-3 and omega-6 content of skin phosphatidylcholine (PC). ( D) Omega-6/omega-3 ratio in skin phosphatidylcholine (PC). ( E) Omega-3 and omega-6 content of skin phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). ( F) Omega-6/omega-3 ratio in skin phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). (n = 5–13 animals/group). Healthy mice were supplemented daily with EPA-rich oil (2 g of EPA-rich oil/kg bw) for 4 weeks and the serum and skin were sampled immediately prior to induction of the skin lesion and during the wound healing process. The percentage contribution of each fatty acid to the total fatty acid pool in each fraction was determined by gas chromatography. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001 indicates significant differences in relation to the control as indicated by Two-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post-test ( A, C, E) or test t and Mann Whitney post-test ( B, D, F). The fractions analyzed were: 18:2 (ω-6) – Linoleic acid (LA); 18:3 (ω-6) – Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA); 20:2 (ω-6) – Eicosadienoic acid; 20:3 (ω-6) – Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA); 20:4 (ω-6) – Arachidonic acid (AA); 18:3 (ω-3) – Alpha linolenic acid (ALA); 20:4 (ω-3) – Eicosatetrenoic acid (ETA); 20:5 (ω-3) – Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); 22:5 (ω-3) – Docosapentaenoi acid (DPA); 22:3 (ω-3) – Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). </p>
