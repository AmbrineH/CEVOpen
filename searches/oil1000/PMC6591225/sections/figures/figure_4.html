 <p> Wound healing, immunophenotyping, MMP9 and TIMP-1 production of scar tissue on 10 th day after wounding in IL-10 −/− mice and IL-10 −/− supplemented daily with EPA-rich oil. ( A) Wound area percentages during the experimental period in IL-10 −/− mice (blue line) and IL-10 −/− mice supplemented daily with EPA-rich oil (red line) (n = 5–7 animals/group). Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. The comparison between the groups was made through two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post-test. ( B) Percentage of positive M2 macrophages (CD45 +F4/80 +CD206 +), were quantified by flow cytometry in scar tissue harvested 10 days after wound induction. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3–4 animals/group). The comparison between the groups was made through t Test and Mann Whitney posttest. ( C) MMP9 and TIMP-1 quantification of scar tissue collected 10 days after wound induction. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 5–8 animals/group). *p &lt; 0.05 indicates significant differences in relation to control and #p &lt; 0.05 indicates significant differences in relation to IL-10 −/−. ( D) Representative photomicrographs of skin stained with picrosirius and hematoxylin. The examination without (left) and with (right) polarized light revealed the organization and heterogeneity of collagen fiber orientation, squamous stratified epithelium (asterisk) and bulbs of the hair follicles (black arrowhead) and sebaceous glands (white arrowhead) in 21 st day after lesion induction (n = 2–5 animals/group). Scale bar = 50 µm. </p>
