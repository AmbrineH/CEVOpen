  <p class="p">Effects of EPA on the wound healing process. The intake of EPA-enriched oil leads to an increment in the incorporation of omega-3 in cell membranes, an increase of M2 macrophages and an increase of a key anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by this cell population, interleukin-10, in the scar tissue. This anti-inflammatory effect of EPA is associated with delayed of wound closure and affects the reorganization of collagen.</p>
