<p class="p">A 3.0 g sample was parceled in filter paper (filter hole 0.3–0.5 μm) and placed in a dry tray for 2 hr. The drop loss can be calculated by comparing the initial and the final mass of sample. The pH values of the samples were measured using a Testo 205 pH meter (Testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany) by inserting an electrode into the dorsal muscle. The total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB‐N) was determined according to the method of Chomnawang, Nantachai, Yongsawatdigul, Thawornchinsombut, and Tungkawachara (
