 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Approximately 5.0 g of Pacific mackerel sample was homogenized with 45 ml of sterile 0.9% (w/v) normal saline (NS). The resulting suspensions were serially diluted (1:10) in sterile NS for bacteriological analysis. The total microbial counts were determined by the pour plate method using plate count agar. For TVC, the inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hr. For TPC, the inoculated plates were incubated at 7°C for 10 days. Results were showed by the logarithmic of total number of colonies (lg cfu/g).
