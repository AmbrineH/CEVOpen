<p class="p">GC‐MS (7890/5975, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) was carried out to analyze the chemical composite of CEOs. The electron impact ionization mode mass spectrometer operated in was at a voltage of 70 eV. The mass scan range was 40–400 amu. The flow rate of the helium carrier gas on HP‐5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm) was 1 ml/min. The chromatographic column is a fused silica capillary column HP‐5 (30 m × 0.25 mm). The analysis performed in the splitless mode, and injector temperature was 250°C. The column was held at 40°C for 1 min, and then increased from 40 to 220°C at 3°C/min, held at 220°C for 25 min, and finally increased to 280°C at a rate of 20°C/min, then held for 3 min. The identification of the individual compounds was based on the comparison of their relative retention times with those of authentic samples on the capillary column and by matching their mass spectra of peaks with available Wiley and NIST. The relative content of each component was calculated by area normalization method.</p>
