<p class="p">Pacific mackerel of similar size and shape were randomly divided into three groups (CK, T1, and T2), and after gutted and cleaned, each group has 15 fish samples. T1 and T2 were soaked in ice‐bathed chitosan solutions and in the chitosan–citrus essential oil solutions for 20 min, respectively. CK was soaked in water for the same time for comparison. The samples were then preserved in refrigerator under −3°C.</p>
