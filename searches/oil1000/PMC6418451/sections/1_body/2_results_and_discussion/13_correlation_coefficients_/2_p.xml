<p class="p">The correlation coefficient between different indicators (TBARS, TVC, TVB‐N, pH, and DL) of Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage was analyzed, and the results were shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. In all of 3 tested groups (CK, T1, T2), most of the indicators showed a consistent performance trend that the value increases with the extend of storage time. The correlation coefficients among TBARS, TVC, TVB‐N, and DL are all above 0.776. These four indicators showed the same trend during the process of fish spoilage. However, the value of pH does not perform evident correlation between other indicators. That might due to the decrease of pH in the early stage of superchilled storage caused by the accumulation of lactic acid. As a result, pH is not a convincing indicator for evaluating chemical changes of Pacific mackerel. This statement is agreed with Li et al. (
