<p class="p">The change of TVB‐N value of Pacific mackerel using 3 different methods during superchilled storage was shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d. Generally, the content of TVB‐N had an increasing tendency during superchilled storage. On the first day, the value of TVB‐N in CK and T1 increased slowly. Moreover, the Pacific mackerel was in the period of rigor mortis, the protease in fish released, making the content of TVB‐N increase, but the growth speed of microorganisms was rather slow so that the speed of increase on TVB‐N was slow as well. Later, the TVB‐N values of both the control group and the coated samples increased significantly (

The control samples reached a TVB‐N value of 49.44 ± 1.94 mg/100 g at day 12, and for coating samples, the TVB‐N levels of T1 and T2 groups reached 38.66 ± 4.82 and 30.21 ± 2.67 after 12 days, respectively. It was reported that the TVB‐N limitation of “good quality” was up to 30 mg/100 g (EU/EC,
