<p class="p">These two materials could slow down the increase of TVB‐N in Pacific mackerel as well as the spoilage on Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage. Compared with the two treated groups, the content of TVB‐N in T1 was much higher than T2, indicating that the chitosan adding citrus essential oil had better effect on the superchilled storage of Pacific mackerel and suggested the assistant role of citrus essential oil on antiseptic and fresh keeping. This phenomenon was closely related to the antibacterial property of chitosan–citrus coating, and the enhancement of the barrier performance also reduced the invasion of microorganisms, thereby slowing the rise of TVB‐N in T2.</p>
