<p class="p">Among various reactive oxygen species, the chemical activity of hydroxyl radical ˙OH is the strongest (Xie, Xu, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The clearance rate of hydroxyl radical of chitosan–citrus coating and chitosan is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b. The clearance rate of both chitosan–citrus coating and chitosan alone increased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with the increasing concentration of solution. The chitosan–citrus solution exhibited a significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher increase rate, reaching a clearance rate of 75.97% at the concentration of 50%. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of chitosan can be partly attributed to the ˙H in its structure. The more ˙H provided by chitosan, the stronger the hydroxyl radical clearance rate had. The groups in the structure of chitosan such as –NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and –OH can eliminate the hydroxyl radical by inhibiting the chain reaction of reactive oxygen radicals. Terpenoids in citrus essential oil contain double bonds, which can eliminate hydroxyl radical with ˙H by addition reaction. The enhancement of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in chitosan–citrus solution might due to the superposition effect of chitosan and citrus in terms of hydroxyl radical scavenging.
