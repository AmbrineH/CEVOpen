<p class="p">The superoxide anion is a major agent in the oxygen toxicity (Sawyer &amp; Valentine, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>), and it was closely related to the biological course including apolexis, inflammation, and tumor. (Sun, Xie, &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a shows the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity of both chitosan material and chitosan–citrus coating in terms of concentration. As the concentration of solution increased from 0% to 50%, the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity of both chitosan–citrus and chitosan coating agent solution increased, indicating their super oxygen‐anion free radical scavenging ability is strongly concentration dependent. This scavenging ability is substantially larger for chitosan–citrus than that for chitosan. Adding citrus to chitosan reinforces the clearance rate of superoxide anion radical. Besides, the amino groups in chitosan can react with free radicals to form most stable macroradicals, which can partly explain the scavenging effect of chitosan. Moreover, the contents of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>‐Limonene in citrus essential oil are more than 90% (Wu, Fu, et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which contributes to the excellent performance of antioxidation as 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>‐Limonene is an effective hydrogen donor. The integration of citrus oil into CS enhanced the antioxidant ability in comparison with CS alone.
