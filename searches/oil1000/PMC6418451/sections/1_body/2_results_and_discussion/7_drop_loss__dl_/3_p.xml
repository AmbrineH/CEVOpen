 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, the DL of all the three groups increased from the beginning of the superchilled storage, which indicated that the quality of Pacific mackerel gradually got worse. The fastest rising speed of DL occurred in the first 3 days of superchilled storage, and during this period, the rising speed of DL in CK was significantly faster than the other two groups (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05), indicating that the chitosan has slight effects on DL of refrigerated Pacific mackerel. The chitosan–citrus composite coating helped to hold the water in Pacific mackerel. Possibly, the functional groups of citrus essential oil interact with the hydroxyl and amino groups of chitosan, causing the decrease of free space in chitosan molecules and its molecular mobility; therefore, the chitosan–citrus composite coating has a strong barrier property. The bacterial destruction of muscle tissue which accelerated the loss of water in cells was slowed down by the blocking function of composite coating, while the hydrophobicity of the citrus essential oil would reduce the water vapor transmission rate in the composite coating and reduce the water evaporation in muscle tissue.
