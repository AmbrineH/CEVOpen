 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b showed the changes in the pH of the Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage. In the three tested groups, the pH of Pacific mackerel showed a trend of decline after rise. Similar phenomenon has also been obtained for other marine fish species during superchilled storage (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This could be explained by the physicochemical changes in the fish meat after death. The decline of pH in the early stage of superchilled storage may be related to the accumulation of lactic acid, ATP, and phosphocreatine under oxygen‐free environment after the fish died. In the later stage of storage, the value of pH increased again, which is mainly due to the dissolving of endogenous protease in fish body. In the rigor mortis stage after death, there is no significant change in the freshness of fish body.
