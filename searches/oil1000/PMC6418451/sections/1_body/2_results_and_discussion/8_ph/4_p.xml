 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b indicated that the decrease rate of CK in the first day was faster than T1 and T2, and the pH of CK was always lower than T1 and T2. The pH value of these three groups all declined to around 5.75 followed by the rapid increase from the third day. The results of variance analysis showed that from the 6th day, the pH of CK is significantly higher than T1 and T2, while T2 is slightly higher than T1.
