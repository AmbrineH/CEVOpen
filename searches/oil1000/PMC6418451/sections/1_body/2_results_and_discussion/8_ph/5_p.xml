<p class="p">The above results showed that chitosan could reduce the decrease of pH on Pacific mackerel in the early stage of superchilled storage, while it could not induce the final reduction of pH. In the later stage of storage, chitosan can alleviate the deterioration of superchilled Pacific mackerel, and reduce the further decomposition of amino acids and other substances. This is possibly due to the isolation effect and chelating agent of chitosan, which can cut off the oxygen and reduce the activity of enzyme. The composition of citrus essential oil occupies the position of some functional groups in the framework of chitosan, enhancing the effect of oxygen isolation, and therefore, the chitosanâ€“citrus coating has a better effect to prevent the Pacific mackerel from corruption.</p>
