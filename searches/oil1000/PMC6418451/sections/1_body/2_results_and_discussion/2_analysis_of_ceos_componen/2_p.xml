 <xref rid="fsn3958-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. In all of the 30 kinds of compounds that have been detected, Ɗ‐Limonene holds the highest proportion of 90.23%. Ɗ‐Limonene is one of the most common terpenes in nature and is considered to have low toxicity (Sun, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), and it has been listed as the “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) by FDA. Similar as other terpenes, it provides antioxidant and antibacterial properties to CEOs. The other four components have the content of more than 1% including myrcene, α‐terpinene, linalol, and α‐Pinene. α‐Pinene has obvious bactericidal action by inhibiting the biosynthesis of RNA, DNA, fungal polysaccharides, ergosterol, and Candida albicans. These components can decelerate the growth of microorganism, but their applications are restricted by their volatility. Thus, coating citrus essential oil into other matrix could be a promising way to broaden its application.
