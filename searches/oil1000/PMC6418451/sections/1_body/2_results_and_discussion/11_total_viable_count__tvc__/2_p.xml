<p class="p">The total number of colonies is an important indicator for fish spoilage. Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e reflected the variation of the total number of colonies in Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage. In all samples, the total viable count (TVC) value of Pacific mackerel was increasing with the extension of storage time. Compared with the control group (CK), the TVC value of experimental groups (T1, T2) was lower, indicating that the reproduction of microorganisms is inhibited in the experiment groups, and this is consistent with the results of other physical and chemical indicators mentioned above. According to the ICMSF (

All of the three groups did not reach the limitation at the end of storage; however, the TVB‐N value reached the limitation before TVC, decreasing the quality of Pacific mackerel. Adding citrus essential oil into chitosan enhanced the bacteriostatic effect, and that may be due to the multiplying effect of chitosan and citrus essential oil. 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>‐limonene, one of the main components of citrus essential oil, is believed to accumulate on the surface of microorganisms, leads to the destruction of membrane integrity and the reduction of proton dynamics and achieve the effect of sterilization.
