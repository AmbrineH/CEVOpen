<p class="p">The changing regulation on TPC of Pacific mackerel stored under −3°C exhibited similar trends toward TVC, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>f. It was due to the fact that a majority of the bacterial existed under storage temperature (−3°C) were psychrotrophic bacteria. In the initial storage, the TPC value of the three groups was around 3.6 lg (CFU/g). At the 12th day of storage, the TVC value of CK, T1, and T2 were 5.18 ± 0.032 lg (CFU/g), 4.69 ± 0.084 lg (CFU/g), and 4.46 ± 0.081 lg (CFU/g), respectively. The chitosan–citrus essential oil coating efficiently inhibited the growth of psychrotrophic bacteria during superchilled storage.
