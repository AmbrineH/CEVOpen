<p class="p">FT‐IR, which is broadly used to identify the functional groups, was used to analyze whether CEO has been successfully mixed into CS. The FT‐IR spectrums of T1, T2, and CEO were shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. Both T1 and T2 showed peaks at around 2,879 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, corresponding to N‐H stretching vibration absorption peak of chitosan. The intensity of the scissoring vibration absorption peak of O‐H at around 1,376 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was similar in T1 and T2. Compared with T2, the intensity of bending vibration absorption peak of N‐H at around 1,646 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in T1 was slightly reduced, which could be attributed to the superposition effect of CEO and CS for similar functional groups was identified in the spectrum of CEO. Conversely to this trend is that the intensity of peaks at 886 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> decreased in T2 compared to T1, indicating the presence of CEO in T2 (Li et al.,
