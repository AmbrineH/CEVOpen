<p class="p">Inhibition zones of chitosan (CS) and chitosan–citrus (CS‐CEOs) against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were investigated. The inhibition zone diameters of CS against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were 12.24 ± 1.03 mm and 13.35 ± 0.79 mm, respectively, and the inhibition zone diameters of CS‐CEOs against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were 17.23 mm ± 1.29 mm and 19.19 mm ± 1.27 mm, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of CS‐CEOs was better combined with that of CS for both 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. The enhancement of antibacterial property might due to the components which exert potent antimicrobial activity, such as citrullene and limonene (Di Pasqua, Hoskins, Betts, &amp; Mauriello, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Citrus essential oil exerts its bactericidal effects at the membrane level, where they increase the permeability of the cell membrane (Nannapaneni et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). It has been reported that the antibacterial property of chitosan could be due to its polycationic nature, which could interfere with the negatively charged residues of macromolecules at the surface, interacting with the membrane of the cell to alter cell permeability (Fei Liu, Lin Guan, Zhi Yang, Li, &amp; De Yao, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The antibacterial effect of chitosan–citrus essential oil composite was resulted from the synergistic effect of those two kinds of antibacterial agent.
