<p class="p">The changes in biogenic amines content in Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage were shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. The contents of all kinds of biogenic amine tested in this study were high in Pacific mackerel, and the content of 5‐serotonin was even up to hundreds of units. Experimental data showed that the content of biogenic amines in Pacific mackerel was rising during the superchilled storage, although there was a slight fluctuation in the data. From the relevant data, the content of biogenic amines in T1 and T2 groups was less than that in CK group, and basically consistent with the law that CK &gt; T1 &gt; T2, for instance, the content of Spd in the 6th day of storage of CK, T1, and T2 was 71.51 ± 2.70 mg/100 g &gt; 21.45 ± 1.80 mg/100 g &gt; 17.34 ± 5.88 mg/100 g, respectively. The data of histamine (His) also showed the same rule. In the storage of Pacific mackerel (6 days), the His content in Pacific mackerel was 190.6 ± 6.21 mg/100 g &gt; 63.30 ± 1.34 mg/100 g &gt; 96.1 ± 6.55 mg/100 g in CK, T1, and T2, respectively. At the 12th day, the histamine content of CK has exceeded the regulation of United States Department of Health and Human Services (

 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The results showed that the chitosan plays an important role in reducing biogenic amine content in Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage, adding citrus essential oil improves the effect.
