<p class="p">The sensory quality of Pacific mackerel was shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. During the whole storage period, the sensory scores of all samples showed a downward trend. In the 0 day, the sensory scores of experimental groups were lower than that of CK. This may be due to the acidity of the coating solution. Then, during the storage, the sensory scores of experimental groups were higher. The sensory scores of Pacific mackerel coated with chitosan–citrus essential oil were higher than those of other groups, which may be due to the stronger antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of chitosan–citrus essential oil. Although some citrus essential oil odor could be noticed in T2, in general, the sensory acceptability of the samples over the entire storage period followed the order T2 &gt; T1 &gt; CK, which was consistent with the results of Rao et al.
