<p class="p">The results of TBARS value during the superchilled storage are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c. For all of the three tested groups, TBARS increased fast at first, and the growth rate got lowered in the later period of storage. According to the research of Santiago and Mori (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), substances like malondialdehyde can cause Maillard reaction with free amino acids in fish, with the storage time extended, the content of free amino acids in Pacific mackerel increases, slowing the accumulation of malondialdehyde. TBARS of CK increased significantly (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05), while the TBARS in T1 and T2 were less than CK. The contents of TBARS were all &lt;1 mg MDA/Kg in the 0 day, while on the 6th day, the content in CK reached 4.67 ± 0.09 mg MDA/Kg. For T1 and T2, the content of TBARS at the 6th day is only 4.32 ± 0.08 mg MDA/Kg and 4.27 ± 0.08 mg MDA/Kg, respectively. On the 12th day, the content in CK was nearly 1.5 times of the other groups, indicating that the chitosan can prevent the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in Pacific mackerel effectively, and it is highly due to the characteristic that chitosan can form film to block oxygen. There were also some differences between T1 and T2. Before the 3rd day, there was no significant difference between the two groups (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05), and after 3 days, the content of TBARS was significantly higher in T2 than in T1 (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05), indicating that chitosan matrix added with citrus essential oil can prevent the increase of TBARS content better. In the work of Wu, Fu, et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), Wu, Li, et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and Wu, Wang, et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), Pacific mackerel was coated with chitosan–gallic acid and stored under 4°C. At the end of storage, the TBARS value of control group and experimental group was 7.93 ± 0.39 mg MDA/Kg and 4.17 ± 0.18 mg MDA/Kg, respectively, similar with the results of this study. Citrus essential oil contains 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>‐limonene, which has the ability to scavenge free radicals and prevent lipid peroxidation (Singh, Nam, Arseneault, &amp; Ramassamy, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The superposition effect of antioxidant effect in both citrus essential oil and chitosan may be mainly related to the result. In another aspect, the network structure of the composite membrane is more compact than that of chitosan, which reduced the oxygen permeation rate, therefore inhibited the occurrence of the lipid oxidation.
