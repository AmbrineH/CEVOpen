<p class="p">The antioxidant and antibacterial ability of chitosan–citrus essential oil composite coating and its ability to preserve the quality of Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage are discussed in this study. Chitosan–citrus has good superoxide anion radical scavenging activity as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging activity with fine antibacterial property. Chitosan–citrus composite coating has better inhibition effect on microbial growth, and it can alleviate lipid oxidation and peroxide production. Adding of citrus essential oil has a more significant effect on controlling the deterioration of the quality of Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage than using chitosan alone. This was supposed to be related to the bacteriostatic effect of citrus essential oil as well as the superposition effect of these two materials. In this study, the chitosan–citrus essential oil composite coating could extend the shelf life of Pacific mackerel for around 3 days. The combination of chitosan with citrus essential oil may be a promising way for maintaining the storage quality of Pacific mackerel. Chitosan–citrus coating has the great potential for the usage in food industry as a food‐grade bio‐preservative.</p>
