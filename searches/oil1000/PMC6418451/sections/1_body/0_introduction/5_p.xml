<p class="p">Some studies have also been researched on the combination of chitosan‐essential oil in films in extending shelf life of fish products. Remya et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) observed that chitosan incorporated with ginger (
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>) essential oil could efficiently keep the quality of chilled stored barracuda (
 <italic class="italic">Sphyraena jello</italic>) fish. Edible coatings of chitosan in combination with carvacrol were proved to delay the emergence of total volatile bases in ice‐stored tilapia (

 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) observed complex gelatin–chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil could drastically reduce gram‐negative bacteria in fish fillets during chilled storage.
