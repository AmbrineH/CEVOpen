<p class="p">There have been many researches focusing on the use of chitosan or essential oil to extend the shelf life of aquatic products during storage. Fernández‐Saiz, Sánchez, Soler, Lagaron, and Ocio (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) observed that chitosan films had an inhibition effect of refrigerated sole and hake fillets packaged in air and under vacuum. Bingöl, Bostan, Uran, Alakavuk, and Sivri (
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) indicated that the moisture loss could be reduced for
