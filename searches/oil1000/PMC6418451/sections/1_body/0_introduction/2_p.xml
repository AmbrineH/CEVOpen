<p class="p">Pacific mackerel (
 <italic class="italic">Pneumatophorus japonicus</italic>) is an abundant species of pelagic fish and spoils easily. Thus, how to maintain its freshness is a predominant issue for researchers (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Up to now, the methods to keep the freshness of aquatic products have been well‐developed, including low temperature, biochemical preservation, high pressure, the modified atmosphere, irradiation, and ozone preservation (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Low‐temperature storage is the most common method used in the preservation of fresh aquatic products, but deteriorative changes still occur during the process of freezing, storage, and thawing, leading to the changes in flavor, odor, texture, and color (Tironi, Tomás, &amp; Añón, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Bacteria keep growing during freezing storage, either (Carlez, Rosec, Richard, &amp; Cheftel, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Dainty &amp; Mackey, 
 <xref rid="fsn3958-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Superchilled storage combined with biopolymers is one of the ideas currently applied. As polymer coating materials have the advantage of preserving water as well as the properties of antioxidant and antibacterial, there have been a broad range of applications in the field of food preservation. Among these polymer coating materials, chitosan (CS) is a biopolymer with a wide range of bio‐applications.
