<p class="p">As a byproduct of citrus, a fruit widely distributed in temperate zones, citrus essential oil is easy to obtain, and the cost of extraction is relatively low, and it is proved to be an economical natural oxidant. However, citrus essential oil is easy to volatilize and oxidize when exposed to air; thus, combining essential oil with chitosan could be an economical and easy‐realizable way to prolong the shelf life of aquatic products. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial ability of chitosan–citrus composite coating, and investigate its effect on the preservation of Pacific mackerel. Briefly, chitosan was used as the matrix material to form a thin film on the surface of Pacific mackerel. According to Duun and Rustad (

In order to observe the influence of chitosan–citrus essential oil over a longer period, all samples are stored at −3°C. Lipid oxidation and protein denaturation to Pacific mackerel during superchilled storage were studied. The results would contribute to the research for an effective and low‐cost preservation method of Pacific mackerel.
