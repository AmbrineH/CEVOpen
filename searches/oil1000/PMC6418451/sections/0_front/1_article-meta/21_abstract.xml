 <p class="p">The goal of the study was to investigate whether chitosan–citrus essential oil composite works as an efficient preservative in Pacific mackerel (

  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IR</styled-content> analysis showed that chitosan–citrus essential oil coating was successfully prepared. Our results demonstrated that chitosan–citrus essential oil coating possessed significantly higher capability of scavenging reactive oxygen species (

Furthermore, Pacific mackerel coated with chitosan–citrus essential oil composite could significantly reduce parameters of corruption including physicochemical (drop loss, biogenic amine, and thiobarbituric acid‐reactive substances) and microbiological parameters (total viable count), as compared with untreated and chitosan groups after 12 days of storage at −3°C. These results indicated that
