 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>, var. Berrettina, locally known as “priest’s hat”), paying attention to the lipid composition of the seed oil. Since there is little information about the lipid structure, the present research deepens understanding of the total FA content and intrapositional composition of Berrettina pumpkin by using stereospecific analysis, and pays attention to other minor lipid components such as sterols, alcohols, and carotenoids. Butinar et al. [
