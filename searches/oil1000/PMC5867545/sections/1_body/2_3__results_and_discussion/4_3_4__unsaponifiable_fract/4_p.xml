<p class="p">The alcoholic fraction (aliphatic and triterpenic classes) was also studied, after derivatization as TMSE and analysis by HRGC-MS; the typical fragmentation is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, together with the alcohol composition (% and mg/100 g). Some aliphatic alcohols (from C16 to C25 members of the 1-alkanol homologous series) with odd and even numbers of carbon atoms of the aliphatic chain were identified. The TMSE alcohols were identified by comparison with the NIST mass spectra library. TMSE alcohols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was equivalent to [M-15]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, due to the loss of the methyl terminal group, and [M-117]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, equivalent to the loss of [(CH3)
