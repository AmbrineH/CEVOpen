<p class="p">In this paper, sterol identification was carried out by HRGC-MS. Each peak was analyzed via detection of the parent molecular ion and the fragmentation pattern of the TMSE derivative. In addition to the presence of specific ion fragments, the relative intensity of the ion fragments was considered. Some TMSE sterols were identified by comparison with the NIST mass spectra library; typical fragmentation is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, together with sterol composition (% and mg/100 g). TMSE sterols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was usually equivalent to [M-15]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, due to the loss of the methyl terminal group. Other main fragment ions useful for identifying the single sterol compounds are [M-90]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, [M-105]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, and [M-129]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. They correspond to the loss of the trimethylsilanol, methyl group with trimethylsilanol, and fragmentation of the 1,2-cyclopenthanophenanthrene structure, respectively. The predominant sterols of Berrettina pumpkin seed oil are Δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-sterols, in particular Δ
 <sup class="sup">7,22,25</sup>-stigmastatrienol, Δ
 <sup class="sup">7,25</sup>-stigmastadienol, and spinasterol, which accounted for about 76.8% of the total sterols, followed by Δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-avenasterol and Δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-stigmastenol. The Δ
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>-sterols were represented by campesterol, stigmasterol, and only a little cholesterol, as in other foodstuff [

 <sup class="sup">5</sup>- and Δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-sterols could be attributed to the maturity stage of seeds or to the solvent used in the extraction procedure [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. A total sterol content of 295 mg/100 g oil was measured in 
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic> seed oil; 15.7 mg/100 g was represented by Δ
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>-sterols and 279.3 mg/100 g by Δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-sterols. The total content was in agreement with other studies [

 <xref rid="B48-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], even if a wide range of variability is reported [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Hence, more detailed examinations of the composition of the sterol fraction of this oil could be of special interest. For example, analysis of a more extensive sampling is required for better characterization of pumpkin seed oils and for their authentication.
