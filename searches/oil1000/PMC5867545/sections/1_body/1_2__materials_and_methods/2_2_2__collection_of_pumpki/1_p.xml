<p class="p">Pumpkin belongs to the family 
 <italic class="italic">Cucurbitaceae</italic>. The samples (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic> L., var. Berrettina) were taxonomically identified by Luigi Frassineti (Tuder Green Service, Todi, Italy). It is a leafy green vegetable with medium-large flattish fruits with green-gray, moderately hard knobby skin, edible yellow/orange flesh, and a central cavity with numerous plump, whitish-yellow seeds. Three pumpkins cultivated in central Italy (Todi) and collected in autumn 2016 were selected for their uniformity of shape, weight, and color. The fresh pumpkin samples were weighed (about 2.5 kg each), peeled, and, after manual removal of seeds, cut into small pieces (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) and analyzed. The seeds were cleaned to remove impurities and dried at 60 °C for 24 h in a hot-air fan oven. After that, the seeds were reweighed until the weight was constant. The samples were stored in a dry place in the dark at room temperature.
