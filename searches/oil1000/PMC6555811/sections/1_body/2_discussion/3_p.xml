 <italic class="italic">nigrispinus</italic> may be related to the cuticle of this insect, which acts as a barrier, as reported for

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>,

 </sup>. One possible explanation for the low toxicity caused in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nigrispinus</italic> is that there may be differences in the penetration rate of the lemongrass constituents into the body, coupled with the ability of this insect to rapidly detoxify.
