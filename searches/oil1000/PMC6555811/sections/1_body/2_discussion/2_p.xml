<p id="Par13" class="p">The chemical composition of lemongrass essential oil revealed 13 constituents, identified and quantified. Neral, citral, nonan-4-ol, camphene, 6-metil-hept-5-en-2-one, and citronelal were the main compounds that were detected, according to previous reports on terpenoids obtained from lemongrass essential oil
