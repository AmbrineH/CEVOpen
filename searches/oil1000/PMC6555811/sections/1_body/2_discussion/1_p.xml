<p id="Par12" class="p">The increase in the lethal doses (LD

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nigrispinus</italic> suggests that this predator progressively developed a tolerance as it matured. The toxicity of this essential oil is similar to that reported in other studies for this insect

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nigrispinus</italic> nymphs showed that the first and second instar were more susceptible followed by the third, fourth and fifth instars; this indicates that high quantities of the lemongrass essential oil are toxic in the early stages of this insect, and that they become more tolerant with age.
