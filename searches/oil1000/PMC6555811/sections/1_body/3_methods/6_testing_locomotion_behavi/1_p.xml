 <italic class="italic">nigrispinus</italic> nymphs were used for each lethal dose (16 per each treatment: control, geranyl acetate or citral), following a completely randomized design. For each insect, walking activity within the arena was recorded using a digital camcorder (XL1 3CCD NTSC, Canon, Lake Success, NY, USA) equipped with a 16 × video lens (Zoom XL 5.5–88 mm, Canon, Lake Success, NY, USA). A video tracking system (ViewPoint LifeSciences, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was used to analyze the videos and measure the distances that the insects walked and the time spent resting on each half of the arena. Insects that spent less than 1 s on the half of the arena treated with the essential oil or constituent were considered repelled, whereas those that remained less than 50% of the time on the insecticide-treated surface were considered to have been irritated
