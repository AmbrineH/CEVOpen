 </sup>. Lemongrass essential oil was diluted in 1 mL of acetone to obtain a stock solution. Six different doses of lemongrass were prepared and used to assess the insecticide toxicity and determine relevant toxicological endpoints; a dilution series of doses (8.1, 16.2, 31.2, 62.5, 125, and 250 µg/insect
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was used to determine dose-mortality relationship and lethal dose (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>). Acetone was used as a control. Each solution (1 μL) was applied to the thorax of first-, second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs using a micropipette. For each nymph instar, fiften nymphs were tested, placed individually in Petri dishes with one
