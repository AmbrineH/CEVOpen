<p id="Par20" class="p">Quantitative analyses of lemongrass essential oil were performed in triplicate using a gas chromatograph (GC-17A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID). Chromatographic conditions were: a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.22 mm) with a DB-5 bonded phase (0.25 μm film thickness); carrier gas N
