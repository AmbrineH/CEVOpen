<p id="Par21" class="p">Constituents were identified using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass detector GC/MS (CGMS-QP 5050 A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The injector and detector temperatures were 220 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The initial column temperature was 40 °C for 3 min, with a programmed temperature increasing of 3 °C/min to 300 °C, where it was maintained for 25 min. The split mode ratio was 1:10. One microliter of lemongrass essential oil containing 1% (w/v in dichloromethane) was injected and helium used as carrier gas with a flow rate constant of 1.8 mL

 <sup class="sup">®</sup>-5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Bellefonte, USA) using Crossbond® stationary phase (35% diphenyl, 65% dimethyl polysiloxane). The Mass Spectrometer was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29–450 DA with 70 eV ionization energy. Constituents were identified by comparisions of the mass spectra with those available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST08, NIST11) libraries, the Wiley Spectroteca database (7
