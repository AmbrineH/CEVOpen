<p id="Par22" class="p">Geranyl acetate (97.0% purity) and citral (95.0% purity), identified as constituents of the lemongrass essential oil, were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). The efficacy of these constituents was determined by their lethal doses (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>) in the laboratory. Six different doses of each constituent were prepared and used to assess the insecticide toxicity and determine relevant toxicological endpoints; a dilution series of doses (8.1, 16.2, 31.2, 62.5, 125, and 250 µg/insect
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was used to determine dose-mortality relationship and lethal dose. Acetone was used as a control. Each solution (1 μL) was applied to the thorax of third-instar nymphs using a micropipette. Fiften nymphs were tested, placed individually in Petri dishes with one
