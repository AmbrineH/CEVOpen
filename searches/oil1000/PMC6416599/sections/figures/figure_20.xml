  <p class="p">The chemical structures of reagents and the synthesis route employed to obtain methyl-ester-containing polyols from copolymerized methyl 10-undecynoate (MUDY) and 10-undecynyl alcohol (UDYO) fatty-acid-derived polyols. Varying MUDY/UDYO ratios allowed the researchers to obtain polyols with different hydroxyl contents for further reactions with diisocyanate to obtain polyurethanes (PUs).</p>
