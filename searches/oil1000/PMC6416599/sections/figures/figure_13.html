 <p> BDO biosynthetic pathways introduced into E. coli bacteria. Enzymes for each numbered step are as follows: (1) 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase; (2) succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase; (3) CoA-dependent succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; (4) 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; (5) 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA transferase; (6) 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA reductase; (7) alcohol dehydrogenase. Steps 2 and 7 occur naturally in E. coli, whereas the others are encoded by introduced heterologous genes. </p>
