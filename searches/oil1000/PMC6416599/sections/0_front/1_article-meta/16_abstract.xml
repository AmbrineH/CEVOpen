 <p class="p">This article concisely reviews the most recent contributions to the development of sustainable bio-based polymers with antimicrobial properties. This is because some of the main problems that humanity faces, nowadays and in the future, are climate change and bacterial multi-resistance. Therefore, scientists are trying to provide solutions to these problems. In an attempt to organize these antimicrobial sustainable materials, we have classified them into the main families; i.e., polysaccharides, proteins/polypeptides, polyesters, and polyurethanes. The review then summarizes the most recent antimicrobial aspects of these sustainable materials with antimicrobial performance considering their main potential applications in the biomedical field and in the food industry. Furthermore, their use in other fields, such as water purification and coating technology, is also described. Finally, some concluding remarks will point out the promise of this theme.</p>
