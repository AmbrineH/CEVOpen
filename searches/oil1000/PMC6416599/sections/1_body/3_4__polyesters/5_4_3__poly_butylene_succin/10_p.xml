<p class="p">In the case of an application in the medical field, biodegradable polyesters are usually processed in the shape of fibers to find application as scaffolds. Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B300-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">300</xref>] coated PBS scaffolds, obtained using the salt leaching method, with copper-doped nano laponite (cnLAP). This material was to be applied in bone tissue engineering; therefore, the authors used nLAP to promote the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. Additionally, copper ions were expected to also promote bone regeneration and to inhibit infections. In fact, as is shown in

Certainly, the incorporation of laponite improves the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells, which were ascribed to the release of Mg, Si, and Li ions from the coating on the scaffolds into the media. All of these facts make this system a good candidate for bone regeneration.
