<p class="p">The first strategy consists in bounding specific functional groups or molecules to the polymer backbone. This polyester, in general, possesses a lack of available functional groups for further functionalization; therefore, most of the works introduce cationic groups that will provide antimicrobial activity into PBS chains by melt polycondensation to achieve cationic copolymers. Bautista et al. [

In order to overcome the drawbacks of the high temperatures needed for polycondensation reactions that can decompose cationic compounds, the authors successfully applied an enzymatic catalyst that was able to avoid metal residues and drive the reaction of ammonium-containing PBS under mild conditions (vacuum; 80–115 °C; 40–1.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mbar). However, although at lower temperatures than is usual, the introduction of phosphonium groups was only possible by conventional polycondensation with a titanium catalyst (190 °C; 2.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mbar). The antibacterial activity of the PBS copolyesters containing ammonium or phosphonium side groups at different concentrations was explored against
