 <xref rid="B301-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">301</xref>] introduced poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) capped with silver nanoparticles (PVP-capped AgNPs) into PBS electrospun materials to impart antimicrobial properties. PVP is often employed to stabilize AgNPs [
 <xref rid="B302-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>,
 <xref rid="B303-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">303</xref>,
 <xref rid="B304-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">304</xref>], and PVP-capped AgNPs have been reported to have better in vivo antimicrobial activity and less toxicity to mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B305-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">305</xref>] than other capped AgNPs [
 <xref rid="B306-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">306</xref>]. Spherical capped AgNPs were successfully distributed and incorporated into the PBS electrospun fibers. The release of silver ions from the scaffolds was investigated in aqueous solution by an inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer. After 2 weeks, the authors still detected silver ions released from the scaffolds due to the hydrophobic character of the PBS that hindered the permeation of water into the fibers and the diffusion of AgNPs from the fibers. Consequently, an antimicrobial capacity was confirmed against
