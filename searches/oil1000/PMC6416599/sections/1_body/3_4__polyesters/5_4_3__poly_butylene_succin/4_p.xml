<p class="p">Another way to obtain specific functional antimicrobial groups on PBS is the one followed by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B289-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">289</xref>]. The authors modified the PBS surface by O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), a versatile technique that introduces chemical groups onto the samples depending on the gas employed. The authors evaluated the changes that occurred on the surfaces (chemistry, hydrophilicity) and their effects on the behavior in the presence of osteoblasts and bacteria. When the PBS surface was treated with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, no difference was found with the control. However, when treated with N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, an antibacterial effect of 91.41% and 90.34% against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli,</italic> respectively, were obtained (from the amounts of active bacteria). This fact was associated with the presence of C=NH and Câ€“NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups that not only enhance the antimicrobial properties but also promoted osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization, thus representing potential materials for implants.
