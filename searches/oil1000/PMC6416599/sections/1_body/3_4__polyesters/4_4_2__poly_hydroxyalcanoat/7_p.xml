<p class="p">Poly(hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) granular polyethylene derivatives are of particular interest as additives in PHB-based materials processed by melt blending technologies, since they possess high thermal resistance [
 <xref rid="B275-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">275</xref>]. Walczak et al. developed melt-blended PHB films enriched with poly(hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) granular polyethylene wax in 0.6â€“1 wt% with respect to the polymeric matrix. The active films were able to avoid bacterial biofilm formation by
