<p class="p">Among the PHAs, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is the most simple and common representative of PHAs. This is the reason why it is the most widely investigated for the development of PHA-based antimicrobial systems. From a processing point of view, the main drawback of PHB is its very low resistance to thermal degradation, since PHB has a melting temperature (around 170–180 °C) that is close to the degradation temperature (270 °C) [
