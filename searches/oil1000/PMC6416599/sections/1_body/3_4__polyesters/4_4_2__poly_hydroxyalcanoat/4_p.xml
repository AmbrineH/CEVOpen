<p class="p">Another PHA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-
 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), was loaded with less than 1 wt% of AgNPs and processed into an ultrafine electrospun fiber. It showed good in vitro cell compatibility and completely inhibited the proliferation of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>). The amount of released AgNPs in distilled water increased with the incubation time, reaching a value of 0.557 ppm after 30 days (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>). The release is accelerated by the high surface area of nanofibrous scaffolds and the biodegradation of PHBV. Therefore, these materials may be good candidates for arthroplasty in regenerative medicine.
