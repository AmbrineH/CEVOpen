 <xref rid="B274-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">274</xref>] have prepared PHB electrospun nanofibers loaded with kanamycin sulphate, a water-soluble aminoglycoside antibiotic, for the development of nanoscaffolds for cell growth and antimicrobial devices. The electrospun scaffolds promote cell attachment, while the hydrophilic antibiotic confers antimicrobial performance on the electrospun surface as revealed by the obtained good zone of inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria. The results showed that the electrospinning process does not affect the antibacterial activity of the kanamycin sulphate drug.
