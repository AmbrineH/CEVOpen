<p class="p">PHB films with antibacterial properties have been developed by adding metal nanoparticles. In particular, PHB/AgNP nanocomposites are the most extensively developed group. PHB films have had AgNPs embedded into them by a two-step process consisting of helium plasma treatment followed by an immersion process in a silver nitrate solution [
