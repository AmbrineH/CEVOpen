<p class="p">Zinc-oxide nanoparticles were also recently used in combination with PHA matrices. For instance, PHB was melt compounded with bacterial cellulose nanofibers to obtain nanocomposites, which were further modified by plasma treatment and coated with ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol using an ultrasonic spraying device [
