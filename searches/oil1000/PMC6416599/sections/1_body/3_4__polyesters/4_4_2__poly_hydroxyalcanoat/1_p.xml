<p class="p">PHAs are a family of isotactic, semi-crystalline, and high-molecular-weight thermoplastic polyesters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>), which are biologically synthesized by controlled bacterial fermentation of a wide variety of both Gram-negative bacteria (i.e., those belonging to the genera

 <xref rid="B263-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">263</xref>]. Therefore, PHAs are bio-based, biocompatible, and biodegradable, and exhibit thermal and mechanical properties that are comparable to those of other common polymers, such polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP). In fact, the PHA family has been under development during the last few decades, the PHAs market is now emerging very fast, and the production capacity is predicted to quadruple in a few years [
