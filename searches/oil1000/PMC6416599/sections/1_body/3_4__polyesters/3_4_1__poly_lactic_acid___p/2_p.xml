<p class="p">A laminated chitin PLA–PLA composite has been recently prepared by the hot-press method. Chitin powder was dispersed into a PLA matrix and further processed by a hot press to obtain the inner layer, where a neat PLA layer was also obtained by the hot press method [
 <xref rid="B243-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">243</xref>]. It was observed that the incorporation of 5 wt% of chitin in the chitin–PLA layer in direct contact with a Mueller–Hinton agar medium, inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, was enough to produce a clear inhibition zone. Besides this, antibacterial PLA-based compounds have been recently developed by adding chitosan nanoparticles in 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% into a PLA matrix by melt extrusion followed by a solvent casting process to obtain nanocomposite films. The obtained nanocomposites showed higher antibacterial effectiveness with increasing content of nanochitosan as well as higher antibacterial effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> than against 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>.
