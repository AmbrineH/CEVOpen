<p class="p">Antimicrobial electrospun PLA fibers have also been developed by adding silica nanoparticles functionalized with ZnO. The PLA-based materials’ antibacterial effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was found to be concentration-dependent and size-dependent. They required at least 0.8 wt% of functionalized zinc-oxide-doped silica NPs to produce a reduction in bacteria growth. Moreover, the authors obtained nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5–20 nm and observed that when the particle size was reduced, the surface reactivity of the nanoparticles was enhanced, leading to electrospun materials with better antimicrobial performance [
