<p class="p">Likewise, the production of ultrafine electrospun PLA fibers in the form of nonwoven materials has shown great potential in several fields, such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, filtration, catalytic processes, sensor development, and packaging. In fact, the electrospinning process has been suggested to be an effective way to produce nonwoven materials with active surfaces [

 <xref rid="B253-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">253</xref>]. This technique allows for processing of the active substance with the PLA matrix at room temperature, avoiding the thermal degradation of the active substance. Moreover, during the preparation of a PLA material through the electrospinning technique, the high ionic strength as well as the rapid evaporation of the solvent induce the localization of the active compounds predominantly on the surface of the fibers [

 <xref rid="B252-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">252</xref>]. For instance, cinnamaldehyde was incorporated into electrospun PLA-based materials by Lopez de Dicastillo et al. [
 <xref rid="B251-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">251</xref>] following two approaches: direct incorporation into an electrospun PLA solution and supercritical impregnation of the electrospun PLA material. The authors observed that the materials into which cinnamaldehyde had been incorporated by supercritical impregnation showed a higher surface availability of the active compound, since those materials showed a higher release rate in fatty food simulants when compared to electrospun materials into which cinnamaldehyde had been incorporated during the electrospinning process.
