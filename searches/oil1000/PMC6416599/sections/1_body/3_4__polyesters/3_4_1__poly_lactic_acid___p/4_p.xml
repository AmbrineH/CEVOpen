<p class="p">EOs have been widely used as PLA antimicrobial additives for the development of active PLA-based materials with antibacterial activity, which have mainly been studied by the agar disk diffusion method to simulate the food-wrapping conditions [

 <xref rid="B246-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. Plasticized PLA composite films were developed by loading bimetallic silver–copper (Ag–Cu) nanoparticles and cinnamon essential oil into a polymer matrix via melt blending [
 <xref rid="B247-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>]. The obtained nanocomposites were used to pack contaminated chicken samples with Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. Typhimurium</italic>, and the degree of bacteria survival after 21 days under refrigerated storage conditions was measured. The bacterial survival of food-borne pathogens decreased significantly from 6.65 to 3.87 log CFU/g for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, from 5.40 to 2.59 log CFU/g for 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic>, and from 5.52 to 2.42 log CFU/g for 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>, resulting in interesting materials for antimicrobial food packaging systems. However, when EOs are directly incorporated into thermoplastic polymeric matrices that should be processed at a high temperature, high amounts of EOs are lost during processing due to their high volatility. For instance, plasticized poly(lactic acid)–poly(hydroxyalcanoates) (PLA-PHA)-based blends were directly incorporated with 10 wt% of carvacrol and processed by melt extrusion [

 <xref rid="B246-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. Around 25% of the carvacrol was lost during thermal processing [
 <xref rid="B245-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to the high amount added into the blend formulations as well as the high antibacterial activity of carvacrol, the films showed some antibacterial surface effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, with the observation of a clear zone of growth inhibition around plasticized film samples, while no inhibition halo was observed in unplasticized samples. The increased mobility of the macromolecular chains, due to the plasticizer’s presence, promotes the diffusion of carvacrol from the polymeric matrix into the agar medium in a radial way, improving the antimicrobial effectiveness. However, no inhibition halo was observed in the agar plates inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, even with plasticizer [
