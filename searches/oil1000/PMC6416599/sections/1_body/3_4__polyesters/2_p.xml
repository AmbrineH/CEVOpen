<p class="p">As was already mentioned, antimicrobial systems based on biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric matrices have attracted interest for both biomedical and food-related applications. The main objective in developing antimicrobial polymeric systems is to lessen and subsequently prevent the micro-organisms from growing [

In this context, several strategies have been developed to provide materials with antimicrobial performance based on biopolyesters, most of which have been focused on adding additives with antimicrobial activity, including natural compounds (i.e., EOs), peptides (i.e., nisin), chelating agents, antibiotics, other polymers (i.e., chitosan), enzymes, and metals (zinc oxide, silver, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B235-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">235</xref>]. Despite the wide range of antimicrobial agents that have been used during the last two decades for the development of biopolyester-based antibacterial materials, it seems that the route to introduce them is even more important than the agent itself in obtaining an effective antimicrobial activity at the surface of the material.
