<p class="p">Bio-based and biodegradable polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs), are currently the main drivers of the growth in the bioplastics market [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], as they have the potential to replace traditional polymers, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).
