<p class="p">Pectin is another important anionic polysaccharide rich in galacturonic acids, with a potential use in many fields, especially the food industry. Pectin is found in the cell wall of most plants; however, apple and citrus peels are almost exclusively used for the commercial production of pectin. Likewise, it presents an ability to form gels and has good gas permeability properties [
 <xref rid="B137-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Typically, in pectin-based materials, the pectin is crosslinked and blended with other components to improve their physical properties and water stability. An interesting strategy to impart antimicrobial activity to pectin is the use of ions as a crosslinking agent with an antimicrobial character, such as Zn ions [
