<p class="p">Carrageenan has been also studied as a anionic polysaccharide material for potential applications in packaging [
 <xref rid="B199-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. Carrageenan is a linear sulfated polysaccharide composed of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>
 </italic>-galactose and 
 <italic class="italic">
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>
 </italic>-anhydrogalactose obtained from marine red algae. Among all of the carrageenan types, the κ-carrageenan type is used the most due to its good properties. A number of studies have been published in recent years related to the development of antimicrobial films based on κ-carrageenan by addition of classical AgNPs [
 <xref rid="B200-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>,
 <xref rid="B201-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>], ZnO NPs [
 <xref rid="B202-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>], CuO NPs [
 <xref rid="B203-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>], essential oils [
 <xref rid="B204-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>], and clays [
 <xref rid="B205-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. For instance, carrageenan-based hydrogels and dry films with antimicrobial properties were prepared by their combination with CuO and ZnO NPs [
 <xref rid="B203-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>]. Several samples were prepared, containing 1% ZnO, 1% CuO, or 0.5% ZnO/0.5% CuO, and, in general, both the mechanical and antimicrobial properties were improved with the incorporation of nanoparticles. The films showed strong antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>; however, an insignificant difference in the activity was observed between the different types of incorporated NPs. Equally as described in starch and cellulose, chitin nanofibrils have been used to reinforce carrageenan and to impart antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. The tensile strength and modulus of carrageenan film increased significantly with up to 5 wt% of chitin nanofibers. With respect to the antibacterial activity, the films showed high activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> depending on the content of chitin, but insignificant activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>.
