 <xref rid="B150-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>] have evaluated the effect of the combination of nisin (a small antimicrobial peptide approved by the European food safety authority that is used as a food preservative [

 <xref rid="B151-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Recently, pouches of polyamide/low-density polyethylene were coated with blends of oxidized starch with gelatin containing LAE [
 <xref rid="B152-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. The authors found that the incorporation of LAE extends the shelf-life of chicken breast fillets without affecting the meat’s oxidation. Nevertheless, the release of these natural products is not always in a controlled manner. Campos-Requena et al. [
 <xref rid="B153-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>] have developed thermoplastic starch/layered silicate (TPS/LS) bionanocomposite films for the controlled release of carvacrol. This is possible due to the formation of intercalated/exfoliated structures that can tune the migration of antimicrobial carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B154-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>], which results in the increase of its half-life.
