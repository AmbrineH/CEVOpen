<p class="p">Another interesting polysaccharide is starch, which is formed by a large number of glucose units linked by glycosidic bonds. Starch is a highly hydrophilic polymer that consists of linear amylose and highly branched amylopectin.

However, its mechanical performance is poor; therefore, to overcome this limitation, it is usually is blended with another biopolymer, such as chitosan. In spite of this, starch does not have inherent antimicrobial properties, so these properties also need to be conferred on it.
