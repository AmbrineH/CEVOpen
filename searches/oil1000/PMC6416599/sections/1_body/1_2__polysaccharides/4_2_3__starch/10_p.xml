 <xref rid="B170-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>] cellulose papers were obtained. In a first step, starch–silver nanoparticles were synthesized, and then blended with chitosan in solution at different compositions. Afterwards, the mixture was poured onto papers and the antimicrobial activities were tested against the

 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic> fungal strain. The results showed that the chitosan–starch–AgNP papers were effective against these microorganisms in comparison with papers coated with chitosan or starch–AgNPs alone, which do not present antimicrobial properties.
