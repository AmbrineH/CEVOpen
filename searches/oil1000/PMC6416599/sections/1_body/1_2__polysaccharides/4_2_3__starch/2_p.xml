<p class="p">Starch has been chemically modified to introduce cationic groups by etherification, graft copolymerization, or a combination of both. Yang and coworkers [

 <xref rid="B141-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>] have extensively used this type of modification to obtain flocculants for water treatment, as starch is a low-cost and effective system. These authors also tested starchâ€™s antimicrobial activity, which has scarcely been explored in this field. They showed that

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria were almost unviable after flocculation. Cationic starch was also used in combination with starch and sodium alginate to obtain polyelectrolyte films with an antimicrobial character [
 <xref rid="B142-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. These films have inhibitory effects on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> that are greater against Gram-positive than against Gram-negative bacteria.
