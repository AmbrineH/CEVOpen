<p class="p">Starchâ€“graphene (G) hydrogels were obtained by Diels-Alder crosslinking reactions between furan-modified starch bismaleimide in the presence of graphene layers. These were incorporated as a conductive nanofiller to the mixture using Salvia extracts as dispersion stabilizers. The resulting hydrogels were tested against

 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. They present activity with low concentrations of extract, which confirms that the addition of G sheets also influences the antimicrobial efficiency. Moreover, these materials exhibit improved mechanical and conductivity performance.
