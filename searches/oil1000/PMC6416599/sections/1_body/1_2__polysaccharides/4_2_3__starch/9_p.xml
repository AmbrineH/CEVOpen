<p class="p">Starch has been also blended with antimicrobial polymers to provide a bioactive character. Chitin nanowhiskers were added (0.5â€“5%) to starch, and films obtained by solvent casting were tested against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> to analyze their antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B167-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. These films showed more effectiveness against Gram-positive than against Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, they exhibited improved thermal properties and mechanical strength in comparison to native maize starch.
