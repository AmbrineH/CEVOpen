 <italic class="italic">Phomopsis asparagi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum lagenarium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. The most active derivatives were those with phenyl and cyclohexyl groups. The cytotoxicity of starch derivatives was also examined against HEK-293T cells using an MTT assay. These systems presented low cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity was higher in those systems having alkyl groups.
