<p class="p">Copper nanoparticles have also been incorporated into starch-based hydrogels to obtain antimicrobial systems [
 <xref rid="B175-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>]. These nanoparticles were synthesized in a starch medium followed by silica coating, which enhances their stability. The antibacterial activity of hydrogels with different amounts of NPs was evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus,</italic> and was maintained for at least four cycles of use. In addition, their dermal toxicity was studied, showing slight irritancy. Therefore, these hydrogels can be suitable wound-dressing materials.
