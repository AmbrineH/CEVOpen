<p class="p">In another approach, starch-based flexible coating papers with excellent hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activities were obtained [
 <xref rid="B171-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>]. These were prepared with ZnO NPs, in which carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCe) and chitosan were added to improve the compatibility between particles and matrix. The antimicrobial activity was improved with the addition of guanidine-based starch in different amounts (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> for an illustration). Moreover, migration tests were performed in three food simulants (deionized water, 10% alcohol solution, and 3% acetic acid), according to the E.U. No. 10/2011 standard (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). It seems clear that the migration of ZnO NPs is much higher in films than in coated papers, and, although there is migration in all of the simulants, it is within the overall migration limits prescribed by legislation.
