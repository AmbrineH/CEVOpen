<p class="p">Another modification of starch performed by Guoâ€™s group was the introduction of 1,2,3-triazole via click chemistry, which reached high yields and degrees of substitution (see

 <xref rid="B143-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. The resulting derivatives, 6-hydroxymethyltriazole-6-deoxy starch (HMTS), 6-bromomethyltriazole-6-deoxy starch (BMTS), 6-chloromethyltriazole-6-deoxy starch (CMTS), and 6-carboxyltriazole-6-deoxy starch (CBTS), were able to inhibit the growth of
