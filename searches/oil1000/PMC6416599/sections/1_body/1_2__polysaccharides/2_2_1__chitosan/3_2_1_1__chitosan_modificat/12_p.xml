<p class="p">Then, several conjugates were obtained by varying the content of the attached peptide. Some of the resulting derivatives exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria compared to anoplin or chitosan. In particular, the conjugates were very effective against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, with MIC values as low as 4 Î¼g/mL. More importantly, the hemotoxicity was significantly reduced in the case of the anoplin-chitosan derivatives.
