<p class="p">Chitosan and chitosan derivatives have also been conjugated with several cationic amino acids and antimicrobial peptides with the purpose of improving their activity. The incorporation of amino acids, such as arginine [

 <xref rid="B48-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], typically leads to derivatives with excellent antimicrobial properties and high water solubility. Arginine has a guanidine group with a pKa of ~12.5; thus, it is positively charged over almost the whole range of pH. Arginine can be easily attached onto chitosan by using, for example, an EDC/NHS coupling reaction between the amino group of chitosan and the carboxylic acid of arginine [
