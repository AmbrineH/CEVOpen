<p class="p">In another recent example, cysteine-terminated HHC10 (KRWWKWIRW) AMP was grafted onto the C2 (amino) or C6 (hydroxyl) reactive centers of CS by thiol-maleimide click conjugation [

Remarkably, the peptide-polysaccharide with free amino groups of chitosan backbone (CSO-HHC) displayed higher antibacterial activity than the corresponding conjugate with the modified amino groups (CSN-HHC) due to its capacity for protonation, which increases its water solubility and the positive charge. Likewise, both conjugates showed lower hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity than the free peptide due to the effect of chitosan.
