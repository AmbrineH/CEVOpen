<p class="p">Recent studies have been directed at obtaining better selectivity and a high degree of substitution by using several protecting groups. Sahariah et al. [

 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] have developed an efficient method for the selective modification of chitosan with up to 100% substitution of the amino groups. They prepared protected di-tertbutyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) chitosan and introduced quaternary ammonium groups with different alkyl chain lengths by reductive amination. All of the prepared derivatives showed bactericidal properties and good selectivity when tested with human red blood cells (RBCs). It was also shown that the activity was influenced by the length of the alkyl chain and by the tested micro-organisms; derivatives with a short alkyl chain presented high activity against
