<p class="p">The preparation of carboxyalkyl chitosan derivatives, especially carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) polymers, is also a common strategy to improve the water solubility of chitosan and enhance the antimicrobial activity over the whole range of pH [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Typically, carboxymethyl chitosan is synthesized through carboxymethylation of the primary amino and alcohol groups, leading to 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-CMC and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-CMC chitosan, respectively, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">N,N</italic>-CMC and 
 <italic class="italic">N,O</italic>-CMC derivatives. The incorporation of the carboxymethyl group at the reactive positions of chitosan (amine and hydroxyl) can be controlled by the reaction conditions, such as temperature or concentration [

 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In general, the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-CMC is greater in comparison with the rest of the derivatives, as it presents a higher number of free amino groups [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], although other parameters, such as the degree of deacetylation, the degree of substitution, the molecular weight, and the pH of the medium, can affect its antimicrobial capacity [
