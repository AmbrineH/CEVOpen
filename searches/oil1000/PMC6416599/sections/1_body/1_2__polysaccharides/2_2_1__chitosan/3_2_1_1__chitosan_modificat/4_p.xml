<p class="p">In another recent work, the quaternary ammonium groups were introduced exclusively at the hydroxyl groups by previous protection of the â€“NH

By this way, it is possible to prepare positively charged chitosan derivatives with free primary amino groups, which is important as these amino groups have a key role in the biological activity of chitosan, such as in its antioxidant activity. The obtained
