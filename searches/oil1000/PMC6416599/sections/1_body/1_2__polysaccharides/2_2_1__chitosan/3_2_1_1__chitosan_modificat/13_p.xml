<p class="p">Other click chemistry reactions, such as thiol-ene click chemistry, have been employed to prepare peptide–chitosan conjugates. The cationic peptide ε-poly(
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-lysine) was attached onto chitosan in order to prepare broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds, as the ε-poly(
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-lysine) is effective against bacteria but presents poor activity against fungi [

In this coupling reaction, the chitosan was first functionalized with methacrylate groups, and the terminal amino group of the peptide was thiolated with homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride. After the click reaction, the obtained cationic peptide-polysaccharides demonstrated both antibacterial and antifungal activities. In addition, the conjugates showed low hemolytic activity, good in-vitro biocompatibility when tested with bone mesenchymal stem cells, and scant evidence of in vivo toxicity.
