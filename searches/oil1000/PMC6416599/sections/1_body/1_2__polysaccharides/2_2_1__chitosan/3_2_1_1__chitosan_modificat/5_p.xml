<p class="p">A different strategy was followed in a recent work, in which quaternized chitosan samples with alkyl chains were prepared by an external acid-free method [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In this approach, a quaternary ammonium molecule containing carboxylic acid was synthesized, which acted as a reactant for attachment onto the amino groups of chitosan via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry and also acted as an acid for the dissolution of chitosan. The antimicrobial activity was tested against planktonic Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> fungi, by evaluating the MIC and minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentration (MBC and MFC, respectively) and against biofilms. Although the chitosan derivative showed growth inhibition and biocidal effects, the results against Gram-negative bacteria were modest.
