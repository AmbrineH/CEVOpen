<p class="p">Probably the most common method for introducing a permanent positive charge into chitosan chains is by the formation of quaternary ammonium groups by either direct quaternization of the primary amino group at the C2 position or by incorporating such groups at any of the reactive moieties (hydroxyl and amino groups). For instance, in a recent study, chitosan derivatives with triple quaternary ammonium groups were synthesized via Schiff-based reactions. Although the resulting samples with a high positive charge exhibit significantly enhanced antifungal activity, the preparation method required multiple steps [
