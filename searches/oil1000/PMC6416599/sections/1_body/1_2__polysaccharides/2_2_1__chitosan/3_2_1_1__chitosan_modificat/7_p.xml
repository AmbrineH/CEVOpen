<p class="p">In addition, carboxyalkyl chitosan is commonly modified by the introduction of other functional groups in order to improve the activity. For instance, several thiosemicarbazone 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-carboxymethyl CS derivatives have been prepared towards a condensation reaction of thiosemicarbazide 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-carboxymethyl CS with 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-methoxybenzaldehyde, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>- chlorobenzaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of the prepared derivatives was tested against Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Geotrichum candidum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> fungi using the inhibition zone method. The microbiological results showed that both the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the thiosemicarbazone 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-carboxymethyl chitosan derivatives were better than those of the original 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-carboxymethyl chitosan, especially the chloro-derivative.
