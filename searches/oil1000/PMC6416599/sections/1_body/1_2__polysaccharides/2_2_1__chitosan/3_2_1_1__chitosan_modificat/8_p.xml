<p class="p">In recent years, the effectiveness of carboxyalkyl chitosan against biofilm formation has also been studied [

 <xref rid="B47-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. A carboxymethyl chitosan with an

 <xref rid="B46-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. CMC also demonstrated the capability to prevent bacterial biofilm formation in dynamic conditions. Although the mechanism of action was not fully understood, it seems that the presence of CMC induces the flocculation of bacteria by surface charge neutralization that prevents initial bacterial adherence and cellâ€“cell interaction. This group has also demonstrated the efficacy of CMC on the inhibition of a fungal biofilm of
