<p class="p">In another study, chitosan derivatives were prepared by reaction with different quaternary ammonium salts containing a bromide end-group capable of reacting with the amino or hydroxyl groups of chitosan [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The ammonium salts benzalkonium bromide, pyridinium bromide, and triethyl ammonium bromide were previously obtained by a quaternization reaction between 1,4-dibromobutane and the respective tertiary amines. These chitosan derivatives with quaternary ammonium groups showed much lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria than neat chitosan. Also, in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, the type of substitution influences the activity, with better properties for the pyridinium derivative. Although an important improvement of the activity is generally obtained [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], these chemical modifications often lead to unselective reactions at the amine, the hydroxyl, or both, as occurred in the last example. For instance, the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylation with methyl iodide typically provokes partial 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methylation [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Similarly, chitosan derivatives only modified at the OH positions are exceptional. Besides this, it is difficult to obtain a high degree of substitution in most of the cases, in particular with long alkyl chains, as these syntheses normally need to be carried out in acidic conditions or heterogeneous media [
