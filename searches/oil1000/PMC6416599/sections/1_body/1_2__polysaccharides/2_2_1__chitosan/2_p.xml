<p class="p">Although the exact mechanism of action is still not completely understood, the most accepted mechanism is based on electrostatic interactions between positively charged chitosan and the negatively charged micro-organism membrane [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, other modes of action, such as interactions with DNA or the formation of complexes with metal ions, seem to be involved [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This antimicrobial activity is strongly affected by its structural characteristics, such as molecular weight or degree of deacetylation, and by environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, or ionic strength [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Compared with other antimicrobial polymers, chitosan offers several advantages, as it has a natural origin, is biodegradable, biocompatible, and nontoxic for mammalian cells, and has been approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the E.U. as safe (GRAS, Generally Recognized As Safe) for tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound dressing, dietary use, and plant protection applications. Besides this, chitosan has excellent film-forming ability and good mechanical and barrier properties; thus, it has great potential in food packaging [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, its biocidal activity and solubility are reduced in neutral pH conditions [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which limit its use in many applications. Therefore, chemical modifications of chitosan, typically either at amino (the secondary C2 NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> group) or hydroxyl groups (the primary C6 OH and secondary C3 OH groups), aim to produce derivatives with enhanced properties to widen its applications [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. A huge number of studies have been carried out on the preparation of antimicrobial chitosan derivatives mainly via quaternization and carboxylation. However, all of these modifications propose to improve its solubility and antimicrobial activity while also maintaining its original biodegradability and biosafety. Next, the most common and recent functional groups and derivatives used to improve its antimicrobial activity without affecting its inherent properties are discussed viz. by chemical modification and blending with organic and inorganic antimicrobial agents.
