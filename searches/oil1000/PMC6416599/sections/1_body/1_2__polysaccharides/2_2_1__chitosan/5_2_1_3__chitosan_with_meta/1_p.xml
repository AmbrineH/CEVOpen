<p class="p">An important and highly explored strategy for improving the antimicrobial activity of chitosan is the incorporation of metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles (NPs), including Ag, Cu, ZnO, and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs, and the preparation of nanocomposites. Among all existing nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted much attention due to their potent antimicrobial activity. Several approaches have been used to prepare chitosan/AgNP nanocomposites, including physical and chemical strategies, in which the main objective is to reduce agglomeration, which is considered to be an important factor that affects the antimicrobial efficacy in the nanocomposites. Common methods imply the in situ preparation of AgNPs by the chemical reduction of silver salts; however, the used reducing agents may exhibit toxicity and also could interact with the functional groups of chitosan. Thus, more environmental friendly methods are becoming a priority nowadays [

 <xref rid="B77-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. For instance, AgNPs stabilized with chitosan were synthesized at a large scale by a green method using autoclave, in which chitosan functions as a reducing agent as well as a stabilizer [

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria. Moreover, the inhibition zone from a disk diffusion test increased with the presence of the AgNPs. This was due to the additional modes of action of AgNPs by disrupting the cell wall of bacteria via several pathways and also by the release of Ag
