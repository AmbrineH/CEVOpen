<p class="p">Nevertheless, there is a serious concern related to the possible toxicity of AgNPs for the human body; for instance, when they are used in food packaging [

 <xref rid="B81-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. A possible solution might be the immobilization of silver nanoparticles to limit the leakage and diffusion of AgNPs. For example, laponite, which is a synthetic clay with a nano-sized and layered structure, was used to immobilize silver nanoparticles in chitosan films [
 <xref rid="B82-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. In this approach, quaternized chitosan was used as a reducing agent for the synthesis of AgNPs embedded in laponite, and subsequently the modified laponite was mixed with chitosan to prepare films by the casting solvent evaporation technique. Remarkably, the resulting films only released about 5.6% of AgNPs, which was much lower than films without laponite (about 29.1%). In addition, the films showed low toxicity and good antimicrobial activity against
