<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are a product of aromatic plants, which contain multiple substances, including terpenes and aromatic and aliphatic compounds, such as esters, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and phenols [

 <xref rid="B63-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. They have received great attention during the last few years due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, in particular in the food industry [
 <xref rid="B64-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. However, the direct use of essential oils for food preservation is often limited due to their cost, poor solubility, toxicity, and aroma, which may impact on the sensory perception of foods. In this sense, essential oils can be incorporated into films, coatings, or capsules in a reduced dose that maintains their efficacy. Much effort has been made in the development of chitosan materials with essential oils, as chitosan has great potential as an active ingredient as well as in bio-based packaging films and edible films [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. In general, the incorporation of essential oils improves the effectiveness of chitosan against fungi and food-borne bacteria. Essential oils can be incorporated either directly in the formulation of chitosan films [
 <xref rid="B66-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] or previously encapsulated [
 <xref rid="B67-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Likewise, the preparation of micro- and nanocapsules of chitosan derivatives as food additives has been extensively explored [
 <xref rid="B68-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] as well as the covalent attachment of some components, such as gallic acid, onto chitosan [
 <xref rid="B69-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. For instance, in a recent publication, a rosemary essential oil was incorporated onto chitosan-montmorillonite nanocomposite films in different amounts (0.5%, 1%, and 2% v/v) [
 <xref rid="B71-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Films containing the essential oil exhibited antimicrobial activity on the contact surface for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested by the inhibition zone method, whereas the chitosan films did not present any activity. Results in growth media obtained by the colony forming units (CFU) method, indicated, however, that the presence of the essential oil did not affect the antibacterial activity, and the montmorillonite decreased the activity as it can interact with chitosan and phenolic compounds of the rosemary essential oil. Thus, in the preparation of composite films for a food packaging application, the components and additives that are added to improve the mechanical and physico-chemical properties could affect their antimicrobial properties, so an optimal design is normally required. In another example, nanoemulsions of carvacrol were incorporated onto carboxymethyl chitosan films that were previously obtained by electrospray from CMC microgels [
 <xref rid="B72-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The resulting composite films showed good antibacterial activity against
