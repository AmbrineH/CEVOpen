<p class="p">In the last few years, the nanoencapsulation of essential oils has attracted more attention compared to microencapsulation as smaller particles improve the solubility and dispersibility of the compounds. A clove essential oil was encapsulated by chitosan nanoparticles via the emulsion ionic gelation technique [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. The resulting loaded nanoparticles demonstrated enhanced fungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> in comparison with empty chitosan nanoparticles and free oil. Similar results were found for a rosemary essential oil nanoencapsulated in chitosan/Î³-polyglutamic acid nanoparticles, with a significant increase in the antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Likewise, an essential oil of Cyperus articulates was loaded into chitosan nanoparticles by an oil-in-water mixture and ionic gelation method [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. These loaded particles also showed lower MIC values against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> compared to free oil and unloaded chitosan nanoparticles. However, these nanoparticles exhibited a higher cytotoxicity effect against MDA-MB-231 cells, probably due to the slow release of oil components encapsulated in the chitosan nanoparticles.
