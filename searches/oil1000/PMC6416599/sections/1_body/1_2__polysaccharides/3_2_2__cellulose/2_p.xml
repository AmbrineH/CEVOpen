<p class="p">As stated in the introduction, there is also an actual challenge involving the development of antimicrobial materials, which includes the development of biopolymers (natural polymers) and bio-based polymers with antimicrobial properties. Indeed, there is a deep concern regarding the increased resistance of microbes (bacteria, fungi) against actual antimicrobial agents. Micro-organisms are everywhere and they require only moisture, a source of carbon, and mild temperatures to multiply and prosper. Unfortunately, cellulose and its derivatives are an excellent medium that can serve as a supplier of moisture and even the growth of micro-organisms. So, modifications need to be done to impart antimicrobial properties to this natural polymer [
 <xref rid="B95-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. To do so, and also in the case of polysaccharides, three main approaches have been followed: cellulose and cellulose derivative modification (functionalization or grafting); blending with cationic molecules, essential oils, or antimicrobial polymers; and the incorporation of antimicrobial metal nanoparticles (silver, gold, etc.). Special recognition of nanocellulose is given below.
