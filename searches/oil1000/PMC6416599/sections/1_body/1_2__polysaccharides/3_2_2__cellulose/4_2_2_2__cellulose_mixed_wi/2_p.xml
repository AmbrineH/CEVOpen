<p class="p">Following the strategy of incorporating an essential oil into cellulosic matrices, Liakos et al. created antimicrobial cellulosic nanofibers by an electrospinning technique. For that, the authors used cellulose acetate (CA) as a biopolymer matrix to encapsulate different EOs within the CA fibers: cinnamon, lemongrass, peppermint, rosemary, and oregano [

 <xref rid="B104-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. CA is a biodegradable compound formed from the acetylation of cellulose. This biopolymer is amorphous, odorless, non-toxic, and water-vapor permeable, and shows excellent optical properties besides a high resistance to heat and chemicals [

For the encapsulation of the essential oils, the authors first dissolved a cellulosic polymer in acetone and then added the corresponding essential oil to the CA/acetone solution. The obtained CA/EO electrospun fibers showed a diameter size that ranged from 1 to 3 Âµm approximately. The antimicrobial properties of the CA/EO fibers were evaluated against

 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> fungi. The results revealed that cellulosic fibers containing 6.2% and 25% EOs were able to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria. The cellulosic material owes its enhanced effectiveness to the nanostructured morphology that is provided by the used technique (electrospinning). Cellulosic electrospun fibers have a high exposed surface area compared to cellulosic flat films, allowing the micro-organisms to more easily penetrate inside, so that they can better sense the presence of the antimicrobial agent. Despite this advantageous morphology, the antifungal activity of the CA/EO fibers was not effective. The authors concluded that the lack of activity was due to the size of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> fungi being four times larger than 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, such that they were not able to penetrate inside the cellulosic material and thus make contact with the encapsulated essential oil [
