<p class="p">Tran et al. developed a novel method to prepare biocompatible antimicrobial composites from cellulose and keratin with silver nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B106-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. The idea for the study came from the need to fix silver nanoparticles into a matrix so that nanoparticle agglomeration or coagulation could be hindered. Following this idea, they took advantage of a previous methodology used for the green synthesis of a cellulose and keratin antimicrobial composite [
 <xref rid="B107-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>], in which ionic liquids (ILs) were used as green solvents. In this case, they introduced silver salt into a cellulose-keratine-IL solution that was further reduced to obtain a biopolymer-based composite containing silver in either its ionic (Ag
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) or metallic (Ag
 <sup class="sup">0</sup>) form. The antibacterial property of the obtained material was tested against

 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity, bacteria were grown in the presence of the composites with ionic or metallic Ag, and further measured by CFU counting compared to those for the cellulose/keratin composite and the control. As determined from the experiments, both composites exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against most of the studied bacteria; however, those with metallic silver nanoparticles showed slightly better performance compared to ionic silver. The interesting properties of the cellulose/keratin composite, together with the antimicrobial activity derived from the presence of silver nanoparticles, make this sustainable biopolymer-based material useful as a potential dressing for chronic wounds treatment.
