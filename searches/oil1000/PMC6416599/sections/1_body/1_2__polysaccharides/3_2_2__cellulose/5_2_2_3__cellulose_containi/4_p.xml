<p class="p">Although silver nanoparticles present antimicrobial properties, both ionic and metallic silver nanoparticles were found to be toxic above a certain concentration as mentioned above [
 <xref rid="B106-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Being so, Tran et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>] developed a cellulosic-based biopolymer antimicrobial composite using gold nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents instead of silver. It is well-known that gold nanoparticles exhibit high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria alongside their antiviral function [
 <xref rid="B114-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. As the authors indicated in their study, most of the work done in this regard used synthetic polymers as carriers or matrixes for the growth or encapsulation of Au nanoparticles. Tran et al. focused their work on the use of cellulose as a matrix. They took advantage of the methodology used for the green synthesis of the cellulose and keratin antimicrobial composite mentioned earlier [
 <xref rid="B106-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. However, in this case, the authors used two different ionic liquids as solvents of both the biopolymer matrix and the chloroauric acid to obtain a cellulose/keratin/Au NP composite with antimicrobial activity. The composite was tested against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus</italic> (VRE). The assays demonstrated that the biopolymer composite is able to inhibit 97% and 98% of the VRE and MRSA bacteria, respectively, being the Au NPs responsible for the antibacterial effect. As toxicity is the drawback for silver nanoparticles, the authors also evaluated their biocompatibility. They evaluated the cytotoxicity of the composites using human fibroblasts. Interestingly, the results revealed that the cellulose/keratin/Au NPs composites were not cytotoxic. The authors demonstrated for the first time that any possible cytotoxicity that the gold nanoparticles may have had was removed when they were incorporated into the cellulose/keratin biopolymer matrix.
