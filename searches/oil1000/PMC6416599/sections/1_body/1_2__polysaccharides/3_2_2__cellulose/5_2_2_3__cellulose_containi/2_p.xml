<p class="p">As mentioned, micro-organisms are everywhere; for instance, in paper and the paper products that are widely used in our everyday life, from bank notes to newspapers, books, and packaging paper. The distribution of this kind of material can contribute to the contamination and spreading of infectious diseases. Taking this into consideration, Islam et al. integrated antimicrobial activity into cellulose paper by the incorporation of silver nanoparticles using a mussel-inspired strategy [
 <xref rid="B108-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. To do so, the authors functionalized cellulose paper with dopamine molecules. This functionalized paper was then immersed in an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution; at this stage, dopamine catechol groups reduced the silver salt and subsequently held the produced nanoparticles via strong adhesion. Finally, the authors demonstrated the successful antimicrobial activity of the AgNP-decorated cellulose paper against some highly virulent fish and shrimp pathogenic bacterial strains, such as Gram-negative
