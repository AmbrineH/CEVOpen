<p class="p">Dairi et al. have recently developed a cellulose-acetate-based film with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties for packaging applications [
 <xref rid="B109-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. The strategy consisted of the use of CA and AgNPs prepared following a biogenic synthesis mediated by plants. This is a novel ecofriendly process to obtain AgNPs in which there is no need for high temperatures, high pressures, and the production of toxic chemicals [

 <xref rid="B112-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. In this particular case, the process consisted of the synthesis of AgNPs into a gelatin-modified montmorillonite organoclay (OM) using a 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> tuber aqueous extract. The final material consisted of plasticized CA films that were obtained by a solvent casting method from a solution of CA, thymol, and modified nanoparticles. The antimicrobial property of the obtained film was tested against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria as well as 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus.</italic> The antimicrobial test for the films was performed by an agar diffusion disc against micro-organisms. The authors found that the CA films presented a low bacterial inhibition zone indicative of a moderate antimicrobial activity, which is directly related to the low content of Ag within the CA film. The activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria was moderate even when this bacteria strain was found to be most sensitive to AgNPs. In addition, the authors concluded that the presence of the organoclay may contribute to control over the silver release for a long-lasting antimicrobial effect.
