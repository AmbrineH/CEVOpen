 <xref rid="B131-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>], inspired by the intrinsic antimicrobial property of chitosan that is imparted by the amino groups along the polymer chain, chemically modified cellulosic fibrilsâ€™ surface by grafting aminoalkyl groups. In particular, the authors chose bacterial cellulose nanofibrils as the matrix for the modification. Bacterial cellulose (BC), a high-purity cellulose that is produced mainly from the 
 <italic class="italic">Gluconacetobacter</italic> genus, presents physical and mechanical properties that, together with its biocompatibility, make it interesting for biomedical applications. For the surface modification, the authors used a silane chemical grafting approach to produce BC-NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanofibrils. After confirming the surface modification of the bacterial cellulose, they evaluated the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria using non-functionalized BC as a reference. Aminoalkyl-functionalized BC membranes showed a significant reduction in bacterial viability after 24 h.
