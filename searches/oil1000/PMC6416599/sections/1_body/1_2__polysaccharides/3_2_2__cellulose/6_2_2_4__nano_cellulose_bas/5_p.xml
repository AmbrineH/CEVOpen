<p class="p">In a recent study, Lizundia et al. [
 <xref rid="B135-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>] designed innovative antimicrobial bio-based films composed of cellulose nanocrystals and metallic (silver, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) nanoparticles that show antimicrobial activity. As mentioned above, AgNPs present antimicrobial activity but with the limitation of toxicity above a certain concentration. Zinc-oxide nanoparticles have effective antibacterial activity and good catalytic, electrical, photochemical, and optical properties [
 <xref rid="B136-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. For the film preparation, Lizundia et al. first synthesized an NC by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose, giving rise to nanorods approximately 10 nm in diameter and 170 nm in length. Next, they dispersed the respective nanoparticles (rod-like ZnO, spherical Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) in water through sonication prior to their incorporation into the aqueous NC suspension. In the final step, the prepared NC/nanoparticles dispersions were solvent-cast to form the films by evaporation-induced self-assembly. The properties of the obtained nanocellulosic films were evaluated in terms of the effect of NC dimension, shape, and chemistry in the final composite. Interestingly, the authors confirmed that the method used for the filmsâ€™ preparation was derived from the formation of liquid crystal phases with a chiral nematic (cholesteric) structure. However, the incorporation of NPs affects this cholesteric structure, as reflected by the different optical properties observed by UV. The authors evaluated the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria and the cytotoxicity on planktonic cell cultures after being in contact with the different NC-based films, and on the cells adherent to the surface of materials to determine the number of live cells. As revealed from the results regarding 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, at 3 h of incubation time, the surviving fraction of cells adherent to the surfaces showed a significant reduction in NC/Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O followed by NC/ZnO and, to a minor extent, on NC/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> films. A similar trend was observed for planktonic cells. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria, the surviving fraction of cells adherent to NC-based films was significantly diminished on NC/Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, followed again by NC/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and NC/ZnO. The difference was observed after the direct exposition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> cells to the NC-based film when no significant reduction was observed for NC/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> films, whereas for NC/Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and NC/ZnO films an important decrease in cell survivability was detected. After 24 h of incubation, the surviving fraction of adherent cells decreased significantly for all NC films, but differences were observed for the planktonic cells, in which relevant results were only observed with the NC/Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and NC/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> films. In summary, the direct exposition of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells to NC-based films containing Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O or ZnO nanoparticles was effective at both shorter and longer incubation times. Similar results were obtained in the case of direct exposition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, although its effectiveness is more significant on adherent cells at 3 h of incubation. The activity of NC-based films was less effective against planktonic cells at either 3 h or 24 h of incubation. These successful results indicated that the incorporation of nanoparticles could provide NC films with antimicrobial activity. The authors suggested their use as biomaterials and, in particular, as sustainable biomaterials for wound-healing applications.
