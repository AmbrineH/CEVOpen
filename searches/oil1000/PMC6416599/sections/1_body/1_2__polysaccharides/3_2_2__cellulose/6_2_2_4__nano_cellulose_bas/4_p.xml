<p class="p">Nanocellulose (NC) particles have been also used as reinforcing agents to improve the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of biomaterials, since it is known that the major drawback of bio-based polymeric materials is their poor mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties compared to synthetic polymers [

 <xref rid="B134-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] developed silver-functionalized cellulose nanoparticles without using organic solvents that were further incorporated into a polymer matrix. To obtain nanocrystal (NC)/AgNPs, they first obtained cellulose NCs by acid hydrolysis using HCl; the hydrolysis lasted for different periods of time so that NCs with different dimensions were obtained. In the next step, the authors functionalized the NCsâ€™ surface with succinic anhydride (NCSA) to incorporate carboxylic groups. Then, the carboxylic groups were deprotonated by adding NCSA to a sodium bicarbonate solution to act as anchoring groups for AgNPs. In the last step, the deprotonated NCSA solution and the AgNO

 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> fungi by the standard broth microdilution method. The effectiveness was dependent on the morphology of the obtained NC/AgNPs. In fact, the best results were obtained for NC/AgNPs samples with smaller sizes (between 6 and 18 nm), since larger nanoparticles had difficulty penetrating into the micro-organism cells.
