<p class="p">The first strategy followed for the development of sustainable antimicrobial cellulosic materials considers the chemical modification/functionalization or grafting onto cellulose derivative surfaces [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] so that non-leachable materials are obtained. This strategy is often applied for the modification of nanocellulose, or uses microfibrillated cellulose as starting material, as we will describe in the following section. However, based on the literature from the last three years, research related to cellulose derivatives is scarce. As an example of this approach, Wu et al. reported the preparation of nisin-grafted cellulose membranes [
 <xref rid="B97-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The authors first oxidized native cellulose using sulfuric acid, and then bonded nisin amino groups onto aldehyde groups of the oxidized cellulose. The obtained nisin-grafted cellulose membranes were then tested against Gram-variable 
 <italic class="italic">Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris</italic> bacteria, which are not pathogenic to humans but are implicated in the spoilage of fruits and cause a bad taste and flavor. The performed antimicrobial test confirmed the antimicrobial activity of the cellulosic material. Besides this, the authors determined that the antimicrobial efficacy increased as the oxidation time of the native cellulose increased.
