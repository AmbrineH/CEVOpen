 <xref rid="B98-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>], using as starting material fully bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp fibers, took advantage of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique to modify these fibersâ€™ surfaces with chitosan and lignin (LS), which present both antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The electrostatic LbL technique is a simple and versatile polymer surface modification method that builds a nanostructured multilayer onto a solid substrate surface with the desired composition and properties [
 <xref rid="B99-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. For the preparation of multilayer deposition onto cellulosic fibers, the authors immersed the fibers into CS for a short period of time and rinsed the surface with water to remove the excess. The same procedure was followed for the deposition of the LS layer. By repeating those steps up to four times, the authors fabricated a multilayer of alternant CS and LS layers over cellulose fibers. They evaluated their antimicrobial activity by measuring their MIC against

For the test, fibers modified with different numbers of layers, and fibers where the outermost layer was either CS or LS, were selected. The obtained results revealed that as the content of the bilayer increased the growth inhibition degree also increased, but always when the CS was located in the outermost layer.
