<p class="p">Cellulose is a linear syndiotactic and semi-rigid homopolymer consisting of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-anhydro glucopyranose units (AGU), where each unit has three hydroxyl (OH) groups at the C2, C3, and C6 positions (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Cellulose is a semi-crystalline and high-molecular-weight homopolymer of β-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucopyranose units linked by β-1,4-linkages, where the repeat unit is a dimer of glucose: cellobiose. Cellulose and its derivatives are one of the most abundant natural biopolymers, and much progress has been made towards their study, characterization, and applications. Most cellulose derivatives are commercially available. Some are water-soluble, biodegradable, electro-neutral, and biocompatible. They are used in many industrial applications, such as packaging and textile production; however, in recent years, cellulose-based materials have been investigated regarding new advanced applications, such as sensors, liquid crystal polymers, soft-actuators, and biomaterials [

 <xref rid="B94-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. The increased interest in this natural polymer, obtained from renewable biomass feedstock, responds to the urgent need for the replacement of synthetic polymers to reduce the actual global dependence on fossil fuel sources, making possible the development of sustainable and ecofriendly functional materials.
