<p class="p">First, we will mention polysaccharides, which are the most abundant and exploited family. Following the natural systems, the proteins with antimicrobial activity will be described. Then, synthetic systems based on natural products will be analyzed; specifically, polyesters and polyurethanes. Since the literature regarding natural and bio-based antimicrobial polymeric materials is significantly wide, we focus the analysis mainly on the research performed in the field during recent years. It is not our purpose to do an extensive review; instead, we will highlight some of these interesting materials. Finally, we will conclude with some reflections on this hot topic.</p>
