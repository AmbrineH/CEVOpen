<p class="p">Nowadays, plastics have gone from being outstanding materials that make life easier for us to being a serious concern for our ecological system. The European Council has pointed out the need to reduce our dependency on fuel and gas imports and to create sustainable energy, that is, achieve sustainable development by 2030. The 17 goals that cover this sustainable development include food security, health, sustainable consumption and production, the sustainable management of natural resources, clean oceans, and climate change [

Bio-based polymers have emerged as a potent solution for replacing petroleum-based polymeric materials and reducing the dependence on the depleting crude oil reserve. Besides this, many of the existing bio-based polymers can be biodegradable; in particular, natural bio-based polymers, such as polysaccharides and proteins, but also several synthetic biopolymers, such as poly(lactic acid). Biodegradability is also an important and desired property in many applications, including food packaging and agricultural applications, and contributes to sustainability as it reduces the waste impact of oil-based polymers. Nowadays, although the bio-plastics market represents only about 1% of the 335 million tons of plastic that the world produces annually [

In some of the uses of biopolymers, additional properties are also needed; for instance, antimicrobial properties are desired in food packaging and biomedical devices, wherein microbial contamination can cause serious problems for public health and safety.
