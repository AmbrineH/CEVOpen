 <xref rid="B317-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">317</xref>] functionalized intermediate tertiary amine soybean-oil-based polyols (TAPs) with ammonium salts by using either methyl iodine or benzyl chloride as alkylating agents instead of using an acid. These bio-based polyols containing quaternary ammonium salts were incorporated into polyurethanes using different diisocyanate monomers to obtain biocompatible and bactericidal coatings. When methyl iodine was used, the materials showed significant bacterial reduction (83â€“95%) against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria due to the higher amount of active groups in comparison to their benzyl-chloride-alkylated counterparts.
