<p class="p">VOs and their derivatives have demonstrated huge potential as renewable feedstocks, receiving increasing interest from the research community for developing polyols and PUs from under-used sources of plant oils. However, there are still some challenges related to cost barriers, mainly due to the fact that they come from edible sources; so, their usage affects the cost of foodstuffs. Therefore, future efforts have to be concentrated towards the employment of non-edible seed oils, such as algae oils, for the preparation of bio-based polyols. Additionally, heterogeneity in terms of VO structure also represents a challenge and, additionally, new advances in bio-based isocyanates are expected to be made in the near future.</p>
