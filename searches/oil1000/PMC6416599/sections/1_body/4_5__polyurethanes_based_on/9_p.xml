<p class="p">In general, bio-based PU does not show antimicrobial activity and, in other polymeric families, the incorporation of uniformly dispersed metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles has been reported to result in nanomaterials with excellent antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B322-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">322</xref>]. These nanocomposites enhance the durability and efficacy of the antimicrobial effect through a controlled release of the fillers. The antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Mesua Ferrea L.</italic> seed-oil-based hyperbranched and linear PU nanocomposites containing AgNPs were studied by Deka et al. [
 <xref rid="B323-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">323</xref>]. The hyperbranched PU (HBPU) nanocomposite showed a better bactericidal effect over its linear counterpart (LPU) towards 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria and against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> yeast. The antibacterial activity was dose-dependent and, particularly at a high loading, the efficiency of the system was comparable to standard antibiotic and antifungal agents.
