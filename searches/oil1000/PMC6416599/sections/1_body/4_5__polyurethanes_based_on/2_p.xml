<p class="p">VOs have been employed for the synthesis of cationic polyurethane (PU) coatings with antimicrobial properties for application either in the biomedical or food packaging fields. Usually, cationic PUs are prepared by incorporating a tertiary amine diol or polyol treated with an acid that is able to bind microbes and disrupt their cell structure thanks to amino groups. Xia et al. [
