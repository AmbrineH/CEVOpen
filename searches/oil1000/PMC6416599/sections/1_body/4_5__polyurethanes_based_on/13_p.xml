<p class="p">Boron-incorporated linseed oil polyols were also employed to obtain semi-inorganic vegetable-oil-based PUs [
 <xref rid="B330-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">330</xref>]. Both polyols and their obtained PUs showed high antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>; however, although the polyols were completely inactive against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, the PUs were found to be mildly to moderately active. Sharmin et al. [
 <xref rid="B331-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">331</xref>] linked CuO NPs to a linseed oil polyol through an esterification reaction with copper (II) acetate (CuAc) in a one-pot, solvent-less process to obtain good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, probably through membrane disruption and cell death. The authors proved as advantageous the small size of the particles, which enhanced the size of the contact surface area and improved the antibacterial action as the metal content increased. These materials may be useful for making a self-sterilizing biofilm that resists PU coatings and paints.
