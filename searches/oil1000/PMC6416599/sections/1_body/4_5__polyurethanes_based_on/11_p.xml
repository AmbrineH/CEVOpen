Self-healable castor-oil-based polyurethane containing sulfur-nanoparticle-decorated reduced graphene oxide (SrGO), combining the potential of both antimicrobial agents (rGO and sulfur nanoparticles), was obtained by Thakur et al.

 <xref rid="B327-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">327</xref>]. A synergistic effect was obtained on the nanohybrid particles of SrGO, and, although a high dose of nanocomposite was needed, the HBPUâ€“SrGO material showed an inhibitory effect on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, enhancing the inhibitory effect of the neat matrix. Recently, Duarah et al. developed a bio-based hyperbranched PU from a starch-modified polyol filled with carbon dots and AgNPs (HPU/CD-Ag) as a material for rapid self-expandable stents. Importantly, HPU/CD-Ag nanohybrid membranes prevented biofilm formation against
