<p class="p">Algae oil and several di-acids from renewable sources (dimer acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, and phthalic anhydride) were used to synthesize alkyd and polyesteramide polyols for PU coatings with anticorrosive and antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B321-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">321</xref>]. Bactericidal properties were tested against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> by turbidimetry, showing that the uncoated polyols and the algae oil fatty amide (AOFA) and monoglyceride (MG) coatings had more bacterial attachment and less inhibition efficiency compared to algae-oil-modified PU coatings, since algae-oil-modified PU coatings have a higher percentage of oleic acid, which inhibits the bacterial growth.
