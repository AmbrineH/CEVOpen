<p class="p">Similarly, Liang et al. [
 <xref rid="B316-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">316</xref>] employed castor oil, as a natural antimicrobial agent, and MDEA, as an ionic chain extender, to synthesize waterborne PUs. Samples were tested against

 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> bacteria, being more effective by increasing either the MDEA content or the reduction of polyol functionality (a lower crosslinking density, higher mobility, and better interaction with bacteria).
