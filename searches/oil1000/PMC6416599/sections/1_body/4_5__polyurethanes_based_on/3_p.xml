 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)- and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-ethyldiethanolamine (EDEA)-containing PUs provided the best antibacterial activity, which the authors associated with the smaller/shorter side chains attached to the nitrogen atoms that allow for better penetration of materials into cells. They observed a good antibacterial activity towards 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and against a Gram-negative structural mutant of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella minnesota</italic> (R613) lacking a full outer membrane layer. Additionally, although the MDEA with a triethanolamine (TEA) residues structure had lower antibacterial activity than MDEA and EDEA (lower ammonium ion content), it provided the best balance of antimicrobial, thermal, and mechanical properties from all tested amino polyols thanks to its relatively high crosslink density. In a similar study, the same group [
 <xref rid="B315-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">315</xref>] varied the molar ratio between hydroxyl and isocianate groups in the PU by varying the MDEA content. All formulations showed inhibitory activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, and MRSA. Clearly, an increase in the ratio of ammonium cations enhanced the antibacterial properties. Additionally, they varied the crosslinking density of the materials by using methoxylated soybean polyols (MSOLs) with different numbers of hydroxyls. Lower crosslinking densities (a lower functionality of MSOLs) showed increased antimicrobial activities even though the concentration of quaternary ammonium was slightly lower than in their higher crosslinked counterparts. It seemed that a lower crosslinking density promoted the physical interaction with the target bacteria as the molecular mobility of the chains was higher, which helped to increase the antibacterial activity of the material.
