<p class="p">Moreover, Das et al. [
 <xref rid="B324-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">324</xref>] reported the antibacterial activity of smart HBPU/Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanocomposites based on sunflower oil and with superparamagnetic-like behavior and shape-recovery effects. The authors concluded that the hyperbranched structure of the sunflower-oil-based HBPU matrix, as occurred with AgNPs, prevented agglomeration and led to a better dispersion of Fe

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs, resulting in better antibacterial performance against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumonia</italic> with respect to bare Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. Both Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanomaterials and HBPU/Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanocomposites exhibited good antibacterial activity against infectious and biofilm-forming microbes.
