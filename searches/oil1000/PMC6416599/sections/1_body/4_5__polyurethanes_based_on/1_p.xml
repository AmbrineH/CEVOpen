<p class="p">Natural oils and fats from vegetable oils (VOs) are the most important renewable industrial feedstock for sustainable chemistry and, indeed, in polymer science [
 <xref rid="B311-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">311</xref>]. VOs are triacylglycerols formed from glycerol and three fatty acids, being the most common the saturated capric (C10), lauric (C12), myristic (C14), palmitic (C16), and stearic (C18) acids and unsaturated oleic (C18, with one carbon–carbon double bond) and linoleic (C18, with two or three carbon–carbon double bonds) acids. In general, VOs do not contain hydroxyl groups; therefore, they are often modified chemically to introduce hydroxyl groups into their structures. Interestingly, polymer scientists have found plant-oil-based polyols to be attractive thanks to their unique chemical structure that offers numerous options for modification. VOs are cheap, non-toxic, biodegradable, and, moreover, their polar character confers enhanced antibacterial properties to the resultant polymeric systems. Most utilized polyols from VOs are derived from soybean, sunflower, and cottonseed and, together with fatty acids, have been used for many years in the production of polyols employed in polyurethane and, to a lesser extent, in polyester synthesis [
