<p class="p">Keratin is a protein found in mammalian hair, fur, wool, skin, hoofs, claws, and horns and in feathers of birds. This is an ancient material used for textile applications due to the early domestication of sheep and the use of the produced wool for such purposes. However, the need for non-contaminant sources for the design of sustainable bio-plastics has put the focus on keratin. Keratin extracted from such agricultural waste products as poor quality wool and chicken feathers has been used to produce films, fibers (electrospun fibers), and hydrogels and shown potential application as a scaffold for tissue engineering and tissue dressings and even as drug delivery systems [
