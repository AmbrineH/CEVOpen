<p class="p">Nayak et al. used a different approach by blending keratin with different polysaccharides (alginate, agar, and gellan) to obtain therapeutic porous dermal patches [
 <xref rid="B225-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">225</xref>]. To impart antimicrobial activity, the obtained patches were coated with AgNPs. In particular, the antimicrobial activity of a keratin/agar patch was evaluated through the disk diffusion test against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic> bacteria and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> fungi pathogens. The results indicated the good antimicrobial activity of the patches against the tested pathogens, with a remarkable effect against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Thus, the broad antimicrobial activity of the keratin-based obtained patches was confirmed.
