 <xref rid="B224-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">224</xref>] proposed the immobilization of quaternary ammonium moieties on a keratin-based substrate, thus turning keratin into an antimicrobial material for biomedical applications. The methodology consisted of the generation of thiols in wool keratin fibers (reduction of disulfide bonds using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride) and then their reaction with the acrylate monomer [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (2-AE) through click chemistry. In this way, a quaternary ammonium moiety was grafted onto reduced keratin fibers. The antimicrobial property of the obtained material and also of the untreated material was evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria using the agar diffusion plate test. Interestingly, the percentage of bacteria reduction obtained with the modified keratin was 94%, whereas for the untreated material there was no antibacterial effect. In this case, since the antimicrobial compound (the quaternary ammonium moiety) is covalently bonded to keratin, the antimicrobial activity is sustained in time and no leaking can occur. This interesting approach makes keratin-based materials applicable, for instance, as medical textiles.
