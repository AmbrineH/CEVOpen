<p class="p">Among animal proteins, caseinates are considered to be attractive for use in the food-processing industry; i.e., food packaging and culinary applications, since they show numerous advantageous properties, such as their natural origin, edible character, water solubility, and ability to act as emulsifiers [

 <xref rid="B214-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. Caseinates show an ability to form networks, plasticity, and elasticity, which lead to the formation of transparent films with good performance as a barrier against oxygen, carbon dioxide, and aroma compounds [

 <xref rid="B215-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>]. Sodium caseinate is more frequently used than the other caseinates, such as calcium caseinate or potassium caseinate, and, importantly, caseinates are frequently plasticized with glycerol to obtain the required flexibility for the formation and manufacture of film [

 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>]. Moreover, caseinate-based films have attracted interest as carriers of antimicrobial substances in food-related applications [
 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>]. The main advantage of introducing antimicrobial agents into caseinate films, as in the other described systems, is the ability to slow the diffusion of the agents through the film, allowing for its availability at a desired concentration. Therefore, smaller amounts of antimicrobial additives are needed to achieve a targeted shelf-life extension, compared with the direct addition of the antimicrobial additives onto the food surface strategy, where they quickly diffuse away from the surface, and are rapidly diluted or react with food components [
