<p class="p">Noori et al. [
 <xref rid="B218-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">218</xref>] have recently developed a nanoemulsion-based edible coating with strong antimicrobial activity against psychrophilic bacteria to extend the shelf-life of chicken fillets. For that, ginger (
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>) EO was added to sodium caseinate matrices and the obtained films showed comparable results to the antibiotic gentamicin. Arrieta et al. added 10 wt% of carvacrol into edible matrices of both sodium and calcium caseinate, and further studied the obtained plasticized films against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria by the agar diffusion method [

 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>]. Although edible films of sodium caseinate and calcium caseinate with carvacrol showed antibacterial effectiveness against both 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria, they showed a higher diffusion of carvacrol through an agar gel inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> than that with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, resulting in a higher inhibition zone around the edible film area [
 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>]. Moreover, the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> inhibition zone was larger for sodium caseinate films than for calcium caseinate films (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00641-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). This behavior was related to the fact that divalent calcium cations in calcium caseinate promote crosslinking with protein chains [
 <xref rid="B214-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>], retaining carvacrol more efficiently due to the more tortuous structure, which releases the active agent more slowly [
