<p class="p">Imran et al. [
 <xref rid="B219-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>] developed sodium caseinate films that incorporated nisin, one of the most-used bacteriocins for food conservation, with high antilisterial and antistaphylococcal activity. Meanwhile, Calder√≥n-Aguirre et al. [
 <xref rid="B216-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>] introduced nisin as well as antimicrobial substances produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus infantarius</italic> into glycerol-plasticized sodium caseinate films, and observed that caseinate films containing bacteriocins produced by 
 <italic class="italic">S. infantarius</italic> showed higher antilisterial effectiveness in long-term refrigeration storage (around 2 months) than nisin-incorporated ones.
