<p class="p">Collagen is the main structural protein found in the extracellular matrix of various connective animal tissues. The amino acids that compose collagen are wound together in a triple-helix, giving rise to elongated fibrils. The main role of collagen is both structural and functional, since it contributes to some processes of tissue repair [

In addition, by partial hydrolysis of collagen and destabilization of the triple-helix, it is possible to obtain the natural polymer called gelatin, which has also attracted much industrial interest. In sum, collagen possesses such properties as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity, which makes it suitable for applications involving wound healing and tissue regeneration. However, as is the case with the aforementioned bio-based polymers, this protein lacks the antimicrobial activity that is rather important for those kinds of applications. So, the modification/functionalization of collagen or its combination with antimicrobial agents is required.
