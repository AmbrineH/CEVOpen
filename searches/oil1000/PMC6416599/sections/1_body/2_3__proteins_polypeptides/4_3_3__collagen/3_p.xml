<p class="p">Similarly, You et al. developed a metallic silver nanoparticles–collagen/chitosan hybrid scaffold to be used as a dressing for burn wounds [
 <xref rid="B230-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">230</xref>]. Ideal dressings are required to present antimicrobial activity among other factors, such as keeping moisture in the wound, removing exudates, or even providing drugs that contribute to the healing. However, in the case of burn wounds, where a large amount of fluid is lost and bacterial infections occur, it can become necessary to have dressings with antimicrobial activity. For the scaffold’s preparation, bovine type-I collagen and chitosan were dissolved together in an acetic acid solution. In the next step, commercial AgNPs were added to the collagen–chitosan, poured in a plate and kept at 4 °C, frozen at −25 °C, and finally lyophilized to obtain the scaffolds. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> via the disk diffusion method, at which the zone of growth inhibition was measured after 24 h of incubation. An antimicrobial assay was performed for collagen and the hybrid collagen-based scaffolds, and, as expected, more activity was observed in the hybrid scaffold compared to the neat sample without AgNPs. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity was improved as the amount of AgNPs in the scaffold increased. These bio-based hybrid scaffolds, besides their proven antimicrobial activity, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that are also derived from the presence of AgNPs. As a conclusion, the authors postulated that the hybrid collagen-based dermal scaffolds could have application as a new antimicrobial dressing designed using non-toxic components.
