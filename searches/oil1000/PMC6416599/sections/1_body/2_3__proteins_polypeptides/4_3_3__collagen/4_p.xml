 <xref rid="B231-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>] developed a collagen-based antimicrobial dressing that incorporated thymol as an essential oil to provide antimicrobial activity to the final material. As previously highlighted, it has been demonstrated that thymol shows antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains as well as against fungi and yeast [
 <xref rid="B232-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">232</xref>,
 <xref rid="B233-materials-12-00641" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>]. For the preparation of the films, collagen obtained from rat tendons was dissolved in acetic acid. Then, different amounts of thymol were added to the collagen solution. For a better miscibility of the thymol in the collagen, a nonionic surfactant was also added to the solution. Finally, the solutions were poured, and, by the solvent evaporation method, collagen–thymol films were obtained. Since the main objective of the work was to develop an antimicrobial material against biofilm formation, the obtained films were tested by the agar diffusion method against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. aerogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains. The antimicrobial test revealed that the most sensitive micro-organism was 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacteria. This effect was even more significant with the increase in thymol content in collagen films. The growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria was also inhibited, although the dose needed was higher compared to that of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus.</italic> Similar results were observed for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. aerogenes</italic>, but no inhibition was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. The biofilm formation for collagen–thymol and collagen control films was also evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Through an SEM observation, it was concluded that the number of micro-colonies on the surface of the collagen-thymol film was smaller compared to that of the control film without the EO. Thus, collagen-based films were also effective in inhibiting biofilm formation.
