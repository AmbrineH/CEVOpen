<p class="p">Within this challenge of finding sustainable bio-based materials, natural macromolecules as proteins are playing an important role due to their versatility and it being possible to modify them enzymatically, chemically, and physically so that the desired properties can be obtained for each specific application. In general, proteins are used as additives in polymeric matrices (nisin and corn zein [
