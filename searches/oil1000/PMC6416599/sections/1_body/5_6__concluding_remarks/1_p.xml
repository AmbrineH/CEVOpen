<p class="p">There is a necessity to find new routes or alternatives to petroleum-based materials. The circular economy has to be reached in every corner of life, and, at the same time, we must be able to combat bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Thus, biopolymers are outstanding candidates to be modified or combined with an antimicrobial substance to obtain antimicrobial systems with application in several fields and in good alignment with the circular economy. This article describes some of the recent steps taken to reach these goals. However, more research and investment are needed to achieve fully sustainable materials with antimicrobial activity and effective substitutes for the existing ones. In this sense, nanotechnology as a method of reinforcement, nanoencapsulation, or nanostructuration has shown that it can help us to achieve our goals.</p>
