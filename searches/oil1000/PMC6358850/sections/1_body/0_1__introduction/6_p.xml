<p class="p">We aimed to evaluate the content and chemical composition of essential oils (EOs) and, for the first time, leaf hydrosols (EWs) obtained by steam distillation of these species. The evaluation of the content and chemical composition of both EOs and EWs was carried out using optimized Gas-Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Head-Space Solid Phase Micro Extraction followed by comprehensive two-dimensional Gas-Chromatography (HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS) analyses allowed providing a fast and direct comparison and visualization of the volatile components (fingerprint) of the EWs, also pointing out the presence of some VOCs not detectable only using the GC-MS. To the author’s knowledge, this work is the first report regarding the characterization of the aroma components of EW from these four 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species. Due to the fact that these 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species are 1,8-cineol-rich, we hypothesized that 1,8-cineol was the main volatile of EOs and EWs, and that the main differences among both EOs and EWs from different species were due to relative amounts of minor volatile compounds.
