<p class="p">Essential oils and leaf hydrosols were analyzed using integrated sampling and chromatographic techniques. In particular, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted (from EWs) or diluted (from OEs) with organic solvent and analyzed by GC-MS and the volatile profile of EWs was also analyzed by GC×GC-TOFMS after extraction of VOCs by HS-SPME. GC-MS is the well-recognized technique of choice for analysis of VOCs from plant material and plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and, in this work, we applied this technique for the evaluation of the content and chemical composition of both EWs and EOs. HS-SPME is well recognized as a widespread and convenient sampling tool for VOCs and it is increasingly used coupled with GC-MS in analysis of food and more [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] (e.g., differences that arise from different absorption capacity of different fibers, changes in sorption temperature, competition between different molecules at different affinities for the absorpting material, fiber wearing) led to the need of using several devices (e.g., the use of a pool of suitable internal standards [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]) to ensure unbiased quantification. For these reasons, we decided to apply HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS analysis on EWs to better elucidate the volatile profile, thus providing a tool for the direct comparison and visualization of plant volatile components and pointing out the presence of molecules not detectable only with GC-MS. Further quantitative evaluation via HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis can be further investigated in future researches. To the authors’ knowledge, the characterization of EWs of these
