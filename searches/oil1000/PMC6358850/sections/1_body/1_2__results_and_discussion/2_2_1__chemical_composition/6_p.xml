<p class="p">In our study, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus pulverulenta</italic> Sims were the species with the highest amount of 1,8-cineole. Since EOs are totally composed by the volatile fraction, the relative abundance of each compound can be assumed as the amount of this molecule in the oil expressed as g/100g.
