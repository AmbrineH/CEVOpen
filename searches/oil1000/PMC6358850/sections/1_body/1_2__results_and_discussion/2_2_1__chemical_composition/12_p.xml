<p class="p">Other compounds: no significant amounts of esters and aldehydes were identified in our samples, the only exceptions being traces of nonanal in one EW sample and very low amounts of isoamyl acetate in EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic>. Ketones (the three linear isomers of heptanone and lower percentages of 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one) were identified in low amounts (0.20â€“0.27% in both EWs and EOs). Finally, alcohols were identified in very low amounts in EOs (heptan-2-ol and heptan-3-ol for a total amount up to 0.16%), while in EWs they were present in percentages up to 2.01%, with 3-methylbutanol as the main molecule, followed by 2-phenylethanol and
