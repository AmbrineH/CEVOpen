<p class="p">OMs constituted about 90% of the EOs. In these samples, α-terpineol was in the range 2.00–3.11%. Noteworthy, in the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic>, the highest amount of α-terpineol and no presence of its ester, namely α-terpinyl acetate, were detected. In the other three species, α-terpinyl acetate was detected and the sum of the percentages of α-terpineol and α-terpinyl acetate was similar to that of α-terpineol of EO of the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic>. The other OMs didn’t exceed 0.72%.
