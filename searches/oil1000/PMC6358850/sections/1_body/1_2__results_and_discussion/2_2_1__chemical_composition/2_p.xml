<p class="p">Monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH): these terpenes were present in the EO samples with relative abundances between 6.74% and 10.76%. Limonene was the most abundant MH, with similar percentages in all the EOs (3.00–4.65%). Different abundances of the other MHs were pointed out for different 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species: in 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic>, similar amounts of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and α-pinene were detected, followed by lower amounts of γ-terpinene and 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-ocimene. In 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus cinerea</italic>, similar amounts of α-pinene and Limonene were detected, followed by lower amounts of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, β-myrcene, β-pinene and 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-ocimene. Regarding the other two species (
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus pulverulenta</italic> Sims and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus pulverulenta</italic> baby blue Sims), the α-pinene amount was approximately half the Limonene, with lower amounts of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, β-myrcene, and β-pinene. Other MH (camphene, α-phellandrene, alloocimene) were in low amounts. Noteworthy, the α-phellandrene content in EOs of all these species was lower than 1%, according to the
