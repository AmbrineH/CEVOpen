 <xref rid="molecules-24-00226-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the chemical composition by GC-MS of the EOs and EWs summarized in Table 3 (see experimental section). Overall, 10 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 19 oxygenated monoterpenes, 2 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 2 aromatic monoterpenes (one of which oxygenated), 1 ester, 4 ketones, 1 aldehyde and 5 alcohols were identified. Some of the main molecules detected in the EWs and EOs are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00226-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Relative abundance of each of the molecules identified by GC-MS was calculated as a percentage of the peak area on the total area of the identified peaks. Peak areas from the total ion current were normalized by the use of the area of internal standard (tridecane).
