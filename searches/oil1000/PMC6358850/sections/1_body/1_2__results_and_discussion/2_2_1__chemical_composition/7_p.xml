<p class="p">Regarding the analyzed hydrosols (EWs), 1,8-cineole was in the range 88.40–90.78%. In order to better characterize these hydrosols, 1,8-cineole was quantified using an external calibration curve, as reported in the experimental section. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00226-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows that the absolute concentration of 1,8-cineole in the EWs extracts varied in the range 0.74–1.58 g/L, highlighting that this molecule was also recovered in water samples.
