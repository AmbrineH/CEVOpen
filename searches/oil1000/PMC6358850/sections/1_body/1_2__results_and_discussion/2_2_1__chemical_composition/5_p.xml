<p class="p">Oxygenated monoterpenes (OM): 1,8-cineole is the main component of EOs obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus,</italic> the most common 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In EOs from these four species, relative abundance of 1,8-cineole ranged between 83.80% and 88.66%, higher than the 80–85% indicated by the standard ISO as the minimum amount of 1,8-cineole for EO from 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus.</italic> Other papers in the literature reported the characterization of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus cinereal</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus pulverulenta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], while, to the authors’ knowledge, no reports on EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus parvula</italic> have been published, to date. In such papers, the relative abundance of 1,8-cineole showed great variability ranging usually from 58.0 to 69.0% and sometimes reaching 87.8% in 
 <italic class="italic">E. cinerea</italic> EOs and being approx. 75% in 
 <italic class="italic">E. pulverulenta</italic> EOs. Consequently, also the relative abundances of the other minor terpenes showed a great variability. This variability might be due to the effect of climatic and geographical factors and harvesting season.
