<p class="p">For example, a total of about 400 compounds was detected by GC×GC analysis in 1-16-EW (estimated from the number of peak contours in 2D plots) and, after subtracting baseline peaks, corresponding to fiber blending or background interferences, 137 peaks/compounds were identified. These results were in agreement with Wong et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], where the 2D rational separation pattern aids the identification of ca. 400 metabolites in 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> spp. leaf oils, 183 of which were identified or tentatively identified and represented percentages between 50.8–90.0% of the total ion count, comprising various chemical families.
