<p class="p">An advanced approach known as comprehensive template matching fingerprinting [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] was adopted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00226-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). This method considers, as a comparative feature, each individual 2D peak together with its time coordinates, detector response and MS fragmentation pattern, and includes them in a sample template that is created by the analyst and can be used to compare plots from different samples directly and comprehensively. A template could be used to correctly interpret visual differences in further analyses. To create the template, the peak identification was performed by matching the experimental mass spectra against spectra databases combined with GC-MS data.
