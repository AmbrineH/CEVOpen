 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> hydrosols were organized mainly in three clusters in 2D separation space: monoterpenic hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpenes acetate, except for the 1,8-cineol that wrapped around, resulting in monoterpenes zone (

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], one molecule that wraps around, does not affect the separation and identification of the compounds, since the more strongly retained components (those that wrap-around) did not overlap peaks that were weakly retained in the subsequent modulation.
