<p class="p">The main differences that emerged between the four varieties could be summarized as follows: 1-16-EW showed the presence of 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one that was not present in the other species (see also 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00226-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">exo</italic>-2-hydroxycineole acetate isomers. 1-16-EW did not show terpinyl acetate and α-terpinene, which instead were found in the other three species. 2-16-EW was the only species that showed the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-phellandrene, piperitone and citral. 1-16-EW and 2-16-EW showed the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-jasmone and carvone, while 3-16-EW and 4-16-EW didn’t show the presence of these molecules. Volatile profiles presented in 2D contour plots allow visual discrimination of the metabolic composition among interspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> aromatic waters, as reported for leaf oils of other different 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> spp. [
