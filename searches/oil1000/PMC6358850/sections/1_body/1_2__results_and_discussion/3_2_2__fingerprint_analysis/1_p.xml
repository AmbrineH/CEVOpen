<p class="p">Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a rapid and simple procedure for extraction of volatile fraction from aromatic and medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. As reported, the divinilbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber is the most effective SPME fiber able to isolate the volatile fraction from commercial hydrosols of several plants [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. HS-SPME and GC×GC-TOFMS fingerprint analysis are ideal tools to analyze complex volatile fraction from several matrices, and to provide a sensitive method for the direct comparison and visualization of plant volatile components. As previously reported, 1,8-cineole was the major component in the EOs and EWs, but differences in the other metabolites present in low amounts are very important. Utilization of comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC×GC) increases separation power with respect to that of the one-dimensional GC in complex matrices where the presence of low abundant components is critical, such as

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. To our knowledge, there has been no study reporting the volatile profile of EWs from these 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species; therefore, hydrosols from the four 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS to better elucidate the volatile profile of these by-products, also pointing out the presence of molecules not detectable with only GC-MS. HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS analyses of the complex volatile fraction of EWs were submitted to advanced fingerprinting analysis of 2D chromatographic data.
