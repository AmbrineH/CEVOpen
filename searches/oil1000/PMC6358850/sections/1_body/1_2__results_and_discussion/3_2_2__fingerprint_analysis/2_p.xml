 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species are reported: each 2D-peak corresponds to a single volatile compound. In this case, SPME and comprehensive comparative analysis of 2D chromatographic data showed visual differences among EW samples. 1-16-EW and 2-16-EW showed a larger number and a higher intensity of peaks, with respect to 3-16-EW and 4-16-EW. The most intense peak corresponded to 1,8-cineole.
