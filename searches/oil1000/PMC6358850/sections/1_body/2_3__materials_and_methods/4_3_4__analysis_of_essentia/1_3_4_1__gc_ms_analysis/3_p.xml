<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of EO and EW solutions, obtained as described above, were carried out by liquid injection on an Agilent 7890a Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Gerstel MPS automatic sampler system and a quadrupole Mass Spectrometer 5975c MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) working in split-less mode. The analytes separation was carried out by an Agilent DB InnoWAX column (length, 50 m; i.d., 200 µm, film thickness, 0.4 µm). Initial oven temperature was 40 °C, held for 1 min. Then, it raised to 200 °C at 5 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, then raised to 260 °C at 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and finally held at 260 °C for 6 min. Injector temperature was 260 °C, while the carrier gas helium, was at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. 1 µL of each sample was injected.
