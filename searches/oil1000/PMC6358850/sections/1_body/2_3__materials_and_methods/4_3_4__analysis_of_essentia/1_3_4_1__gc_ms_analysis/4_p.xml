 <italic class="italic">z</italic> and with an electron ionization of 70 eV and the Total Ion Current chromatograms were recorded. Compounds were tentatively identified by comparing the mass spectra of each peak with those reported in mass spectral database as the standard NIST08/Wiley98 libraries; when available, standards were used for confirming the nature of the identified molecules: α-pinene, β-pinene, camphene, β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-ocimene, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, alloocimene, 1,8-cineol, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, citral, α-terpineol, borneol, β-caryophillene, heptan-2-one, 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one, nonanale, 3-methylbytanol, heptan-2-ol and 2-phenylethanol. Peaks identification was then confirmed by comparing their retention index; to this aim, a mixture of linear alkanes (C

 <sub class="sub">26</sub>) in hexane (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI, USA) was injected in the same condition already described for sample analysis and the retention indexes were calculated by the generalized equation [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] The relative concentration of each identified compound was calculated as peak area on total area of all the identified peaks (peaks areas were normalized using tridecane as internal standard). 1,8 cineole in EWs was quantified by a six point calibration curve, which were built using 1,8 cineole as external standard (range 10–160 ppm, 0.9936 R
