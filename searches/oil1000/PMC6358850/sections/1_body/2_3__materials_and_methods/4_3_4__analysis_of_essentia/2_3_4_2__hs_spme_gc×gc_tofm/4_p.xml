<p class="p">The chromatographic conditions were: oven temperature program, 40 °C, increased at 4 °C/min to 220 °C, increased at 10 °C/min to 260 °C (hold 1 min); injector temperature, 260 °C; split ratio 1:5. The inlet of the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column was maintained under vacuum by a deactivated fused silica (0.30 m × 0.10 mm I.D.) placed immediately before the column, after the flow modulator. TOFMS parameters: the ion source temperature was 230 °C; the transfer line temperature was 280 °C; ionization, −70 eV. A mass range of 43–500 Da was used, with data rate of 50 Hz. TOF-DS
