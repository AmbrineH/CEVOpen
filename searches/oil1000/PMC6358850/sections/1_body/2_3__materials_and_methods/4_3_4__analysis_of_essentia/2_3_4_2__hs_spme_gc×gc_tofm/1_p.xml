 <xref rid="molecules-24-00226-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) were extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by GC×GC-TOFMS. GC×GC was performed by a flow modulation apparatus consisting on an Agilent 7890B GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), with flow modulator device for 2D separation, coupled with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-DS Markes International Ltd., Llantrisant, UK). After some trials aimed at optimizing amounts of sample, NaCl and water and exposure time and temperature, SPME conditions were set as follow: 1 mL of the EW sample, together with 2 g of NaCl and 4 mL of deionized water were placed into a 20-mL screw cap vial fitted with PTFE/silicone septa. VOCs were absorbed exposing a divinilbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) 2 cm fiber (Supelco) for 10 min into the vial at 60 °C and then immediately desorbed at 280 °C in a gas chromatograph injection port.
