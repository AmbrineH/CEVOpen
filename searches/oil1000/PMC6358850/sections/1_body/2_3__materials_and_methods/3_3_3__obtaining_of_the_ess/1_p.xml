<p class="p">Essential oils and hydrosols were obtained by steam distillation of the 
 <italic class="italic">eucalyptus</italic> fresh leaves and little stems, within 24 h after harvesting, using the Essenziale 20 extractor (Tred Technology srl, Italy). The system used low working temperatures (always below 80 Â°C), thus decreasing the consumption energy and minimizing the degradation of the volatile fraction. The process parameters were continuously checked and adjusted during the distillation, e.g., internal pressure inside the boiler, internal boiler temperature, water temperature, oil and hydrosol flow. The starting material vs hydrosol ratio was 3:1 and the recovery of the corresponding essential oil was in variable percentage depending on the collection period and atmospheric conditions. The mean of yields of EO are from 1.1 to 1.3%, as reported in
