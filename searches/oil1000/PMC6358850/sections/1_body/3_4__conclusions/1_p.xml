<p class="p">This study reports a first preliminary characterization of the volatile profile of EO and EW of four less studied 1,8-cineol-rich 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species (
 <italic class="italic">E. parvula</italic> L.A.S. Johnson &amp; K.D. Hill, 
 <italic class="italic">E. cinerea</italic> F. Muell, 
 <italic class="italic">E. pulverulenta</italic> Sims and 
 <italic class="italic">E. pulverulenta</italic> baby blue Sims) cultivated in Tuscany (Italy) and intended to be employed as natural additives in the food, cosmetics and perfume industries, as well as for therapeutic ends, beyond the predominantly ornamental one. Chemical differences in VOCs from EWs and EOs were evidenced, providing products for potentially different uses. Further studies will be necessary for the standardization of commercial EOs and EWs optimizing the technological harvesting period.
