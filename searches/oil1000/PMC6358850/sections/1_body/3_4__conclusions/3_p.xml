<p class="p">GC-MS analysis allowed pointing out that the volatile fraction of EWs extracts was mainly constituted by oxygenated monoterpenes (97.6–98.9%), with monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons detected only in traces. HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS analysis of EWs extracts also allowed for metabolic profiling of EWs for the direct comparison and visualization of volatile components of these not yet investigated co-products. The GC-MS quantitative evaluation of 1,8-cineole in EWs showed amounts of up to 1.6 g/L; consequently, the studied EWs, co-products of steam distillation of fresh leaves and little stems of the four
