<p class="p">Regarding the EOs from these 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species, GC-MS analysis of diluted samples showed that oxygenated monoterpenes accounted for up to 92.7% and monoterpenes hydrocarbons contributed to volatile fraction for up to 10.8%, with limonene as the most representative MH. The relative abundance of minor terpenes as limonene, α-pinene, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol and alloaromandrene seems to be suitable for differentiation among EOs of the four different 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species.
