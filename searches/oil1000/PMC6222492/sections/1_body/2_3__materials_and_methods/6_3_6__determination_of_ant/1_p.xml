 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil and terpinen-4-ol were tested for their anti-
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> biofilm formation. Only three strains were selected for this test. A crystal violet assay was employed to test the effects on biofilm formation. One hundred µl of fresh bacterial suspension was added to each well. Growth control (cells + broth), media control (only broth) and blank control (broth + extract) were included. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the biofilm biomass was evaluated using the crystal violet staining assay as described above and the OD at 570 nm was measured [
