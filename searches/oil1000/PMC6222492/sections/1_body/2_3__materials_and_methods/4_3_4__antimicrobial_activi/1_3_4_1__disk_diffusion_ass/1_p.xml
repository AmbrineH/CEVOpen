<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity testing was done according to the protocol described by Snoussi and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Overnight cultures were used and the optical density was adjusted to 0.1 standard turbidity (OD
 <sub class="sub">600 nm</sub>). The inoculums were streaked onto MH agar plates using a sterile swab. Sterile filter discs (diameter 6 mm, Biolife, Milano, Italy) were impregnated with 10 mg of essential oil. Discs with the standard antibiotic, Cefoxitin (5 µg/mL), were taken as positive control. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was taken as a measure of the antimicrobial activity.
