<p class="p">The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for all bacteria tested in this study using the microdilution assay [

 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells/mL (DOλ = 600 nm). 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil and terpinen-4-ol were dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO 10%). The highest concentration was 50 mg/mL, and then serial twofold dilutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 50 to 0.048 mg/mL in the 96-well plates and prepared by dispensing 100 µL aliquot from the stock solutions of each essential oil was added to 95 µL of the correspondent broth into the first well. Then, 100 µL from the serial dilutions were transferred into 10 consecutive wells. Finally, 5 µL of the inoculum of each microorganism was added to the wells. The last well, containing 195 µL of nutrient broth without essential oil and 5 µL of the inoculum on each strip was used as a negative control. The final volume in each well was 200 µL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
