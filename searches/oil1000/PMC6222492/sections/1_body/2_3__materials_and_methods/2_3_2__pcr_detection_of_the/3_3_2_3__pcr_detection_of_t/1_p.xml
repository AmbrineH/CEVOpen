<p class="p">The PCR detection of the mecA gene responsible for resistance to methicillin was carried out according to the technique described by Geha and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The mecA primers are 5′-GTAGAAATGACTGAACGTCCGATAA-3′ (Forward) and 5′-CCAATTCCACATTGTTTCGGTCTAA-3′ (Reverse). The size of the amplified fragments is of 310 bp. The reaction mixture volume of the PCR was 25 μL, containing 200 μM of each dNTP (ATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP); 0.5 μL of MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 1 U of GO Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), 5 μL of Green Go Taq buffer (5×) and 1 μM of each primer. The cycle includes incubation at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 2 min at 72 °C and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The amplification was carried out in a PTC 100 thermocycler (Biorad, Marnes la Coquette, France). Then, the PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) and photographed by a Gel doc XR apparatus. The type strain
