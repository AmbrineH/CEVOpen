<p class="p">There are different protocols for extracting DNA, but we have followed a simple protocol based on the method of lysis of the bacterial cells used in our laboratory. Thus, after inoculating the bacterial strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> on nutrient agar and incubating for 18 to 24 h at 37 °C, some pure and well-isolated colonies were suspended in 1 mL of a solution of Tris-EDTA (TE), followed by a centrifugal washing of this suspension (13,200 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C). Subsequently, the supernatant was removed while the pellet was suspended in a volume of 200 μL TE, vortexed and then incubated for 10 min in a Marie bath at a temperature of 95 °C. After incubation, a final centrifugation step (13,200 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C) was made and the supernatant containing the bacterial DNA was moved into new Eppendorf tubes. The DNA was stored at 20 °C until use.
