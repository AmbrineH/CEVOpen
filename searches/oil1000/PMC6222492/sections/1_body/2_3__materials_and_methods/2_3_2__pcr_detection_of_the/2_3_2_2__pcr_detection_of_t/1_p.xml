<p class="p">The PCR reaction was applied using the Sa442 gene. The primers used in this reaction were as follows: 5′-CGTAATGAGATTTCAGTAATAACAACA-3′ and 5′-AATCTTTGTCGGTACACG ATATTCTTCACG-3′ [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The size of the amplified fragments is of 218 bp. The total DNA was extracted using the lysis method. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 25 μL containing 50 ng of bacterial DNA, 5 μL of buffer (5×), 0.25 μL of dNTP (10 mM), 0.5 μL of MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), 1 μL of each primer (25 μM), 1 U of GO Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). The PCR mixture was placed in a thermocycler (Mastercycle). The PCR cycle conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 90 s, hybridization at 57 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 90 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products (5 μL) were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL) at 90 V for 1 h and visualized under ultraviolet light. The amplification products were photographed and their sizes were determined with a marker of molecular size of 100 bp (Invitrogen, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France).
