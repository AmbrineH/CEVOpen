<p class="p">For biofilm formation on stainless and glass, the strips (1.5 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were disinfected by dipping in 70% alcohol for 30 min and washed with sterile distilled water. They were then ultrasonicated for 20 min to remove any contaminants and artefacts from the surfaces, washed again in sterile distilled water, dried and used for the biofilm assay. Successively, strips were placed into 12-well tissue culture plate and 100 µL of bacterial suspensions were placed into each strip. The cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed from the strips by being gently washed with 5 mL PBS. Strips to which no cells were added served as negative controls. Biofilm quantification was made with crystal violet 1% staining and then dissolved into acetic acid (33%). One hundred twenty-five μL of each well were transferred on 96-well microtiter plate and the OD at 570 nm was measured [
