<p class="p">The composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02672-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Fifteen components, listed according to their elution time on an HP5 capillary column, were identified, representing 93.8% of the oil. TTO was particularly rich in terpinen-4-ol (40.4%), γ-terpinene (19.5%), and α-terpinene (7.7%). Other relevant components were 1,8-cineole (5.2%), p-cymene (4.7%), α-terpineol (3.3%), and α-terpinolene (3.1%). Terpinenes and derivatives represent the great majority of the oil (74.0%). Our results agree with previous literature. More chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> have been reported, including terpinen-4-ol, terpinolene and four 1,8-cineole chemotypes [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Brophy and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] used GC and GC/MS to analyze more than 800 TTO samples, with a great prevalence of terpinen-4-ol, γ-terpinene and α-terpinene. Also, commercial tea tree oil is very rich in terpinens [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This result agreed with a previous study which showed that terpinen-4-ol was the major component of a pure tea tree [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. On the other hand, Russell and Southwell [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> contained a low quantity of terpinen-4-ol in the early stage of seedling growth and its concentration rose with plant development.
