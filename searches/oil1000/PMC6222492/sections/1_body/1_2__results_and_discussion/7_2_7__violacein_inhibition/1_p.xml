 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm inhibition by TTO and terpinen-4-ol, we carried out the AHL-based in vitro QS competition assay with a suitable biosensor strain (
 <italic class="italic">Chromobacterium violaceum</italic>). In qualitative analysis, TTO showed an inhibition in HSL-mediated violacein production in 
 <italic class="italic">C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12,472 with a MIC of 69.3% and a MIC/2 of 58.98%. This inhibition was about 23.55% at a concentration of 0.3125 mg/mL (MIC/32) for the essential oil (
