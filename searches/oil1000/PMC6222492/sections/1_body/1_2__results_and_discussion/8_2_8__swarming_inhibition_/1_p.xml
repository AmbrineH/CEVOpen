<p class="p">As swarming migrations have an important role in biofilm formation mediated by Quorum Sensing, we examined the anti-QS potential of TTO and terpinen-4-ol on swarming motility in PAO1 test strain. The QS inhibiting activity of assayed substances was obtained from the levels of pyocyanin production in treated 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. Our results revealed that this essential oil inhibited the swarming of PAO1 at the three tested doses (50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) with pyocyanin concentration decrease between 16.67% and 33.33% (
