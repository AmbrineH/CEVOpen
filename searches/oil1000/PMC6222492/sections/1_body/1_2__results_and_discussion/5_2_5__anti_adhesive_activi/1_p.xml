<p class="p">To avoid biofilm formation is useful to prevent its colonization. Thus, we evaluated the ability of different concentrations of TTO and terpinen-4-ol to inhibit the adhesion. The study of anti-adhesive properties of TTO and terpinen-4-ol was carried out on three 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains namely Sa12, Sa15 and Sa18. These strains were selected according to their high biofilm production ability on both polystyrene and glass surfaces. TTO volatile and terpinen-4-ol showed anti-adhesive ability of MRSA strains on polystyrene at the lowest tested concentration (MIC/16 = 0.003 mg/mL) (
