<p class="p">For determining the effect of TTO and its major compound on biofilm formation, we used the quantitative microtiter plate method. Three MRSA strains (Sa12, Sa15 and Sa18) were cultured in microtiter plates for 48 h in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the tested substances (MIC, 2 × MIC and 4 × MIC), and the formed biofilm was stained with crystal violet. Low concentrations (0.048, 0.096 and 0.192 mg/mL) of terpinen-4-ol showed a significant reduction of the biofilm formation, with a great percentage of inhibition of MRSA cells adhesion (
