<p class="p">High ability to eliminate the biofilm formed on both polystyrene and a glass material by using terpinen-4-ol was also recorded. In fact, the eradication percentage was up to (91.24 ± 5.81)% for Sa15 on polystyrene microplate and about (73.79 ± 9.47)% on glass material. The effects of natural antibacterial agents, such as berberine, carvacrol, oregano and thymol against staphylococcal biofilms have been frequently reported [
