<p class="p">Twenty 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains out of 28 tested (71.43%) were high Biofilm producers on glass material with an optical density ranging from (1.01 ± 0.2) to (3.38 ± 0.12). Additionally, four strains (Sa18, Sa30, Sa12 and Sa15) were the highest biofilm-producers strains on both glass and polystyrene surfaces isolated from blood, superficial pus, and other origins. Vergara and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] found that 22.7% of MRSA strains isolated from milk and meat were able to form biofilm on polystyrene and only one of these strains (1 out of 28, 4.5%) was able to produce biofilm on stainless steel (weak producer).
