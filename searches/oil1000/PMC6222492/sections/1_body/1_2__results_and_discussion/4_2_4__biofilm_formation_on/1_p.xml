<p class="p">In this study, polystyrene and glass were chosen because they are the most frequently used materials in medical devices. We have noticed that all MRSA strains independently of their colonization sites form a biofilm (0.1 &lt; OD &lt; 1 or OD
 <sub class="sub">570</sub> &gt; 1) on the tested materials with different degrees as function of the strain tested and the abiotic surface used (
