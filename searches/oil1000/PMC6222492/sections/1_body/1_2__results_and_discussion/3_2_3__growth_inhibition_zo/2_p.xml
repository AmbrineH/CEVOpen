<p class="p">Low concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil and its main compound (terpinen-4-ol) inhibited the growth of all 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains tested independently of their origins. In fact, mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) values as low as 0.048–3.125 mg for the whole essential oil, and 0.048–1.52 mg/mL for the terpinen-4-ol are sufficient to inhibit the growth of all 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains tested. Whereas mean bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) about 25 to 50 mg/mL (whole volatile oil) and 6.25–50 mg/mL (terpinen-4-ol) are needed to completely inhibit the growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains tested.
