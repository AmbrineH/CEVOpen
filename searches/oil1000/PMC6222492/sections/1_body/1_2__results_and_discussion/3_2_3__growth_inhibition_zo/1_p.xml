 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> and terpinen-4-ol were active against MRSA isolates with zones of inhibition ranging from 13 mm (strain Sa 21) to 37.5 (strain Sa4) for the TTO. Terpinen-4-ol is active against one MRSA clinical isolate (Sa24) and the two reference strains, similarly to the antibiotic Cefoxitin (5 Âµg/mL). Two isolates showed a resistance to terpinen-4-ol (Sa1 and Sa6) with a diameter of the zone of inhibition of 6 mm (
