<p class="p">Twenty-eight 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains isolated from different pathological samples were identified using amplification of Sa 442 gene. Positive control (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and ATCC 43300) reacted appropriately. The Sa442 PCR assay was perfectly indicated for detecting
