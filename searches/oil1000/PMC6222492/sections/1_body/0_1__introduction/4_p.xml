<p class="p">The aim of this research was to study, for the first time, the anti-quorum sensing activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil using 
 <italic class="italic">Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 as bacterial models. Also, this study we aimed to report the chemical composition of the essential oil and the antibacterial activity as of the oil as of terpinen-4-ol against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains. We indagate also the anti-MRSA biofilm potency of different concentrations of TTO and its main component terpinen-4-ol.
