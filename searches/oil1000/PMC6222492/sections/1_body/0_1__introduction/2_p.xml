<p class="p">Tea tree oil (TTO), an essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Maiden &amp; Betche) Cheel (Myrtaceae), has been known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. TTO consists of about 100 different components including terpinen-4-ol, which is one of its main antibacterial compounds [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Drugs and care products containing TTO are frequently used for the treatment of various infections or as antiseptics and disinfectants [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Preliminary clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of TTO in the elimination of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of TTO against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and, therefore, this oil was widely adopted in the pharmaceutical industry and in the clinic [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02672" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is able to form complex structures named biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms exhibit more resistance to antibiotics and host defense systems, which contribute to its pathogenesis and make the treatment of infections difficult [
