<p class="p">This study provided strong evidence that tea tree oil (TTO) could be used as an alternative treatment for bacterial infections, in particular those associated with biofilm formation. This study specifically concluded that the low concentration of TTO was able to eliminate biofilm formation and subsequently cells communication (quorum sensing). However, it is highly recommended to further search for new effective compounds for the treatment of bacterial infection.</p>
