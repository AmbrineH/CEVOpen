<p id="Par25" class="p">Among the diseases related to altered gut microbiota, chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) is one of the most common digestive complications in cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. CID has been found to occur in 50â€“80% of cancer patients, especially those with advanced cancer [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. In a word, there is still a lack of safe and effective modern medicines for the prevention and treatment of CID. Therefore, considerable attentions have been paid to complementary or alternative medicines such as traditional herbal medicines [
