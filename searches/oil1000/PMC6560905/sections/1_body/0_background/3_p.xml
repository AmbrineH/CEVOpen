<p id="Par26" class="p">Shenzhu Capsule (SZC), a formula of Chinese herbal medicine, is composed of ginsenosides and polysaccharides from Renshen (rhizomes of 
 <italic class="italic">Panax ginseng</italic> C. A. Mey.), essential oil and polysaccharides from Baizhu (rhizomes of 
 <italic class="italic">Atractylodes macrocephala</italic> Koidz.). In the past few years, our researches mainly focused on the therapeutic effects of SZC for gastrointestinal diseases. For example, we had reported that SZC induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through mitochondrial pathway [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. In addition, SZC could reversely regulate the expression of some genes (metabolic, ion channels and transport proteins) in SGC-7901 tumor-bearing mice, resulting in the improvement of gastric cancer through multiple targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Moreover, SZC not only regulated immune and inflammatory responses during the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), but also acted on UC complications (bloody diarrhea) and prevented UC from developing into colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. At present, our attentions are being paid to investigate whether SZC exhibits therapeutic effect on CID, the GI side effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. As is known, many Chinese traditional anti-diarrheal formulae such as Shenling Baizhu Powder, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Sijunzi Decoction, all of which contain Renshen and Baizhu, had been proved to possess the ability of alleviating CID [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, no study has determined if SZC (the form of compatibility of Renshen and Baizhu) exerts any therapeutic effect on CID. In recent years, gut microbiota has become an important frontier to reveal the therapeutic mechanisms of medicines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the therapeutic effect of SZC on CID based on gut microbiota.
