<p id="Par24" class="p">Gut microbiota, known as a complex ecological community colonized in human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, can interact with host factors to affect normal physiology and diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Healthy gut microbiota contributes to the metabolism of nutrition and drugs, structural integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier, immune regulation, and inhibition of pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Gut microbiota in the disordered state is likely to trigger many diseases, such as diarrhea [
