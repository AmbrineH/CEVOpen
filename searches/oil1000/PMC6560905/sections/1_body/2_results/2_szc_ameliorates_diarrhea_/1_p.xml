<p id="Par43" class="p">The mice were injected with 5-FU for 6 days during the treatment of SZC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). During the first 4 days, there was no significant difference in body weights among the control, model and SZC groups. Mice in the model group injected with 5-FU experienced weight loss compared with the control group from days 5–10, and had the lowest weight at the end of the experiment. Treatment with SZC significantly prevented weight loss in CID mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). From days 4–8, diarrhea rates increased in the untreated model group, while the clinical symptoms of diarrhea were not observed in the control group. At all time points, the diarrhea rates of the SZC group were obviously lower than those of the model group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). In addition, the thymus and spleen indexes in the model group decreased significantly after 5-FU chemotherapy, whereas SZC markedly inhibited the decreases of thymus and spleen indexes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d).
