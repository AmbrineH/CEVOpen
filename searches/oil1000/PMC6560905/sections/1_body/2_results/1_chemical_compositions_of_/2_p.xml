<p id="Par42" class="p">IR scanning results showed that both polysaccharides extracts of Renshen and Baizhu showed characteristic functional groups of polysaccharides (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c and d). The bands at 3524.26 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> and 3535.44 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> were due to O-H groups of polysaccharides from Renshen and Baizhu, respectively. The C=O groups in Renshen and Baizhu polysaccharides caused the increases of the absorption bands at 1741.45 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> and 1748.61 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>, respectively. In addition, the bands at 1158.56 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> and 1150.02 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> (polysaccharides of Renshen and Baizhu, respectively), which were also the characteristic absorption bands of polysaccharides, resulted from the stretching vibration of C-O in C-O-C cyclic ether.
