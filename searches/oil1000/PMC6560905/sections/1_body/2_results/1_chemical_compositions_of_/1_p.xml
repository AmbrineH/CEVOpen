 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, the quantitations of ginsenosides standards showed good linearities within 6.25–200.00 μg/mL. The compositions of ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rf, Rb1, Rc, Rb2 and Rd in total ginsenosides were 46.98 ± 0.25, 55.25 ± 0.66, 12.81 ± 0.11, 132.81 ± 0.96, 83.86 ± 0.39, 70.66 ± 0.34, and 31.61 ± 0.32 mg/g, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b, the five main constituents such as 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-eudesmene (3.82%), eudesma-3,7(11)-diene (12.49%), atractylone (51.67%), isopetasan (2.07%), and 1-methoxy-2-(1-methyl-2-methylenecyclopentyl) benzene (5.10%) were identified in essential oil of Baizhu. Atractylone was considered as the representative constituent of essential oil in Baizhu.
