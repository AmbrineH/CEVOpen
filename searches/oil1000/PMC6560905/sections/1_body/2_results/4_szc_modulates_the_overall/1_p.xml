<p id="Par45" class="p">To detect structural differences in gut microbiota between the three groups, a total of 883,537 sequences and an average of 58,902 sequences per group were obtained from the 15 samples. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a showed that the position of box diagram in species accumulation boxplot tended to be gentle as the increase of samples number, which suggested that samples number and species richness both were adequate and stable. At this sequencing depth, the overall bacterial diversity had already been covered. Then the sequences were clustered into OTUs at 97% similarity, and 935 OTUs in total were obtained from 15 fecal samples. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b, there were 424 OTUs in all three groups, and 17, 329 and 13 unique OTUs were detected in the control, model and SZC groups, respectively. Additionally, the model group showed a significant increase in the number of OTUs compared with the control group. But no significant difference of OTUs number existed between the control and SZC groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c). Consistent with the changes of OTUs, both ACE richness and Shannon diversity values of bacterial community were significantly increased in the model group. After the treatment of SZC, ACE richness and Shannon diversity values reduced to the normal levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d and e). NMDS plot showed that the structure of overall bacterial community in the model group was quite different from those in the control and SZC groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f). The clustering tree based on UPGMA also showed a significant separation in gut microbiota between the control and model groups. Notably, gut microbiota of mice treated with SZC did not significantly differ from that of the control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>g).
