<p id="Par46" class="p">The histogram of LDA value distribution showed that there were significant differences in dominant microbiota among the three groups (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). 1, 8 and 4 taxa of dominant communities were found in the control, model and SZC groups, respectively. 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales_S24-7_group</italic> was the dominant bacteria in the control group. The gut microbiota in the model group was dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotellaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Alloprevotella</italic>. Dominant microbiota in the SZC group included 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic>. An evolutionary branch graph based on LDA scores further revealed the important microbiota in the three groups. The results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales_S24-7_group</italic> was identified as the dominant bacteria in the control group. In the model group, predominant microbiota consisted of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotellaceae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic> were the predominant flora in the SZC group (Fig.
