<p id="Par47" class="p">Histograms with respect to phylum, family and genus were used to reveal the microbial species and their relative abundances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a–c). In fecal samples, 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> were the 3 dominate phyla, whose relative abundances were 77.62, 18.83 and 1.83% respectively in the control group. The abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> (26.41%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> (8.76%) increased in the model group, whereas the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> (61.75%) decreased. However, SZC treatment could restore the proportions of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> (80.54%), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> (11.74%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> (3.22%) after 5-FU chemotherapy. At family level, our result showed that relative abundances of families such as 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic> (8.19%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotellaceae</italic> (8.03%) significantly increased in the model group, compared with those (2.49 and 2.04%, respectively) in the control group. Moreover, SZC treatment significantly reduced the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic> (2.53%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotellaceae</italic> (2.87%).
