<p id="Par38" class="p">The genomic DNA of fecal samples was extracted by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After that, the concentration of DNA was detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. The V3–V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 341F–806R primer set. All PCR reactions were induced by High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, USA). PCR products were detected by electrophoresis with 2% agarose gel, and then purified by Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) was used to generate sequencing library. Library quality was evaluated on Qubit@2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Finally, the Library was conducted on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Novogene, Beijing, China).</p>
