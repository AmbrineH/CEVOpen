<p id="Par36" class="p">Both body weights and diarrhea states were recorded every day. For the diarrhea evaluation, the mice with moist and unformed stools, or perianal stains, were deemed to show the clinical symptoms of diarrhea. The calculation formula of diarrhea rates in each group was given as follow: the diarrhea rate (%) = the number of diarrheal mice/the number of mice × 100%. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, fecal sample (4 g) was collected in sterile plastic tube and stored at − 80 °C. All the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Then thymuses and spleens were removed after the sacrifice of mice. Thymus and spleen indexes of each mouse were calculated according to the following formula: thymus (spleen) index = thymus (spleen) weight/body weight (mg/g).</p>
