 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>], we chose the oral doses of ginsenosides and polysaccharides from Renshen as 126.7 mg/kg/d and 176.3 mg/kg/d respectively, and the oral doses of essential oil and polysaccharides from Baizhu as 35.3 μL/kg/d and 192.3 mg/kg/d respectively for mice. SZC was mixed in 0.1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution. Twenty-four mice were randomly assigned into three groups (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. The mice were orally administrated with SZC in a preventive mode on the first 2 days of the experiment, and then intraperitoneally injected with 5-FU (40 mg/kg/d) for 6 days. Mice in the SZC group were orally administrated with SZC half an hour before 5-FU chemotherapy. SZC treatment lasted until the 3rd day after the end of 5-FU chemotherapy. Mice in the control group received equal volume of liquid solvent for the whole 11 days, while the untreated mice in the model group received 5-FU chemotherapy on the 3–8 days.
