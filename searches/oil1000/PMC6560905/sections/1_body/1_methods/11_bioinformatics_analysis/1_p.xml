<p id="Par39" class="p">Paired-end reads of each sample were merged by FLASH (Version 1.2.7) to get raw tags. High-quality clean tags were generated from the strict filtration of raw tags by QIIME (Version 1.9.1). Final effective tags were produced after the removal of chimera sequences in the tags, which were detected by gold database (Version 1.9.1) and UCHIME Algorithm. The sequences at 97% identity were clustered into the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by Uparse (Version 7.0.1001). Then the representative sequence of each OTU was selected for the species annotation. MUSCLE (Version 3.8.31) was used for the multiple sequence alignments to get the phylogenetic relationships. The OTUs abundance information was normalized by the sequence number standard. ACE and Shannon indexes that respectively indicated richness and diversity of gut microbiota were calculated on QIIME (Version 1.7.0). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to detect the dominant bacterial community difference among groups. The lowest screening value of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in LEfSe software was defaulted to 4. Venn, LEfSe and Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) diagrams were built on R software (Version 2.15.3). Unweighted Pair-group Method with Arithmetic Means (UPGMA) Clustering was performed on QIIME software (Version 1.7.0).</p>
