<p id="Par32" class="p">Renshen powder (200 g) was refluxed 3 times by 60% ethanol (8 ×) for total 6 h. Then, the combined extracts were concentrated by vacuum-rotary evaporation. The concentrate was eluted by 70% ethanol on D101 macroporous adsorptive resin. All the collected eluents were concentrated, and then dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven. Final residue of ginsenosides (1.4 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL methanol and then filtered through a 0.45 μm filter membrane. Ginsenosides were characterized by HPLC (1260, Agilent, USA) with a C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., particle size 5 μm) (Cosmosil, Japan). The column was eluted at 35 °C with a detection wavelength at 203 nm and an injection volume of 10 μL. The flow rate of the mobile phase of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) was set at 1.0 mL/min. Gradient separation was based on the following: 0–10 min, 18–21% B; 10–20 min, 21–22% B; 20–30 min, 22–26% B; 30–40 min, 26–30% B; 40–55 min, 30–32% B; 55–75 min, 32–33.8% B; 75–90 min, 33.8–38% B; 90–105 min, 38–45% B; 105–110 min, 45–18% B. And the standard curves were obtained based on the absorbencies of different concentrations of standard ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rf, Rc, Rd, Rb1 and Rb2.</p>
