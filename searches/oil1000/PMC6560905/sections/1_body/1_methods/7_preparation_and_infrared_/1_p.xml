<p id="Par34" class="p">Renshen (200 g) or Baizhu (200 g) powder was refluxed by distilled water (10 ×) for 2 h. The procedure was repeated 3 times. Then these extracted solutions were combined, concentrated, and cooled (4 °C) for 12 h. The cooled concentrate solution was precipitated in 60% ethanol, and final residues were dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven. The characterization was carried out on a FTIR Spectrum (cary 660, Agilent, USA). Polysaccharides (1 mg) from Renshen or Baizhu were mixed with 150 mg KBr and homogenized by a pestle in the mortar. The mixture was then made by a hydraulic press into a slice, which was analyzed in IR at the wavenumber region from 400 to 4000 cm
