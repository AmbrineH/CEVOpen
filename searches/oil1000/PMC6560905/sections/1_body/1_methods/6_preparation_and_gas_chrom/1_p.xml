<p id="Par33" class="p">Baizhu powder (200 g) was refluxed by distilled water (10 ×) for 12 h. Final essential oil was gathered by steam distillation from the powder. Essential oil was characterized by GC-MS (GC 7890A and MS 5975C, Agilent, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a capillary column HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness 0.25 μm). The electron ionization system operated at 70 eV of ionization energy. Helium was used as the carrier gas. 1 μL sample (essential oil: n-hexane, 1: 100 dilution) was injected and the injector temperature was set at 230.0 °C. Initial oven temperature was set at 100.0 °C, then increased to 120.0 °C at the rate of 3.0 °C/min and held at 120.0 °C for 20 min, and finally increased to 220.0 °C at the rate of 3.0 °C/min. MS was recorded in the range of 35–550 m/z at the rate of 1.0 scan/s. Identification of different components in essential oil was based on the comparison with the known constituents that stored in National Institute of Standards and Technology Library (NIST14.0).</p>
