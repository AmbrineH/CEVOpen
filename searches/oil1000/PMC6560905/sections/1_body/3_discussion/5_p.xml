<p id="Par53" class="p">Although SZC could modulate gut microbial structure of fecal samples in CID mice, the specific relationship between the anti-diarrheal activity of SZC and gut microbiota remained undefined. For example, fecal collection in a non-invasive manner was chosen as the sampling method for gut microbial analysis. However, fecal communities may not completely represent bacterial communities living in intestines, although they play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and microbial diversity [
