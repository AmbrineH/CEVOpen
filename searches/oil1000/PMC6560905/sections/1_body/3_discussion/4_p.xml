<p id="Par52" class="p">Redundancy information uncovered the structural changes in the key phylotypes of gut microbiota based on the following classification: phylum, family and genus. Statistical results revealed that the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> significantly changed in the model group. But there was no difference between the SZC and control groups in the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic>. Also, mice in the model group significantly increased the abundances of some genera such as 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiumm</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Parabacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alloprevotella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic>, which might provide opportunities for the occurrence of diarrhea. For example, high-abundant 
 <italic class="italic">clostridium</italic> belonging to 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> is one of the causes of diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic> family and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum), a complex organism colonized in the gut, may be the key factor influencing the integrity and immune development of intestinal mucosa in the process of diarrhea. Increased 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> may alsoÂ induce inflammation or even carcinogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Parabacteroides</italic> in high abundance was found in immune-related diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">Alloprevotella</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Prevotellaceae</italic> family) is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli with the high relative abundance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Both 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> family) were associated with bloody diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> is commonly found in patients with malnourished and infectious diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. These above studies indicated that the growth of these genera (potential pathogens) was associated with diarrhea. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, SZC treatment reduced the abundances of these genera in CID mice. Therefore, our results suggested that SZC could inhibit the growth of potential pathogens and modulated microbial structure in the feces. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> is an important genus for relieving diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. On the contrary, no significant difference in the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> (probiotic) existed among the three groups, which was not in accordance with the results of 5-FU-induced decrease of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in the previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. The reason behind the difference might be that our results were based on fecal microbiota in mice, while the previous study focused on fecal microbiota in rats. Therefore, the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and CID still needs a deeper investigation. Conclusively, these results suggested that amelioration of CID with SZC treatment might be mainly mediated by inhibition of potential pathogens.
