<p id="Par50" class="p">Previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacological effects of Renshen and Baizhu were closely associated with gut microbiota. Renshen could effectively reduce body weight and change gut microbial composition in obese middle-aged Korean women [

 <italic class="italic">Bacillusbifidus</italic>, and fostering the normal gut microbiota in lincomycin-induced mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Therefore, SZC, a formula composed of active herbal extracts from Renshen and Baizhu, might exert potentially modulatory effects on gut microbiota. In addition, gut microbiota is a contributing factor of many diseases including diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Therefore, we further analyzed gut microbiota from the feces of CID mice.
