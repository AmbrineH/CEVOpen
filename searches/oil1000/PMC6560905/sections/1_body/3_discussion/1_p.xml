<p id="Par49" class="p">In this study, all the model mice showed the clinical symptoms of diarrhea. We also found that thymus and spleen indexes in the model mice decreased significantly compared with those of the control group. Thymus and spleen indexes, whose levels depend on the extent of lymphocyte proliferation, can be used to partly reflect host immune function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The results indicated that the immune system of the model group was affected by 5-Fu chemotherapy. In addition, some histological changes of colonic sections were observed in model mice. Especially, the numbers of goblet cells in the model group were remarkably lower than those of the control group. Goblet cells play important roles in producing and maintaining protective mucus blankets by synthesization and secretion of high molecular weight glycoprotein such as mucin. The reduction of goblet cell number could directly or indirectly impact intestinal health [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) were significantly alleviated by SZC, which indicated that SZC was effective in the treatment of CID. More importantly, the potential mechanism behind this anti-diarrheal effect of SZC needed to be investigated in this study.
