<p id="Par51" class="p">Gut microbial composition in fecal samples was determined by 16S rDNA Amplicon Sequencing. Species accumulation boxplot indicated that the species richness of gut microbiota was sufficient and stable for the following analyses when the total number of samples was 15 (

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d and e, gut microbial richness and diversity were significantly increased in the model group. In general, the richness and diversity of microbial populations should be reduced under a pathological condition. The possible cause behind our results was that the richness and diversity of original microbiota was not reduced, and some potential pathogenic bacteria was introduced or increased in CID mice. Our results also showed that microbial richness and diversity decreased to normal levels after SZC treatment. Furthermore, the remarkable differences of distance existed among the three groups in NMDS plot, but a shorter distance was presented between the control and SZC groups. UPGMA clustering showed no obvious structural shift between the SZC and control groups, whereas the gut microbiota in the model group significantly deviated from that of the control group. Taken together, these results demonstrated the overall structure of gut microbiota in CID mice could be reversed to normal by SZC treatment.
