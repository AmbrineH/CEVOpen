 <p> The effects of SZC on histological changes of colon sections in mice with CID (n = 8, male/femal = 4). ( a) Representative images of HE-stained colonic sections (200 × and 1000 × magnifications). ( b) Number of goblet cells in HE-stained colonic sections (1000 × magnification). Red arrows in colonic sections (200 × magnification) indicated amplified target areas of pictures, and red arrows in colonic sections (1000 × magnification) indicated damaged goblet cells. Data were presented as means ± SEM. * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with model, # P &lt; 0.05 and ## P &lt; 0.01 compared with control </p>
