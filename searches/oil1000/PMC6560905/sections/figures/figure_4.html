 <p> The effects of SZC on the overall structure of gut microbiota in mice with CID ( n = 5, male/femal = 2–3). ( a) Species accumulation boxplot was used for the estimations of samples number and species richness. ( b) Venn diagram indicated the overlap of OTUs in the feces. ( c) OTUs were clustered from high-quality sequences with 97% similarity. ( d– e) ACE and Shannon values indicated the bacterial community richness and diversity, respectively. ( f) NMDS plot showed distinct structural changes of the overall bacterial community in each group. ( g) UPGMA clustering was used to interpret the distance matrix of each sample by the average linkage. Data were presented as means ± SEM. * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with model, # P &lt; 0.05 and ## P &lt; 0.01 compared with control </p>
