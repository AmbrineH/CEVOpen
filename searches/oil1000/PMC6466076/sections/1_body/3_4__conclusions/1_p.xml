<p class="p">Our study provides evidence for the suitability of using PLM as a feed resource for animals. Throughout the experiment period, the inclusion of 15% PLM in the rabbit diet did not adversely affect growth performance, blood biochemistry, carcass traits, nutrient digestibility, and nutritional values. However, the inclusion of 30% PLM significantly reduced the digestible energy and NFE digestibility; nonsignificantly decreased growth performance; and did not negatively affect blood measurements, carcass characteristics, and digestibility of most nutrients. Therefore, the current study recommends the inclusion of 15% PLM in rabbit diets instead of alfalfa hay to achieve the maximum benefit. In addition, the populations of fungi and Enterobacteriaceae and total bacterial count in the feed, and populations of coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae and total bacterial count in the cecum content, were decreased in the rabbits fed diets containing PLM.</p>
