<p class="p">The results obtained by Guoqiang and Jianqing [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] showed that the contents of threonine, cystine, valine, methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine, and arginine in healthy paulownia leaves were 0.98%, 0.16%, 0.36%, 0.46%, 0.33%, 0.75%, 0.82%, 0.26%, and 0.85%, respectively. The findings of our study are partially similar to those of Guoqiang and Jianqing [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], especially with respect to the contents of methionine, phenylalanine, and arginine.
