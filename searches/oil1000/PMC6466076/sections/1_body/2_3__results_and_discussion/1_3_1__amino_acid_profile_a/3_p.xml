<p class="p">The mineral composition of PLM, alfalfa hay, and experimental diets is shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00095-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The analyses showed that paulownia has 0.36%, 0.16%, 0.07%, 0.28%, 7.27 mg/kg, and 2.29 calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, copper, and Ca/P, respectively. The value of manganese was 52.63 mg/kg in PLM and 30.67 mg/kg in alfalfa hay. The zinc content of PLM (132.92 mg/kg) was very high when compared with that of alfalfa hay (17.07 mg/kg). The mineral composition in all diets was nearly similar, except for zinc content (47.22, 63.97, and 80.73 mg/kg in the control, 15%, and 30% PLM diets, respectively). According to El-Showk and El-Showk [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], PLM is rich in minerals such as calcium (2.1%), phosphorus (0.6%), zinc (0.9%), and iron (0.6%). Moreover, the levels of heavy metals such as cadmium and lead in the paulownia leaves did not exceed noxious levels [
