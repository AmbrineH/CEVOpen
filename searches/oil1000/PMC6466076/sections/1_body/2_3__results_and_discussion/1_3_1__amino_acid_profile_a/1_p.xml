 <xref rid="animals-09-00095-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the amino acid compositions of PLM and alfalfa hay. The contents of tyrosine, methionine, and histidine were 3.6%, 3.0%, and 4.8% of CP in PLM and 3.1%, 1.0%, and 1.6% of CP in alfalfa hay, respectively. The contents of lysine, leucine, and isoleucine were 3.8%, 4.6%, and 4.0% of CP in PLM and 5.8%, 7.3%, and 4.7% of CP in alfalfa hay, respectively. The results revealed that threonine, phenylalanine, valine, cysteine, arginine, and total amino acids contents were nearly similar in PLM and alfalfa hay. The contents of all amino acids were similar in all the diets containing PLM and alfalfa hay.
