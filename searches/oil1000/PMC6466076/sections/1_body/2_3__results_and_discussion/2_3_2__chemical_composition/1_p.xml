<p class="p">When PLM is used in a complete rabbit diet, the nutrient composition of PLM is considered and mixed with appropriate feed ingredients to obtain a suitable diet formula that meets the nutritional requirements of rabbits. The nutrient composition of PLM, alfalfa hay, and experimental diets is shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00095-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The analyses indicated that the contents of CF, NDF, and ash were 23.87%, 40.47%, and 8.85% in PLM and 25.68%, 42.07%, and 11.67% in alfalfa hay, respectively. The content of EE was 3.84% in PLM and 2.33% in alfalfa hay. The CP content was nearly similar in PLM and alfalfa hay. Our findings are partially consistent with those of Stewart et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], who found that the NDF, CP, ash, and fat contents were 29%–55%, 14%–23%, 6%–9%, and 2%–4%, respectively, indicating that paulownia leaves have the potential to be a new feed ingredient for livestock. According to the analysis of El-Showk and El-Showk [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], paulownia leaves contain 22.6% CP and 7.8% ash. Moreover, according to the analysis of Koleva et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and Bodnár et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Paulownia elongata</italic> leaves can be used as a new feed ingredient in diets for ruminants and other herbivorous agricultural species such as rabbits and horses. In the present study, the content of all nutrients was nearly similar in the experimental diets containing PLM and alfalfa hay. 
 <italic class="italic">Paulownia</italic> species such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. fortunei, P. tomentosa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. elongata</italic> are palatable and have a good chemical composition and nutritional value suitable for animal feed [
