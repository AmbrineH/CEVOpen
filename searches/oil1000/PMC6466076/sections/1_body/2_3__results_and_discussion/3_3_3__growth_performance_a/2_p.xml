<p class="p">Initially, at 5–9 weeks of age, BWG was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.027) decreased because of 30% paulownia when compared with 30% alfalfa hay. The lowest FI value (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003) was detected in the rabbits fed the diet containing 15% PLM. The best FCR value was observed in the rabbits fed 15% PLM during 5–9 weeks of age, when compared with 30% PLM (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001). The decrease in BWG (with 30% PLM) and FI (with 15% PLM) during the first 4 weeks of the experiment (5–9 weeks of age) might be due to the slight bitterness of the PLM possibly affecting palatability, some pharmacologically active agents, or the organic matter (OM) being simply less digestible. Leaves of paulownia have been reported to be slightly bitter but palatable for some animal species such as sheep and cattle [
