<p class="p">During the overall experimental period, 5â€“13 weeks of age, there were no significant differences in the BWG, FI, or feed utilization among the experimental groups. Previous studies have reported many fodder trees and shrubs that may partially or completely replace concentrated rations without any detrimental effects on the digestion or growth of animals such as goats and sheep [
