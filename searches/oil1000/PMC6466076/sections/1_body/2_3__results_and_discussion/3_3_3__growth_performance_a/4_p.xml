An adequate number of dietary tree leaves could have a positive impact on the growth and carcass parameters of animals. Better feed utilization might be due to antimicrobial properties against several pathogenic microbes [

 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] stated that growing rabbits can use varying dietary levels of tree leaves up to 45% without any adverse impacts on the growth rate and organ and carcass characteristics. Adedeji et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found that the inclusion of 5%, 10%, and 15% tree leaves improved the performance of rabbits, although the feed consumption decreased.
