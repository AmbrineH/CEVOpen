<p class="p">The effects of dietary inclusion of PLM on DM, CP, CF, OM, EE, and NFE digestibility and TDN, DCP, and DE values of growing rabbits are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00095-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. No significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were observed in the nutrient digestibility, apart from NFE, because of the paulownia treatments. Inclusion of paulownia in the rabbit diets significantly reduced (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.028) NFE digestibility. As a result, decreased TDN and DE were observed when the animals were fed 30% paulownia foliage. Conversely, the inclusion of 15% paulownia foliage, when compared with alfalfa hay, in the rabbit rations did not affect TDN and DE. Our results are consistent with those reported by Juniar et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], who postulated that low levels of tree leaf meal have no adverse impacts on the digestion coefficient and even improve the feed conversion ratio. El-Gendy [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] observed that up to 30% 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia saligna</italic> leaf meal did not affect nutrient digestibility and N balance. Tree leaves can be used as a supplement to enhance feed utilization and animal performance or to replace traditional feeds to achieve safe and economic production [

 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Rubanza et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] found that nutrient digestibility was improved in animals fed tree leaves, and this improvement may be due to the high nutritional profile, especially CP, EE, NDF, acid detergent fiber (ADF), gross energy (GE), and amino acids. However, a berseem hay diet decreased the digestibility of organic matter (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.028), dry matter (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004), crude protein (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001), acid detergent fiber (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.011), and NDF (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.033); in addition, TDN (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.045) and DCP (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.041) were detected in the diets containing tree leaves [
