<p class="p">In contrast, Varlyakov et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] found that blood parameters were significantly affected by the dietary inclusion of paulownia in sheep diets. PLM increased the serum levels of total protein, albumin, and globulin. Furthermore, they showed that paulownia leaves have the ability to significantly reduce blood glucose levels [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. This discrepancy might be related to the differences in animal species or PLM inclusion level. On the other hand, herein, the HDL level was significantly increased in the rabbits that received the PLM diets (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.037), but LDL was decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.042) in those that received 30% PLM. Our findings are partially consistent with those of Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], who detected that the inclusion of 10% tree foliage in rabbit diets resulted in the lowest value of serum LDL when compared with the alfalfa group. These effects could be linked to the PLM antioxidant and antiperoxide activity [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] or the reduction of energy intake [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Our results suggested PLM dietary inclusion had no negative effect on blood biochemistry, so it could be used safely up to 30%.
