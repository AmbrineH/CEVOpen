<p class="p">The mineral contents (method 984.27) were analyzed using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer in the Central Laboratory for Food and Feed analysis (CLFF), Agriculture Research Center, Ministry of Agriculture, Cairo, Egypt. Amino acid analyses of PLM and experimental diets were performed using an automated amino acid analyzer after hydrolyzing the samples of paulownia leaves and diets with 6 M HCl at 110 Â°C for 24 h, according to Ogunbusola et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and the sulfur amino acids were estimated using the method of Bassler and Buchholz [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Tryptophan was not estimated because it is demolished through acid hydrolysis. Also, during sample preparation, glutamine is converted to glutamate and asparagine to aspartate, so the values mentioned for these amino acids (Glx and Asx) represent the sum of acid and amide.
