<p class="p">The chemical composition of PLM, alfalfa hay, and experimental diets were estimated using Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. All samples were analyzed in triplicate for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), and ash (methods 930.15, 954.01, 920.39, 978.10, and 942.05, respectively). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was also determined [
