<p class="p">Blood samples were collected from the sacrificed rabbits (five rabbits/group) in sterile tubes. The samples were coagulated and centrifuged (4000 rpm for 10 min), and the sera were stored till further analysis. The serum samples were used to estimate the level of albumin (g/dl), total protein (g/dl), urea (mg/dl), creatinine (mg/dl), total cholesterol (mg/dl), triglyceride (mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (mg/dl), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by using kits and a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).</p>
