<p class="p">At week 13, four rabbits from each group were randomly selected and individually distributed into metabolic cages for seven days for the digestibility trial. The feces were collected daily from each rabbit and weighed, and a 50% subsample was obtained, oven-dried at 60 °C for 24 h, and stored in the lab for chemical analysis. Samples of the diets and feces were chemically analyzed [
