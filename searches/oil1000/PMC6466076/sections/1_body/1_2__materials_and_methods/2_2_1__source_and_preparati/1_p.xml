<p class="p">Paulownia (
 <italic class="italic">Paulownia tomentosa</italic>) leaves were harvested and collected in October 2016. They were collected from 100 six-month-old trees in an orchard located in Bani-Salama Village, Wadi El-Natroun in Beheira Governorate, Egypt (30° 26′N 30° 14′E). The orchard has an area of two acres containing 2500 trees. About 4 kg of fresh leaves was collected from each tree. The average moisture content was 80.22%. The paulownia leaves were transported to the lab of the Animal Production Department, Agriculture College, Zagazig University for further processing. The leaves were dried, ground, and stored in airtight bags until further analysis (proximate and amino acid profile) and use. The paulownia leaves were ground using a grinding machine designed at the Department of Agricultural Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University for producing a nontraditional feed for growing rabbits to improve product quality. The highest values of machine productivity and overall machine efficiency were 435 kg/h and 90.60%, respectively. The optimum operating parameters of the milling machine were 1600 rpm drum speed by using a 450 kg/h feed rate of PLM.
