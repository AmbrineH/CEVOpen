<p class="p">However, to date, there is limited information on the optimal use of paulownia leaves as an animal feed resource to overcome the shortage of protein sources for livestock animals. In this study, paulownia leaf meal (PLM) was used as a novel feedstuff to replace alfalfa hay as a high-quality forage in the diet of growing rabbits. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of PLM as a nontraditional feed on the growth, carcasses, nutrient digestibility, blood chemistry, and intestinal microbiota of rabbits.</p>
