  <p class="p">Paulownia trees are grown as a woody biofuel crop, and they yield large amounts of leafy biomass rich in nitrogen. However, there is limited information on the use of paulownia leaves as an animal feed resource. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the effects of paulownia leaf meal (0%, 15%, and 30% in diets) on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, and intestinal microbiota of growing rabbits. The chemical analyses of paulownia leaves indicated that most of the nutrients are similar to those in alfalfa hay. The in vivo results showed that the use of up to 15% paulownia leaf meal instead of alfalfa hay in the diets of the rabbits did not have any negative effects on their performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood constituents. In addition, a notable reduction in both cecal and feed pathogenic bacteria was observed when paulownia leaf meal was included in the diets.</p>

  <p class="p">This experiment was conducted to study the effects of paulownia leaf meal (PLM) as a nontraditional feed on the growth, carcasses, digestibility, blood chemistry, and intestinal microbiota of growing rabbits. Sixty rabbits (5-weeks old) were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments containing three amounts of PLM (0%, 15%, and 30%). The results showed that PLM has a higher content of ether extract, organic matter, methionine, tyrosine, histidine, manganese, and zinc than alfalfa hay. Body weight gain decreased when 30% PLM was provided. The best feed conversion ratio was recorded in the rabbits fed 15% PLM. A notable increase in high-density lipoprotein levels with a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein was noted in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Total fungi and Enterobacteriaceae and total bacterial count in the feed were significantly reduced because of PLM. In the cecum, coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae species, and total bacterial count declined in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Conclusively, up to 15% PLM can be used in rabbit diets without any deleterious effects on the performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood constituents. In addition, dietary inclusion of PLM has the potential to reduce cecal pathogenic bacteria in rabbits.</p>
