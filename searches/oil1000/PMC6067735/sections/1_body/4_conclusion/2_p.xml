<p class="p">The aquafeeds industry will use microalgal co-product as a nutrient source only if it is a highly digestible ingredient that improves feed conversion ratios and reduce nutrient loads in fish culture effluents [

 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. As we mentioned earlier, microalgal co-product also needs to become cost-competitive with conventional protein sources for aquaculture feeds. Fortunately, innovative business models by leading microalgae companies are emerging to meet this challenge [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. These include multi-product “biorefinery” approaches, such as Cellana LLC’s current business model, which is anchored by high-value omega-3 supplements and high-value inks, allowing for flexible pricing of the microalgal co-products for aquafeeds and other commodity feed, food, and fuel applications (Martin Sabarsky, personal communication).
