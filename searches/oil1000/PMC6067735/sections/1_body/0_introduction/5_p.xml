<p class="p">Marine microalgae show promise as alternative aquafeed ingredients that can improve environmental sustainability and human health benefits. Marine microalgae production offers several advantages over terrestrial crops: improved land and water-use efficiency due to higher yields per unit input, no need for freshwater and arable land, and lower greenhouse emissions [

Moreover, microalgal co-product, the protein-rich biomass left over after extracting oil for biofuel and nutraceutical products, is increasingly available and shows promise as a lower-cost replacement for conventional protein ingredients in tilapia feeds [

For the research presented in this paper, Qualitas Health, Inc. gave us a microalgae co-product, leftover from the companyâ€™s large-scale production of nutraceuticals. Integrating such industrial co-products into aquafeed could lower feed prices and provide an additional revenue stream from algae biomass and biofuel/ nutraceutical production. Several investigators showed the possibility of commercializing co-products as promising cost competitive protein-rich ingredients for animal feed [
