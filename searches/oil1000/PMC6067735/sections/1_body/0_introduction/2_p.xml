<p class="p">Sustainable expansion of aquafeeds, among other things, necessitates finding alternatives to fishmeal and fish oil because of environmental, food security, and financial drawbacks of these ingredients. Aquaculture uses 70% of global supplies of fishmeal and fish oil, making it the largest consumer of these commodities [

Diversion of small ocean fish to fishmeal and fish oil production erodes human food security because currently a quarter of the worldâ€™s commercially caught fish, 20 million tons of ocean fish, is directed away from human consumption every year, and instead, is used for fishmeal and fish oil production for other animal feeds [

More than 90 percent of these small, wild marine fish are considered food grade and could be directly consumed by humans, potentially creating an important source of nutrition for impoverished, food insecure people in developing countries [
