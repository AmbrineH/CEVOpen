<p class="p">These drawbacks of fishmeal and fish oil have motivated aquafeed producers to reduce their use of forage fish via partial substitution of fishmeal and fish oil with terrestrial plant ingredients [

Methionine is the major limiting amino acid in soybean meal and lysine is the major limiting amino acid in cornmeal when these cropmeals are included in aquafeeds [
