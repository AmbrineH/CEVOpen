Tying aquacultureâ€™s rapid growth to terrestrial staple crop feed inputs exacerbate existing environmental problems; i.e. the expansion of industrial terrestrial-crop (soy, corn) agriculture sectors which have had sizable contributions to both biodiversity loss and climate change [

Thus, unbalanced essential amino acids, low levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and high levels of anti-nutritional factors limit the inclusion rates of terrestrial plant ingredients, even in diets for omnivorous species like tilapia [
