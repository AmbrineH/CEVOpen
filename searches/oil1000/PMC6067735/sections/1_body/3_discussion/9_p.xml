<p class="p">Consistent with many aquaculture studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], we found that dietary fatty acid composition was mirrored in the fatty acid profile and composition of edible fillet tissue of Nile tilapia. Similar levels of fish oil, total n6 PUFA and total n3PUFA in all formulated diets (Tables
