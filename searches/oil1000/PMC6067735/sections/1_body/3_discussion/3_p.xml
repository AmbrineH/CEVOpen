<p class="p">Our digestibility results are promising with respect to higher digestibility of lysine, which is one of the most deficient amino acids in terrestrial protein used for aquaculture feed. Algal biomass could be a desirable source of EAAs in aquaculture feeds, as well as other animal feeds [

 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. If algae biomass is produced and made available in larger quantities, it could become cost competitive or cheaper than crystalline amino acid supplementation, provided it shows adequate digestibility in the farmed animals. For Nile tilapia, we observed significantly lower ADCs of methionine in
