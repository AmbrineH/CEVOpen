<p class="p">Our digestibility study found that 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product is a highly nutrient-dense feedstuff compared to 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> whole cell and offers the highest digestibility of lysine, an essential amino acid that is often deficient in terrestrial crop meals used in aquafeeds. We also detected the highest 20:5 n-3 EPA digestibility in co-product (97%), indicating that it would be a good candidate for EPA supplementation in tilapia diet formulation. Results show that, even though 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product contains higher amounts of protein compared to 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> whole cells, co-product had significantly lower digestibility values for crude protein than whole cells. Results from our nutritional feeding experiment showed, compared to the control, good growth, feed conversion, and survival of tilapia fed a diet replacing 33% of fish meal with 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product and decreased fish performance at higher inclusion levels. These findings indicate a need to improve nutrient digestibility in order to achieve a higher replacement level. This is the first report of effects of different inclusion levels of a micro-algal co-product in tilapia diets.
