<p class="p">These growth experiment results provide the first report on effects of inclusion levels of a microalgal co-product in tilapia feed. A few studies have examined microalgae co-products in feeds of other aquaculture species. Sørensen et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] reported that the co-product of 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis oceania</italic> can be used at modest inclusion levels, around 10%, without negative effects on the performance of Atlantic salmon. Kiron et al. (2012) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] reported no reduction in weight gain of Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) fed diets in which whole and lipid-extracted algal meals replaced 5 or 10% of dietary protein from fishmeal. The same authors reported that 25–40% protein replacement with two algal co-products (
 <italic class="italic">Nanofrustulum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Tetraselmis</italic>) was possible in common carp and 
 <italic class="italic">Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>. Patterson and Gatlin (2013) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] reported that co-product from 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis salina</italic> could replace up to 10% of crude protein from fishmeal and soy protein concentrate without causing significant reductions in juvenile red drum performance. Our results and these prior studies suggest that lower trophic level aquaculture species (tilapia, carp, shrimp) perform better on higher dietary inclusion rates of micro-algal co-product than do higher trophic species (salmon, red drum).
