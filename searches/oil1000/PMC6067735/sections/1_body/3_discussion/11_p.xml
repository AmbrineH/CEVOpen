<p class="p">The limited published data on elemental composition of microalgae whole cells and co-product indicate that essential minerals (e.g., Ca, Mg, P, and K), and certain trace elements (e.g., copper and manganese) are generally found at higher levels in microalgae than terrestrial feed ingredients [
