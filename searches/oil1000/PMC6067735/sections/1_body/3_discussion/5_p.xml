<p class="p">Results of the 84-day growth experiment using 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product showed that replacing 33% of fishmeal with 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product achieved final weight, weight gain, percent weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) that are comparable to the reference diet (Nanno0) but that higher inclusion levels lowered these fish performance measures. Higher inclusion levels of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product, however, did not depress feed conversion (FCR), feed intake (FI), and fish survival, given that we observed no significant differences among the diets. Also, tilapia showed high palatability to 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product diets, feeding equally well on these diets as on the reference diet (Nann0, 7% fishmeal by weight).
