 <xref rid="pone.0201315.t012" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 12</xref> shows no significant differences in fillet macro mineral composition but some differences in fillet trace element composition among dietary treatments. With respect to trace elements, concentrations of iron in the fillet of tilapia fed the Nanno66 and Nanno100 had significantly higher levels compared to fish fed the Nanno0 and Nanno33 diets. The fillet zinc concentration of Nile tilapia fed Nanno100 had significantly higher levels compared to fish fed the other diets. Concentrations of manganese in the fillet were significantly lower in fish fed Nanno100 compared to Nanno0, Nanno33, and Nanno66 diets. Concentrations of Cu, S, and, Mo in whole body and fillet were not significantly different (
