<p class="p">The fatty acid profile of the fillet tissue of tilapia fed the experimental diets reflected the dietary fatty acid content of the corresponding feed (

Similarly, the total saturated fatty acid (SFA), composition of SFA fractions, total MUFA, and most MUFA fractions did not differ across treatments. However, the concentrations of 16:1n7 were significantly affected by dietary treatments, as fish fed the Nanno100 diet displayed the highest concentrations, which was directly related to the 16:1n7 content in experimental diets (
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Amounts of major n3 and n6 PUFA deposition in the fish fillet (mg/g fillet) were not significantly different among the four dietary treatments (
