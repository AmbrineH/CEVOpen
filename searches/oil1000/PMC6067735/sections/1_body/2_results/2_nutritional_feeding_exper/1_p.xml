 <xref rid="pone.0201315.t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref> summarizes the results of the 84-day growth experiment we conducted to test effects of replacing different percentages of dietary fishmeal with 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product. Results showed comparable final weight, weight gain, percent weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) Nanno0 diet and Nanno33 diet; and lower performance at higher 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product inclusion levels. We found no significant differences in feed conversion (FCR) and feed intake (FI) among the diets. Tilapia appeared healthy at the end of the experiment with survival rates ranging from 94 to 98% among all diet groups, with no significant difference in survival rates. Also, the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> whole cell and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product diets showed high palatability to tilapia, who fed equally well as on 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic>-based diets as the reference diet.
