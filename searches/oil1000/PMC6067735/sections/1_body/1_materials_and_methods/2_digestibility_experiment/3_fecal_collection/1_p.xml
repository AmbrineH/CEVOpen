<p class="p">We collected whole fish fecal strands twice daily, before the morning feeding and before the afternoon feeding, for 30 consecutive days, from an undisturbed fecal collection column affixed to the bottom of each tank [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We rinsed uneaten feed residues out of the fecal collection column after each feeding. In order to collect feces, we sealed off the bottom of the tank from the collector via gate valve, gently removed the full column, and then extracted settled feces using electronic pipetting (Eppendorf Easypet
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Serological Pipette Dispenser) before placing samples in 50 ml Falcon tubes (BD Falcon
 <sup class="sup">™</sup>). We allowed approximately 10 minutes to settle the fecal samples to the bottom of each Falcon tube before discarding supernatant water with the pipette and then froze the tubes at -20 °C. We pooled fecal samples by tank for the duration of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, we lyophilized, finely ground, and stored samples at -20°C for proximate, amino acid and fatty acid analysis.
