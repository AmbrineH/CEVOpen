<p class="p">The experiment employed a completely randomized design of three diets x four replicates (tanks). We used twelve static-water 114-L cylindro-conical tanks fitted with feces settling columns [

 <italic class="italic">niloticus</italic>) from Americulture Inc. (Animas, New Mexico, 88020, USA) were randomly assigned to tanks at a rate of 10 tilapia/tank, with a mean weight of 30 g/fish. We maintained a photoperiod cycle at 10 h light and 14 h dark and fed them the reference diet during a seven-day acclimation period. After randomly assigning the three diets to twelve tanks, we acclimated fish to experimental diets for seven days before initiation of feces collection. We hand-fed fish two times daily between 0930 and 1700h using restricted pair feeding to supply the same quantity of dietary nutrients to the groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. We collected uneaten pellets directly after each feeding to minimize potential artifacts in the fecal samples, and we monitored water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen, ammonia and nitrite levels daily to maintain favorable conditions for tilapia. We replaced 50% of tank water, if total nitrogen or nitrite reached above 3.0 mg L -1 or 0.025 mg L -1 respectively, or twice per week. Water temperatures were kept within 27.0–28.0°C using a Finnex (HMA-100) 100watt immersion heater.
