Trypsin inhibitor was analyzed in the New Jersey Feed Laboratory, Inc. (Ewing, NJ, USA). Trypsin inhibitor activity was determined via AOCS method Ba 12–75 [
 <xref rid="pone.0201315.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. This method is a spectrophotometric determination after an incubation of the sample. A defatted gram sample was extracted with 50 ml 0.01N NaOH for 3 hrs. An aliquot of this suspension was taken and diluted so that it inhibits approximately 40–60% of the trypsin available during the analysis. 2 mls of this suspension was incubated at 37 deg C for ten minutes after 2 mls of a trypsin solution and 5 mls of a BAPA (benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-niroanilide.HCl) solution are added to it. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1 ml 30% acetic acid at the end of the ten-minute period. Sample and reagent blanks are also prepared. The resulting sample solutions were centrifuged 5 minutes at 10K ppm and measured at 410 nm on a spectrophotometer. The reported result was expressed in TI units per gram. We detected lectin content at Environmental Measurements Lab, Dartmouth. Lectin content was analyzed using an erythrocyte agglutinating assay that measured hemagglutinating units per milligram dried
