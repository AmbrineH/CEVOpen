 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> whole cell and co-product samples were analyzed in the Department of Earth Science at Dartmouth College for minerals analysis. 100 mg of each sample was acid digested in 0.5 ml 9:1 HNO3/HCl in an open vessel digestion with heating at 105 Â°C for 1 hr. The samples were diluted to 10 ml in DI water prior to analysis. All measurements were recorded gravimetrically. Digested samples were run by ICP-MS analysis using an Agilent 7700x with collision (He) and reaction (H
