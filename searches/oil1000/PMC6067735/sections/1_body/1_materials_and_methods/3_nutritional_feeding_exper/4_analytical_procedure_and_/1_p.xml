<p class="p">We determined effects of different 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">oculata</italic> co-product replacement levels on growth and survival by quantifying final weight, weight gain, weight gain percentage, feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival rate. Calculations for these indices are as follows (Sarker 2016b; Sarker et al. 2012): Weight gain = (final weight—initial weight/initial weight) x 100; FCR, feed conversion ratio = feed intake/weight gain; protein efficiency ratio; SGR (%/day) = 100 x (ln final wet weight (g)—ln initial wet weight (g))/Time (days), PER = weight gain (g)/protein fed (g); and Survival rate (%) = (final number of fish/initial number of fish) x 100. Proximate, amino acids, and fatty acids of the samples were analyzed as described above for the digestibility experiment.
