<p class="p">We weighed and sampled fish at the beginning of the experiment. Prior to commencing the feeding trial, we euthanized 20 fish from the stock, ground these fish into a homogeneous slurry, freeze-dried, reground, and stored at -20°C for whole-body proximate and fatty acid composition analysis. At week 12 of the experiment (terminus), 10 fish were removed from each tank and were immediately euthanized by single cranial pithing [

We freeze-dried the remaining 5 fish from each tank, finely ground and stored the samples at -20°C until whole-body carcass analysis.
