<p class="p">We used a completely randomized design of four diets x three replicates (tanks). Six hundred juvenile tilapia (mean initial weight 5 g) were randomly assigned to groups of 50 fish per tank, bulk-weighed and placed into twelve, 100 gal fish tanks, with each fish tank belonging to a recirculating aquaculture system module (RAS module). Stocking density (&lt;0.25lb/gal, 80 gal of rearing water/tank) and water quality parameters in the RAS modules were maintained to ensure maximum growth of tilapia. Each RAS removed suspended solids and maintained acceptable ammonia-nitrogen and nitrite levels via bacterial nitrification in a BioClarifier bubble bead filter. We monitored water quality daily and did maintain favorable conditions for tilapia across all RAS modules and kept water temperature within 27.7 ± 0.09°C [

The range of values for other variables were pH 7.8 ± 0.2, dissolved oxygen 7.48 ± 0.18 mg L- 1, nitrite 0.09 ± 0.06 mg L- 1, and total ammonia nitrogen 0.24 ± 0.06 mg L- 1. We performed backwashes on each RAS module weekly to keep nitrates within acceptable levels &lt;150 mg L -1.
