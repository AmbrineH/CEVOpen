<p class="p">We maintained all fish with the control diet for one week to adapt them to feeding and handling practices. We administered feed at a rate of 10% of body weight per day for the first 3 weeks, 8% of body weight until the 6th week, 6% of b.w. until the 9th week, and 4% of body weight until the 12th week [

We bulk-weighed and counted the fish in each tank at 3-week intervals and adjust the feeding rate accordingly. For 24 hours prior to the weighing procedure we withheld food to avoid an increase in ammonia excretion due to handling.
