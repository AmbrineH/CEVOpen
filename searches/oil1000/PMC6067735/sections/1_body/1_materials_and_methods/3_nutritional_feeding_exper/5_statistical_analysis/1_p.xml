<p class="p">We conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of apparent digestibility coefficients for macronutrients, fatty acids and amino acids in the reference and test diets, as well as for test ingredients. We then conducted ANOVA of growth performance and feed utilization parameters, whole body proximate composition, and fillet fatty acids composition and, when significant differences were found, compared the treatment means using Tukeyâ€™s test of multiple comparisons, with a 95% confidence interval. We carried out all statistical analyses using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program for Windows (v. 21.0, Armonk, NY, USA).</p>
