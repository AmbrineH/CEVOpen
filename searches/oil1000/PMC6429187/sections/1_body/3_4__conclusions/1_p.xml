<p class="p">The optimization of EDS oil yield SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction parameters used OAD method. The maximum EDS oil yield was achieved at 30 MPa, 50 °C, 150 min and 80 mesh. Compared with SE and CP extraction methods, SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-extracted EDS oil presented better physicochemical characteristics (higher linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, γ-tocopherol, γ-tocotrienol and total phytosterols content). Furthermore, the antioxidant ability of EDS oils obtained by different extraction methods were tested by DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. There were no significant differences on the antioxidant ability of EDS oil extracted by different methods. Above all the results, SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-extracted EDS oil has properties of antioxidant and health-caring with development potential for human health and functional food industry.
