<p class="p">Total tocopherols and tocotrienols content were measured by a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2487 ultraviolet detector set at an absorbance of 290 nm and a Luna Silica column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm particle size) used at 35 °C. The test method was improved based on the method Boso et al. [
