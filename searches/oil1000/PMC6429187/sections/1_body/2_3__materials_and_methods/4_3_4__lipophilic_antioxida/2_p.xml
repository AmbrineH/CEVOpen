 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. GC/MS analysis was performed using an Agilent DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The initial oven temperature was held at 200 °C for 0.5 min then raised to 300 °C at 10 °C/min for 20 min. The transfer line temperature and ion source temperature were 280 °C and 250 °C, respectively. A sample injection of 1 μL was performed in a split mode of 100:1 at 250 °C. Detection was performed in the full scan mode from
