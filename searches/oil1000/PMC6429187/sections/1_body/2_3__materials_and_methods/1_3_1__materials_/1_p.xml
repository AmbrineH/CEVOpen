 <italic class="italic">E. mollis</italic> Diels seeds were collected from Linfen, Shanxi Province, China in July, 2017. The seeds used in the experiments were ground into powder in a grinder mill (JP-3000C, Jiupin Instruments Co., Ltd., Yongkang, China) for around 1 min, and passed through 40, 60, 80 and 100 mesh sieves respectively. The seed moisture was determined by an infrared moisture analyzer (MA35M, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). The result showed that EDS moisture was 8.49 Â± 0.021 wt.%. The total oil content of seed was measured by Soxhlet extraction (SOX406, Hanon Instruments Co., Ltd., Jinan, China) which was 32.85%.
