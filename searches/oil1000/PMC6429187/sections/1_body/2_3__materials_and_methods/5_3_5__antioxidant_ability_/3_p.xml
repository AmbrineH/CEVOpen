<p class="p">Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of EDS oils was determined following the method performed by Kaur [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The reaction system (10 mL) contained 1 mL (9.0 mM) FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>·7H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O solution, 1 mL (8.8 mM) H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution and 1 mL (9.0 mM) salicylic acid ethanol solution with 7 mL oil sample (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/mL). After incubation at 37 for 30 min, the absorbance was measured at 510 nm on a spectrophotometer. The inhibition percentage of hydroxyl radical assay was calculated as the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">% hydroxyl radical inhibition ratio = (A
  <sub class="sub">C</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">S</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">C</sub> × 100%
  <label class="label">(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> represents the absorbance value of control sample, and A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub> represents the absorbance value of the oil sample.
