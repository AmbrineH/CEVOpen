<p class="p">The DPPH radical scavenging ability of EDS oil was tested according to the method described by Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] 2 mL, 0.2 mM methanolic DPPH solution was mixed with EDS oil that diluted in isopropanol. The reaction was kept for 30 min in the dark and measured the absorbance at 515 nm on a spectrophotometer. The inhibition percentage of DPPH was calculated as the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">% DPPH radical inhibition ratio = (A
  <sub class="sub">C</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">S</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">C</sub> × 100%
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> represents the absorbance value of control sample, and A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub> represented the absorbance value of oil sample.
