 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction was performed with a Waters SFE 500 device (Shanghai, China) equipped with a 500 mL extraction vessel, high pressure pump and automated temperature regulator. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00911-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> displays a scheme of a lab supercritical fluid extractor. In all experiments, around 120 g samples were used. The SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow rate was 40 g/min constantly. During all the experimental extraction process, the extraction pressure, extraction temperature and extraction time were controlled by regulating the adjusting valves on the equipment panel. When the extraction time was achieved, depressurizing the SF-CO
