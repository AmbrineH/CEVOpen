<p class="p">All the EDS oil samples were converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) according to the method used by Bimakr [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Then the analysis of fatty acid composition was performed by gas chromatography (GC-2010PLUS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a TR-FAME (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column and flame ionization detector (FID). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was set as 60 °C for 3 min initially, then was raised at 5 °C/min to 175 °C and held at that for 15 min. Finally, the oven temperature increased to 220 °C at the rate of 2 °C/min and held for 10 min. Fatty acid composition was identified by comparing the retention time in samples to the FAMEs standard mixture which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). Each and total fatty acid were quantified as percentages which were calculated by the normalization method.
