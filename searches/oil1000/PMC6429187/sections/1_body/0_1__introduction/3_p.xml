<p class="p">Oil seeds of plants are usually extracted with organic solvents such as 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, ethyl ether and petroleum ether or mechanical pressing. However, solvent extraction requires long time, and the following separation at high temperature has negative impact on oil quality, especially the sensory quality. Mechanical pressing methods have limited application because the oil yield is low, although oil quality is great [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is known as a fast and efficient method for the extraction of various compounds from plant materials. SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the most common supercritical solvent since it is odorless, colorless, safe, inexpensive, nontoxic, recyclable and environment-friendly. In addition, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can evaporate immediately when exposed to atmospheric conditions, thus the extract of SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is free from chemicals and thermal degradation compounds [
