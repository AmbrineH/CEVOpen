<p class="p">Optimization of the extraction conditions is a critical step to develop a successful process. Selection of diverse variables including extraction pressure, temperature, time and pretreatment of raw materials is an important factor affecting the final composition of the extract and the process efficiency of SFE. In addition, the dissolving capacity of SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is changing with the variation of the extraction pressure and/or temperature, which means that SFE is a tailored extraction method for desired compounds while leaving undesirable compounds behinds [

In order to obtain optimal SFE conditions for EDS oil extraction, we have employed the orthogonal array design (OAD) procedure. OAD is one of the simple and systematic approaches for designing an experiment with less experimental runs [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Thus, OAD is possible to reduce the time and cost for the experimental investigations [
