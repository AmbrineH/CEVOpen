 <italic class="italic">E. mollis</italic> Diels seed (EDS) is a good edible oil resource with high vitamin E levels and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Thus, due to its composition and related properties, EDS oil could be used in pharmaceutical and functional food applications. Recently, many attempts have been made to investigate the health benefits of EDS oil such as hypolipidemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activity. Therefore, EDS has drawn increasing interest in recent years as a promising oil resource. However, no reports were found in the literature on the oil content and the composition of EDS extracted by supercritical CO
