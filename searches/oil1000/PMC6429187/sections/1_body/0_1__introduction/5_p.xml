<p class="p">The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of extraction pressure, temperature, time and seed particle size on the EDS oil yield. OAD was employed to optimize extraction conditions for the maximum EDS oil yield. Furthermore, the fatty acid composition and antioxidant activity of the EDS oil obtained under optimized conditions were determined and compared with those obtained by the SE and CP method. The antioxidant activity of extracted oil was determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and hydroxyl (â€¢OH) radical scavenging test. The overall aim of the study was to provide a reliable and theoretical basis for the commercial exploitation of EDS.</p>
