<p class="p">The effects of four SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction parameters, namely extraction pressure (A), temperature (B), time (C) and particle size (D) on the oil yield were investigated by single factor experiment method. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00911-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, with the increase of extraction pressure from 20 to 35 MPa, the oil yield improved significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The pressure above 35 MPa would lead to more energy consumption and less equipment safety. Thus, the extraction pressure was set from 30 to 35 MPa. The oil yield was the highest when the extraction time and temperature was 150 min, 55 °C respectively. Considering the SFE efficiency, energy consumption, and equipment security, 150 min and 55 °C were deemed the best extraction time and temperature for the optimization of SFE conditions. The oil yield increased with the decrease of particle size. However, if the particle size was too small, the equipment pipeline would be jammed seriously result in the decrease of EDS oil yield. Thus, the 80 mesh was deemed best for the optimization of SFE conditions.
