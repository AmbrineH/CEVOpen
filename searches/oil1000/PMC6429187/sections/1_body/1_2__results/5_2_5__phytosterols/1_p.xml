Lupeol is the second richest phytosterol accounting for 15–22% of total phytosterols in EDS oils which was found for the first time in EDS oils. Lupeol is one of the triterpenoids which exhibit a broad spectrum of relevant clinical activities, such as antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antimicrobial [
