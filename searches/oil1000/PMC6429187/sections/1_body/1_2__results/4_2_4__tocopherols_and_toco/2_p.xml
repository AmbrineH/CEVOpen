 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> reported the concentration of tocopherols and tocotrienols in EDS oil samples obtained by three methods. There were three isoforms (α, γ and δ) of tocopherols and tocotrienols in EDS oils. In all oil samples, the content of tocopherols, which accounted for 85% of total content, was higher than the content of tocotrienols. The total tocopherols and tocotrienols content of SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-extracted EDS oil was 96.24 ± 3.01 mg/100 g, which was the highest among the three extraction methods. γ-Tocopherol was the richest tocopherol, while δ-tocopherol was the lowest. The content of α-tocopherol in EDS oils was almost twice that of δ-tocopherol. These results were different with data previously reported by Liang et al., who reported that the total content of tocopherols ranged from 119.6 to 128.60 mg/100 g [
