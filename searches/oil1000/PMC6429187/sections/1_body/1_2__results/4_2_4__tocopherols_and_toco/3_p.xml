<p class="p">Besides, it was the first time to determine the content of tocotrienols in EDS oils. The concentration of total tocotrienols in EDS oils extracted by different methods had no significant differences. However, there were some differences among the content of each tocotrienol in the EDS oils obtained by different extraction methods. SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracted EDS oil was enriched in γ-tocotrienol, followed by α-tocotrienol and δ-tocotrienol. For EDS oils extracted by SE or CP, α-tocotrienol content was the highest followed by δ-tocotrienol and γ-tocotrienol.
