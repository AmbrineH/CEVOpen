<p class="p">The fatty acid analysis of EDS oil performed by GC-FID showed that EDS oil has a high content of linoleic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Kan et al. reported that the main fatty acids present in EDS oil were linoleic acid (44.7–54.8%), oleic acid (33.6–40.6%) and palmitic acid (3.1–5.5%) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, some minor differences in fatty acids were observed, that may depend on many factors, such as the geographical origin, climate, soil composition and especially extraction method. The unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) extracted by optimized SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction (91.89% of total fatty acid) was higher than those extracted by SE (85.16% of total fatty acid) and CP (90.92% of total fatty acid). Although the composition of fatty acids varied among the three extraction methods, the content of UFAs was approximately 90% which means the EDS oil must be prevented from contacting with air to oxidation when it is stored. This work showed that EDS oil is a great source of linoleic acid (C18:2 n-9, 12) and oleic acid (C18:1 n-9), accounting for up to 50% and 30% of total oil which obtained by different extraction process. The content of essential fatty acids (EFAs), namely linoleic acid (C18:2 n-9, 12) and linolenic acid (C18:3 n-9, 12, 15) in EDS oil obtained by optimized SF-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction method was the highest. These two EFAs are necessary to support normal cell functions, promote disease prevention and may even be useful for disease treatment [

However, the composition of fatty acids in EDS oil was similar with that in walnut oils from Serbia. It was reported that linoleic acid (57.2–65.1%), oleic acid (15.9–23.7%), linolenic acid (9.1–13.6%) and palmitic acid (6.3–7.7%), and the PUFAs, MUFAs and SFAs in walnut oil ranged in 67.4–75.7%, 15.9–23.9% and 8.3–9.4%, respectively [
