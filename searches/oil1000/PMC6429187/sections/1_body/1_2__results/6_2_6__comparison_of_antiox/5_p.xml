<p class="p">According to many references, the antioxidant activity of some vegetable oils might be related to their natural antioxidant concentration, especially lipophilic antioxidant compounds such as tocopherols, tocotrienols and phytosterols with antioxidant activity (in both the DPPH and hydroxyl radical assays). A Pearson correlation analysis was performed, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, there were significant correlations between antioxidant ability and beneficial lipophilic antioxidant compounds content in EDS oils [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. There were significant correlations between lipophilic antioxidant compounds and antioxidant capacity of the EDS oils assessed by DPPH and hydroxyl radical assays (
 <italic class="italic">r.</italic> 0.728–0.915, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Thus, the above-mentioned compounds in EDS oils may have essential impact on its antioxidant ability. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, the total tocopherols and tocotrienols content correlated to DPPH and hydroxyl radical values were higher than that of total phytosterols content. This represented that tocopherols and tocotrienols play a more important role than phytosterols in antioxidant capacity of EDS oils. Besides, the lupeol content correlated to DPPH and hydroxyl radical values was the highest (
 <italic class="italic">r.</italic> was 0.886 and 0.791, respectively) in all phytosterols. The possible reason we suspected was that there was a unsaturated side chain of lupeol positioned at C-21. The correlation value of γ-tocopherol content to DPPH and hydroxyl radical was the highest, which demonstrated that γ-tocopherol was the most important antioxidant in EDS oil.
