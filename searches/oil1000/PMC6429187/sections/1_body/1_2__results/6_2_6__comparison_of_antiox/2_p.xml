<p class="p">The antioxidant properties of EDS oils have been described by some authors. Kan et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00911" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] investigated the radical scavenging activities of three kinds of EDS oils by DPPH assay, the cold-pressed EDS oil showed the highest radical scavenging effects (around 60% when the concentration was 20 mg/mL). These results are different our study, the Soxhlet-extracted EDS oil showed the antioxidant activities valued 75.38% in DPPH assay under the same concentration. These differences would be explained by the different regions of raw materials and the different chemical compositions of EDS oil obtained by different extraction methods.
