<p class="p">The free radical scavenging capacity of EDS oil extracted by different methods was assessed by DPPH and hydroxyl radical assays. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00911-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the antioxidant activity of EDS oils was dose-dependent with the experimental concentration range both in DPPH and hydroxyl radical assays. This indicated that DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was proportional to the increase of sample concentration. For DPPH radical scavenging activity, the IC
