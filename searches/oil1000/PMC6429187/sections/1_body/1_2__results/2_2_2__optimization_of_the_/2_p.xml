 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> revealed that the extraction time significantly affected the EDS oil yield. The best extraction conditions were approximated by taking the level of each factor giving the maximum extraction. The optimum SFE parameters for achieving the maximum extraction yield of EDS oil were 30 MPa, 50 °C, 150 min and 80 mesh. Under such optimal SFE conditions, the extraction yield of EDS oil was tested by confirmation experiments repeated three times. The practical EDS oil yield was 28.32 ± 1.155%, which indicated that the process was reliable and effective.
