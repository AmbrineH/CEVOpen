 <sub class="sub">9</sub> matrix nine experiments were conducted, and the corresponding oil yields are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The assignment of the factors and their levels is also shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. For each factor, the mean values of K at different levels and the range (R) were also shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00911-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. It was used to evaluate the effects of each factor on oil yield. The highest extraction yield was obtained in run number 6 (28.02%) at 32.5 MPa, 50 °C, 180 min and 100 mesh. Moreover, in run number 9, the extraction yield was the least (24.29%) at 35 MPa, 60 °C, 120 min and 100 mesh. The oil yield varied significantly with the changing of operating conditions. Statistical analysis showed that the effects of various factors on the extraction process followed the order C &gt; D &gt; A &gt; B; the effect of extraction time on the extraction process was the greatest, followed by particle size, extraction pressure and then extraction temperature.
