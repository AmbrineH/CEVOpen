 <p class="p">The study determined the chemical constituents and anti-inflammatory effects of leaf oil from
  <italic class="italic"> Cinnamomum subavenium</italic> (CS-LO) that has been used in folk medicine to treat various symptoms including inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of the oil were evaluated by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and the Carr-induced hind mouse paw edema model, respectively.
  <italic class="italic"> In vitro</italic>, nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>), TNF-
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
  <italic class="italic">β</italic> were significantly decreased by CS-LO, and the expression of nuclear factor-
  <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B (NF-
  <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B) protein was blocked as well. In
  <italic class="italic"> in vivo,</italic> the malondialdehyde (MDA) and paw edema levels were decreased by CS-LO, and the same result came up on the NO and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) of serum at the 5th h after Carr injection. In addition, iNOS and COX-2 immunoreactive cells of the paw tissue were decreased significantly by CS-LO (200 mg/kg) in histological examination. The present findings indicated that CS-LO have anti-inflammatory properties, and the effects might be caused through inhibiting iNOS, COX-2, TNF-
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-1
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>, and IL-6 expression via affecting NF-
  <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B pathway, which will provide a power scientific basis for CS-LO to be used as the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
