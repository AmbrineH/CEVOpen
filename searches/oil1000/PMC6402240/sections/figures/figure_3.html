 <p> Effect of CS-LO on LPS-stimulated protein expression of NF- κB p65 (a, b) in RAW 264.7 cells. The NF- κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (10 µM) was used as a positive control. β-actin was used as an internal control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD for three different experiments performed in triplicate. ## p &lt; 0.01 as compared to the control group. ∗ P &lt; 0.05, ∗∗ P &lt; 0.01, and ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 compared to the LPS-treated cells alone. </p>
