<p class="p">The constituents of essential oil were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MS is equipped with Polaris Q quality selective detector in electron collision ionization mode (70 eV). The chromatographic column was an RTx-5 (25 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m), kept 1 minute at 80°C to 200°C at 4°C/min, and kept 5 minutes. The temperature of injector was 250°C, the helium gas flow rate was 10 mL/min, and the split ration was 1:10. Manual injection of diluted samples (1.0
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l, 1/100, v/v, ethyl acetate) was in nonshunt mode. The major chemicals of CS-LO were identified by comparison with standard products and retention indices based on their mass spectral fragmentation in The Wiley GC-MS library. The amount of compounds was determined by Peak area of integral spectrograms.
