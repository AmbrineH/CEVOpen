 <sub class="sub">7</sub>, 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.9), 100 mM b-glycerophosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and one protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)] and incubated on ice for 0.5h. The collected supernatants were rapidly frozen. The concentration of the proteins was detected using the BCA method. After denaturation, the proteins of the cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, they were incubated with blocking solution (5% skim milk) for 12 h at 4Â°C, and then incubated with primary antibody for 4 h. After washed with Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (TBST), the blots were incubated with a dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed again with TBST and then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. The quantities of western blot were made by measuring the relative intensity contrasted with the control using Kodak Molecular Imaging Software.
