<p class="p">Male Wistar rats (180–220 g), two months old, were provided by the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All animals were kept under 23–25°C conditions and 12 hours of light/12 hours dark cycles. The experiments and animal maintenance followed the animal care and use guidelines of the Institute's Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The Wistar rats, injected with 1% Carr (50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) in the plantar side of right hind paws by 30min in advance, were administered with CS-LO (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.), Indo (10 mg/kg, p.o.), and the vehicle (pure water + CMC 0.5%). The volume of paw was measured using a plethysmometer (model YLS-7B, Zhong Hao, Peking, China) before Carr injection and every hour after administration of the edematogenic agent for 5 h. The degree of edema (%) was measured by the ratio ((V1−V0)/V0), where V0 is the normal volume before injection, and V1 is the pathological volume after Carr injection. Finally, the rats were sacrificed; the collected blood and Carr-induced edema feet were stored at -80°C until analysis.
