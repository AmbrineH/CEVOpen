<p class="p">NO production was measured by the nitrite levels of the cultured media and serum based on the Griess reaction [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in 0.2 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL LPS with different CS-LO (2.5, 5, and 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) for 18 h. Then, the collected medium was mixed with the same volume of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% phosphoric acid). 15 min incubation later, the absorbance was detected at 540 nm using Micro-Reader. RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS and CS-LO were incubated with DAF-FM (10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>M) diacetate at 37°C for 1 h, and the production of NO was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The production of PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was quantified with the Prostaglandin E2 Express EIA Monoclonal Kit. IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> were quantified with their ELISA kits under the manufacturer's instructions.
