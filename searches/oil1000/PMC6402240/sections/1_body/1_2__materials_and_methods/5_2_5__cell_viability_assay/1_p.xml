<p class="p">The RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from Cell Culture Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with FBS (10%), streptomycin (100 mg/Ml), and penicillin (100 U/mL) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and were subcultured every 3 days. The CS-LO was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with culture medium to target concentration. RAW 264.7 cells (1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>) in 96-well plates were treated with 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL of CS-LO in LPS at 37°C for 24 h. Adding MTT solution to every well, the cells were incubated for another 4 h at 37°C. And then, the medium was discarded; the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
