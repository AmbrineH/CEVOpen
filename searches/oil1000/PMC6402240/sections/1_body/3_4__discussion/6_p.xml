<p class="p">NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B plays an important role in regulating immune system and inflammatory processes. Activated NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B regulates the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, such as iNOS, COX-2, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>Bp65, a signal for NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B activation, played an important role in the regulation of its transcriptional capacity. Once the NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>Bp65 is activated and phosphorylated, it could promote proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Therefore, NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B signaling pathway is considered to be a therapeutic route against inflammatory diseases. Our findings suggest that CS-LO suppressed the nuclear translocation of p65 in a concentration-dependent manner (
