<p class="p">Previous studies had demonstrated the bioactivity of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic>. For example, Wang et al. demonstrated the stems of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> had good pigmentation inhibitory abilities [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Cheng et al. found that the leaves and stems of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> had antioxidative activities [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Ho et al. reported that the leaf oils of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> had good antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Chen et al. reported the extraction of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> leaves had inhibition to various cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. So in this study, we analyzed the leaf oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> by GC-MS, and anti-inflammatory effects with LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and Carr-induced paw edema in mice.
