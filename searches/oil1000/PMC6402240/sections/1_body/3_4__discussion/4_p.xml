<p class="p">The proinflammatory cytokines NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> plays important roles in inflammatory diseases. NO is an endogenous free radical substance synthesized from â€‰
 <sub class="sub">L</sub>-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in various animal cells and tissues [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX), which has COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms. Therefore, the inhibition of NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is an effective strategy for inhibiting inflammation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Our result showed that the production of NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was significantly inhibited by CS-LO (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">1(b)</xref>); we also found that CS-LO downregulated iNOS and COX-2 with immunohistochemical staining (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(h)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(l)</xref>). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of CS-LO may due to its inhibition of NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> via blocking the expression of iNOS and COX-2.
