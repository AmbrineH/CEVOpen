<p class="p">Carr-induced paw edema could cause the peripheral release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in tissue [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]; it is a common model to study inflammation. After administrating with Carr, the edema will rise to the high level, PGE2, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, and NO will be released during 1–5 h, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) will be produced by free radical attack on the membrane [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Edema and MAD are important criteria to evaluate anti-inflammatory activity of natural products [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Our results showed that CS-LO significantly decreased the paw edema at 5 h after treatment with Carr (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(a)</xref>), the MDA level was also significantly decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(b)</xref>). These findings indicate that CS-LO has a potent anti-inflammatory activity
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic>. NO, PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> play an important role in inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our results revealed that CS-LO decreased the NO, PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> level after treatment with Carr (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4(c)</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4(d)</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4(e)</xref>). We also found that CS-LO downregulated neutrophils with H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and TNF-a by CS-LO in macrophages, suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of CS-LO might due to its suppression of NO, PGE
