<p class="p">The effects of CS-LO on acute inflammation were tested with the Carr-induced paw edema model. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(a)</xref>, there was a dose-related inhibition of CS-LO to hind paw edema. Especially at 200 mg/kg, CS-LO significantly inhibited (p &lt; 0.01) the development of Carr-induced paw edema. Indo (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the Carr-induced paw edema as well.
