<p class="p">The toxicity of CS-LO was determined in RAW 264.7 cells by MTT assay; the result is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Cell viability did not change at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL of CS-LO. These results suggest that there were no toxic to RAW 264.7 cells under 40 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL of CS-LO. Therefore, CS-LO (2.5-10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) was used in the subsequent experiments.
