<p class="p">NO production may reflect inflammation; the effect of CS-LO on LPS-induced NO in RAW 264.7 cells was assessed. After treatment with CS-LO and L-NAME (NO inhibitor), the level of NO in RAW 264.7 was evaluated. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2(b)</xref>, there was a concentration-dependent inhibition in NO production. The group treated with 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/L CS-LO (p &lt; 0.01) was highly decreased compared to the LPS-alone group, and L-NAME (100 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>M) also have a significant inhibition on the NO in RAW 264.7 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Moreover, the image of confocal laser scanning microscopy indicates that the NO production was also suppressed by CS-LO (
