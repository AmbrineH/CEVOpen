<p class="p">PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is another important mediator in inflammatory responses. Decreasing the PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production would be an effective strategy for suppressing inflammation. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(b)</xref>, PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was inhibited by CS-LO. Especially, there was a significant inhibition on the expression of PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at the 10
