<p class="p">MDA was measured to evaluate the ability of CS-LO to radicals. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(b)</xref>, there was a higher level of MDA in paw tissue at 5 h after Carr injection (p &lt; 0.01). However, dose-related inhibition of the MDA level was observed in paw tissue at 5 h after treatment with CS-LO (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg); CS-LO at 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly decreased the MDA level in the paw tissue (p &lt; 0.01), the same with Indo (10 mg/kg) (
