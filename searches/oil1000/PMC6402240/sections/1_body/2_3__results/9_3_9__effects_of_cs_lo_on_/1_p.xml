<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(c)</xref>, at 5 h after treatment with Carr (p &lt; 0.01), the NO level increased significantly in the serum of rats. However, the inhibition of CS-LO to NO in the serum of rats was found with a dose-dependent manner, and 200 mg/kg of CS-LO significantly reduced the NO level in the serum (p &lt; 0.01).
