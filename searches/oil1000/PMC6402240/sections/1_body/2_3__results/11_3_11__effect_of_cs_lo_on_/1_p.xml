<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(e)</xref>, the PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> level in the serum increased significantly at 5 h after treatment with Carr (p &lt; 0.01). However, CS-LO decreased PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the serum with a dose-dependent manner, and CS-LO (100 and 200 mg/kg) highly inhibited the level of PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (p &lt; 0.01).
