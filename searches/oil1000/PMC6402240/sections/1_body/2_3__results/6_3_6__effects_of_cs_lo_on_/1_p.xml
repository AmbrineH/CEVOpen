<p class="p">The NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B transcription factor plays a key role in the expression of some cytokines and inflammatory enzymes, such as iNOS, COX-2, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, and IL-6. To determine whether CS-LO affects NF-кB pathway, NF-кB p65, a major subunit of NF-кB, was assessed in the presence or absence of CS-LO using western blot. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3(b)</xref>, the expression of NF-кB p65 was increased significantly with absence of CS-LO in RAW 264.7 cells. However, the p65 (
