<p class="p">In summary, CS-LO showed potent anti-inflammatory properties. These activities may be due to the effects of minor components or synergetic effects of the components. The current study also demonstrated that CS-LO not only inhibited iNOS and COX-2 expression and the subsequent production of NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> but also reduced the expression of IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α in vitro</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the inhibition of CS-LO was related to inactivation of NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B. The results of this study indicate that the leaf essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> is a potential anti-inflammatory agent. The Conclusions section should clearly explain the main findings and implications of the work, highlighting its importance and relevance.
