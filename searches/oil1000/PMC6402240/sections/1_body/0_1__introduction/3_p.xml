 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum subavenium.</italic> Miq. belong to lauraceae family, which are popular in China, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Burma [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Its peel, fruit, and leaves have been used in folk medicine for treating stomachache, carcinomatous swelling, abdominal pain, chest pain, hernia, rheumatism, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Recently, researchers have reported that
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium </italic>has potent cytotoxic effects in some tumor cell lines, including urothelial carcinoma cells, colorectal cancer cells, skin cancer melanoma cells, human bladder cancer cells, human lung cancer cell, and human prostate cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Moreover, the leaf oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> has potent antioxidant and antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. But, the anti-inflammatory activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> has not been report so far. Therefore, the objectives of our study were to investigate the major chemical composition of leaf oil from
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium</italic> using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and assess the anti-inflammatory activities of the leaf oil from
 <italic class="italic"> C. subavenium </italic>(CS-LO).
