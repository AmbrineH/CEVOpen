 <p class="p">The potential of fluorescence spectroscopy has been utilized for the characterization of three types of canola oil samples: the first type was obtained by dissolving its seeds in hexane solvent, the second by cold press method, and the third from eight commercial brands. Fluorescence spectra from all samples have been acquired by using excitation wavelengths from 280 to 420 nm with step of 10 nm to investigate their valuable ingredients. The emission bands at 375, 525 and 673 nm that represent vitamin E/beta-carotene and chlorophyll, are present only in canola oil samples extracted by chemical and cold press methods and absolutely absent from all commercial brands. The emission band at 440 nm appearing only in the commercial oil brands, is assigned to oxidized products of isomers of vitamin E and fatty acids. In addition, the effect of temperature on the canola oil extracted by cold press method has been investigated which showed that up to 180
