<p class="p">A set of self-written codes in MatLab (MathWorks release 2014a) have been used for pre-processing of all the fluorescence spectra to remove unwanted noise and for the vector normalization. The pre-processed data have been used in producing spectral plots for comparison. A chemometric technique, called principal component analysis (PCA), has been applied on all the spectral data through a built-in routine in MatLab for classification. The principal component analysis (PCA) is the unsupervised chemometric technique that differentiates the samples on the basis of their similarities and differences by plotting them along the orthogonal axes in the form of components called PCs. These PCs are orthogonal vectors, i. e. not corelated to each other. Therefore, when both are plotted against each other as scatter plot, data of both PCs cluster separately.</p>
