<p class="p">The fluorescence spectra of all canola oil samples using different exciting wavelengths in the range 280–420 nm have been acquired by a spectrofluorometer system FluoroMax-4 (Horiba Scientific, Jobin Yvon inc, USA). The system was controlled by a software fluoroEssence
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> operating within the Window’s environment. A continuous 150 W ozone free xenon arc lamp is used as the excitation source and the photomultiplier (R928P) was used as the detector. Fluorescence spectra of all samples were acquired by pouring samples in a cuvette through right-angle geometry with an acquisition time of 1 sec. Spectroscopic analysis of the emission spectra shown in

Both selected wavelengths produced maximum spectral information about samples.
