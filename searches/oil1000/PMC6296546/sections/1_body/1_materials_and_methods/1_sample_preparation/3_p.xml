<p class="p">In subcontinent, a generally opted cooking method is described below. At the begging of cooking, an appropriate amount of oil, crushed onion, ginger and garlic are poured into a cooking pot which is heated by a gas burner or an electric stove until onion turns light brown. The temperature of mixture was monitored by a K-type thermocouple that measures temperature directly with an accuracy of ±2°C. It was found that temperature of mixture in cooking pot remains between 100 and 110 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C and it took 5–10 minutes to turn whole mixture to light brown. The cooking time may depend upon amount of food stuff and supplied heat. At this stage, a small quantity of water was poured in the pot so that the above described mixture was just immersed, along with appropriate quantities of other food items including green/red chili, tomato, coriander and turmeric are also added. Then the whole mixture was cooked for 5 minutes by tightly fixing the lid of the pressure cooker. After 5 minutes, lid was opened and the mixture was further fried for 5–10 minutes until oil got itself separated from the mixture. The temperature of mixture remained around 100°C due to water content. When all mixture got fried, water content reduces which causes the temperature of mixture to increase up to 115°C. Further heating causes the mixture to burning. At this stage when oil got separated itself from the mixture, vegetable or meat are added and cooked. The whole procedure took around 20 minutes where temperature remains between 100 and 115°C.
