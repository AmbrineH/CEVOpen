<p class="p">First type of canola oil sample was extracted in the laboratory by dissolving crushed canola seeds in hexane solvent (Sigma-Aldrich). Canola seeds were crushed in mortar and pestle. The mixture was left for three days during which seeds dissolved completely in hexane. The mixture was then filtered through Whatman qualitative filter grade-1 (Sigma Aldrich) to get clean canola oil. It was further placed in a glass beaker with open lid at room temperature which varied from 25 to 35 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C in summer at Islamabad for a week to evaporate hexane completely. The second type of oil sample was obtained by cold press mechanism in the laboratory. The clean canola seeds were poured in a stainless-steel cylinder which has a hole in the bottom, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. When bolt shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> is screwed down, it presses canola seeds slowly to extract oil which is collected in the beaker. The hole is covered with a stainless steel mesh to stop crushed residues coming out from the hole with oil. This extracted canola oil through cold press method may be called virgin oil.
