<p class="p">Fluorescence spectroscopy along with chemometric analysis have been employed to study the effect of extraction methods on the nutritional values of canola oil. It has been found that canola oil extracted by cold press method is rich with fat soluble vitamins, vitamin E, beta carotene and chlorophylls. Similarly, chemically extracted oil possesses almost same molecular composition as that of cold press but the refining processes destroy its nutritional values. Therefore, if chemically extracted oil is not refined through the processes described in the text then the end users can enjoy its natural ingredients. In addition, it seems difficult to find the origin of commercial brands named as canola oil, as their spectra reflect only oxidized products. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the heating of cold pressed canola oil up to 180°C, does not lose most of its valuable ingredients. Therefore, it can be used safely for cooking of foods where usually temperature remains between 100–115 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C. In addition, present studies suggested that cold pressed canola oil can be used safely without destroying much of its valuable ingredients for frying of egg which needs temperature range 140–160°C and deep frying of meat and fish that needs temperature of oil around 180°C.
