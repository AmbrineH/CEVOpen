<p class="p">The PCA scatter plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref> shows that chemically extracted and cold press canola oil samples are clustered towards positive side of PC1 with a clear separation between them, depicting that they have some dissimilar chemical compositions. The difference in the concentration of beta carotene and chlorophyll contents may be the basis for their separation along PC2 axis. It is also evident that commercial canola oil samples along with vitamin E closely clustered in a line along PC2 axis towards negative side of PC1 axis which confirms that all the commercial canola oil brands are different from each other but have similar chemical composition but completely different from cold press and chemically extracted oil. Spectra of vitamin E lies very close to the commercial brands 5 &amp; 8, which means that these brands may have been added by synthesized isomers of vitamin E.
