<p class="p">For detailed spectroscopic investigations, three type of oil samples were excited with the two wavelengths of 330 and 410 nm. Both excitation wavelengths were selected because they yield maximum spectral information from the samples. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>, which shows a comparison of fluorescence spectra of vitamin E, commercial canola brands, canola oil extracted chemically and by cold press method when excited by a wavelength of 330 nm. It shows the emission bands at 375, 525, 673 and 725 nm, which are common in oil samples extracted chemically and by cold pressed [

However, they contain oxidized products which came up with emission at 440 nm. The emission band at 375 nm shows high intensity in cold press samples as compared to chemical one. Both bands at 525 and 673 nm show more concentration of vitamin E and beta carotene and chlorophylls contents in chemically extracted canola oil as compared to cold pressed.
