 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 420 nm. Surprisingly, the emission bands at 375, 525, 673 and 725, which have been assigned above were completely absent from the commercial canola brands. However, the emission band centered at 440 nm as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref> shows emission spectra of canola oil extracted by cold press and put in evidence four prominent emission bands centered at 370, 520, 673 and 725 nm and their molecular assignments have been discussed earlier. The emission bands at 375 and 525 nm in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref> for cold pressed canola oil are shifted at 370 and 520 nm in chemically extracted oil. The shifting of spectra may be attributed to matrix effects of oil samples extracted by different methods. However, fluorescence spectra of chlorophylls fluoresce at the same spectral positions as described above. The intensity of emission band centered at 520 nm increases for λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> range 340–380 nm, it approaches maximum at λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 380 nm and reduces for λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> range 390–420 nm and become minimum at λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 420 nm. The intensity of emission band at 673 nm increases with the increase of excitation wavelength which means that chlorophylls contents fluoresce more for longer excitation wavelengths and show maximum intensity at λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 420 nm.
