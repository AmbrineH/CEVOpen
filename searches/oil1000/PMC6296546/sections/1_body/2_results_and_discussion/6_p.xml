<p class="p">In order to further investigate the commercial brand samples in more detail, their fluorescence spectra were acquired with Î»
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> 330 nm and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>. All commercial brands show a broad band roughly centered at 440 nm, assigned to oxidized products as described earlier, but the maxima of two bands are at little bit different spectral positions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B</xref> shows the interspecies PCA classification, where the clustering of commercial brands at different positions in close vicinity illustrated that they contain different concentrations and types of oxidized products, which is also evident from spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>. Therefore, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> confirms that commercially available canola oil samples are treated with almost same processing technologies possibly at very high temperatures that lead to their thermal oxidation and consequently to the destruction of valuable natural ingredients, which have been described earlier.
