 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9C</xref> also shows that heating the cold pressed oil samples start to deteriorate its natural ingredients like vitamin E, beta carotene, essential fatty acids and chlorophylls which reflect the changes at 375, 435, 470 and 520 nm, respectively, and it increases with rise of temperature and heating time. Consequently, it can be inferred from the above discussion that heating of cold pressed canola oil during extraction and refining processes at ultra-high temperatures leaves it with no natural color (beta-carotene &amp; chlorophyll), fatty acids and vitamin E contents which is evident from
