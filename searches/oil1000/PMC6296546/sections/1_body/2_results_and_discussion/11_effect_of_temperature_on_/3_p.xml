<p class="p">It is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g008" class="xref">Fig 8A</xref>, that up to 180°C, no appreciable spectral changes occur in cold pressed canola oil samples. However, there is a trend of separation in heated samples which can be clearly seen. Above 180°C primary to secondary oxidized products start to appear [
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], which reflect themselves as change in band intensity and shape. The intensity of band at 375 nm shows a gradual decrease due to oxidation of essential fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids and this band totally disappears at temperature of 200 and above at 250°C. Emission band at 525 nm, representing vitamin E and beta carotene, shows an increase in its intensity with the rise of temperature above 150°C, possibly due to oxidation of these nutritional ingredients. On the contrary, emission band at 673 nm, representing chlorophylls, shows gradual decrease in its intensity with the rise of temperature. However, from 180 to 200°C, quantity of secondary oxidized products increases and consequently leading to the destruction of vitamin E, beta-carotene and chlorophylls contents which disappeared completely at 200°C, a temperature less than its smoke point [
