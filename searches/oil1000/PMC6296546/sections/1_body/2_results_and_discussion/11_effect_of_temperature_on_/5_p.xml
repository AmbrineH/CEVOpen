<p class="p">The PCA classification code is based upon the loading vectors associated with principle components. Loading vectors give the spectroscopic reasoning of classification of data. The PCA code basically calculates the maximum variance between two set of data, therefore, to explain the classification based on loading vectors, the PCA was applied on the spectra of non-heated and heated cold pressed canola oil samples heated at 100°C. The spectra of both samples are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9A</xref>, and the PCA scatter plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9B</xref> and their loading vectors in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>). The excitation wavelength of 330 nm has been used for recording emission spectra from non-heated and heated oil sample at 100°C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9A</xref> shows intensity variations in the emission bands at 375, 435, 470, 520 and 673 nm. It evidently shows that heating the cold pressed oil samples, even at comparatively low temperatures, induces small spectral variations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9B</xref> illustrates that the non-heated oil samples are clustered in the positive side and heated at 100 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C in the negative side of the PC1 axis. Same observation is evident from the corresponding loading plots shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9C &amp; 9D</xref>. It follows that from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g009" class="xref">Fig 9C</xref>. Evidently both samples are well separated which is due to maximum variance in PC1, which is 79% and 17% in PC2. However, when it is applied on more than two different samples, it can illustrate the trend of separation between all data based on their spectral dissimilarities.
