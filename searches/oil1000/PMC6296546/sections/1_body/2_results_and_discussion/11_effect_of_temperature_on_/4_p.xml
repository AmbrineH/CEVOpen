 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g008" class="xref">Fig 8B</xref> shows the PCA scatter plot between PC1 (87% variance) and PC2 (7% variance) which are produced from the emission spectra of heated and non-heated cold pressed oil samples when excited at 330 nm. Cold press oil samples heated up to 180°C, are clustered towards positive side of the PC1 axis while samples heated at 200 and 250°C are clustered towards negative side. It also shows that up to 180°C, there is a small separation trend between non-heated and heated samples which shows that heating influences the chemical composition of oil samples. Above temperature of 180°C, heated samples got separated completely, showing prominent spectral variations due to change in their molecular composition, which is evident from

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g008" class="xref">Fig 8C</xref> shows fluorescence spectra of heated and non-heated cold pressed oil samples using exciting wavelength at 410 nm. Intensity variations can be observed at emission band of 525 and 673 nm as a function of temperature. These two bands totally disappear with the formation of a broad band at 490 nm at temperatures of 200 and 250

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g008" class="xref">Fig 8C</xref>. It shows that along PC1 axis, oil samples heated up to 180°C are clustered towards positive side with minimum separating trend putting in evidence that heating induces minute spectral variations up to this temperature. The samples heated at temperatures of 200 and 250°C cluster towards negative side of PC1 axis and far away from each other which means that they are not only different from each other but also totally different from rest of all samples. The visual look on the displayed heated samples in

It means that the heating of cold pressed canola oil up to 180°C, does not lose most of its valuable ingredients. Similarly, temperature of 160°C has been recommended for frying of egg in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) [
