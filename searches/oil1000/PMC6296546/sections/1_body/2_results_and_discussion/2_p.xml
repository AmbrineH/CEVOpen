<p class="p">It is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> that all commercial brands bear very light color and are almost transparent, while oil extracted by chemical method bears yellow and by cold press bears yellow greenish color. Visually all types of canola oil samples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> can be differentiated, but visual inspection cannot ultimately certify the best one. Therefore, in order to evaluate the three types of canola oil samples shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, their emission spectra were recorded by using excitation wavelengths from 280â€“420 nm and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, which shows that the emission spectra of commercial brand-2 are entirely different from cold pressed and chemically extracted. The spectra displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref> evidently shows emission bands at 375, 525 and 673 and 725 nm which appeared in canola oil extracted by chemical method. Commercial brand-2 was randomly selected for different experiments described in the text.
