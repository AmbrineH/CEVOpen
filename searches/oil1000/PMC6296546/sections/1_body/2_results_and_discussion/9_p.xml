 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref> shows a comparison of emission spectra of three types of oil samples excited at λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 410 nm. It shows the intense emission bands at 460, 525 and 673 nm. Bands at 525 and 673 nm are present only in samples extracted chemically and by cold press while emission band at 460 nm is present only in commercial brands. The emission band at 440 nm appeared at the shifted wavelength of 460 nm when excited with λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 410 nm. The band cantered at 460 nm is assigned to oxidized products in cited literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The band at 673 nm, labelled for chlorophylls shows almost same spectral intensity in chemical and cold press samples. The fluorescence band at 525 nm, assigned to beta carotene and vitamin E shows a little more concentration in chemically extracted oil samples.
