<p class="p">To investigate the origin of emission band at 440 nm, different aliquots of commercial brand-2 were heated at temperatures of 100, 150, 200 and 250°C for 30 minutes each. The spectra of heated, non-heated and synthesized vitamin E were recorded by using λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> of 330 nm and are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref>, which shows that the isomers of vitamin E also fluoresce at 440 nm and this band is also reported for oxidized products of vitamin E [
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] but spectral shape of vitamin E is little bit different from others. As reported in the literature, vitamin E fluoresce at 375 and 525 nm [
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], this means that the isomers of vitamin E which fluoresce at 440 nm may have different isomers. Regarding the emission band at 440 nm, literature suggested that it is assigned to oxidized products of essential fatty acids and isomers of vitamin E [
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0208640.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. It is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref> that there are some little spectral variations in heated commercial oil samples in comparison with non-heated samples and prominent intensity variations can be observed above a temperature of 200 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C. These spectral variations can be better visualized by chemometric analysis, which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B</xref>. It shows the PCA scatter plot between PC1 (92% variance) and PC2 (6% variance), which classifies the samples on the basis of spectral variations induced due to heating at different temperatures for same time period.
