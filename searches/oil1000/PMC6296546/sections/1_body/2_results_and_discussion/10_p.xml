 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g006" class="xref">Fig 6D</xref> shows the PCA scatter plot between PC1 and PC2 which depicted a clear separation of all three types of oil samples. Commercial brands are clustered towards negative side of PC1 axis and show a separating trend along PC2. This trend of commercial oils highlights that they are slightly different from one another, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>. While cold pressed and chemically extracted oil samples clustered towards positive side of PC1 clearly separating from each other. This behavior shows that the cold pressed and chemically extracted oil samples show nearly similar composition in comparison with commercial brands, but they are also slightly different from one another.
