<p class="p">It evidently shows that samples heated up to a temperature of 200°C clustered closely on the positive side of the PC1 axis near to non-heated canola oil samples and samples heated at 250°C clustered on the negative side of the PC1 axis clearly far away from all the rest. However, the trend of clustering of heated samples show that commercial oil samples heated from 100–200°C are not much different from one another which is also evident from the spectra shown in

Therefore, it can be concluded that the commercial brands lose almost all of its natural molecular composition during refining processes and consequently contains only oxidized products which fluoresce. It certainly contains saturated and unsaturated fats but they do not fluoresce but their oxidized products fluoresce. The results in
