 <p> Antiproliferative activity of EOs on THP-1 cell line after 96 h of exposure. The mean absorbance values for the negative control (DMSO-treated cells) were standardized as 100% absorbance (i.e., no growth inhibition) and results were displayed as absorbance (% of control) versus essential oil concentration. </p>
