 <p> Antiproliferative activity of the EOs on THP-1 cell line after 24 h of exposure. The mean absorbance values for the negative control (dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells) were standardized as 100% absorbance (i.e., no growth inhibition) and results were displayed as absorbance (% of control) versus essential oil concentration. </p>
