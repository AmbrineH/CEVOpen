<p class="p">Citronellal shows moderate antioxidant activity due to its limited capacity to scavenge free radicals [
 <xref rid="B29-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of citronellal may be related to one unpaired electron from the molecule allylic hydrogen of both CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> or CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-05-00061-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) that by resonance stabilize the radical formed after the reaction. Nevertheless, Wojtunik et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] considered that only the presence of conjugation of π bonds would allow a resonance-stabilized structure. However, essential oils are complex mixtures and the antioxidant activity cannot be assigned to only one compound. The different constituents of EOs may act synergistically or antagonistically, leading to an overall activity that results from the interaction among several compounds. Ciesla et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] studied the capacity of binary mixtures of some common EO terpenoids, for scavenging DPPH free radicals. They reported an antagonistic effect between citronellal and 1,8-cineole, both present in Cc EO. Nonetheless, the interaction of citronellal with other constituents could trigger a synergistic effect, responsible for the high level of activity observed in Cc EO. Antagonism was also observed by Ciesla et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] for the binary mixture of 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene. These constituents were the major Er EO compounds (
 <xref rid="medicines-05-00061-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Eg, Ep, Er, and Es EOs, which showed the lowest free radical scavenger activities, had 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene as major constituents. These monoterpenes were previously reported as poor scavengers of DPPH free radicals [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. γ-Terpinene, one of the main constituents of Ev EO, is considered a good free radical scavenger [
 <xref rid="B29-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], possibly due to the delocalization of the unpaired electron along the molecule, owing to the two allylic hydrogens that can stabilize the resonance-structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-05-00061-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, the binary mixture of γ-terpinene and 1,8-cineole (another major constituent of Ev EO) did not produce any significant effects. Despite the presence of an allylic hydrogen in 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene in conjugation with an aromatic ring, its abstraction from the molecule can be difficult due to steric hindrances, because hydrogen is hidden by the two CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups as well as by the aromatic ring (
