<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the EO was determined with an electron reaction-based method (the ABTS+ method) and a hydrogen reaction-based method (the ORAC method). With the TEAC method, Cc EO showed significantly higher antioxidant activity (5.08 µmol TE/g EO) than

 <xref rid="medicines-05-00061-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The lowest antioxidant activity was observed with Eg, Ep, Er and Es EOs, without significant differences among them. The activities ranged from 0.10 in Es to 0.30 μmol TE/g in Eg EO. Cc EO showed the highest scavenging peroxyl radical activity (148.55 µmol TE/g EO) along with Ev EO (135.80 µmol TE/g EO) (
