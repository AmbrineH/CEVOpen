<p class="p">The MIC and MBC values were determined for Es, Eg, and tea tree EOs (
 <xref rid="medicines-05-00061-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The lowest MIC and MBC values were observed for Eg EO against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR 4, with values of 0.015 and 0.05 mg/mL, respectively. Both 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> strains showed a similar MIC and MBC for the tea tree EO, namely 0.025 and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively. However, for the Es EO 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 showed a similar MIC value to 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR 4, but the MBC value was the double of that of 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR 4, showing an MBC of 0.3 mg/mL in contrast to TIGR 4 that showed an MBC of 0.15 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="medicines-05-00061-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Such differences may be associated with serotype differences between the strains. Moreover, Eg EO, that in the diffusion agar test showed a very weak activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR 4, displayed an efficient activity in the microdilution assay, even in comparison with tea tree EO. These differences may be related to its low diffusion ability. Intriguing was the resistant behaviour of 
 <italic class="italic">H. influenza</italic> that was able to growth at the highest EO concentration tested (0.4 mg/mL). Eg EO showed a better activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic>, that can be related with its richness in 1,8-cineole and α-pinene. In addition, 1,8-cineole prevents the growth of other microorganisms, but when in association with other terpenes in an essential oil, such as camphene, α-pinene, globulol and limonene, it was more efficient against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, and also biofilms of MRSA and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
