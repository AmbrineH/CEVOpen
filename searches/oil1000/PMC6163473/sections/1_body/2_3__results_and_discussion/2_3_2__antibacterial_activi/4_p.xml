<p class="p">All essential oils showed poor antibacterial activity in comparison with the antibiotic chloramphenicol, however differences could be observed among the EOs and bacterial strains (

 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR 4, tea tree EO showed better activity than Myrtaceae EOs, and the strain was even resistant to Ed EO. For
