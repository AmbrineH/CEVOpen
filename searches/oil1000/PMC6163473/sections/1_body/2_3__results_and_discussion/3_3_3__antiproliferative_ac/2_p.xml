<p class="p">EOs decreased viability of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After one day, a great difference was observed between the antiproliferative activity of Eg and Es EOs and the other EOs, particularly at 50 μg/mL. Hence, Eg and Es EOs possessed the lowest antiproliferative activities. After 96 h incubation of THP1 cells with EOs, the differences were more evident for lower concentrations (10 and 25 μg/mL). At 25 μg/mL, it was possible to distinguish two EOs (Er and Ev) with significantly higher antiproliferative activity than the remaining EOs. At 50 μg/mL, these differences disappeared, because almost all EOs showed survival percentages &lt;20%. The exceptions were Eg and Es EOs, that showed survival percentages above &gt;70%, at 50 μg/mL. The main constituents of Eg EO were 1,8-cineole (64%) and α-pinene (20%), and in Es EO, 1,8-cineole represented 80% of the total EO (
