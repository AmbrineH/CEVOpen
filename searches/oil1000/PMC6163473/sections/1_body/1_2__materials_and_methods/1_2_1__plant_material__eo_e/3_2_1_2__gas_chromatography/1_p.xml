<p class="p">Gas chromatographic analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) equipped with two flame ionization detectors (FIDs), a data handling system, and a vaporizing injector port into which two columns of different polarities were installed: a DB-1 fused-silica column (100% dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm; J &amp; W Scientific Inc., Folsom, CA, USA) and a DB-17HT fused-silica column ((50%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.15 μm; J &amp; W Scientific Inc.). The oven temperature was programmed to 45–175 °C, increasing at 3 °C/min, subsequently increased to 300 °C at to 15 °C/min, and then maintained isothermal for 10 min; injector and detector temperatures were 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The carrier gas, hydrogen, was adjusted to a linear velocity of 30 cm/s. The samples were injected using a split sampling technique, ratio 1:50. The volume of injection was 0.1 μL of a distilled 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-pentane-oil solution (1:1). The percentage composition of the oils was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak areas, calculated as a mean value of two injections from each oil, without response factors.
