<p class="p">The growth inhibitory effect of EOs was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well and submitted to different EO concentrations (10–500 μg/mL). All samples were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO). The solvent concentration in the incubation medium never exceeded 0.5%. Control cultures had the equivalent concentration of DMSO. After treatment, cells were incubated (1 h) in the usual culture conditions after addition of the same volume of medium containing MTT (2 mg/mL). After this period, 150 μL HCl (0.1 M) in isopropanol was added to dissolve the blue formazan crystals formed owing to the reduction of MTT. Absorbance at 570 nm using a background reference wavelength of 630 nm was measured. Antiproliferative activity was expressed as the mean absorbance values for the negative control (DMSO-treated cells) standardized as 100% absorbance (i.e., no growth inhibition) and results were expressed as absorbance (% of control) versus essential oil concentration [
