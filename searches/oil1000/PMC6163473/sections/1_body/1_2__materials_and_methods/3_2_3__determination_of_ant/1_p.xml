<p class="p">Antibacterial activity was determined against two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> D39 and TIGR4, and 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus influenza</italic> DSM 9999. Bacterial strains were kept at −70 °C in brain heart infusion (BHI) (Oxoid) supplemented with glycerol (final concentration 25%,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) until use. The cultures were recovered from freezing by growth in brain heart infusion supplemented with 5% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) horse blood at 37 °C in microaerophilic conditions for 24 h. From this plate a suspension with a turbidity value corresponding to 0.5 in the McFarland scale was prepared. From this suspension 0.1 mL was transferred to a new Columbia agar plate supplemented with 5% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) horse blood. Sterile filter paper discs of 6 mm (Oxoid) were distributed on the agar surface and 3 μL of each essential oil was dispensed in the paper discs. Tea tree essential oil with 38% terpinen-4-ol (Optima Healthcare Ltd., Bradford, UK) was included as reference. Sterile 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-propanol (essential oil solvent) and the antibiotic chloramphenicol (30 μg/disk) were used as control. Inhibition zones were evaluated after 24 h at 37 °C in microaerophilic conditions. The assays were done in triplicate.
