 <xref rid="B25-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.4 mg/mL with increments of 0.05 mg/mL were tested. Three replicates for each bacterium were used. The recovery of the viability of each bacterium was evaluated, and the minimum concentration at which no viability was observed was considered as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).
