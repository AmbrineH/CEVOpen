 <xref rid="B22-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Briefly, in each well 150 µL of fluorescein working solution and 25 µL of the previously diluted sample, blank (75 mM phosphate buffer), or standard (Trolox) were added. The plate was covered with a lid and incubated in the preheated (37 °C) BioTek Synergy
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> 4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek, Swindon, UK), country) for 10 min after shaking for 3 min. Then 2,2′-Azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide dihydrochloride (AAPH) was added to each well of the plate, except for the control and blank wells. The final volume of the assay was 200 µL. The fluorescence was read every minute for 90 min at 485 nm excitation and 527 nm emissions. ORAC values were calculated according to [

The standard curve was obtained by plotting Trolox concentrations against the average net AUC of the measurements for each concentration. Final ORAC values were calculated using the regression equation between Trolox concentration and the net AUC and were expressed as µmol TE/g EO [
