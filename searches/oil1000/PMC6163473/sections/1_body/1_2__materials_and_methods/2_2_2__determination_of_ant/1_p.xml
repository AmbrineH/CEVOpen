<p class="p">Antioxidant activity was determined with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+•</sup>) free radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) methods. For the ABTS method, the preformed radical monocation of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+•</sup> was generated by dissolving ABTS in water (7 mM), adding potassium persulfate (2.45 mM, final concentration), and allowing the mixture to stand overnight in the dark at room temperature. Before the assay, the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+•</sup> solution was diluted with ethanol to obtain a solution with absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm [
 <xref rid="B20-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. For the assay, 10 μL of sample were added to 1000 μL of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+•</sup> solution and left to stand for 6 min, after which the absorbance was read spectrophotometrically at 734 nm. For the control, the volume of sample was replaced by ethanol. The antioxidant activity of each sample was calculated as scavenging effect % (IA%, Inhibitory Activity Percentage) = [(A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>] × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the sample. The same procedure was repeated using diverse concentrations of Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-05-00061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The values obtained with the samples were compared with the curve for several Trolox concentrations and the final results given as μmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/g EOs. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
