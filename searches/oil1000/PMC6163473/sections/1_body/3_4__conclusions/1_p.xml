<p class="p">The highest scavenging of ABTS+ and peroxyl free radicals was observed in Cc and Ev EOs, and the lowest was detected in Eu EO. All essential oils were less effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 than against the D39 strain. MIC and MBC values showed that Eg EO is promising for the treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> infections. EOs displayed low diffusion capacity and the antibacterial activity screening through microdilution test would be more appropriate. 
 <italic class="italic">H. influenzae</italic> was the respiratory pathogen that showed the highest resistance to all EOs including that of tea tree. Eg and Es EOs showed the lowest antiproliferative activities on THP-1 cells. After 96 h incubation, the Er and Ev EOs showed the highest antiproliferative activity against THP-1 cells. Although further assays are required, the results suggest that the antiproliferative activity is challenged by the combination of 1,8-cineole with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene or with Î³-terpinene. Despite their specific bioactivities, none of the assayed EOs showed simultaneously good antibacterial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative capacity.
