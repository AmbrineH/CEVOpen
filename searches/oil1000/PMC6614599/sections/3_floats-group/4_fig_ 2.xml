  <p class="p">Performance parameters of 
   <italic class="italic">Lates calcarifer</italic> juveniles fed different diets formulated with varying inclusions of fishmeal (FM) and purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) (diet 1: 30%FM-0%PPB, diet 2: 20%FM-10%PPB, diet 3: 10%FM-20%PPB, diet 4: 0%FM-30%PPB). A. Fish daily growth rate (g fish
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>day
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) determined for the three periods investigated: day 1–18, 19 to 28, and 29 to 47. Note the differences between diet 1 and 4 between day 19–28 and 29–47. B. Food conversion ratio (FCR) determined for those same periods, looking at any difference in FCR values between diets at the start, middle and end of the feed trial. The dot line indicates a FCR of 1. All data are given as the means with 95% CI from three replicate tanks. 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value indicates if the slope and intercept of the linear regression for a given time period are significantly different. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
