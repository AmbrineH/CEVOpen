<p id="p0040" class="p">Purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB), including 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodopseudomonas sp</italic>. and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodobacter sp</italic>. are a phylogenetically diverse group of phototrophic anoxygenic microbes that avoid this dissipation through phototrophic growth and yields close to unity (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>) and can be readily selected with infrared radiation (IR). IR is utilised as catabolic driver and enables direct and non-destructive, assimilative uptake of organics, nitrogen, and phosphorous (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hülsen et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, PPBs exhibit high growth rates and contain &gt;60% crude protein with additional, potentially beneficial compounds such as carotenoid pigments, polyhydroxyalkanoates and readily digestible cell walls (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kobayashi and Kobayashi, 1995</xref>). This makes PPB an ideal mediator for resource recovery from wastewater where IR allows for selective enrichment with little or no competition with other bacteria or algae that are unable to absorb wavelengths above 750 nm (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bidigare et al., 1990</xref>). As a result, PPB can dominate non-sterile systems in a mixed culture context, which enables consistent product quality. This offers the ability to generate PPB as a product stream, e.g. as feed or feed additive from industrial and potentially domestic wastewaters, with health controls or phase separation (
