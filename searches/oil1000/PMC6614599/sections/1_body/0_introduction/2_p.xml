<p id="p0030" class="p">For over five decades, aquaculture has been the fastest growing animal food-production industry, with production expanding on average by 8.0% per year since 1961, and 47% of all food fish are now derived from aquaculture (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2018</xref>). However, there is heavy reliance on fishmeal and fish oil derived from capture fisheries to manufacture feeds for aquaculture species, however this is a limited resource with very strict quotas (

To reduce this pressure, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations have charged the scientific community with the investigation of alternative protein sources that are simultaneously more environmentally friendly, low cost and may promote extra nutritional health benefits (
