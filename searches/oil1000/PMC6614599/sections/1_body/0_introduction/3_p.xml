<p id="p0035" class="p">Microbial biomass, also referred to as single cell protein (SCP) has a range of advantages as a feed ingredient (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Matassa et al., 2016</xref>). Conversion of organics, nitrogen and phosphorous to proteins is highly efficient compared to, for example, plant based alternatives (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Matassa et al., 2016</xref>). Secondly, whereas plant and insect proteins are generally well digested, certain fractions may contain less digestible and anti-nutritional factors such as cellulose, chitin and phytate. Microbial proteins are generally well utilised by fish and crustaceans and comprise a protein content and amino acid profiles similar to fishmeal (

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yaakob et al., 2014</xref>), microbial biomass from bacteria is regarded as one of the most promising vectors (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pikaar et al., 2017</xref>). Bacterial biomass is generally characterised by a protein content between 50 and 65% (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anupama and Ravindra, 2000</xref>), which is an important consideration when formulating feeds for popular aquaculture species such as salmon, trout and barramundi where final dietary requirement may exceed 50% protein (

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Glencross, 2006</xref>). However, the majority of microbial SCP production relies on aerobic heterotrophs, which dissipate a substantial fraction of the energy during catabolism (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Matassa et al., 2015</xref>), limiting biological yields and conversion ratios to below 50%.
