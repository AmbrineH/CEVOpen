Pellets, regardless of the diet retained structural stability after 10 min immersion in water. Water from tanks receiving diet 4 and 3 were slightly more turbid than from diet 1 and 2 and this usually occurred for 10–15 min following feeding. The amino acid profiles of all feeds were determined, and are provided in
