<p id="p0130" class="p">A PPB biofilm was formed after 7 d post-inoculation (20 L) and harvesting was subsequently carried out every 3 d, reusing 10% (v/v) of the reactor liquid as inoculum. The biofilm was up to 3.0 mm thick (visual estimate), completely covered the irradiated surface (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>B and C) and was easy to remove from the tubes. Non-irradiated regions (due to non-functional LEDs) were immediately evident as no growth occurred (

Although the primary purpose of the PPB reactor in this study was the production of PPB rather than optimising the COD, N and P removal and uptake efficiencies, the potential of simultaneous uptake of resources from artificial and wastewater sources has been shown. Representative time series of the artificial and the domestic wastewater reactor operation over 40 d (of the 135 d) and over 71 d respectively are shown

This is unfavourable for high rate systems, but we also note that this will ultimately depend on an optimised illuminated surface to volume ratio, which would further affect the mixing and likely increase the removal rates. Nevertheless, we consider the attached PPB growth as a successful proof of concept, which requires optimisation, especially with focus on the energy input.
