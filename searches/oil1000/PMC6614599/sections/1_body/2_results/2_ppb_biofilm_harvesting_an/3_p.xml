<p id="p0135" class="p">The results further show the effect of attached PPB growth on the product consistency. Protein, amino acid, total carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll contents in PPB biomass grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater were almost identical with slight variations in the fat and carbohydrate contents (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This indicates a degree of compositional independence from the feed matrix, which is crucial for product consistency on different growth media or wastewaters. This is further confirmed by the sequence-based analysis of the total harvested biomass. In both biofilms, grown on artificial and domestic wastewater, PPB were dominant (70% of sequences (

 <italic class="italic">Rhodobacter sp</italic> accounting for up to up to 32% and 15%, (artificial medium) and 44% and 39% in domestic wastewater (
