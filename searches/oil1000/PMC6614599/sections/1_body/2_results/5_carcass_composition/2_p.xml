 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Table S3</xref>. Three samples were analysed per diet treatment, one for each replicate tank. Each sample was composed of five representative animals per tank. Differences in moisture, protein, lipid, ash, and carbohydrate were analysed by linear regression. Increasing level of PPB in the diets had a negative correlation with protein content in fish carcasses (p = 0.0220), with carcasses of fish fed diet 4 having the lowest protein content. Increasing level of PPB had a positive correlation on ash content of the carcass (p &lt; 0.0032) with ash content maximum in carcasses of fish fed diet 4. Carcasses of fish fed diet 3 formulated with 66% PPB as fishmeal replacement had the highest level of lipid among all diets including control, though no statistically significant correlation was detected by regression. PPB concentration in diet had no effect on moisture or carbohydrate content in carcasses of animals fed the diets (
