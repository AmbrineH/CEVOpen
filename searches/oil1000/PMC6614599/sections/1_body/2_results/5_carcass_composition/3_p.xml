 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. Potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and calcium increased by 7%, 21%, 12% and 27% respectively from reference to complete fishmeal replacement, while sulphur and sodium decreased by 12 and 22%. Levels of calcium between diets did not show a particular trend but its levels in fish carcasses composition increased significantly (p = 1.20 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup>). Iron levels in diets increased by 37% in diets with 66% and 100% PPB inclusion but remained constant in fish carcasses. Potassium levels were fairly constant in diets and no differences in body compositions observed. Magnesium levels increased gradually in experimental diets (up to 48% in diet 4) so as its levels in fish carcasses (p = 7.06 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>). Sodium increased in diets (up to 43% in diet 4) but decreased significantly in fish fed experimental diets (p = 6.88 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup>). Phosphorous level was maximum in diet 3 (23% higher than control diet 1) and increased significantly in carcases of fish fed increasing level of PPB (p = 1.61 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup>). As expected, sulphur levels increased along with FM replacement (up to 33% in diet 4) but its levels decreased significantly in carcasses of fish (

 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>). Concentrations of copper, iron, lead, and zinc remained constant in all fish carcasses tested.
