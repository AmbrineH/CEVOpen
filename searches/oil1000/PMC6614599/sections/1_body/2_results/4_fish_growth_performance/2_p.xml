<p id="p0145" class="p">A summary of growth performance outcomes (daily growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), weight length gain and survival) for the four treatments are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Feed intake was not significantly impacted by PPB inclusion suggesting that replacement of fishmeal with PPB protein did not affect palatability of the diets. Survival of barramundi fingerlings after 47 days was high (94%–100%) with no significant differences between diets or any other factors (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Three fish died in one tank in the initial period but, following this, only one further fish died in a different tank over the trial. All fish that died were abnormally small (below average weight of the cohort) and presented signs of aggression by others.
