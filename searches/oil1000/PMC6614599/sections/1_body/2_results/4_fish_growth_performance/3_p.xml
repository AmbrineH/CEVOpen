<p id="p0150" class="p">Fish in all tanks increased in weight over time (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). During the 47 days of the trial, fish grew more than five-fold (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), with fish fed control diet 1 increasing by 7.1 ± 0.9-fold, those fed diet 2 (30% FM replacement) by 6.1 ± 0.6-fold, fish fed diet 3 (66% FM replacement) increasing 5.8 ± 0.3-fold and fish fed diet 4 (100% FM replacement growing 5.4 ± 0.8-fold (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). To predict weight, a simple linear model with explanatory factors age, initial size, and diet was as effective as a more complex interaction model (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.96 vs R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.98), and the simpler model was used. Average weight was primarily driven by the age of fish (

 <sup class="sup">−23</sup>, 80% of variance), secondarily by initial size (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−12</sup>, 12% of variance), and finally by diet (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−06</sup>, 4.1% of variance). The model R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was 0.96, indicating very little residual variance (probably due to the fact that each observation was averaged from 50 individual fish). Weight and length gain at the end of the trial were negatively correlated with increasing level of PPB with p-values of 0.0037 and 0.0003 respectively (
