 <italic class="italic">Daily feed intake</italic> was not impacted by tanks or diet. However, it was slightly impacted by the initial size and, naturally, time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−15</sup> of the fish (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup>) with larger animals consuming more feed than smaller ones. There were no interactions between primary factors and, as expected, no differences observed in feed intakes between diets at any given time (restrictive pair-fed feeding strategy). Further analysis regressing daily intake vs fish weight (at t
 <sub class="sub">end</sub>) vs PPB fraction found that, apart from the strong correlation with fish weight (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−18</sup>), there was a significant positive correlation with PPB inclusion (0.005, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9).
