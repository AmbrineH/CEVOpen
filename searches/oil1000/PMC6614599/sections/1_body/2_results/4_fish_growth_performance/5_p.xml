<p id="p0160" class="p">Feed conversion ratio varied substantially with time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup>) and diet (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−7</sup>) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>B), but tank allocation and initial size had no impact on FCR. Comparison of linear models and interaction models and removing non-significant factors resulted in two candidate models, each involving only time and diet. The best model was a two-factor model (diet and time*diet, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.89), which was better than the two-parameter linear model (time and diet, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.75), and not worse than the full 3-parameter interaction (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.90, time alone not significant). This optimal model predicted PPB fraction in diet negatively affecting FCR (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−7</sup>, fraction of variance 0.12) with a highly significant interaction between time*diet type (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−15</sup>, fraction of variance 0.6). The primary (linear factor) indicates a slight decrease in FCR with increased PPB inclusion rate (i.e., beneficial impact), but the latter dominates, and is a detrimental impact. Overall, at an earlier time point, diet is less important to FCR, while at later times, diet has a strong impact in increasing FCR (detrimental). This can be effectively seen in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>B also, where only at later periods, and at higher dietary PPB inclusion rate, does the FCR rise substantially above 1.
