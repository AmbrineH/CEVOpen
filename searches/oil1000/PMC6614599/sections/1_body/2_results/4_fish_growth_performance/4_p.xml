<p id="p0155" class="p">Daily gain effectively removes the cumulative weight effect of time (i.e., fish get bigger over time), leaving analysis of the possibility that bigger or older fish grow faster or slower. There was no significant tank effect on the daily individual live-weight gain. Instead, daily gain was impacted positively by time (older fish grow faster (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>)), positively by initial size (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0029, big initial size results in higher daily gain), and negatively by PPB inclusion rate (p = 0.0001). R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for the linear model was 0.62 (vs interaction model R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.7 – slight improvement). An R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of 0.62 indicates that the main factors were highly explanatory, even with the cumulative growth effect of time removed. For the first 28 d of the trial there was no effect of PPB on daily weight gain (p = 0.3; 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>A). From day 28 until day 47, PPB inclusion rate had a negative correlation with daily gain (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.008 and 5.94 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> respectively) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>A). Fish fed diet 4 (100% FM replacement) had the lowest gain at both sample times. As fish grew older from day 18 to day 28, the daily gain significantly increased in all diet treatments (p &lt; 0.0001). At the end of the feed trial, daily weight gain slightly increased in fish fed diet 1 (0% FM replacement) but remained unchanged for fish fed diet 2 and 3 and decreased for fish fed diet 4 (
