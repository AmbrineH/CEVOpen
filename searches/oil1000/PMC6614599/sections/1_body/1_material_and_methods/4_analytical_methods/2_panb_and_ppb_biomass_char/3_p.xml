 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eding et al. (2006)</xref>. Total lipid was determined by acid hydrolysis of the sample, then extraction of the total lipids in a soxhlet apparatus (FOSS Soxtec, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia). Ash content was determined gravimetrically following loss of mass after combustion in a muffle furnace at &gt;550 °C. Moisture, lipid, nitrogen, and ash procedures were conducted by Symbio laboratories (Eight Mile Plains, QLD, 4113, Australia). Amino acid analysis from PPB grown on synthetic wastewater was performed by Symbio laboratories and the obtained values used to formulate the diets. Amino acid profiles for PPB grown on domestic wastewater and for all the manufactured diets were performed by Ridley Aquafeed (Narangba, Australia) by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (Acquity Arc, WATERS, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia). Samples were firstly hydrolysed in 6N HCL at 112 °C for 20 h, under nitrogen. Hydrolysed samples were then diluted and passed through a 0.2 μm syringe filter and then derivatized using the standard WATERS AccQ.Tag chemistry (Milford, MA, USA). Derivatives were analysed on an XBridge C18 column (2.5 μm, 3.0  mm × 150  mm) using the UHPLC quaternary pumping system, with WATERS eluents, LC-MS grade acetonitrile, and ultrapure water as mobile phase, which was set at a constant flow rate of 0.97 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with column temperature set at 43 °C. Chromatograms were integrated and quantitated using the Empower v3 software (WATERS, MA, USA).
