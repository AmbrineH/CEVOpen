Pigment analysis (bacteriochlorophyll and total carotenoids) was performed as follows: Samples were frozen overnight (−80 °C). Then the temperature was raised to 4 °C, a small amount (&lt;7 mg) of each dry sample (PPBs or diets) were weighed on a precision balance and the pigments extracted with acetone and methanol 7:2 while sonicating on ice for 10 min (modified from

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van der Rest and Gingras (1974)</xref>). The process was repeated until a colourless pellet was obtained. The extracted pigments were detected at 475 nm (total carotenoids) and 771 nm (PPBs samples) and 750 nm (diets) for bacteriochlorophyll on the 0 to 1 absorbance scale using a Quartz cuvette. Pigment concentrations were calculated via the Beer-Lambert Law, assuming the Spirilloxanthin absorption coefficient (ε = 94000 M
