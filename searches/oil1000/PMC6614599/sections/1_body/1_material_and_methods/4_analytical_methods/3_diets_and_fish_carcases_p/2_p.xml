<p id="p0115" class="p">The diets, initial and final fish were processed and analysed for moisture, lipid, protein and amino acids following the methods described above. The diets were ground to a fine powder using a bench top grinder (Coffee &amp; Spice, Breville, Australia). The whole, frozen fish were passed through an industrial food processor mincer twice (Hobart Tin chopper, Hobart) to obtain a homogeneous mixture. A sample was taken for dry matter analysis calculated by gravimetric analysis, following oven drying at 105 °C overnight and another sample was freeze dried for chemical analysis for 72 h at −106 °C and 0.2 hPa (CoolSafe™ Scanvac, Labogene).</p>
