<p id="p0085" class="p">PPB from synthetic wastewater was used to formulate nutritionally complete diets balanced on an equal protein and energy basis using standard raw materials used in commercial barramundi feeds (Ridley Aquafeeds, Australia) and with ingredient chemical composition described in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>A. Briefly, experimental diets were prepared with 30% fishmeal (control), or with substitution rates of 33%, 66% or 100% of the fishmeal component substituted with PPB, with adjustments in other components to maintain crude protein, phosphorous, and lipid levels (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>B), and amino acid balance based on pre-analysis of ingredients (see 2.3 Analytical Methods). Each raw material was pre-milled into a fine powder (&lt;0.7 mm) and mixed in a 20 L Hobart planetary mixer A200 (Hobart, Ohio, USA) for 10 min to allow complete homogenisation. Lipid (fish oil 25%/75% poultry oil) was slowly added to the dry mash while mixing. Water was then added until an optimum dough consistency was achieved. The mash was then passed three times through a Hobart Tin chopper attachment fitted with a 2 mm tapered die mincing plate attached to a rotating knife (Hobart, Ohio, USA). Strands were then placed onto stainless steel mesh trays and steamed (100% humidity) at 105 °C for 2 min (fan speed 2) in a Cheftop Unox (XEVC-0511-E1R) combi oven. Steamed strands were then dried overnight at 65 °C (fan speed 4). The strands were first broken by hand and pulse-blended for 1 s five times. To produce 1.5–2 mm pellets, resulting mixed pellets were sieved through a 2 mm Endecotts test sieve shaker (Endecotts, London, England). Composition analysis of each diet after preparation was determined to confirm formulation levels (
