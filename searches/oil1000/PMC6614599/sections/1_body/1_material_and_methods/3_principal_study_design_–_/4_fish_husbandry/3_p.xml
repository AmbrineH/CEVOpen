<p id="p0095" class="p">Feed intake was recorded on a daily basis for each tank based on weight of feed provided (g) less uneaten feed collected, dried and weighed (g). Feed consumed was accounted for each diet and corrections applied to determine daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR) which is the ratio of the amount of feed consumed (dry weight in g) to fish biomass gain (live weight-gain in g). Weight gain was derived from final weight (g) minus initial weight (g).</p>
