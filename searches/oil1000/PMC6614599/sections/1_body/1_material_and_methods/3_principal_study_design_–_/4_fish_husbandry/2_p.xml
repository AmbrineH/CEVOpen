<p id="p0090" class="p">Juvenile barramundi (n = 540) of approximately 25 mm were sourced from Mainstream Aquaculture hatchery (Melbourne, Vic, Australia), airfreighted to the University of Queensland and kept in a freshwater recirculating system composed of twelve 70L tank connected to two 300 L sumps, one fitted with two 300 μm filter socks to remove large organic matter before reaching a mechanical and biological filter (K1 micro bead filter media, Evolution Aqua). Water was pre-filtered through a carbon filter to remove any traces of chlorine and chloramine and any other contaminants. A heating/chilling unit (Teco TK3000) maintained the temperature constant at 28 ± 1 °C and the dissolved oxygen was maintained at &gt;5 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> by means of an air compressor and in-tank airstones. Other water quality characteristics were analysed regularly, and water exchanges performed to maintain concentrations as follows: ammonia, (&lt;0.25 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), nitrite (&lt;0.5–1 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), nitrate (&lt;20 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), pH (7.2–7.8), and general hardness 100–200 ppm. After a three weeks acclimatisation on a commercial feed, fish were starved for 24 h and then separated by size, with larger fish 6.11 ± 0.10 g fish
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (mean ± S.D., n = 45) being randomly allocated to four tanks (one per diet), and medium sized fish 4.23 ± 0.21 g fish
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (mean ± S.D; n = 45) being randomly allocated to 8 tanks (2 per diet). Each diet was randomly assigned two tanks with medium fish and one tank with large fish in a balanced block design. Fish were then reared over 47 d with initial, intermediate and final measurements of weight and length performed on individual fish. Fish losses were expressed as percentage survival. Each diet was fed manually to each tank twice daily (08:00 and 16:00) using a restrictive pair-fed feeding strategy (

Limiting-constraint feeding prevents confounding issue of unregulated feed intake due to nutrient-limited diets and allows for the standardisation of nutrient and energy utilisation of new ingredients in protein-replacement studies (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Glencross et al., 2007</xref>). All diets were formulated to equivalent protein and energy levels, but feed was provided at a reduced proportion from the estimated requirements based on the diet with the lowest feed intake (e.g. usually 100% PPB diet 4). This strategy allows for the isolation of any particular effects caused by PPB protein.
