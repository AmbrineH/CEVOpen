<p id="p0080" class="p">Juvenile barramundi were grown with complete or partial replacement of fishmeal by PPB in a series of iso-nitrogenous (∼56.3% CP) and iso-energetic (∼17.2 MJ kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) diets formulated with varying inclusion levels of PPB. Ethical approval for the feed trial in barramundi was granted by the University of Queensland Native and Exotic Wildlife and Marine Animals (NEWMA) Ethics Committee (permit SBS/130/17). The experiment was conducted in a re-circulating freshwater tank array fitted with continuous aeration, water temperature controlled and filtered through a mechanical and biological filtration system.
