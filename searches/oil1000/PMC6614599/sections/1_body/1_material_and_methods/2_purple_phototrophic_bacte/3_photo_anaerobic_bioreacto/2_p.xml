<p id="p0055" class="p">A 1000L (800L working volume) photo anaerobic bioreactor (PAnB) was used to grow PPB for the feed trial. The PAnB consisted of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) base with a conical bottom flanged to a rectangular clear acrylic main tank (1164  mm × 1008  mm x 1007 mm). The reactor lid contained 100 sealed, hollow acrylic tubes with flanged connections (Diameter: 50 mm OD, Length: 905 mm) which were submerged in the reactor liquid. Each tube contained a rigid light bar with an aluminium triangle core with three sides, each with a 75 cm rigid, dimmable IR LED strip. Each triangular light bar contained 126 LEDs (10 W, IR 850 nm HK-R5050IR-30N-X, 12 V DC, Demo Photoelectric Tech (Wuxi) Co, LtD, China) to irradiate the PAnB from inside-out with 14–16 W m
