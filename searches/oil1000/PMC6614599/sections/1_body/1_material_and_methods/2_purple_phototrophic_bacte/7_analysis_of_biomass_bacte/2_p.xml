<p id="p0075" class="p">Microbial community composition of biomass grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater was determined by amplicon sequencing. DNA extraction and subsequent sequencing by Illumina Miseq Platform, using universal primer pair 926F (5′-AAACTYAAAKGAATTGACGG-3′) and 1392wR (5′-ACGGGCGGTGWGTRC-3′) primer sets and data analysis were performed on PPB biomass grown on both the synthetic and domestic wastewaters as previously described (
