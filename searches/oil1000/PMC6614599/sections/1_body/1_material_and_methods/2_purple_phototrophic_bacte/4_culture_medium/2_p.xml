 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ormerod et al., 1961</xref>) with the following modifications: biotin, (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and malic acid were substituted with: yeast extract (0.015 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Cl (50 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and acetic acid (500 mgCOD L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The pH was set to 6.5. While synthetic wastewater was used to grow PPB for the feed trials, the system was further operated on-site at a wastewater treatment plant (Luggage Point, Queensland Urban Utilities) using domestic primary clarified wastewater in order to compare nutrient removal efficiency by PPB and to characterise the composition of the biomass grown on different sources.
