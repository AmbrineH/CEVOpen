<p id="p0070" class="p">PPB biomass was harvested at the end of each batch by removing each tube and removing the biofilm manually. The harvested biomass was weighed and the total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) were determined. The collected biomass was stored in a freezer (−20 °C) before air drying in a commercial food dryer (DT6000 Food Lab™ Dehydrator, Sunbeam, Australia) at 45 °C until dry (2 × 19.5 h). The dried biomass was further processed in a mixer (Nutribullet 600, Australia) to produce a fine and homogenous powder. After collecting a total of 2.2 kg of dried biomass grown on synthetic wastewater, the bacterial biomass was analysed for proteins, fat, carbohydrates, ash, amino acids, total carotenoids, total chlorophyll, metals, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), total nitrogen and phosphorous (

Identical analyses were performed on PPB grown on domestic wastewater although only artificially fed PPB were fed to fish in this study to confirm proof-of-concept before testing PPB generated from other wastewater sources.
