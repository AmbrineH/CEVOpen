<p id="p0065" class="p">The PAnB was inoculated with enriched PPB and operated for 135 days on synthetic artificial wastewater including 24 harvesting events, approximately every 3 days followed by 70 days on domestic wastewater. After an initial start-up time of 1 week, PPB biomass attached to the submerged surfaces of the acrylic tubes and was harvested via manual scraping (see below) in intervals of 3–4 d. Consecutive batches were started by adding glacial acetic acid and NH
