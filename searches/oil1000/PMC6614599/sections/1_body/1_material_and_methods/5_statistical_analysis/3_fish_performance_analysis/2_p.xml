<p id="p0125" class="p">The main explanatory variable (PPB inclusion) was continuous, rather than categorical, and hence mixed mode (categorical-continuous) linear modelling was used to assess its impact. This allowed for assessment of its impact vs other factors (tank number, initial fish size, age of fish etc). Effect of PPB inclusion on feed intake, daily gain, FCR, growth rate, and mortality between diets were examined using a generalized linear mixed regression model. Limits for all critical ranges were set at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (95% confidence interval) from three replicate tanks. An ANOVAN (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-way) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effects of multiple factors on each tank and sample point using the ANOVAN function in MatLab (MathWorks, R2016b, also see SM1 for more details). Linear non-interaction and interaction models were tested, with the non-interaction model generally being used (as more parsimonious) where outcomes were comparable. Tank number was treated as categorical factor. Age of fish (time), start initial size (medium or large) and PPB fraction (diet type) were treated as primary continuous factors. Residual normality (noting 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> &gt; 36) and heteroscedasticity (against explanatory variables) were tested and are given in the scripts. While linear modelling was used as the main statistical method for overall impact, comparison between pairs was done using an appropriate 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test.
