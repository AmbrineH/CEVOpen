<p id="p0205" class="p">Although the attached reactor concept utilised to grow the PPB had low removal rates and required a high energy input, mainly for illumination, the concept of attached biofilms on IR illuminated submerged tubes for consistent biomass quality seems technically feasible. The tubes are by no means the final design and significantly higher illuminated surface to volume ratios can be easily achieved e.g. with smaller tube diameters or in a flat plate reactors (e.g. 67 m

 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> (

This can further improve the mixing and the removal rates, which might also lead to increased attached areal productivities e.g. due to faster growth and more frequent harvesting rather than increased density. The logical step would be the use of outdoor cultures, which would harvest natural light, drastically increasing illumination intensity and reducing illumination costs to zero while sacrificing 12 h of illuminated operation due to night/day cycles.
