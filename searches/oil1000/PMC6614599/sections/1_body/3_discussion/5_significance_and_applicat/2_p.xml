<p id="p0200" class="p">The application of PPB biomass for fishmeal substitution adds value to the PPB biomass. This, primarily (but not limited to) concerns the value of bulk protein where fishmeal fluctuates in price according to grades and availability, in the last 5 years prices have ranged from 1,919 US$ metric ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (01/2013) to 1,296.00 US$ metric ton-1 (04/2017) and last recorded at 1,604 US $ metric ton-1 (03/2018) or 2.5–3 US$ per kg crude protein (assuming 65% CP) (

Future prices are expected to increase due to overfishing and catch quota (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tveteras and Asche, 2008</xref>). Moreover, supply restriction during climatic events (for example fishery closure during El Niño events) are likely to increase in frequency and duration forcing prices higher (

For the wastewater treatment industry, preferably agri-industry sources (e.g. food processors, abattoirs, or comparable industries) this means the production of PPB from their wastewaters will add an additional income stream. The PPB technology has the potential to remove organics, nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater, lowering the discharge costs while simultaneously transforming these constituents into protein-rich biomass at yields around 0.8 gCOD

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hülsen et al., 2018</xref>). General PPB applicability has been demonstrated in dairy, red meat, poultry processing wastewaters and pork flush with a characteristic profile of mixed culture PPB extensively discussed with respect to those protein sources (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hülsen et al., 2018</xref>). PPB from different sources has been found to be very consistent, almost independent from the wastewater source, as indicated with the comparison of PPB composition grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater (
