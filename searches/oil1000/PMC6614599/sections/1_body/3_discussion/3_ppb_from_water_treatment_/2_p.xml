<p id="p0185" class="p">PPB produced, using synthetic or domestic wastewater in photoactive bioreactors was consistent in terms of bacterial community, protein, lipid and carbohydrate content in agreement with previous research where biomass derived from bioreactors operating on wastewater streams from pork, dairy and poultry processing were compared (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tangendjaja, 2015</xref>) so the product consistency across synthetic wastewater, domestic wastewater (this study) and disparate waste streams (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hülsen et al., 2018</xref>) is an advantage of the PPB biomass. Protein content of the PPB biomass was reasonably high (&gt;57%) making it possible to substitute at quite high rates in feeds for carnivorous fish where dietary protein requirement may be between 40 and 55%. This compares favourably with other microbial protein sources such as yeast, fungi and microalgae where protein content is substantially less than 50% (
