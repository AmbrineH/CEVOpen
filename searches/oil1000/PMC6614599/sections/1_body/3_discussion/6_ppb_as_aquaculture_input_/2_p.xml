<p id="p0210" class="p">Our results suggest that PPB up to 33% (∼10%) could offer an alternative to fishmeal with little or no detrimental effect on fish performance in barramundi, a tropical species with high dietary protein requirement. It may be possible to address the penalties in FCR and growth at higher inclusion levels by relatively inexpensive and simple ingredient pre-treatment (eg hydrolysis) as this improved digestibility and performance of baker's yeast in Arctic charr (

In addition, the potential beneficial impact of vitamins and other compounds (including carotenoids, chlorophylls and biopolymers such as PHB) needs to be assessed to change the overall optimal formulation for commercial utilisation. It is noted that this study focused on manual preparation of relatively small amounts of feed (though still with a large number of individual animals). The encouraging results of the present study justify a larger trial, involving preparation of larger volumes of feed with a commercial extruder. Given the relatively high carotenoid content in PPB and its stability through feed processing demonstrated in this study, assessment of performance in feeds for high value crustaceans such as tiger prawns (
