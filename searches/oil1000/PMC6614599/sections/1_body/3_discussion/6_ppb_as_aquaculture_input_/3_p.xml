<p id="p0215" class="p">Here we tested full and partial replacement of fishmeal with PPB in fast growing carnivorous species, the Asian sea bass or barramundi. Alternative species such as shrimp and prawns that are largely detritivorous (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bailey-Brock and Moss, 1992</xref>), and Tilapia that are omnivorous grazers may well thrive on microbial biomass and should be priorities for further study. Additionally, potential benefits of using PPB as whole feed (either directly in culture water or fed to rotifer or artemia) to survival and growth during early life stages of these animals should be considered.
