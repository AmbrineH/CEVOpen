Here we show that bacterial biomass derived from synthetic or domestic wastewater using photoactive bioreactors can be substituted for fishmeal in diets for the popular tropical aquaculture fish barramundi (Asian sea bass,

Given this is a proof-of-concept study, with feed formulation not yet optimised for differences between PPB and fishmeal as primary protein source, there remains substantial scope to further improve these outcomes. These aspects are discussed further in this section.
