<p id="p0195" class="p">While the bulk properties (amino acid profile, metals profile etc.), were comparable across the four diets, PPB has a number of additional active compounds (vitamins, biopolymers (PHAs), carotenoids, and bacteriochlorophylls), which are important to commercial fish rearing. PPB contain a range of vitamins (e.g. B2, B12, E and niacin) (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sasaki et al., 1991</xref>) which are important for fish growth and are routinely added to commercial feed (vitamin premix), including in the current study. If substantially substituted by native compounds in PPB, this would allow reduction of premix from commercial feed formulations, with associated cost-saving. The same applies for carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll, which in this study were present in the PPB product used to formulate the diets at 6.8 g kg

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respectively. Interestingly, pigments were stable after the steaming and overnight drying steps of the pellets, their levels of detection in the diets were in accordance with the concentration of PPB biomass used in the formulation of the diets (
