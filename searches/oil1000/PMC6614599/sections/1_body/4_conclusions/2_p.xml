<p id="p0225" class="p">This represents proof of concept for the replacement of fishmeal using a mixed population PPB biofilm generated in a photo-anaerobic bioreactor (PAnB). Bulk characteristics and population were consistent on synthetic and actual wastewater. We encountered no significant increase in mortality associated with the use of PPB as a feed ingredient and demonstrated that up to 66% replacement of fishmeal with PPB has no significant adverse effects on fish performance for the first 28 days. However, full fishmeal replacement with bacterial biomass reduced growth and increased feed conversion ratio. Nevertheless, our study strongly supports further research to identify optimal opportunities for microbial protein substitutes for fishmeal for more cost effective and long-term sustainable aquaculture feeds.</p>
