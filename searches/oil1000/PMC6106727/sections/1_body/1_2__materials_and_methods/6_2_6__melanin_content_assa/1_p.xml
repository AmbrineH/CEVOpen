<p class="p">The B16 cells were seeded in a six-well plate (2×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/ well) for 12h, after renewing the culture medium of the cells treated with different concentrations of AVO for 48h and washed with ice-cold PBS twice. Cells were lysed [

BCA Protein Assay Kit (Biomed, Beijing, China) was used to determine the protein concentration of each sample. The melanin content was normalized to the cellular protein concentration (abs melanin/
