<p class="p">For the chemical analysis of AVO, an Agilent 7200 GC-QTOF-MS (Agilent, SantaClara, USA) was used, equipped with a HP-INNOWax capillary column (Agilent, 60 m×0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness, polyethylene glycol stationary phase). The carrier gas was 99.99% high purity Helium with a flow rate of 0.8 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. GC injection was performed in pulsed split mode (split rate 10:1, purge flow to split vent 5ML·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The following GC temperature gradient was used: 60°C for 2 min, 2°C/min to 80°C, 8°C/min to 180°C, 4°C/min to 240°C, and holding at 240°C for 30min. The temperatures of the injector, the transfer line, and the ion source were set to 250, 280, and 230°C, respectively. The total run time was 65 min with a solvent delay of 5 min. The QTOF mass spectrum was recorded at five scans per second with a mass-to-charge ratio 50-500 m/z mass acquisition range. Ionization was operated in electron impact ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV. 1.2
