<p class="p">The viability of cultured B16 cells was assayed by adding CCK-8 solution. Generally, B16 cells were plated in 96-well plate at a density of 5×10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Test samples were added with different concentration, and the cells were incubated for 24h. After discarding the culture medium of the cells, 10
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of CCK-8 solution was added into each well and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2h. The absorbance was determined at 450 nm using microplate spectrophotometer (Spectra Max M5, Molecular Devices Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The absorbance of cells without treatment was regarded as 100% of cell survival. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated for three times.
