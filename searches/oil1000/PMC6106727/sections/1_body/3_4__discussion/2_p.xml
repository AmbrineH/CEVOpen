Both intrinsic (gene polymorphisms/mutations, autoimmunity, autotoxicity of melanocytes, and oxidative stress) and extrinsic factors are known to contribute to vitiligo, and it is recognized that hypersensitivity to oxidative stress has an important role in ultimate destruction of epidermal melanocytes. Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be enhanced in pathological melanocytes and closely related to melanocyte apoptosis and autoimmune destruction [
