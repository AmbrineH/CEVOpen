<p class="p">In the melanin content assay, the absorbance of the same number of cells across AVO concentrations (10-30
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was measured in order to exclude the possibility that a rise in melanin content may be induced by the cell proliferating effect of AVO. We found that melanin levels were increased in B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner after the treatment of AVO (
