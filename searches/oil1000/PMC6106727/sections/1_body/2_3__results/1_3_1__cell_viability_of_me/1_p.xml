<p class="p">Our results showed that murine melanoma B16 cells treated with concentration of 1-10

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> AVO for 24h did not induce any changes in cell viability. At the concentration of 10-30
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the cell viability was around 80 to 90 percent which display slight cytotoxicity. Compared with untreated cells, with the treatment of 50

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of AVO cell viability was only 56 percent and indicated relative higher cytotoxicity (
