<p class="p">Although many researches about
 <italic class="italic"> V. anthelmintica </italic>seeds were found, no more scientific results were reported about the chemical composition and bioactivity of volatile oil from
 <italic class="italic"> V. anthelmintica</italic> seeds (AVO). To search active components for the treatment of vitiligo we studied volatile components of
 <italic class="italic"> V. anthelmintica</italic> and its bioactivities. In this research, we studied the AVO effects on melanogenesis in B16 cells and investigated its chemical composition by GC-QTOF-MS method.
