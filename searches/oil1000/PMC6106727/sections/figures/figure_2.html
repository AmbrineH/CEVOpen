 <p> Cellular melanin synthesis (a) in B16 melanoma cells and concentration-dependent effect of AVO on tyrosinase activity (b). Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO as a vehicle or with AVO at 10, 20, and 30 μg·mL −1 and 50 μM 8-MOP as a positive control. The data of melanin content is shown (a). The cells were then analyzed by tyrosinase activity assay (b). Each percentage value for treated cells is reported relative to that of 0.1% DMSO cells. The results have been shown as the means ± SD; n = 3, ∗∗ p &lt;0.01, and ∗∗∗ p &lt;0.001 compared with 0.1% DMSO cells. </p>
