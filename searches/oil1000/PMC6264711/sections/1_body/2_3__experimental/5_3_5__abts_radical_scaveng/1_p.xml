<p class="p">The radical scavenging capacity of the samples for the ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) radical cation was determined as described by Re

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] with some modifications. ABTS was generated by mixing a 7 mmol/L solution of ABTS at pH 7.4 (5 mmol/L NaH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, 5 mmol/L Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>HPO
 <sub class="sub">4 </sub>and 154 mmol/L NaCl) with 2.5 mmol/L potassium persulfate (final concentration) followed by storage in the dark at room temperature for 16 h before use. The mixture was diluted with ethanol to give an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 units at 734 nm using a spectrophotometer (Helios). For samples, solutions of the essential oil in methanol (100 μL) were allowed to react with fresh ABTS solution (900 μL), and then the absorbance was measured 6 min after initial mixing. Ascorbic acid was used as a standard and the capacity of free radical scavenging was expressed by IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (mg/L). IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were calculated as the concentration required for scavenging 50% of ABTS radicals. The capacity of free radical scavenging (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was determined using the same previously used equation for the DPPH method. All measurements were performed in triplicate. All data of antioxidant activity were expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD) of the triplicate measurements. The confidence limits were set at P &lt; 0.05. SD did not exceed 5% for the majority of the values obtained.
