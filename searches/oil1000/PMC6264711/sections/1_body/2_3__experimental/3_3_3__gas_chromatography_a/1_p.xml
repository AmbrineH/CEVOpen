<p class="p">Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the essential oil was carried out by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Gas chromatography analyses were carried out on a Varian Star 3400 Cx chromatograph (Les Ulis, France) fitted with a fused silica capillary DB-5MS column (5% phenylmethylpolysyloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm). Chromatographic conditions were 60 °C to 260 °C temperature rise with a gradient of 5 °C/min and 15 min isotherm at 260 °C. A second gradient was applied to 340 °C at 40 °C/min. Total analysis time was 57 min. For analysis purposes, the essential oil was dissolved in petroleum ether. One microliter of sample was injected in the split mode ratio of 1:10. Helium (purity 99.999%) was used as carrier gas at 1 mL/min. The injector was operated at 200 °C. The mass spectrometer (Varian Saturn GC/MS/MS 4D) was adjusted for an emission current of 10 µA and electron multiplier voltage between 1,400 and 1,500 V. Trap temperature was 150 °C and that of the transfer line was 170 °C. Mass scanning was from 40 to 650 amu.</p>
