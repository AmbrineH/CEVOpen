 <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-alkanes, with those provided in the literature, by comparison of their mass spectra with those recorded in NIST 08 (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and reported in published articles and by co-injection of available reference compounds. The samples were analyzed in duplicate. The percentage composition of the essential oil was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak areas, assuming identical mass response factors for all compounds. Results were calculated as mean values of two injections from essential oil, without using correction factors. All determinations were performed in triplicate and averaged.
