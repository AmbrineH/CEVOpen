<p class="p">Antioxidant scavenging activity was studied using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH) assay as described by Blois [

After an incubation period of 30 min at 25 °C, the absorbance at 520 nm (the wavelength of maximum absorbance of DPPH) were recorded as A

 <disp-formula class="disp-formula"> % inhibition = 100 (A
