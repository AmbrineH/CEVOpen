<p class="p">The chloroquine-resistant FcB1-Columbia strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for chloroquine: 186 nM) was cultured continuously according to Trager and Jensen [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], with modifications [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for chloroquine were checked every 2 months, and we observed no significant variations. The parasites were maintained 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> in human red blood cells (O
 <sup class="sup">Â±</sup>; EFS; Toulouse, France), diluted to 4% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Emerainville, France) supplemented with 25 mM Hepes and 30 M NaHCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and complemented with 7% human AB
