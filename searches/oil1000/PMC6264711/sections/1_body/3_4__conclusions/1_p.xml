<p class="p">In conclusion, we have identified all volatile constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic> leaf essential oil and evaluated its anticancer, antimalarial, and antioxidant activities. Our results clearly showed that this essential oil was active against the tumor cell lines MCF-7 and the FcB1 strain of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum. </italic>Based on established correlations, compounds such as α-terpinolene, aromadendrene and β-selinene against MCF-7, could be the best candidates for further analysis. Purification of these compounds is under development to test them separately. In addition, an in depth study could determine the mechanisms by which these compounds exert their biological activities. The results presented here can be considered as the first information on the anticancer and antimalarial properties of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic>. This may also contribute to our knowledge of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Helichrysum</italic>. These 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> results provide some scientific validation for the widespread use of plants from this genus in traditional medicine.
