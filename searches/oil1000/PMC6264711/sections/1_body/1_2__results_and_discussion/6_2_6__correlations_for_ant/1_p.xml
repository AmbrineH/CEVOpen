<p class="p">We established correlations between both major and minor components and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (antimalarial activity). Calamenene showed the highest correlation R

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-16-08273-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Our results are in accordance with those of Van Zyl 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]; the former showed that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, limonene and β-pinene had low antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 205.20, 72 and 40.16 mg/L, respectively). Indeed, they also showed that there are significant synergies (the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations (∑FIC) &lt; 0.5) between 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and other compounds such as 
 <italic class="italic">E-</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-(±)-nerolidol, carvacrol and γ-terpinene (0.09, 0.02 and 0.37, respectively). We noticed that bicyclosesquiphellandrene (5.6%), α-amorphene (5.1%), bicyclogermacrene (5.0%), 2,3-dihydro-1,8-cineole (2.0%), and 2,3-di-
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl-phenol (0.5%) were present only in our essential oil. It is possible that these compounds may be involved in the activity of our essential oil.
