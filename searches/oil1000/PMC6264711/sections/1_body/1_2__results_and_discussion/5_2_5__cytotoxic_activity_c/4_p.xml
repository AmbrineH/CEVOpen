<p class="p">A deep study of the anticancer activity of aromadendrene, α-terpinolene, β-selinene, bicyclo-sesquiphellandrene, α-amorphene, 2,3-dihydro-1,8-cineole, calamenene, 2,3-di-
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butylphenol, bicyclogermacrene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene will have to be carried out to determine the origin of the anticancer activity of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic>. On the same target, we should evaluate the synergy between these compounds and their own contribution to the final anticancer activity.
