<p class="p">Cavalli 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] have shown that the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic> was dominated by 1,8-cineole (59.7%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (6.3%), α-pinene (4.9%), β-pinene (3.3%) and terpinen-4-ol (2.6%). These published compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic> essential oil indicated the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, which were not present in our work. On the other hand, we found more α-thujene (1%) and δ-cadinene (3.6%) compared to Cavalli 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively. For terpinen-4-ol, we obtained 2.6% which was similar to the result of Cavalli 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] (2.7%) but higher than the result of Mollenbeck 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] (1.3%). An intermediate concentration (4.3%) of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene was obtained compared to Cavalli 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and Mollenbeck 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], with 6.3% and 2.3%, respectively. On the other hand, β-pinene (1.1%) was obtained in the lowest concentration compared to these two studies of Cavalli 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and Mollenbeck 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] (3% and 2.7%, respectively).
