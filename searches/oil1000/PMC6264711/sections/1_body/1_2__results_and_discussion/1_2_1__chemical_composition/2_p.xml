Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were the major groups of compounds (32.4% and 54.0%, respectively), while oxygenated sesquiterpenes were not present. The major monoterpenes found were 1,8-cineole (47.4%),

Among the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons bicyclosesquiphellandrene (5.6%), γ-curcumene (5.6%), α-amorphene (5.1%) and bicyclogermacrene (5%) were present in appreciable quantities. On the other hand, this essential oil contained a phenolic compound (2,3-di-
