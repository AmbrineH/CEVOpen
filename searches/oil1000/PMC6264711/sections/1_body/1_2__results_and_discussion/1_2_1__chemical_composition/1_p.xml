<p class="p">The essential oil yield of H. 
 <italic class="italic">Gymnocephalum</italic> obtained from hydrodistillation of leaves was 0.40%. Two previous works have quantified the yield of this essential oil. They studied the shoot part of the plant mainly bark and leaves; extraction yields for essential oil were 0.5% and 0.41% according to Mollenbeck
