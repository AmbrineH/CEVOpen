<p class="p">Many studies on the antiplasmodial activity of crude essential oils have been reported [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro </italic>antiplasmodial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum</italic> essential oil was determined against the FcB1 chloroquine-resistant strain of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-16-08273-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The antimalarial activity of the essential oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values) was 25 ± 1 mg/L. Since the value of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was found between 5 and 50 mg/L, it can be considered that 
 <italic class="italic">H. gymnocephalum </italic>essential oil has a good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum </italic>[
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-16-08273" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This rather high value of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> compared to that of chloroquine (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.1 ± 0.09 mg/L) can be explained by the low concentration of the active compound(s) since the essential oil is a multi-components mixture.
