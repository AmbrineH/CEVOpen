<p class="p">To study the role of the various components of an essential oil in the biological activities obtained, we performed a complete survey of the activities and the percentage of compounds present in order to assign the origin of the activity. The aim of the study was to find correlations between each component present in our literature search of all essential oils of various plants tested for biological activities (anticancer and antimalarial). Correlations between our essential oil, other oils and their components are listed in
