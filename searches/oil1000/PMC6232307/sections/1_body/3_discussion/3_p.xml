<p class="p">The females of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> oviposit on mature leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, which should be a strategy to avoid the crushing of the egg cavities by the intense cell proliferation common in young developing leaves (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rivnay, 1935</xref>). Besides crushing the cavities, the hyperplasia of young leaf tissues should end up pushing eggs out of the leaf, which should not favor the establishment of the galling thrips and gall development. The ability of inducing galls on mature leaves rather than exclusively on young leaves, as is common for most galling insects, guarantees to the individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. a high availability of sites for completing their life cycles. However, the more differentiated is a cell, the less responsive it is. So, inducing galls on mature leaves may impose constraints for the differentiation of high-specialized cells, such as those of true nutritive tissues (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>). Nutritive cells may occur in some Thysanoptera galls (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ananthakrishnan and Raman, 1989</xref>), but they are absent in the galls induced by 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> studied here. The absence of a true nutritive tissue indicates that the galling 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> should feed on epidermal cell contents. Also, the reduced hypersensitive sites next to the oil glands in the galls on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> indicate that the 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> may access the cells of the oil glands and take advantage of its high energetic content. Taking into consideration the non-occurrence of secretory structures other than the oil glands in leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, we assume their potential for secreting the major portion of the VOCs.
