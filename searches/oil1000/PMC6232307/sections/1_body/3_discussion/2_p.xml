 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ananthakrishnan and Raman, 1989</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of oviposition has not been considered in gall induction of most galling Thysanoptera, since females of suborder Tubulifera lay their eggs externally to plant tissues. Comparatively, the ovipositor of most female Terebrantia is well-developed, and eggs are inserted in a cavity within mesophyll cells. Although this endophytic process has been shown by almost all phytophagous Terebrantia, only three thrips species are reported as capable of causing plant cell responses and gall induction through oviposition (
