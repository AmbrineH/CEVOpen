<p class="p">The detection of methyl salicylate (#42) in the samples of galls had also been related to acquired resistance and indirect plant defense (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oates et al., 2016</xref>). Methyl salicylate is a plant semiochemical related to stress signaling (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pickett et al., 2006</xref>), and it is generally described as anti-herbivoric, attractive to beneficial insects that would kill herbivores (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bruinsma et al., 2009</xref>), and as a pheromone (

 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, the production of methyl salicylate neither affected the life cycle of the inducing thrips nor attracted natural enemies, since individuals in several stages of life occurred inside the galls, and the rate of hyperparasitism was apparently low in comparison to other Neotropical systems (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carneiro et al., 2013</xref>). Such inability of methyl salicylate as an anti-herbivore substance may be effect of its low concentration and consequently its limited potential to stimulate the galling thrips responses, crucial for attractiveness or repellency (
