<p class="p">The effect of gall induction on other host plant organs, by the production of secondary metabolites, including volatile compounds, may represent an indirect defense of the plant (

Despite of their simple molecular structures, the alcohols and aldehydes deriving from the lypoxygenase (LOX) pathway, methyl salicylate, and 3-hexenyl butanoate of low molecular weight pertaining to the GLV class were detected in the samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. galls on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, and can act as signaling molecules in plant-herbivore interactions (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Damasceno et al., 2010</xref>). The chemical signaling between 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> and its associated galling herbivores may be mediated by some of the terpenes detected in samples of galled leaves. The monoterpenes (geraniol) and the sesquiterpenes may play an attractive role for the adult female of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp., as proposed for 
 <italic class="italic">Frankliniella occidentalis</italic>, a generalist phytophagous species found worldwide (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koschier et al., 2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The geraniol and sesquiterpenes-mediated attraction is yet to be tested for the four galling herbivores reported on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> on PESV (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Portugal-Santana and Isaias, 2014</xref>). The decreasing concentration of δ-muurolene (#67), β-elemene (#58) and α-caryophyllene (#63) in the samples from which the galling thrips were removed (cLRG) could be an indicative that the individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. were manipulating 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> metabolism and assimilating some of these secondary metabolites.
