 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">James and Chem, 2005</xref>). Such inference is based on the ability of the inducers to stimulate host plant responses, which trigger local reactions, and may interfere directly with the insect communication with its host plant (

 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> at the PESV, there is one plant individual, which has never associated to 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. The lowest content observed in the chemical profile of this individual of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, the aforementioned control individual, and the highest content observed in the general composite of the non-galled leaves (NGL) of the other individuals in the population indicates that the galling activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. may have caused long-distance effects (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mani, 1964</xref>) over the population of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>. The secondary effects or tele-effects were first described for galls induced in roots, but causing changes in flowers of the host plant,
