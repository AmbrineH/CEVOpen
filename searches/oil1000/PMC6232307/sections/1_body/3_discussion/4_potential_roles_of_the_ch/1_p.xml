<p class="p">Currently, the second step of investigation revealed that gall induction and establishment caused alterations in the density and area of the oil glands, which are larger in galls than in the non-galled leaves. The increased size of the oil glands indicates an enhancement in the potential for the production of volatiles in galled condition. Such potential can provide a favorable microenvironment to the galling
