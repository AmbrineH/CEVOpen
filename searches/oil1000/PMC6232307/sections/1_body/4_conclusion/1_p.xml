<p class="p">The rare event of gall induction by the Terebrantia studied here revealed mesophyll compactness and formation of air cavities as new features, first described for the Neotropical Thysanoptera-induced galls. The structural profile of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> non-galled leaves and galls revealed that the main alteration regards the number and size of the oil glands. As the only secretory structure differentiated in leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, the oil glands should be the main secretory sites responsible for the peculiar chemical profile of the analyzed samples. The main alteration in GLVs concentration in response to 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. activity indicates the GLVs as possible stress biomarkers involved in the host plant-galling Thysanoptera signaling. Moreover, the methyl salicylate in the composite of the non-galled individual reveals a potential plant resistance stimulated as a long-distance effect. In addition to the signaling effects of the volatile compounds produced by the non-galled leaves and the galls on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic>, it can be hypothesized that the individuals of the galling 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. may have captured, incorporated, and metabolized some of these VOCs. This hypothesis is based on the increased levels of some sesquiterpenes detected in the composites containing the galling thrips in comparison to the composites without thrips.
