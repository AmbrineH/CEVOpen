<p class="p">Our study focuses on a rolling gall morphotype induced by a tiny Thripinae, an undescribed species of 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> (suborder Terebrantia) on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> (Sw) DC, and it aimed to (1) characterize gall anatomical structure to elucidate how the host plant cell an tissue responses lead to the rolling of leaf lamina; (2) quantify the number and area of the essential oil-producing glands in order to determine whether the gall induction alters the host leaf potential for the production of volatiles; and (3) trace the composition of the volatile compounds emitted by non-galled leaves of a plant totally free of galls (the control individual), by non-galled leaves of galled plants, and by 
 <italic class="italic">Nexothrips</italic> sp. galls to detect possible biomarkers of the biotic stress related to gall induction and establishment.
