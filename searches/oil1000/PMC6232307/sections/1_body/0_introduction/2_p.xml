<p class="p">Along the process of gall induction and the establishment of the galling organism within plant tissues, the plant reacts to the presence of the parasite and chemical signaling mechanisms initiate. Such phenomenon of chemical signaling on plant-herbivore interactions has been widely explored for free-living insects (
