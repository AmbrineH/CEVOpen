<p class="p">For the analysis of oil glands, non-galled leaves (NGL) and mature rolling galls (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20 per sample) were clarified in 50% potassium hydroxide until complete bleaching, washed in water (three times), stained with 1% safranin in 95% ethanol, and dehydrated in ethanolic series (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bersier and Bocquet, 1960</xref>). The slides were mounted with varnish Acrilex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paiva et al., 2006</xref>), and the images were obtained with a photomicroscope (Leica ICC50 HP
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>). The number of glands per area (8.00/mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was counted, and the relative area of the glands on non-galled leaves and rolling galls was measured using the AxioVision 7.4 software (Carl Zeiss
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). Statistical analyzes were performed using the SigmaStat
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> software, and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test was applied considering 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05.
