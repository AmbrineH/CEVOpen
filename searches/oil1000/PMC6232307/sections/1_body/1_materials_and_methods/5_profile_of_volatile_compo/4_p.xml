<p class="p">Peaks in the total ion current chromatograms (TICC) were tentatively identified comparing the experimentally acquired mass spectra and the NIST08 mass spectral library, with minimal mass spectra match threshold of 80%. In addition, retention indices (RI) were determined using data obtained from an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkane solution (C8â€“C28), and compared to RI reported in the literature. For sesquiterpenes, whenever an appropriate match between mass spectra library hit and retention index was not found, only the family group was designated, according to their mass spectra fragmentation. Relative amounts, as percentages of each component, were achieved by peak area normalization measured without any correction factor. The response obtained for the internal standard 1,4-cineole, measured as area counts, was utilized to monitor possible drifts in instrumental response (
