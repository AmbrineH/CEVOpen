<p class="p">Volatile profiles were obtained by extracting the compounds from the samples employing HS-SPME with subsequent analyses by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Souza Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, 20 mL vial containing 0.025 g of powdered plant material was taken from the ultrafreezer just before extraction. Immediately, 2 μL of internal standard (aqueous solution of 1,4-cineole at 100 ng μL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was added to the sample with the use of a 10 μL Hamilton syringe pierced through the vial cap septum, without opening the vial cap. Subsequently, each sample vial was pre-incubated on a home-made heating block at 30 ± 2°C, without agitation, for 30 min prior to exposure of the SPME fiber to the vial HS. After 15 min of extraction, the fiber was desorbed into the GC injector at 240 °C for 15 min. Upon desorption of the volatile compounds, the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with a Shimadzu 2010Q-Plus GC/MS equipment equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm).
