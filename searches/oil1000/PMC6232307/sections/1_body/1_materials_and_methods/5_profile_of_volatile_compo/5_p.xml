<p class="p">The final data matrix containing the relative percentages of each identified peak was submitted to statistical analysis. All analyses were performed assuming 95% level of confidence (Î± = 0.05). Since the chromatographic response (area) for each compound had already been normalized, no further data normalization or transformation was performed, and scaling of the data was performed using Pareto scaling (mean-centered and divided by the square root of standard deviation of each variable) in order to give all variables equal weight regardless their absolute value. This procedure is especially useful to generate a sound statistical analysis since the levels of the volatile compounds found may be of very different orders of magnitude. After data pre-processing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), heat map with hierarchical clustering, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were performed using web-based metabolomic data processing tool MetaboAnalyst

 </sup>. PCA was used to detect intrinsic clusters and outliers within the data set, while PLS-DA maximized class discrimination.
