<p class="p">The galls are green with the rolling movement of leaf lamina upward, along both sides of the midrib (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>). Galling thrips in several stages of life occur inside the galls, but parasitoids and predators are rare. Hypersensitive reactive spots form in response to the feeding activity of the thrips in the epidermis and mesophyll (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>). The number of secretory cavities increases and the cells of the epithelium are hypertrophied (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1D</xref>). The spongy parenchyma is 5–7 layered and compact due to a reduction of intercellular spaces. Large air cavities are evident within mesophyll cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1E</xref>). The oviposition takes place inside leaf tissues, where the larvae develop. Later on, the immature thrips hatch out of the tissues (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A–D</xref>) and start feeding.
