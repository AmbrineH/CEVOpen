<p class="p">Even though the four groups could be successfully separated into two classes (PCs 1 and 2 explain 78% of variance in the data), the 25 most discriminating VOCs show that there is a clear distinction between the profile of the groups within a class, i.e., between the Ctrl and the NGL samples, and between the cLRG and the LRGwT (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). The main compounds responsible for the separation of the groups are 2-
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-hexenal (#14), sesquiterpene 5 (#64), β-caryophyllene (#61), and β-bourborene (#56) that are upregulated in the leaves of non-galled samples, and methyl salicylate (#42), 3-
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-hexen-1-ol (#15), 2-
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-hexen-1-ol (#16) and 1-hexanol (#17), which are upregulated in the samples of galls (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). In fact, there were significant distinguishing features between the control sample (Ctrl) and the non-galled leaves of galled individuals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). Contrastingly, to the higher levels of sesquiterpenes in the samples of the control individual, there were increased levels of aldehydes in the non-galled samples of galled individuals, mainly of the C6 aldehydes from GLV class.
