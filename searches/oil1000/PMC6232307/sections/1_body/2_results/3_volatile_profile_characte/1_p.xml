<p class="p">A total of 84 compounds were aligned across all samples. Twelve compounds were tentatively identified only as sesquiterpenes due to their characteristic mass spectra fragmentation pattern, inconsistencies between NIST library hit, experimental retention indexes and literature retention indexes. The complete identification of 72 metabolites was possible according to their retention indexes (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The 36 sesquiterpenes constitute the major class of the identified compounds, followed by monoterpenes (12), alcohols (10), aldehydes (10), esters (5), aromatic compounds (5), ketones (3), and hydrocarbon (1). Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), comprising low molecular weight oxygenated compounds, amounted to 17 compounds.
