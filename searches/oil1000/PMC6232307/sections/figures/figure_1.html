 <p> Non-galled leaves and galls induced on leaves of Myrcia splendens by an undescribed species of Nexothrips (suborder Terebrantia) (A) Non-galled leaves and stem branch with leaf rolling galls. (B) Anatomy of non-galled leaves, evidencing the mesophyll and oil glands. (C) Gall mesophyll, evidencing the hypersensitive reaction in response to the inducer’s feeding activity. (D) Anatomy of a gall, evidencing the increased number of secretory cavities. (E) Gall mesophyll, evidencing the reduction of intercellular spaces and air cavities. Arrowhead: Non-galled leaves, Dashed: Rolling gall, OG: Oil gland, OV: Oviposition, HR: Hypersensitive area, Arrow: Air cavities Scale bars: A: 2 cm, B, C, E: 50 μm; D: 200 μm. </p>
