<p class="p">It is observed that the unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and oleic) account for most of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> pulp and seed oils. It is also noted that linoleic and oleic acids are the major fatty acids in peanut, soy beans and lentil [
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The pulp oil has the highest content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs); that is, oleic acid (C18:1) (22.31%). Various studies indicate that a diet rich in oleic acid decreases the development of atherosclerosis and lowers serum cholesterol by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators while promoting antioxidant defenses [
