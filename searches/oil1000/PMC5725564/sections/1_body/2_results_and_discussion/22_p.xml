<p class="p">The unsaponifiable matter of the oil samples were 1.63% (pulp) and 2.54% (seed). These values are low especially in the pulp oil, which indicate that the oil sample is pure because most fats and oils of normal purity contained less than 2% of unsaponifiable matter [

 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> oil implies good shelf-life characteristics. The viscosities of the investigated oils were 9.15 and 10.62 in pulp and seed oils, respectively. Oils with low viscosity value indicate that they are light and so probably highly unsaturated. The high value might be as a result of suspended particles still present in the crude oil sample. Kinematic viscosity increases with FA chain length and with increasing degree of saturation of either the fatty acid or alcohol moiety in a fatty ester [
