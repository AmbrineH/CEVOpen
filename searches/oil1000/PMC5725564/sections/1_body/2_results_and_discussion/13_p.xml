 </bold>. From the result, the seed oil contained the highest concentration of total phospholipids, 771.80 mg/100g as compared to 292.46 mg/100g for pulp oil. Phosphatidycholine (PC) had the highest value of 351.82 mg/100g in seed sample while phosphatidylinositol (PI) showed a greater concentration with the value of 176.69 mg/100g in pulp sample. PC is usually the most abundant phospholipid in animals and plants, often amounting to almost 50% of the total, and as such it is obviously a key building block of membrane bilayers. In particular, it makes up a very high proportion of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. It is also said to be the principal phospholipid circulating in plasma, where it is an integral component of the lipoproteins, especially the HDL, as it is regarded as the only phospholipid necessary for lipoprotein assembly and secretion [

PI is an important lipid, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes in all plants and animals, both directly and via a number of metabolites. The inositol phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol) are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules in animal and plant cells, trough the action of a family of highly specific enzymes collectively known as phospholipase C. They regulate the activity of a group of at least a dozen related enzymes known as protein kinase C, which in turn control many key cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis. In addition to that, inositol phospholipids appear to have crucial roles in interfacial binding of proteins and in the regulation of proteins at the cell interface [
