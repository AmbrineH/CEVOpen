  <sub class="sub">3</sub>) nanoparticles with enhanced complex permittivity properties have been incorporated as a filler in a polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix reinforced with oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) fiber for microwave absorption applications. The complex permittivity values were improved by reducing the particle sizes to the nano scale via high-energy ball milling for 12 h. A total of 5–20 wt.% recycled α-Fe

  <sub class="sub">3</sub>/OPEFB/PCL nanocomposites were examined for their complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties via the open ended coaxial (OEC) technique and the transmission/reflection line measurement using a microstrip connected to a two-port vector network analyzer. The microstructural analysis of the samples included X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At 1 GHz, the real (
