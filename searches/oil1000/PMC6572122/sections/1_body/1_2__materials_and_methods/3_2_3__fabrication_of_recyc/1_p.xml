<p class="p">The recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/OPEFB/PCL nanocomposites were fabricated by mixing 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% mass percentages of recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanoparticles with PCL and OPEFB fiber at a fixed mass ratio of 3:7 through the melt blend technique using Brabender Plastograph twin screw extruder (Model 815651, Brabender GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Duisburg, Germany) at a temperature of 65 °C. The blended nanocomposites were then hot pressed at a pressure of 110 kg/cm² into 6 cm × 3.6 cm × 0.70 cm pellets for characterization. The synthesis process is as depicted in
