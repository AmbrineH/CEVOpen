<p class="p">The size, shape and arrangement of the particles were investigated using the JEM-2100F high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The HRTEM images were processed with the ImageJ software (Version 1.50i, NIH, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA, 2016) to obtain the particle size distribution. The dispersion of recycled α-Fe

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the samples was carried out with the Perkin Elmer Spectrum100 FTIR Spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) within the wavelength range of 400–4000 cm
