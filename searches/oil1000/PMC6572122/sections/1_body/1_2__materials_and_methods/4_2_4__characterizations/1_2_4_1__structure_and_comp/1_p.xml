 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a fully automated Philips X-pert system (Model PW3040/60 MPD, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with Cu-Kα radiation operating at a voltage of 40.0 kV, a current of 40.0 mA and at a wavelength of 1.5405 Å. The diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10–80° with scanning speed of 2 °/min. All data were subjected to the Rietveld analysis on PANalytic X’Pert Highscore Plus v3.0 software (PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands). The samples were identified by comparing their diffraction peaks with the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).
