<p class="p">The complex permittivity measurements were carried out at room temperature in the 1â€“4 GHz range using Agilent 85070B open ended coaxial (OEC) dielectric probe connected to the Agilent N5230A PNA-L Network Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). This technique is appropriate for complex permittivity determination for liquids, semi-solids and solids having flat and smooth surfaces and with a gap-free contact between the probe surface and the materials. A standard one-port, short-air-water calibration was undertaken and a reference standard material (unfilled polytetrafluoroethylene) was characterized to confirm the accuracy of the calibration. The powdered samples were compressed into sample holders to a thickness of 6 mm. Measurements were taken by pressing the probe flat onto the surfaces of the samples while ensuring air-gap free contact throughout the process. The measurement set-up is as illustrated in
