<p class="p">The reflection coefficient (S
 <sub class="sub">11</sub>) and transmission coefficient (S
 <sub class="sub">21</sub>) of the nanocomposites were measured using the transmission/reflection line technique based on RT duriod 5880 microstrip (length = 6.0 cm, width 5.0 cm, thickness 0.15 cm) connected to a two-port Anritsu MS 2024B VNA Master (Anritsu Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan). A standard calibration (Short, Open and Load) was performed to ensure accuracy of data acquisition. The measurements were carried out by placing the samples flat onto the surface of the microstrip while avoiding any air gap with the strip line. The variation in reflection loss (dB) with frequency in the 1â€“4 GHz range was then investigated.
