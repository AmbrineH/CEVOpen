The milling was performed at room temperature for 12 h using SPEX Sample Prep 8000D High-energy Ball Mill (SPEX SamplePrep LLC, Metuchen, NJ, USA) fitted with a 1425 rpm and 50 Hz motor operating at a clamp speed of 875 cycles/minute and a powder-to-ball ratio of 1:5. For every 50 min of milling, the steel vials were opened for 2 min so as to avoid transforming α-Fe
