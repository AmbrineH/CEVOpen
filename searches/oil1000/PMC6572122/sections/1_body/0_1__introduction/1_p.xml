<p class="p">The sharp growth in the electronics industry spanning the microwave frequency range and its associated electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem has led to intensified research into the development of microwave absorbing materials to reduce the impact of EMI. In recent years, ferriteâ€“polymer composites based on spinel or hexagonal ferrites and non-degradable polymer matrices such as epoxy resin [
