 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was recycled from mill scale and the particle size reduced to the nanosize through high-energy ball milling in order to enhance the dielectric loss properties. A total of 5–20 wt.% recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanofiller loadings were incorporated into OPEFB fiber/PCL matrix to fabricate nanocomposites using the melt–blend technique followed by hot molding. The samples were then evaluated for their complex permittivity and microwave reflection loss properties in the 1–4 GHz range.
