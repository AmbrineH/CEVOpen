<p class="p">Ferrites have attracted a lot of attention in microwave absorber development in view of their excellent electrical and magnetic properties, and are often synthesized through multi-staged chemical techniques such as sol–gel [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], co-precipitation [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], solid-state [
 <xref rid="B2-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and hydrothermal [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] reactions. Among the less extensively used ferrites for microwave absorption applications is hematite (α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), a ferrite (corundum-type oxide) which is stable under ambient conditions with unique electrical and magnetic properties. Recently, α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was successfully synthesized from industrial mill scale waste material [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] through a low-cost technique. Recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is cheap, reduces environmental pollution and its generally low dielectric loss properties [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] can be enhanced by reducing the particles to the nanosize for use in polymer composites for microwave absorption applications.
