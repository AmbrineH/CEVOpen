Carbon bio-based materials from agricultural waste can serve as a low-cost and eco-friendly alternative to the often-used carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene. Abdalhadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported in a recent study that compressed oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) fiber of 100 μm grain size possessed a high loss factor in the 1–4 GHz range. Moreover, OPEFB is an abundant waste material generated by the oil palm industries and the biodegradable fiber has low density, good mechanical and thermal properties. Reinforcing materials with OPEFB fiber could reduce cost, improve dielectric loss properties, enhance thermal stability and improve rigidity. OPEFB fiber and ferrites are easily blended with polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL), as demonstrated in a study by Ahmad et al. [
