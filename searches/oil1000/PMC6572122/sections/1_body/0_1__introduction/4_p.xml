<p class="p">PCL is a fully biodegradable polymer, easy to blend, lightweight, non-toxic and has good dielectric characteristics. Biodegradable composites reduce the effect on the environment when they are no longer in use since they can be broken down by micro-organisms. By combining a biodegradable polymer with recycled Î±-Fe
