 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles were loosely formed, randomly shaped and bulky. However, after 12 h of high-energy ball milling, nanoparticles with distinct aggregation and agglomeration were formed. The agglomeration could be due to higher particle–particle interaction arising from the increased specific surface area [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The nanoparticles were largely spherical and the sizes ranged from 10.3 to 24.45 nm with an average of 16.2 nm, consistent with the estimated crystallite sizes from the XRD analysis. The variations of the particle size with milling time for the recycled α-Fe
