<p class="p">FTIR spectroscopy was performed to establish the functional groups present in recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanoparticles, OPEFB fiber and PCL in order to identify the type of the interaction that exists in the nanocomposites. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00918-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the spectrum for α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> shows characteristic peaks at 507 and 420 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> which can be ascribed to Fe–O stretching/vibrational modes [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The pure PCL spectrum indicates characteristic peaks at 727, 1168, 1366, 1720 and 2940 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> consistent with similar studies [
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The spectrum for OPEFB portrays a characteristic absorption band at 3325 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> which could be related to O–H stretching vibration [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Characteristic peaks were also found at 1635 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> attributed to absorbed water by cellulose, 2919 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C–H stretching vibration) and 1029 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C–O stretching). It is evident that the spectra for α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/OPEFB/PCL nanocomposites comprise the characteristic peaks and bands of α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanofiller, PCL polymer and OPEFB fiber. The absence of any significantly new bands or changes in the peak positions in the spectra of the nanocomposites shows that there was no strong interaction between the recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanofiller, PCL polymer and OPEFB fiber. The FTIR results, therefore, suggest that the mixture of recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanoparticles, OPEFB fiber and PCL to form the nanocomposites was physical in nature.
