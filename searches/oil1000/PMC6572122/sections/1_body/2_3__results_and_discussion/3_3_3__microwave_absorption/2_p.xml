 <xref rid="polymers-11-00918-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the most prominent band was located around 2.4 GHz where the minimum value reached −24.2 dB and the maximum −21.5 dB. All the 
 <italic class="italic">RL</italic> values for the nanocomposites were also found to be less than −10 dB (90% absorption) with the 20 wt.% nanocomposites obtaining the lowest value. The improvement in the absorption capacity of the nanocomposites could be related to their high dielectric loss properties as a result of the combined effect of enhanced polarization attributed to the recycled α-Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/OPEFB/PCL nanocomposites are capable of significant microwave absorption and would serve as a cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative for applications within the investigated frequency range.
