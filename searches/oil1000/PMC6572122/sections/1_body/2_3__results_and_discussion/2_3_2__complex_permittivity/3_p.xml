 <sub class="sub">3</sub> nanofiller and OPEFB fiber contributed to the nanocomposites exhibiting higher permittivity values with increased loadings, in agreement with the results of other inorganic/organic-polymer matrix composites [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Complex permittivity properties of a material largely depend on contributions of various forms of polarizations such as interfacial, atomic, orientation and electronic. However, the inclusion of OPEFB fiber in the PCL matrix expectedly enhanced the combined effect of orientation polarization and interfacial polarization [
