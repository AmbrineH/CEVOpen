<p class="p">In order to investigate the dielectric properties of the recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles, compacted samples were characterized for their real (
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic>) and imaginary (
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic>) parts of the relative complex permittivity (
 <italic class="italic">ε* = ε′</italic> – 
 <italic class="italic">jε″</italic>). Compacting the samples decreased the void and eliminated air gaps likely to affect the results. The dielectric properties of recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles were examined for reduced particle size dependency, and the variation with frequency is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00918-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. Generally, 
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic> of the recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles decreased with increase in frequency, a trend common with ferrites and explained based on the Maxwell–Wenger polarization model [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00918" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic> values, however, depicted an increasing profile with frequency, consistent with the OEC calibration profile of water in the studied frequency range. Additionally, both 
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic> values showed instabilities in their profiles due to impedance mismatch between the input impedance of the OEC probe and the surface impedance of the compacted samples arising from surface imperfections and voids. The 16.2 nm recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles had higher 
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic> values than the 1.73 μm particles throughout the 1–4 GHz range. The 
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic> of the 16.2 nm particles varied from 12.75 to 12.03 while the 
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic> were between 0.40 and 0.54. For the 1.73 μm recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles, the 
 <italic class="italic">ε′</italic> ranged from 7.88 to 7.54 while the 
 <italic class="italic">ε″</italic> values varied between 0.14 and 0.51. These results demonstrate that the complex permittivity of recycled α-Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> particles are significantly enhanced when the particle sizes are reduced to a nanosize.
