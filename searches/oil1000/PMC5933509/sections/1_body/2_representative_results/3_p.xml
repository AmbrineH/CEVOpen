<p class="p">Self-assembly driven by the nanoaggregation of a hydrazide-functionalized PNIPAM polymer in a heated solution followed by crosslinking with an aldehyde-functionalized PNIPAM polymer results in highly monodisperse nanogels (polydispersity &lt;0.1) on the size range of 180-300 nm, depending on the process conditions used (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>. The nanogels retain the typical thermoresponsive behavior of conventional free-radical crosslinked PNIPAM nanogels, with lower degrees of thermal deswelling observed as more cross-linking polymer was added (
