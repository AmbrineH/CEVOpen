<p class="p">Microfluidics leads to the formation of well-defined gel microparticles on the size scale of 25-100 Âµm, with the size controllable based on the flow rates of the oil and/or the combined aqueous polymer phases (

Hot stage optical microscopy confirms that the gel microparticles maintain the thermoresponsive nature of the bulk hydrogels, showing reversible temperature-dependent swelling-deswelling with only a slight hysteresis on cycle 1 (attributable to irreversible hydrogen bond formation between neighboring amide groups in the collapsed state
