 <bold class="bold">: Properties of degradable nanofibers from reactive electrospinning.</bold> (A) Scanning electron microscopy images of nanofibers in the dry state (left), half dipped in water (middle, thin film), and fully soaked in water overnight (right, thick scaffold); (B) Swelling of nanofibrous hydrogel (red) relative to a bulk hydrogel (blue) of the same composition, with error bars representing the standard deviation of n=4 replicates; (C) Scanning electron microscopy and (inset) visual images tracking the acid-catalyzed degradation of nanofibers in 1M HCl; (D) Tensile cycling of dry (80 cycles, 20% elongation/cycle) and swollen (325 cycles, 10% elongation/cycle in 10 mM PBS) electrospun nanofibrous hydrogels.
