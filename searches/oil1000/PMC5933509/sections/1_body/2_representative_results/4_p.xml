<p class="p">Reactive electrospinning creates a nanofibrous hydrogel structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>
 <bold class="bold">A</bold>), with nanofiber diameters on the order of ~300 nm achievable without visible electrosprayed particles present
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>. Soaking the POEGMA-based nanofibers in water results in rapid hydration (roughly two orders of magnitude faster than achieved with a bulk gel of the same composition, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>
 <bold class="bold">B</bold>) but maintains the nanofibrous morphology over 8-10 weeks prior to hydrolytic degradation at physiological conditions; faster degradation is observed in acid-catalyzed environments, as expected due to the potential for acid-catalyzed hydrazone bond degradation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>
 <bold class="bold">C</bold>). The nanofibrous structures are also mechanically robust in both the dry and swollen states over multiple cycles, enabling easy handling and repetitive straining (
