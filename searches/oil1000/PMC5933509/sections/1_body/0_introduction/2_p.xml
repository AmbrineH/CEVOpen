Furthermore, by maintaining the molecular weight of the pre-polymers used to prepare the hydrogels below the renal filtration limit, hydrogels made using this approach degrade back into the oligomeric precursor polymers that can be cleared from the body

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, this approach offers a potentially translatable method for the use of thermoresponsive smart hydrogels in medicine, particularly if well-controlled degradable analogues of such hydrogels on all length scales (bulk, micro, and nano) can be fabricated.
