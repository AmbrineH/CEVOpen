<p class="p">To create degradable gel particles on the nanoscale, a thermally-driven reactive self-assembly method is described in which a solution of one of the reactive precursor polymers (the "seed" polymer) is heated above its LCST to form a stable nanoaggregate that is subsequently crosslinked by the addition of the complementary reactive precursor polymer (the "crosslinking" polymer); the resulting hydrazone crosslinked nanogel has a size templated directly by the nanoaggregate (
