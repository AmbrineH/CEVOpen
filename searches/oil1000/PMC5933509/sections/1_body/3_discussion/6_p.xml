<p class="p">The choice of oil was critical to the success of this protocol, as heavier oils (favorable in terms of preventing gel microparticle agglomeration after collection) led to much less consistent particle formation at the nozzle than the light silicone oil reported in the protocol. We hypothesize this reduced reproducibility is a result of lower consistency of syringe pumping of heavier oils, leading to more variable shear at the mixing point. Avoiding gel microparticle aggregation in the collection flask was also a challenge, particularly immediately at the exit from the microfluidic device at which point 
 <italic class="italic">in situ </italic>gelation was not complete and large numbers of available reactive functional groups were available to form bridges between colliding particles in the collection bath. This challenge is addressed by: increasing the length of the exit channel on the microfluidic chip itself, maintaining the gel microparticles in laminar flow for a longer period of time to promote more complete gelation; adding the side channels after the nozzle to feed more oil into the chip and thus better separate the gel microparticles in this post-mixing channel without affecting the shear fields at the nozzle itself or the particle production rate; and adding a magnetic mixer to the collection flask to avoid gel microparticle sedimentation and maintain a larger average separation between adjacent particles. While very slow gelling polymers would likely improve the device stability and minimize issues with priming, such systems also were observed to significantly increase the risk of gel microparticle aggregation, as a larger number of reactive functional groups remains unreacted (and thus able to form inter-particle bridges) over a longer period of time. As such, gelation times on the order of 15-60 s appear to be optimal for this technique: slow enough to enable priming but fast enough to ensure most reactive functional groups are consumed prior to the gel microparticles exiting the laminar flow channel into the collection flask.
