<p class="p">Interestingly, depending on the method used to prepare the different morphologies, significant differences have been observed in the degradation times of hydrogels prepared from the same hydrogel precursors. For example, POEGMA nanofibrous hydrogels degrade slower than bulk POEGMA hydrogels with the same composition despite their significantly higher surface area and thus access to water to hydrolyze the hydrazone bonds. We relate these differences to the inherent contrasts between the described protocols in terms of the geometry of mixing the precursor polymers, which may lead to internal gel homogeneities and/or morphologies that are significantly different and/or the

While this may somewhat complicate the choice of the precursor polymers if one polymer is targeted for use in each protocol, it may also offer a technical opportunity in terms of making hydrogels with one chemical composition but very different physical properties.
