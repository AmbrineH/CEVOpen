<p class="p">To achieve low polydispersities, the colloidal stability and the degree of hydration of the nanoaggregate appear to be the key variables. For example, nanoaggregates prepared using the more hydrophilic hydrazide-functionalized polymers as the seed as opposed to the less hydrophilic aldehyde-functionalized polymers lead to nanogels with significantly lower polydispersities. The difference between the experimental assembly temperature and the LCST of the seed polymer is also critical. Operating at a temperature just above the seed polymer LCST ((T - LCST) &lt; 5 °C) offers the highest probability of monodisperse nanogel formation; operating well above the LCST creates more hydrophobic and collapsed nanoaggregates that are more likely to aggregate and less likely to crosslink, while operating below the LCST results in a relatively non-compact seed polymer that cannot be effectively or reproducibly crosslinked. For the best prediction of particle monodispersity, we recommend first performing a UV/vis scan to measure the onset LCST of the seed polymer and subsequently performing the self-assembly process at a temperature 1-2 °C above that LCST.</p>
