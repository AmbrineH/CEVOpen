<p class="p">Overall, the methods described provide a strategy for fabricating degradable (or at least renally clearable) analogues of thermoresponsive polymers on multiple length scales (bulk, micro, and nano) and with multiple types of internal structures (particles or fibers). Such protocols address the key barriers to the successful translation of conventionally-prepared synthetic thermoresponsive materials to the biomedical field: injectability and degradability. We are continuing to explore the application of such materials in both drug delivery and tissue engineering applications ranging from the physical targeting of cancers, the transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier, the therapeutic delivery of proteins at the back of the eye, the directional growth of tissues, and the thermoreversible adhesion and differentiation of cells, among other applications.</p>
