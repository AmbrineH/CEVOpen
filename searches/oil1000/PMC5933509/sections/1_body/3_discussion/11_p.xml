 <bold class="bold">Nanofibrous hydrogels via reactive electrospinning</bold> Controlling the gelation time of the reactive pre-polymers is again essential to the success of gel nanofiber production. In particular, approximately matching the residence time of the precursor polymers in the static mixer (controlled by changing the flow rate of solution from the double-barrel syringe as well as the length and tortuosity of the static mixer) with the bulk gelation time of the precursor polymers is essential both to preserve spinnability as well as ensure effective crosslinking of the spun fibers between the needle and the collector. Faster gelation leads to ineffective Taylor cone development and thus poor spinnability, while slower gelation results in an aqueous solution instead of a gel hitting the collector, resulting in spreading and the ultimate formation of a thin film gel instead of nanofibers. Working at residence times slightly below the bulk gelation time has also been found to be effective (and indeed preferable to reduce the risk of needle clogging) since water evaporation as the solution is spun effectively concentrates the precursor polymers in the stream and thus accelerates gelation kinetics during the spinning process. In this same vein, operating at higher needle-to-collector distances (&gt;10 cm) is generally favorable in this process, as shorter distances reduce the time available for water evaporation and thus require more stringent control over the relationship between residence time and gelation time in order to preserve a nanofibrous product.
