 <bold class="bold">Bulk hydrogels via double barrel syringe co-extrusion</bold> Gelation time is the key variable to control to ensure the efficacy of the double barrel syringe technique for forming bulk hydrogels. Polymers that gel too fast upon contact (&lt;1-2 s) can clog the static mixer, either stopping flow entirely or resulting in non-stoichiometric amounts of the two precursor polymers being extruded from the syringe. We have found that gelation times &gt;5 s are preferable (although not required) for the use of this technique; this is particularly important if replicate hydrogels are being cast for physical or mechanical analysis to ensure that each hydrogel cast has the same composition. Gelation time can be easily altered by changing the density of reactive functional groups on one or both precursor polymers (lower functional group density leading to slower gelation) or changing the concentration of the precursor polymers used to form the gel (lower concentrations leading to slower gelation)

Alternately, replacing the (more reactive) aldehyde group with the (less reactive) ketone group as the electrophile in the gelling pair significantly reduces the gelation time without significantly changing the composition of the resulting hydrogel
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>; polymers prepared with mixtures of aldehyde and ketone monomeric precursors can be used to tune the gelation time as desired without changing the concentration of precursor polymers used (and thus the mass percentage of solids in the resulting gel formed).
