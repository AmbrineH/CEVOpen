<p class="p">Regarding ML model derived on the biofilm inhibition capability of EOs the compounds more responsible for biofilm production modulation were found to be 3-octanol,

 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and β-phellandrene (

On the contrary o-cymene and β-phellandrene were associated to a negative action on the inhibition. This could be speculated as a sort of anti-synergic effect that could balance EOs’ potencies.
