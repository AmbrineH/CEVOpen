<p class="p">The development of anti-biofilm agents is therefore considered of major interest and represents an important strategy since non-biocidal molecules to avoid the rapid appearance of resistant mutants are highly valuable. Among bacteria, staphylococci are prevalent causes of biofilm-associated infections [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In particular, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious diseases in humans, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to invasive infections of the bloodstream, heart, lungs and other organs [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In 2013, Nicholson et al. reported that 30% of U.S. population was colonized by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> while 1.5% was found to be a carrier of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), a major cause of healthcare-related infections responsible for a significant proportion of nosocomial infections worldwide. Recently in the U.S. deaths from MRSA infections have exceeded those from many other infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS [

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>), conventionally considered a commensal of human skin, can cause significant problems when breaching the epithelial barrier, especially during biofilm-associated infection of indwelling medical devices [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Most diseases caused by 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> exhibit a chronic profile and occur as device-related infections (such as intravascular catheter or prosthetic joint infections) and/or their complications [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In view of the above scenario the scientific community is seeking for new agents endowed of anti-biofilm capabilities to fight 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S epidermidis</italic> infections. Recently, several reports indicated in vitro efficacy of non-biocidal essential oils (EOs) as promising treatment to reduce bacterial biofilm production and prevent the inducing of drug resistance [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In different applications, EOs have been found of some efficacy in reducing biofilm production of either 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> standard strains or MRSA [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In other reports, EOs and some of their purified chemical components have also been proved to inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">S epidermidis</italic> biofilm production [
