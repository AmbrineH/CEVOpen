 <p> Percentages of biofilm production after treatment at two concentrations (3.125 mg/mL and 0.0488 mg/mL) for FVEOs against the four strains S. aureus 6538P ( A) and 25923 ( B), S. epidermidis RP62A ( C) and O-47 ( D, respectively). In the ordinate axis are is reported the percentage of bacterial biofilm production. Data are reported as percentage of residual biofilm after the treatment in comparison with the untreated one. Each data point is composed of 4 independent experiments each performed with at least three replicates. </p>
