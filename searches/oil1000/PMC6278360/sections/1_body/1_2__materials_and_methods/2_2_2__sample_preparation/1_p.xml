<p class="p">The samples for microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) and hydrodistillation (HD) were prepared in the following way. The extract (ca. 150 g) was weighed separately in a 1 L flask and approx. 400 g of distilled water was added and the resulting emulsion was stirred for half an hour. Water to extract ratio was 8:3. For the experiments, 50 g of residues (residues obtained after the extraction of hops with scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) were also added to the mixture. Such preparation of the material assures an optimal increase of the material contact with the solvent and enables satisfactory efficiency. 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02866-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the exact compositions of the mixtures for microwave-assisted extraction and hydrodistillation for Marynka extract. For the sake of clarity and discussion, the oils were named according to the scheme: the name of the extract + power at which the extraction was carried out or the name of hydrodistillation apparatus (e.g., Marynka_275 W).
