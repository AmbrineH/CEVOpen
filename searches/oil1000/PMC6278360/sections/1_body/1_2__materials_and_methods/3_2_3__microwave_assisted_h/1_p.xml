<p class="p">The MAHD extractions of the essential oils from Marynka hops varieties were performed at atmospheric pressure using a NEOS-GR (Milestone Technologies) system, equipped with a glycol cooled condenser, lab-grade glycol chiller, collected specimens, as well as a video system for the visual control of the process. The extraction was continued at 100 °C until no more essential oil was obtained. The essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered and stored in dark vials at 4 °C. During the process, two parameters were tested, namely, microwave power as well as the influence of the extraction time (HD and MAHD) on the oils composition and obtained yields. </p>
