 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracts were used as experimental raw materials in this study. The extracts were obtained with the use of supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide in a supercritical state from the Polish hops variety, Marynka. Hop cones from the 2017 harvest were used to produce the hop extract, “Marynka”. The geographic origin of crops was the Lublin province, Poland. Cones with a moisture content of 10.6% were milled on a Retsch SM100 mill using a sieve with a mesh size of 1.5 mm. The average particle size was 0.8 mm. The produced material was subjected to the extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide using a pilot plant. A total of 4 kg of ground hop cones were loaded into a 20 dm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> extractor. The extraction was carried out with the following parameters: Pressure −250 bar, extraction temperature −50 °C, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption −50 kg/kg dm. The extraction yield was 11.4% by weight.
