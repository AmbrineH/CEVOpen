<p class="p">During our previous studies different forms of hops were tested before the final material was chosen for the extraction. One of the materials was post-extraction residue (residue after hops extraction using scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) as a scattering element of the extract mixture with water. However, hop extract is characterized by its poor solubility in water [

The microwave hydrodistillation process was very rapid with the accompanying overheating of the raw material in an aqueous environment. During the optimization of the extraction process, attempts were made to replace the residues with an emulsifying substance. For this purpose, four different emulsifiers were used, including polysorbate 80 (E433), emulsifying biobase, soya lecithin, and cetyl alcohol. None of the used emulsifiers brought the expected results, meaning no adequate degree of mixing and homogenization was achieved. The local overheating of the material was also observed. Our studies were also performed on other forms of materials, such as raw hops and hops granules. In any case, no satisfactory effect and no amount of oils were obtained. It might have been caused by the low concentration of desirable compounds in the analyzed material.
