<p class="p">The first application of the supercritical fluid chromatography with a photo-diode array detector to determine volatile compounds such as β-myrcene and α-humulene is provided in this study. This method was compared with a traditional method involving gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS). As was suggested by Flament et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], the use of scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for the separation of volatile compounds is inappropriate. However, in this study the obtained results for β-myrcene and α-humulene were comparable. The SFC method appeared to be significantly shorter than GC-MS/MS. Moreover, the use of supercritical carbon dioxide is understandable here due to the non-polar nature of volatile compounds being a subject of analysis. According to SFC quantitative analysis of β-myrcene and α-humulene, confirmed by GC-MS/MS analysis, the obtained oils were enriched in β-myrcene in the amount of approx. 74.13%–89.32%, which was several times higher in a comparison with the values obtained by Ligor et al. [
