<p class="p">The function of the extraction time from the microwave power for the microwave-assisted hydrodistillation of the Marynka extract was determined. From the graph, the curve equation for the experimental data was read, from which the values for the extraction time with the applied microwave power values were determined. The obtained data showed that with the increase of the microwave power by 5 W, the extraction time is shorter by 1.07 min (
