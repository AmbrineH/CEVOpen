<p class="p">According to Routray and Orsat [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], the higher the extraction temperature, the better the yield can be obtained. However, when the optimal temperature is achieved, the extraction efficiency decreases. During the studies, a relationship between the extraction power and the extraction time was observed. With increasing microwave power, the extraction time was shortened. When the extraction was performed at 395 W (3.03%) the extraction yield was relatively lower in a comparison with the process at 335 W (3.77%).
