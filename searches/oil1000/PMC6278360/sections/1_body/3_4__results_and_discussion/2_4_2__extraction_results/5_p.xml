 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] obtained the essential oils from hops with a use of different techniques, such as supercritical fluid extraction, steam distillation, accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), and solid phase microextraction (SPME). The values for β-myrcene and α-humulene in obtained essential oils ranged from 15.7% to 21.1% and from 11.1% to 33.4%, respectively. Our study involves the use of microwave-assisted hydrodistillation, which is considered as a safe method [
