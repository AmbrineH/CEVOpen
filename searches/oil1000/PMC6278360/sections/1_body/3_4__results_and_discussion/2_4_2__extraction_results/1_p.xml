<p class="p">The microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) with various microwave power and hydrodistillation (HD) were performed on extracts of Marynka hops variety. In case of the Marynka extract, the yield obtained by MAHD with the microwave power of 295 W was similar to the yield obtained by means of the HD method (1.80% for MAHD vs. 1.90% for HD). The extraction time of MAHD was significantly shorter than that of the conventional HD (40 vs. 276 min). The maximum yield of the essential oil obtained from the Marynka extract was using MAHD with microwave power of 335 W (3.03%).
