<p class="p">Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation has been proven to offer advantages over hydrodistillation in determination of essential oils in 
 <italic class="italic">Humulus lupulus</italic> scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract. A similar extraction yield of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Humulus lupulus</italic> scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract is achieved in shorter extraction time (30 min for MAHD vs. 276 min for HD) and at a lower energy consumption (0.17 kWh/g of essential oil for MAHD vs. 1.89 kWh/g of essential oil for HD). Increasing the extraction time increases efficiency of the process as well as the amount of obtained compounds. Moreover, a significantly higher temperature and longer extraction time in the case of the hydrodistillation may have an influence on the compoundâ€™s thermal degradation. Both chromatographic methods, such as supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS), are comparable with the advantage of the SFC method in terms of shortened analysis time.
