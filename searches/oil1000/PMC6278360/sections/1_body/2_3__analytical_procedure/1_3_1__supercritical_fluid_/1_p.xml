<p class="p">The separation of β-myrcene and α-humulene was conducted on a Waters Acquity Ultra-Performance Convergence Chromatography (UPC
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a PDA detector. For the data analysis, Empower 3 software was used. The column was Acquity UPC
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> HSS C18 SB (100 mm × 3.0 mm; 1.8 μm), packed with a chemically modified, highly strengthened silica with C18 groups. Carbon dioxide (99.998% purity), which was used as the mobile phase in SFC, was purchased from Air Liquide. The separation was performed with an isocratic elution with pure CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and a flow rate of 2.3 mL/min as well as a column temperature of 35 °C and ABPR (automated back pressure regulator) set to 12.6 MPa. The compensation wavelength was set at 500−600 nm throughout the analyses. The wavelength for the compounds was set to 220 nm. The authentic analytical standards of β-myrcene and α-humulene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were dissolved in hexane.
