<p class="p">Limits of detection (LOD), limits of quantification (LOQ), as well as repeatability and intermediate precision, were determined for the mixture of β-myrcene and α-humulene in order to evaluate the correctness of the provided method. Limits of detection (LOD) were 0.78 μg/mL for β-myrcene and 0.89 μg/mL for α-humulene, whereas limits of quantification were, respectively, 2.23 μg/mL and 1.95 μg/mL. The coefficients of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for calibration curves were 0.998 for both compounds. The repeatability was measured by 3 replicate analyses of a mixture of β-myrcene and α-humulene at three different concentrations at the same day, whereas the intermediate precision on three consecutive days. The RSD values, which are calculated according to the equation: RSD% = (standard deviation of the peak area/mean) × 100, show that both repeatability (RSD% &lt; 3) and intermediate precision (RSD% &lt; 6) are acceptable (
