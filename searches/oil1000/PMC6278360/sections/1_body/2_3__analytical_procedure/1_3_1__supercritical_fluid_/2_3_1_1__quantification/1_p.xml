<p class="p">In order to quantify β-myrcene and α-humulene in hops oils, an external calibration method was applied. Individual stock solutions of authentic standards of β-myrcene and α-humulene were prepared in hexane. The appropriate amounts of β-myrcene and α-humulene were weighed and hexane was increased to the volume of 1 mL. The standard curves were obtained from five concentrations in the amount of 1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 μg for β-myrcene and 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.125 μg for α-humulene, adjusted to the real content of β-myrcene and α-humulene in the analyzed samples. </p>
