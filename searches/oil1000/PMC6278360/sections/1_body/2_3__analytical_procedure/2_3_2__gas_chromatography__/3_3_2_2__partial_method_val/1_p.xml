<p class="p">Limits of detection (LOD) were 1.8 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, whereas limits of quantification were 4.6 ng/mL and 8.0 ng/mL, respectively, for β-myrcene and α-humulene. The coefficients of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for the calibration curves were 0.999 for both compounds. The mixture of β-myrcene and α-humulene at three different concentrations was injected on the same day as well as on three consecutive days to evaluate the repeatability and intermediate precision of the developed method. The RSD values indicate that both repeatability (RSD% &lt; 3) and intermediate precision (RSD% &lt; 6) are acceptable (
