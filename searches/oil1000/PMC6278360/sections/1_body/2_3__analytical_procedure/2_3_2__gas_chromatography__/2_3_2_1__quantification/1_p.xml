<p class="p">Concerning the quantitative analysis, internal standard calibration method was used with 4-androstene-3, and 17-dione as an internal standard. About 5 mg of the standard was weighed into a 5 mL volumetric flask. Then 5 mL of methanol/chloroform (9:1,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) mixture was added and 10 μL of such prepared standard was added to each oil sample in order to quantify β-myrcene and α-humulene. The standard curves were obtained from five concentration points: 200, 100, 50, 25, and 10 μg for β-myrcene and 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 μg for α-humulene, adjusted to the real content of β-myrcene and α-humulene in the analyzed samples. The quantification was achieved in the MRM mode with different GC conditions as were used in the qualitative analyses. The quantitative method was shortened to 38 min with an oven temperature of 80 °C at the starting point, held for 1 min, and then ramped up to 300 °C with the rate of 10 °C/min and held for 15 min with nitrogen as a collision gas at the flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The fragment ions for quantification and identification of each analyte were 136→121 (6) and 136→107 (6) for β-myrcene, 204→189 (10) and 204→161 (10) for α-humulene, as well as 286→148 (5), 124→109 (10) and 124→96 (10) for internal standard. The collision energies are provided in the brackets.
