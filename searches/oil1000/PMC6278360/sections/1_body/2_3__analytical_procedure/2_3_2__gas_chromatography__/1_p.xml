<p class="p">The qualitative analyses of obtained hops oils were performed with a GC-MS instrument (Agilent 7890) equipped with mass spectrometry and NIST 2011 MS spectra library. As for the acquired results, Masshunter software (ver. C.01.03) was used. The following analyses parameters were used for 
 <italic class="italic">Humulus lupulus</italic> essential oil samples: Capillary GC column DB-EUPAH (60 m × 250 μm; 0.25 μm) with helium as the carrier gas, and flow rate of 2 mL/min in a split injection mode (40:1). Oven temperature was set initially at 50 °C (held for 1 min) and increased to 260 °C at the rate of 6 °C/min (held for 6 min) and then finally reached 300 °C at the rate of 3 °C/min and held for 20 min. The system was operating in the EI mode (electron energy 70 eV) with the temperature of the source ion set to 230 °C and the scanning range from 40 to 650 amu.
