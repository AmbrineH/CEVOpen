 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The above-mentioned groups of compounds are considered as secondary metabolites. The phenolic compounds present in hops have been investigated in terms of their anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Secondary metabolitesâ€™ composition affects the assessment of the diversity of a given species. However, according to Biendl et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] the exact functions of these metabolites are yet unknown. It is believed that they protect the plant against pests and pathogens. Due to their favorable physiological and pharmacological properties, secondary metabolites are used in the pharmaceutical industry as medicines and dietary supplements. The antibacterial properties were also evaluated for hops extract obtained by the supercritical fluid extraction [
