<p class="p">The main methods used to obtain essential oils are, among other, hydrodistillation, steam distillation, maceration, absorption, and supercritical extraction. These methods are referred to as conventional methods [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In order to shorten the extraction time and improve the extraction efficiency, another form of hydrodistillation has gained a lot of interest. Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD), which is an advanced distillation method using microwave heating, has an advantage over conventional hydrodistillation as was indicated by a number of researchers [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. It is a technique widely used to extract essential oils from medicinal plants and herbs due to its economic and environmental advantages (‘green’ technology) [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. It is used in the extraction of various chemical compounds from the group of aromatic compounds, phenolic compounds, pesticides and, especially, essential oils. It is proven that the 30-minute duration of the microwave hydrodistillation process corresponds to a duration of conventional hydrodistillation that is eight times longer [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Hydrodistillation and microwave-assisted hydrodistillation have been compared in terms of extraction time, extraction efficiency, chemical composition, and quality of the essential oil as well as energy consumption. Microwave action is based mainly on the weakening of cell membranes and facilitating the extraction of biologically active compounds [
