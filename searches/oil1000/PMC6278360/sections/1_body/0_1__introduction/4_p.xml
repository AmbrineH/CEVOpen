<p class="p">β-myrcene and α-humulene, which belong to a group of terpenes, are characterized by their high oxidative sensitivity. During the brewing processes, thermal oxidation products of β-myrcene and α-humulene may affect both the quality of beer and its organoleptic properties [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Therefore, their use as beer additives is limited. However, if not in brewing, the oil rich in β-myrcene and α-humulene might be used in medicine [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02866" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. For instance, β-myrcene is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects in human osteoarthritis treatment [
