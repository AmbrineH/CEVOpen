<p id="Par29" class="p">OD
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents except the tested compound. OD
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test compound. Extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
