<p id="Par42" class="p">The essential oil obtained from the fresh flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> by hydrodistillation had a light yellow colour. The oil yield was 3% (volume/fresh weight). The 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty one different components were identified in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic>. The identified components, with their relative percentages and the retention time, are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The analyses revealed a complex mixture of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO consisting mainly of hydrocarbon monoterpene, oxygenated monoterpene and nitrogen compounds. Nine major detected components were found to be: β-Pinene (25.44%), Limonene (39.74%), Linalool (2.16%), α-Terpineol (7.30%), linalyl acetate(3.01%), Acétate geranyl (3.03%), Nerolidol (6.91%), Acetate neryl (1.74%) and Farnesol (4.28%). The minor components (&lt; 1%) were identified as: α-Pinene (0.46%), Sabinene (0.44%), Myrcene (0.36%), 1,8-cineol (0.54%), cis-linalool oxide (0.53%) and Geranial (0.43%). In our experiment, the 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO isolated from Tunisian lemon samples contains the above-mentioned four predominant ingredients with different percentage. On the other hand, Ahmad et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] reported that also limonene was the major chemical constituent in Indian oil. However, our results were different percentage from the reported one. From our experiment we observed that the percentage of chemical composition and predominant ingredients was not constant. The percentage of active ingredients in the essential oil from the natural samples is depends on geographical distribution as well as the environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, altitude, hours of sunshine, etc. [
