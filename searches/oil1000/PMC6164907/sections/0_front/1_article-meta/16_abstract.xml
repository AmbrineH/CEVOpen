 <p class="p">Members of the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> L. have been used in traditional medicine for centuries for treating gastrointestinal disorders, pain, inflammatory conditions, wounds, and for cancer prevention and antiaging, among others. Many of the biological activities of 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> species can be attributed to nonvolatile curcuminoids, but these plants also produce volatile chemicals. Essential oils, in general, have shown numerous beneficial effects for health maintenance and treatment of diseases. Essential oils from 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> spp., particularly 
  <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, have demonstrated various health-related biological activities and several essential oil companies have recently marketed 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> oils. This review summarizes the volatile components of various 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> species, the biological activities of 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> essential oils, and potential safety concerns of 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> essential oils and their components.
