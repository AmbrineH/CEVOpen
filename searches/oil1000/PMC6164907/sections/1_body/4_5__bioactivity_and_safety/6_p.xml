When administered by gavage, β-myrcene increased the occurrences of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma in male mice, incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma in female mice, and incidences of renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma in male rats, and induced rare renal tubule adenomas in female rats [

As a component in essential oils used in aromatherapy, β-myrcene does not represent a level of fetotoxicity that would cause any problem. β-Myrcene may cause skin (H315) or eye irritation (H319), however [
