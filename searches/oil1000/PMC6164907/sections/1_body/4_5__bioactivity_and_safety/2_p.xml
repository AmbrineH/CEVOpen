 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-Turmerone, α-turmerone, and β-turmerone are major constituents of turmeric rhizome oil. 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-Turmerone displayed strong in vitro antiplatelet aggregation activity [

 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. It also showed neuroprotective effect through inhibiting microglia activation, increasing neural-stem-cells proliferation, and promoting neuronal differentiation [
