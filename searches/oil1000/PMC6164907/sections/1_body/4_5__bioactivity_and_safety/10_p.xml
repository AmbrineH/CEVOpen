<p class="p">Terpinolene showed potent DPPH-scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B280-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">280</xref>] and remarkable protection against LDL oxidation [
 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Terpinolene was chemoprotective against the in vitro formation of the carcinogen 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by 79% inhibition [
 <xref rid="B263-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">263</xref>]. It was neither irritating nor sensitizing when tested at 20% on volunteers [
 <xref rid="B305-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">305</xref>]. Terpinolene was the reason behind several cases of tea tree oil allergenicity [
 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Terpinolene was sensitizing to all of 16 dermatitis patients sensitive to tea tree oil when tested at 10% [
 <xref rid="B306-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">306</xref>]. The acute oral LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of terpinolene was 4.4 mL/kg in rats and mice [
 <xref rid="B305-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">305</xref>]. The skin-sensitization thresholds of terpinolene are not known, but the limited data available suggests minimal toxicity.
