<p class="p">β-Elemene inhibited the proliferation of several cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B302-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>]. It was cytotoxic to HL-60 cells (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>= 27.5 µg/mL), K-562 (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 81 µg/mL) cells, peripheral blood leukocytes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 254.3 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B237-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>], and human laryngeal-cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B210-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>] in a dose-dependent manner via inducing apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B303-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">303</xref>]. β-Elemene selectively inhibited the growth of human non-small-cell lung-cancer cells and human ovarian-cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B302-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>]. Moreover, it was able to overcome the cisplatin-resistance developed in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B302-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>]. β-Elemene showed strong antiangionenic effects. At doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day for 21 days, it suppressed VEGF expression in B16F10 melanoma cells in mice, and repressed VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B276-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">276</xref>]. When used in vitro at 20 and 50 mM, β-elemene inhibited the VEGF-induced sprouting of rat aortic-ring vessels in chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes [
 <xref rid="B276-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">276</xref>]. β-Elemene protected against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in rats through downregulating the expression of plasma endotoxin, serum TNF-α, and hepatic cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) [
 <xref rid="B277-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">277</xref>]. β-Elemene (i.p., 50 and 100 mg/kg) reduced angiogenesis in gastric-cancer stem-like cells [
 <xref rid="B304-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">304</xref>]. In vivo experiments showed that β-elemene treatment suppressed the growth of brain, lung, breast, colon, cervix, and prostate cancers (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 47–95 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B278-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">278</xref>]. In a clinical trial, β-elemene was effective in managing malignant pleural and peritoneal effusions with local pain, fever, and gastrointestional disturbance as the major adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B237-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>]. In another clinical trial that included 40 brain-cancer cases, β-elemene treatment reduced average tumor size by 61%, and four cases completely recovered [
 <xref rid="B279-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>]. No toxicity or dermal data were found for β-elemene; however, its antiangiogenic action might suggest caution in pregnancy.
