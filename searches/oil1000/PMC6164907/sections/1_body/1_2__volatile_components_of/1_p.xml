<p class="p">Generally, essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> species are obtained by hydro- or steam distillation of the fresh or dry rhizome [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Alternatively, 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> volatiles have also been obtained by solvent extraction or supercritical fluid extraction of the powdered rhizome [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. More recently, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been employed as a solvent-free technique to capture and concentrate volatiles from different plant parts. Industrially, 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> oil is produced during oleoresin processing as a byproduct of curcumin extraction [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. After curcumin is isolated from the oleoresin, the mother liquor (about 70–80%) is known as “curcumin-removed turmeric oleoresin” (CRTO) [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The oil is then extracted from CRTO by hexane or other organic solvent, a process that could result in the loss of the highly volatile components during solvent evaporation [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The use of alcohols as the solvent for oil extraction might cause esterification, etherification, and acetal formation [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The volatile components of different 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> species, typically identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, are summarized in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-10-01196-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In general, 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> species produce a wide variety of volatile sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, and other aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The chemical structures of key volatile components are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01196-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. There is a tremendous variation in the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> essential oils (EOs). Differences in the oil chemical profile might be due to genotype, variety, differential geography, climate, season, cultivation practices, fertilizer application, stress during growth or maturity, harvesting time, stage of maturity, storage, extraction, and analysis methods [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. However, some of the variation could be due to misidentification of the plant species or some of the components.
