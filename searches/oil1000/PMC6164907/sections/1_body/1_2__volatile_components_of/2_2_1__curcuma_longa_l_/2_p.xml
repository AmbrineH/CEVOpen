<p class="p">Turmeric oleoresin is an orange-red viscous liquid, prepared from the powdered rhizome by solvent extraction with a yield of about 12% [

The volatile oil is responsible for the turmeric aroma, while the curcuminoids (curcumin and its analogues) are responsible for its bright yellow color [

Unfortunately, comparative data on the chemical composition of volatile oil from fresh and dry rhizomes from a single source, single geographical location, and same season are scarce. However, some of the variation could be explained by the rhizome processing. The order of yield is cured &gt; fresh &gt; dried rhizome [
