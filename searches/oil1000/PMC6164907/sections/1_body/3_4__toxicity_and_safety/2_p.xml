<p class="p">Zedoary EO has GRAS status [
 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. No acute toxicity or adverse reactions were reported for the zedoary oil; however, its consumption may interfere with gestation and may induce abortion [
 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. For this reason, the oil and extracts are strictly prohibited during pregnancy and should be avoided during breastfeeding. Zedoary EO showed obvious embryotoxicity ex vivo and reproductive toxicity in animal and developmental experiments [

 <xref rid="B200-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>]. In addition, treatment with aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> rhizome (10 g/kg/day for 20 days) exhibited reproductive toxicity in pregnant mice [
 <xref rid="B240-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">240</xref>]. Chinese zedoary EO prevented implantation in dose-dependent manner. When given i.p. (300 mg/kg) to female rats on gestational days 7–9, it prevented 77% of pregnancies, and when administered intravaginally to female rabbits, it prevented 16% and 100% of pregnancies at 60 or 400 mg/kg/day on gestational days 5–9 and 2–4, respectively [
 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. It was suggested that the embryotoxic effect of zedoary EO might be caused by its sesquiterpenoids that can block VEGF-mediated angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. However, no direct evidence was found to link any of the oil components to its antifertility effect. Decoctions and ethanol extracts of zedoary rhizomes also have antifertility effects [
