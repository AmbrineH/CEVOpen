 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> extract (5%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) stimulated hair regrowth on patients with androgenic alopecia [
 <xref rid="B205-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> rhizome extract promoted hair regrowth in bald males [
 <xref rid="B205-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. The bioactive compounds were identified as sesquiterpenes, with germacrone being the most potent [

 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> EO, hexane extract, and germacrone improved the skin penetration of minoxidil, a hair-growth promoter approved as topical treatment of androgenic alopecia [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Skin penetration of minoxidil with EO, hexane extract, and germacrone was enhanced 20-fold, 4-fold, and 10-fold, respectively [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In a randomized, double-blinded trial, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> rhizome EO formulated as a lotion (1% and 5% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> EO) was reported to safely and effectively slow the growth of axillary hair and to rapidly and robustly increase axillary skin brightness (within three weeks) [
 <xref rid="B206-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. Interestingly, these effects persisted for two weeks after ending the treatment. The rhizome EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aeruginosa</italic> showed potent antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC = 6.25 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> (MIC = 15.63 µg/mL) and as a teeth-biofilm degradation [
 <xref rid="B207-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>], which makes it a good candidate as a natural antibacterial agent in a mouthwash or a toothpaste. It exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 125 µg/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> (MIC = 125 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The oil showed antifungal activity against
