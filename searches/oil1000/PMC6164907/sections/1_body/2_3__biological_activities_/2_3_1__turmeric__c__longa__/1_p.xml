<p class="p">Turmeric EO has the potential to provide protection against cardiovascular diseases. The oil was reported to have antihyperlipidemic effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemia in rats [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-10-01196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. It markedly decreased the levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, total cholesterol in serum, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while increasing the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Turmeric EO also showed antihyperlipidemic effects in hyperlipidemic golden Syrian hamsters via reducing lipid-induced oxidative stress, platelet activation, and vascular dysfunction [
