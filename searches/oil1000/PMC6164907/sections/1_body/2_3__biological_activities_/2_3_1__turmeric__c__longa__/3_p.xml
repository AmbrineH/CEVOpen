Turmeric EO (200 mg/kg) exhibited antifatty liver and hepatoprotective activities in acute ethanol-induced fatty liver in rats through decreasing the activities of serum enzymes and levels of serum triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, and hepatic malondialdehyde, while restoring the level of reduced glutathione as well as the activities of glutathione-
