<p class="p">In this study, chitosan films containing different concentrations of AEO (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2%) were used to keep chicken burgers under refrigerated conditions. The results of oxidative spoilage showed that in general chitosan + AEO slowed down the amount of thiobarbituric acid and a decrease in moisture content compared to the control treatment, and a better result was observed with increasing concentrations. The results of microbial studies indicate that in all treatments, the microbial load increased over time, but this increase was observed in chitosan + AEO, and the best results were observed in AEO at 2%. The addition of anise essential oil caused a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>,

 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>, so that in all treatments containing 1.5 and 2% anise essential oil after 3 days, none of the bacteria was found. Overall, the best results were observed in chitosan + AEO 2%, but this treatment had a lower sensory rating than chitosan + AEO (1.5%). Considering that chitosan + AEO 1.5% and 2% had a proper chemical, microbial and sensory analyzes, and taking into account cost‐effectiveness, the essential oil content 1.5% in film could be an optimal dosage.
