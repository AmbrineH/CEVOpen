<p class="p">According to what stated, the use of natural ingredients in food sources can be a good alternative to artificial preservatives, but restricts the cost of using and other problems, such as odor intensity, potential toxicity, and uncontrolled release of these substances into food products and also inactivation of food. One strategy to reduce the dose of essential oil while maintaining their effectiveness can be adding these natural compounds to edible coatings and films (Sánchez‐González, Vargas, González‐Martínez, Chiralt, &amp; Cháfer,

Chitosan is a biopolymer that has many uses in the food industry and is the second most natural polymer in nature after cellulose. The polysaccharide has functional properties such as microbial, fungicidal and antioxidant properties, and also has properties such as compatibility with environment, biodegradation, nontoxicity and various physical and chemical properties. Other functional properties of chitosan are the ability to form film, adhesion properties, adsorption, refinement and as a dietary fiber used in food, medicine, pharmacy, dyeing, textiles, cosmetics, and so on. A wide range of microorganisms including gram‐positive bacteria, gram‐negative bacteria and molds are sensitive to chitosan (Vásconez, Flores, Campos, Alvarado, &amp; Gerschenson,
