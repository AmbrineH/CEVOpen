<p class="p">Evaluation of the rate of water vapor permeability of polymer films are absolutely necessary if antimicrobial films are used in foods of medium and high humidity. In order to reduce water vapor permeability, different approaches such as the use of two or more layers of chitosan composites with moisture resistant materials such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (Sebit, Chollet, Degraeve, &amp; Peryorl, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and polymers such as wax starch and another important approach is the use of hydrophobic compounds such as fatty acids, essential oils and extracts. By adding anise essential oil to chitosan film (3.82 × 10
