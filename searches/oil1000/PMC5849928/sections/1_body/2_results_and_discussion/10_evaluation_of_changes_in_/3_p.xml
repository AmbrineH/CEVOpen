<p class="p">According to the results, in all days, the highest levels of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c) were observed in control treatment (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05). By adding chitosan, the bacterial levels had a slower rate than the control treatment, which indicates the antimicrobial activity of chitosan. Different mechanisms have been reported for the antimicrobial activity of chitosan: (1) Chitosan inhibits the growth of bacteria as a chelating agent of metallic ions and nutrients, (2) Chitosan is able to bind to ionic groups existing on the surface of bacterial cells and the formation of poly‐electrolyte complexes with compounds present on the surface of the cells of the bacteria, which leads to the lack of transfer of nutrients to the cells and ultimately prevents their growth (Qi, Xu, Jiang, Hu, &amp; Zou, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In treatments containing 0.5 and 1% of AEO, the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> was decreasing and increasing. In treatments containing 1.5 and 2% of AEO, from the third day of storage, no values of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> were observed. In general, the reduction in bacterial growth in essential oil treatments is due to phenolic compounds in the AEO, which, by increasing the concentration of these compounds, can effectively inhibit bacterial growth and enhance the bactericidal properties. Since the essential oils are mainly lipophilic, they easily pass through the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane and disintegrate the structure of different layers of polysaccharides, fatty acids and phospholipids. In bacteria, membrane permeability is associated with loss of ions and membrane potential recovery, proton pump disruption, and reduced ATP reserve. Herbal essential oils can cause the cytoplasm clotting and damaging lipids and proteins. Damage to the wall and membrane of the cell can lead to the evacuation of macromolecules and eventually death of the cell (Bakkali, Averbeck, Averbeck, &amp; Idaomar,
