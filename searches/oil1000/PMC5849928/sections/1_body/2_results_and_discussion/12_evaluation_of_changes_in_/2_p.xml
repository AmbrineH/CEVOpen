<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacterium, also called 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, is a kind of gram‐negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family. 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> has been identified in many foods worldwide, and the consumption of grinded raw meat is one of the common risks of foodborne pathogenetic infections such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (Solomakos, Govaris, Koidis, &amp; Botsoglou, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Antibiotic resistant 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> are transmitted to humans through the use of meat products and may also cause antibiotic resistance in humans. According to the results, with increasing time, the levels of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> e) increased in control treatment. In Chitosan treatments, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> values were decreasing throughout the maintenance period. In the treatment containing 0.5% AEO, decreased by increasing the time until the third day and on the sixth day, the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was reduced to zero. In the treatment containing 1, 1.5, and 2% AEO from the third day of storage, no evidence was found for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. ISRI (

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> for chicken burger log CFU/g negative pathogen. The antimicrobial property of anise essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> has been reported by other researchers (Al‐Bayati,
