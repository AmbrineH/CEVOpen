<p class="p">Staphylococcus bacteria are a gram‐positive coccus and β‐hemolytic, which is positive for catalase and coagulase and fermentation of mannitol. This bacterium is commonly the cause of many human infections, and every human being infects the bacterium at least once in his lifetime (Jay et al.,

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d) increased in control and chitosan treatment and the highest levels of bacteria were observed in control treatment (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> first, it reduced, and on the ninth day its values reached zero. In the treatment containing 1% of AEO decreased by increasing the time until the third day and on the sixth day the 
 <italic class="italic">s. aureus</italic> was kept to zero. In the treatment containing 1.5 and 2% essential oil of the anise from the third day of storage, no values of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was not observed. The antimicrobial activity of anise essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> has also been reported in other researchers (Al‐Bayati,
