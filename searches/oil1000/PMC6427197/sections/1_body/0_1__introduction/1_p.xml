<p class="p">Water and energy are the base pillars for global economic, social, and cultural development [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Since water is the essential life element, its pollution due to oil spills and industrial effluents has turned into a global problem. The separation of oil from water resources is crucial because of the economic and environmental challenges [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Numerous materials with specific wettability/hydrophobicity are reported in oil/water separation/absorption such as zeolites, clays, carbon-based materials, carbon nanotube (CNT) sponges, fibers of wool, gelators, etc. [

 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In order to fabricate an efficient oil/water separator, the material should possess specific properties like good hydrophobicity, oil uptake, durability, recoverability, retention over time, and biodegradability [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Moreover, the efficiency of oil/water separators depends on their ability to separate both water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions with good recyclability and reusability [
