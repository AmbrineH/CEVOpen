<p class="p">Numerous studies are reported for the oil-adsorbing property of CNT containing PS composites. For instance, Zhang et al. fabricated a CNT film-core shell PS-gold nanoparticle assembled underwater superoleophobic membrane capable of removing oil from contaminated water [

Though CNT reinforced PS was the subject of study for selective oil removal, the surface property influence was not discussed in the literature. This work investigated the correlation of manufacturing technique and the surface modification by gamma irradiation to the selective oil removal from oil/water mixture. PS/CNT hybrid membranes with variable CNT loadings were fabricated by an electrospinning technique, and their properties and oil/water efficiency were studied in terms of gamma irradiation dosage and the filler loading. The fabricated electrospun membranes were also tested for their antibacterial effect, with a probable good bactericidal effect by the incorporation of CNT [
