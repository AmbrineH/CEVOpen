<p class="p">PS/MWCNT membranes containing various concentrations of the CNT are fabricated by electrospinning and the effect of gamma irradiation on their surface characteristics are addressed. Though the nanotubes enhanced the mechanical strength of PS, the optimum concentration for enhanced oil absorbing capacity was identified as 0.5 wt.%. The hydrophobicity of the membranes, enhanced with surface roughness, gamma irradiation, and the optimum radiation dose, was 15 kGy, above which the bond rupture can probably take place. The hydrophobic/oleophobic performance of the membranes is addressed by the contact angle studies. Gravity-driven oil/water separation was clear in the case of PS/CNT at 0.5 wt.% CNT, and the oil absorption capacity (g/g) for this sample was 2.2 times higher than that of the pure polymer. Notable antibacterial properties, in terms of bacterial resistance zones, were observed in the PS/CNT irradiated at 15 kGy, indicating the fouling/bacterial degradation resistance of the sample. Thus, it is proposed that the fabricated PS/CNT membrane acts as a promising material in oil/water separation.</p>
