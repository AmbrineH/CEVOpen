<p class="p">PS pellets were dissolved in DMF by magnetic stirring for 3 h at 60 Â°C to obtain an 8% polymer solution. CNTs at different weight% (0.2%, 0.5%, and 1%) were ultrasonically dispersed in the same solvent and added to specific PS solutions. Magnetic stirring was done overnight to obtain homogeneous dispersions of PS/CNT nanocomposites. These solutions were electrospun at 1 mL/h rate using the same conditions reported earlier by our group [

The spun nanofibers were collected on a cylindrical rotor moving at 500 rpm, kept about 10 cm away from the needle tip at an applied voltage of 12 kV. The distance between the needle and the collector plays an important role in the morphology and fiber diameter. At a smaller needle tip to collector distance of 5 and 10 cm, defect-free fibers were obtained whereas, at longer distances of 12 and 15 cm, beads were formed on the fibers. The typical fibrous morphology of the fibers also depend on the solvent medium of dispersion and also the applied voltage. The whole procedure is schematically represented in
