<p class="p">The morphology of the gold-coated PS/CNT samples was checked with a scanning electron microscope (FEI Nova NanoSEM 450, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 3 and 5 kV acceleration voltages. Nicolet/Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 670 (Thermo Nicolet, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to observe the FTIR spectra of all nanocomposites. The surface properties of the samples were identified by testing the contact angle by a drop shape analysis system (OCA 35-Dataphysics, DataPhysics Instruments, Filderstadt, Germany) using deionized water. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK) addressed the elemental composition and structural properties. Tensile properties of the polymer nanocomposites were tested using a universal testing machine (Lloyd 1KN LF Plus, AMETEK, Inc., Bognor Regis, UK) at 5 mm/min. The oil absorption capacity of PS/CNT composite membranes was monitored by keeping a specific amount of membranes in a petri dish containing engine oil/water (1:1) mixture, at room temperature. The gravity-driven test was also conducted using the same oil/water mixture by using the membrane in the funnel set up. Antibacterial activities of PS/CNT nanofibers were tested by an inhibition zone method [
