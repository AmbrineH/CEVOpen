 <sub class="sub">W</sub>~280,000 purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, USA) were used to prepare the polymer nanocomposites. The solvent, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was also obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The properties of the polar DMF used in this study were: Boiling Point, 153 °C, Viscosity η 0.920 mPa·s at 25 °C, Dielectric constant, 36.7 at 20 °C, and surface tension σ 35.0 mn/m at 20 °C. MWCNTs of diameter 30–100 nm was obtained from Nanoshell, Panchkula, India.
