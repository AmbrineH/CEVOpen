 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a shows the FTIR spectra of pure PS and PS/CNT nanofibers. The characteristic broad peaks at 700, 755, 1456, 1494, 2928 and 3023 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> could be ascribed to the various absorption bands of PS [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The absorption intensities at 3023 and 2928 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> correspond to the C–H symmetric and asymmetric vibrations, respectively. The peaks at 1456 and 1494 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were assigned to bending vibrations and the stronger peaks at 700 and 755 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> correspond to the mono-substituted benzene. With an increase in CNT concentration, the characteristic bands of PS strengthen due to better reinforcement [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The absence of additional peaks indicates the absence of any chemical reaction or formation of chemical bonds during electrospinning. This illustrates the physical blending of PS and CNT.
