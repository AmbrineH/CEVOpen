<p class="p">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the surface chemical composition of the pure PS and PS/CNT membranes as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b. The C1s and O1s intensities increased for the PS/CNT samples compared to the pure PS, due to the incorporation of CNTs into PS. The surface oxygen content was significantly higher with the CNT addition, as shown in the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b, confirming the successful attachment of CNTs in the PS matrix. The very small peak corresponding to the oxygen comes as a result of the CNTs as the chemical vapor deposition can generate some elemental impurities on its surface. Both XPS and FTIR results indicate the existence of CNTs on the surface of PS/CNT membranes.
