<p class="p">Since the surface energy and surface roughness depend on the contact angle values, its determination can reveal the typical surface properties of a membrane. A rough surface is significant while constructing superhydrophobic surfaces [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, it is clear that pure PS nanofibers exhibited a hydrophobic nature with a contact angle of 140Â°, whereas the nanocomposites, showed enhanced hydrophobicity with larger contact angle values.
