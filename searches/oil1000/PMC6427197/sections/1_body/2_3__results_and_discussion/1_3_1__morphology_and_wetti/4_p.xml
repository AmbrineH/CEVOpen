<p class="p">Upon CNT addition in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, the contact angles slightly increase due to the increase in surface roughness. This results in enhanced superhydrophobicity for the composite membranes with introduced nanomaterials. Furthermore, in superhydrophobic surfaces, the chemical composition leads to lower surface free energy, and therefore surface hierarchical structures are more significant [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b. The value increased from 126 to 140Â° depending on the different irradiation doses, but still maintaining the hydrophobicity. This substantiates the applicability of PS/CNT nanocomposite in oil/water separation.
