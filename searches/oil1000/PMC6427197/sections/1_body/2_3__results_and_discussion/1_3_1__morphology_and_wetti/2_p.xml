<p class="p">The average diameter of the pure PS nanofiber is around 2 μm, as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b. However, after CNT addition, the fiber diameter increases for the PS/CNT nanofibers as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c–e. The nanofiber thickness in the case of PS/CNT composite membranes is about 3–5 μm, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c,d, which are comparable with that of pure PS. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>f shows the fiber diameter distribution among all samples of PS/CNT nanocomposites. The influence of surface tension, viscosity, and conductivity of the nanocomposite solution on the fiber diameter and thus the morphology of the nanofibers is clear from the variation in fiber diameter with the CNT loading [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The CNTs were uniformly distributed in the PS matrix with no agglomeration, indicating its better interfacial compatibility with the polymer chains. Both the surface roughness and the surface energy of the membrane are affected by the nanofiber diameter, by enhancing the former and reducing the latter [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The nanofibrous nature of the membranes causes the formation of a fine, interconnected porous structure, which is highly beneficial for the oil/water separation flux [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Moreover, the porous nature of the electrospun membranes also depends on the application of volatile solvents during the fabrication. Such solvents encourage surface pore creation through the evaporative-cooling mechanism, in addition to the condensation of water vapor on the fiber surface [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In fact, other parameters such as solution viscosity, feed rates, and the applied voltage also determine the fiber diameter, fiber distribution, and therefore the porosity characteristics [
