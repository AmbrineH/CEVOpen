<p class="p">Water pollution causes the formation of various micro-organisms in the water, so it is important to monitor the antibacterial nature of the synthesized separating membranes. Gamma irradiated PS/0.5 wt.% CNT membrane was used for the antibacterial activity test and the selection of this membrane is done based on the characterization of the above studies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows the antibacterial effect of PS/0.5 wt.% CNT and at 15 KGy gamma-ray irradiated membrane against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and the antibacterial effect has been proven by the formation of inhibition rings around this membrane [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. These results indicate that the PS/0.5 wt.% CNT membranes are able to eliminate 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> more efficiently than the pure PS membranes. Antibacterial activity was further analyzed by the optical microscope.
