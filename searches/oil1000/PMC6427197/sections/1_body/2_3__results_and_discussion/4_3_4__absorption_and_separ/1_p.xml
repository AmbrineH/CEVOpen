<p class="p">For a general understanding of the membrane reaction towards oil absorption, we selected the PS/0.5 wt.% CNT membrane irradiated with gamma ray of 15 kGy was selected for the oil/water separation test. For the experiment, hydraulic oil was selected as the model oil and it was dyed for a clear identification as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a–d. The oil layer within the water was removed by a small piece of membrane, indicating the capability of the membrane for oil absorption.

The oil droplets dropped on the surface of the PS/CNT membranes were absorbed completely and the oil contact angle was about 0°, showing superoleophilic property [
