<p class="p">To further evaluate the oil absorption capacity, a piece of membrane was dipped in the oil/water emulsion, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. The oil absorption capacity can be calculated by the increase in mass fraction (M: wt.%), as per the following equation,

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> denote the weight of the membranes before and after oil adsorption [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-12-00709" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In order to investigate the adsorbed oil mass, the tested membranes were taken out from the oil/water emulsion and weighed. The results are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a,b. The pure PS membrane showed low sorption capacity compared to CNT loaded membranes due to its lower porosity and the occupation of oil molecules only on the external pores. The oil sorption capacity of pure PS membrane was 5.140 g/g and the oil sorption capacity was maximum at 0.5 wt.% CNT loading with a value of 11.8 g/g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b shows the oil sorption capacity of 0.5 wt.% CNT at different gamma irradiation doses. With the increase in irradiation dosage, the oil sorption capacity gradually increases to 16 g/g.
