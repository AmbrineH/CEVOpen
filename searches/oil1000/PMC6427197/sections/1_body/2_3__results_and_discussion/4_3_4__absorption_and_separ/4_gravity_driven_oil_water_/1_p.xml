<p class="p">Gravity-driven oil/water separation tests were performed using the experimental set up illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. Around 20 mL oil/water emulsion was poured towards a container covered with the PS/CNT membranes at its top; the oil passed, while water retained. Separated oil was collected in the container and water was persisting on the membrane surface. This type of separation process was only driven by the weight of the oil without any external pressure and provides effective separation [
