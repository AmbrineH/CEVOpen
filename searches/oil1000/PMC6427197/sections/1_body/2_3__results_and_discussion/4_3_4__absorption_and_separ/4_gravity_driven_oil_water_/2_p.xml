 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b,d shows the optical microscopy images of feed and filtrate solutions. It can be observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00709-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> that the feed emulsion shows larger densely packed droplets and the droplet size is smaller for the filtrate solution, indicating the efficient separation performance for the PS/CNT membranes.
