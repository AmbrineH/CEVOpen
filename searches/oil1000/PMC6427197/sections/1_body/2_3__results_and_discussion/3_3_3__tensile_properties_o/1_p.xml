The tensile stress for PS/CNT nanofibers at 0.5 wt.% CNT loading level was 0.24 MPa, which was higher compared to that of pure PS nanofibers (0.04 MPa). At 0.5 wt.% CNT, the cross-section gradually became denser, indicating many interactions between CNT and PS. In the electrospun membrane, the CNTs act as a crosslinking point to associate with the polymeric chain and thus increases the rigidity [
