<p class="p">The mechanical properties for PS/0.5 wt.% CNT depend on the gamma irradiation dosages. The increased properties at 10 kGy can be due to the free radicals generated on the CNT surface, which can create more interfacial bonds with the polymer chain-end groups. This crosslinking reduces chain mobility [
