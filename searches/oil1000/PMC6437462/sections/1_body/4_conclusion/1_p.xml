<p class="p">The results presented in this work are the first report on the variation on yields, chemical composition, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae </italic>collected from five localities in the south of Iran. Our results showed that the geographical variation did not have significant effect on major components of EOs except for trans-linalool oxide (7.5-28.5%). On the basis of findings, for achieving the highest oil yield (10.2%), the plant material should be collected from the Tangezagh (S4) region, in which possesses great economic value. With respect to antioxidant activity, results indicated some variation between samples. Although the results of the present study demonstrated weak antioxidant and moderate cytotoxic activities for the tested EOs, these activities suggested a proper potential for possible use of the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae </italic>for pharmaceutical and perfume industries. In addition to its activity, considering its high yield in EO, pleasant smell, and safety in bioactive concentrations, it can be also introduced as an industrial potential interest.
