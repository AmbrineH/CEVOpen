<p class="p">Gas chromatography was carried out using Varian CP-3800 system equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a CP-Sil 8CB fused-silica column (50 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.12 m). The injector temperature and detector temperature were 260 and 280 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C, respectively. The initial GC oven temperature was held at 50 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C for 5 min, then increased up to 250 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C with 3 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C /min and held constant at 250 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C for 10 min. The split ratio was used at 1:5, with the carrier gas, N2 (2 ml/min).
