<p class="p">The free radical scavenging activity of EOs was evaluated by radical scavenging (DPPH) activity evaluation method (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). Two and half ml of the EOs (EO+MeOH) at different concentrations (40-1.25 mg/ml) was added to one ml of a DPPH methanol solution. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was read at 518 nm. The radical scavenging activity of EOs was calculated from the equation:
