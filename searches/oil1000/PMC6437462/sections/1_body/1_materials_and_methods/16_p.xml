<p class="p">The BCB assay was performed according to the standard method, with slight modifications (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Eight mg of β-carotene was dissolved in 8 ml chloroform. One ml the carotene-chloroform solution was added to 20 mg linoleic acid and 100 mg Tween 40. Chloroform was removed using a rotary evaporator and oxygenated distilled water was added to the residue and the mixture was sonicated for 1 min to form emulsion A. The emulsion B (20 mg linoleic acid, 200 mg Tween 40 and 50 ml water) was also prepared. Two hundred μl of EO (final concentrations: 40-1.25 mg/ml) was added to tubes containing 5 ml of the emulsion A. The absorbance was read at 0 min and after 120 min of incubation at 470 nm. Antioxidant activity was expressed as inhibition percentages of the samples which calculated from the equation:
