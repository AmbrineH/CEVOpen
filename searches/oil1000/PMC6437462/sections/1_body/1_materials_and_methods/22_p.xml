<p class="p">Cytotoxicity of the EOs was measured using MTT assay. Briefly, 5×10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of MCF7 and A375 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. After waiting 24 hr for adhesion, a serial of double diluted EOs (1600-50 μg/ml) was added to triplicate wells. After 48 hr, 10 µl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added and the plates were incubated at 37 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C for an additional 4 hr. The supernatant was then discarded and 200 µl DMSO was added to the culture to dissolve the formazan blue. Cytotoxicities were expressed as the concentration of a certain drug that inhibits cell growth by 50% (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>).
