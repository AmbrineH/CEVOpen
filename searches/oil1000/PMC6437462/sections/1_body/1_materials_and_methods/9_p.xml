<p class="p">A quadruple mass detector and a HP-5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D., film thicknesses 0.25 µm) were applied for the GC–MS analyzes. The oven temperature was kept at 50 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C for 5 min and increased from 50
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C to 250
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C at a rate of 3 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C/min and held at 250 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C for 10 min. Other analytical settings were: injector temperature of 250 
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C; injection volume of 0.1 µl in split mode 1:50; carrier gas: Helium at 1.1 ml/min; ionization potential: 70 eV; ionization current: 150 µA; and mass range: 35-465. The compounds were based on the comparison of retention indices (RI) relative to n-alkanes, retention time (RT) and mass spectra. Library search was carried out using the Wiley 7n.L spectral database as well as by co comparing with the mass spectral data with those reported in the literature (
