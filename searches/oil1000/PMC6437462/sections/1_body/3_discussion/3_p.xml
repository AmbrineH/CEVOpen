<p class="p">The highest amount of camphor and linalool was found in the EO of S5. Also the lowest amount of trans-linalool oxide was detected in S5 EO (7.5%). The results revealed that the yields of EOs (6.0-10.2%) could be affected by environmental and geographical conditions. In all the investigated samples (S1-S5) oxygenated monoterpenes were identified as the main class of compounds, in agreement with previous reports, except for trans-linalool oxide (

In this study, some components such as car-3-en-2-one (1.7%) and α-humulene (trace) were found just in sample S2, while α-thujene, thymol and aromadendrene were not detected in S2 whilst they were detected in other samples. According to the results of this research, some constituents like

By our data it is difficult to highlight any conclusive trend relating to qualitative oil chemical composition with environmental conditions for
