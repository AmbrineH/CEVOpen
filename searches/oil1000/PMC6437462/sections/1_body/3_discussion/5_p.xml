<p class="p">Although the two tests yielded quantitatively different values, the best antioxidant activity was observed for S1 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 8.01 mg/ml, followed by S2 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 8.79 mg/ml, in DPPH method. The EO of S5 showed the lowest antioxidant activity with IC

 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae</italic> on the oxidation of the β-carotene in the presence of linoleic acid oxidation intermediates ranged from 11.77 to 29.82 mg/ml. The EOs also demonstrated weak antioxidant activity in this test. The order of activity was as follows: S1&gt; S2&gt; S4&gt; S3&gt; S5. The highest activity was observed for S1 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 11.77 mg/ml followed by S2 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50 </sub>value of 13.65 mg/ml. The lowest activity was observed for S5 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 29.82 mg/ml. The β-carotene bleaching activity of EO was weaker than that of the positive controls BHT and vit C (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.016 and 0.011 mg/ml, respectively). In both DPPH and β-carotene bleaching assays, the S1 and S2 showed better antioxidative capacity than the others. Some authors demonstrated that a significant linear correlation between total phenol content and antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). According to our analysis of the chemical composition of the EO, its low phenolic content could be responsible for its weak antioxidant activity. However, EOs are very complex and this property makes it difficult to explain the antioxidant properties, so it is difficult to attribute the antioxidant activity of the EO to one or some active compounds. Both minor and major compounds could make a significant contribution to the activity (
