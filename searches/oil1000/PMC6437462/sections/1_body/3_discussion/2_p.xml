<p class="p">The quality and industrial values of the EOs is mainly determined on the basis of amount of EO and the presence of some major bioactive compounds in it. Therefore, finding the optimal conditions for obtaining the best quality essential oil is necessary for commercial purposes. Plant EO quality and quantity are the result of interactions between several internal and external factors including; plant tissues used for extraction, maturity of the plant parts, growth stages, altitude, irrigation, seasonal variation, genetic variation, stress experienced by the plant due to soil and environmental factors (

 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae</italic> aerial parts afforded a large amount of EO. Thirty eight components were identified in the S1 EO representing 98.4%, which is mainly composed of oxygenated monoterpenes, represented exclusively by linalool (29.6%), camphor (27.4%), trans-linalool oxide (18.7%) and limonene (3.7%). The S1 EO yield was 9.1% (v/w). Thirty six constituents representing 98.3% were identified in the S2 EO which trans-linalool oxide (28.6%), camphor (27.2%), linalool (24.4%) and limonene (3.4%) were found to be the main components. The S2 EO yield was obtained 6.0% (v/w). Aromadendrene, α-thujene and thymol did not found in the S2 EO while α-humulene and 3-car-3-ene-2-one were only presented in the same one. Thirty seven constituents representing 97.8% in the S3 EO, were composed mainly of linalool (34.2%), camphor (27.7%), trans-linalool oxide (16.2%) and limonene (2.6%). The S3 EO yield was 8.8% (v/w). Similar results with slightly higher levels of limonene (3.8%) and EO yield (10.2%, v/w) were reported for S4 EO. In this sample, 39 constituents representing 98.3% were identified with linalool (33.9%), camphor (26.1%) and trans-linalool oxide (14.6%) as the main constituents. Thirty six constituents representing 98.2% detected in the S5 EO that camphor (34.7%), linalool (34.6%), trans-linalool oxide (7.6%) and borneol (3.4%) were the main compounds. The S5 EO yield was obtained 7.4% (V/W).
