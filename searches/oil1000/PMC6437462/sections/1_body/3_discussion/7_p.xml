<p class="p">In our study, there was no considerable cytotoxicity variability between the examined geographical locations. A375 and MCF7 were most sensitive to the S3 and S5 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 624 and 642 μg/ml, respectively. On the whole, the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae </italic>samples exhibited moderate cytotoxicity. This study is the first report that describes the cytotoxic activity of the EO of the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae, </italic>but according to data available in the literature, it could be hypothesized that camphor and linalool may be attributed to account for the cytotoxic activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae </italic>EO. Linalool, as one of the main component of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. majdae</italic> EO, has been reported to be cytotoxic to C32 and ACHN (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). It was demonstrated that linalool can have cytotoxic effects by inducing cells to undergo apoptosis and triggering cell death (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). However, in another study, linalool was not active against PC-3, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF7, SK-MEL-28, and 5637 human tumor cells in concentration of 100 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). In addition, the non-cytotoxic effect of camphor and borneol was reported (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). However, minor components may be contribute to the cytotoxicity of the oil. It is also possible that the minor constituents may be involved in some type of synergism with the other active compounds, which deserves attention in future studies.
