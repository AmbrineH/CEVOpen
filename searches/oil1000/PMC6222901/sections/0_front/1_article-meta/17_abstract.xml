  <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic> L. (summer savory) is an annual herbaceous crop, native to Europe and in our days spread and used all over the world. Although its use as spice and medicinal plant is known since ancient times, peer-reviewed studies presenting the scientific data are scarce. The natural products obtained from summer savory (extracts and essential oil) are dominated by polyphenols and flavonoids, responsible for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, pesticidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective and anticancer properties, among others. The current study presents the progress made in the last decade regarding the potential applications of summer savory, being the first review study focused on 
  <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic>, in the same time suggesting future research opportunities, as they appear from the properties of other 
  <italic class="italic">Satureja</italic> species. The available data presenting the properties of summer savory represents a scientific support for application in industry, for developing “clean label” food products.
