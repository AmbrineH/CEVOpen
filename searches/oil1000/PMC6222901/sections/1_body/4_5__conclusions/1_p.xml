<p class="p">Summer savory (
 <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic> L.) is known and used since ancient time as herbal remedy, spice and food flavoring. Original from Europe, it is now grown and used in most parts of the world, in several industries. With a composition dominated by polyphenols and flavonoids, the natural products obtained from summer savory were proven to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, pesticidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective and anticancer properties, among others. The literature survey demonstrates that the chemical composition of the natural products is changed significantly with the cultivation and geographical conditions, as well as with the stages of development at harvesting time.
