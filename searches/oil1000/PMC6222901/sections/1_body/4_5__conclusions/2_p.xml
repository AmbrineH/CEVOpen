<p class="p">The current study aimed to present the progress made in the study of this understudied plant in the last decade. According to our findings, most of the literature data focuses on antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic>, although the different uses demonstrated for other 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja</italic> species would suggest the exploration of new applications. This, in turn, would be a promising research area for future studies.
