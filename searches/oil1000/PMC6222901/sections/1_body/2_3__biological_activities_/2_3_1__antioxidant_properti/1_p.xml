<p class="p">Due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds, 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> essential oil presents antioxidant activity, demonstrated through in vitro studies [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Commercial essential oil (from Iran) was proven to exert a considerable antioxidant effect, as determined by different assays, such as 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) diammonium salt (ABTS), ferric thiocyanate and β-carotene bleaching [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic> essential oil (SHEO—obtained by hydro-distillation from Turkish vegetal material) to chitosan nanoparticles offered the nanoparticles antioxidant properties (ranging from 43.66% to 56.99%, as determined by the DPPH assay), in direct correlation with the EO content [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. A similar observation was made by Shojaee-Aliabadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] upon the addition of Iranian commercial SHEO to κ-carrageenan films. On their study regarding the antioxidant potential of EO extracted from fifteen Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> samples, Samadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] obtained values of antioxidant activity index (determined by reporting the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values obtained by the DPPH assay to the value resulted using the positive control BHT) between 0.17 and 0.46. The authors assign the antioxidant activity registered to the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, carvacrol and β-bisabolene.
