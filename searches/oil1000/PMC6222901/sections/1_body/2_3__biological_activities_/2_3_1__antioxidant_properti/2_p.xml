<p class="p">The extracts obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> were also proven to have antioxidant properties: Mašković et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] compared the antioxidant properties of extracts obtained by various methods from Serbian summer savory (methods presented in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-molecules-23-02458" class="xref">Section 2</xref>) using several assays: determination of total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation assay, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and DPPH assay. Their work demonstrated that the extract obtained by subcritical water extraction proved to be superior to the other methods in all the applied assays. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> was evaluated for antioxidant properties, by comparison with 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia dracunculus</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Results of DPPH, ABTS and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays showed superior activity for the 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> extract, in good correlation with the higher total phenolic and total flavonoid content registered.
