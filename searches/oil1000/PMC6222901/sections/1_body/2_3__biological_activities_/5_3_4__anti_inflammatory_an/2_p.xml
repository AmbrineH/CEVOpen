<p class="p">Hajhashemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] presented the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of several natural products obtained from Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> roots (essential oil, hydroalcoholic extract and polyphenolic extract). Using acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin licking test and carrageenan-induced paw edema, the authors observed the inhibition of the abdominal writhes of all products, reduction of the licking time in the acute formalin test by the hydroalcoholic extract and by all materials in the chronic phase, as well as the anti-inflammatory potential of the EO (400 ÂµL/kg), hydroalcoholic extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) and polyphenolic extract (400 mg/kg). Vafaei et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] obtained good results using hydroalcoholic extract for diminishing the morphine withdrawal syndrome signs.
