<p class="p">The hepatoprotective role of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> extract was presented by Boroja et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] for treating cisplatin-induced liver injury in rats, in correlation with the antioxidant properties (see Chapter 3.1), obtaining a maximum dose safe to apply under 200 mg/kg b.w. The results using 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> extract were similar regarding the regulation of the hepatic serum parameters similar to silymarin (a known natural hepatoprotective drug). Although good anti-diabetic and anticholesterolemic properties were reported for other 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], there were no scientific studies found regarding those effects of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> products in the time range reviewed. This could be an opportunity for future studies, as the EO and extracts are rich in carvacrol and thymol (responsible for lowering the serum cholesterol levels) and in flavonoids (possessing antioxidant and anti-hyperlipidemic properties) [
