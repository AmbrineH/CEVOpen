 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis.</italic> The antifungal efficiency tested against two aflatoxigenic moulds 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus parasiticus</italic>, revealed an increase with the exposure of the extract to low radiation doses (1.2 kGy), followed by the decrease with higher doses (3 and 5.1 kGy). The authors assign the decrease of the antifungal activity with the high irradiation doses to decreases or structural changes in the phenols, carvacrol and thymol contents of the irradiated extracts.
