<p class="p">The presence of monoterpenes such as carvacrol, cymene and thymol in the essential oil indicates the high possibility of antimicrobial activities against food, plants and human pathogens [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The evaluation of SHEO obtained from Iranian plants revealed a good antimicrobial activity against several types of microorganisms, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.06 µL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic> to 8 µL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and minimal lethal concentration (MLC) values ranging from 0.06 µL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic> to 16 µL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The results were superior to those obtained for the control substances used (vancomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin) for all the studied lines, except 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The authors suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the EO could be attributed to its thymol and carvacrol content, with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene indirectly increasing their effect. The antimicrobial mechanism is presented (damage in membrane integrity, causing leakage of ions and other cell compounds and eventually death), in the same time evaluating the individual EO’s components antimicrobial properties.
