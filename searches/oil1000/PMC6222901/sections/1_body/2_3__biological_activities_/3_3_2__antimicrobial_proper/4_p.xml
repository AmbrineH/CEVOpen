<p class="p">SHEO was obtained by Dikbas et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] from wild-growing Turkish plants, having as major components carvacrol (54.7%), γ-terpinene (20.9%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (12.3%), α-terpinene (2.0%), and thymol (2.0%). The exposure to SHEO vapors reduced the decay of strawberry and grape fruit in post-harvest stage, especially at low temperatures (5 and 10 °C), in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained on grapes at post-harvest stage [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], as well as on fruits and vegetables post-harvest fungi. The effect of SHEO extracted from Iranian plants was observed on 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonifer</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">R. stolonifer</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The obtained results offer the possibility to develop natural antifungals for disease control in post-harvest stage.
