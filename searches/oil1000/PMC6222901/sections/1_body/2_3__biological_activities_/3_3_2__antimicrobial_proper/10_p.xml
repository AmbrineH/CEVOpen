 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] determined the antibacterial potential of EO and extracts (n-hexane, chloroform, acetone and methanol) obtained from Turkish 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> against fourteen plant pathogenic bacteria by comparison with pure compounds (carvacrol and thymol). The EO showed a good antimicrobial activity against all tested strains (with MIC values ranging from 15.63 to 125 µL/mL), while the extracts had a weak activity against a limited number of pathogens. The pure compounds had MIC values ranging from 15.63 to 31.25 µL/mL. In the same time, the experiments performed on lettuce seeds showed that the hexane–methanol extract mixture can be used as a seed disinfectant and as potential control agents for management of bacterial diseases.
