 <xref rid="B61-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] presented effect of SHEO intake on mice with high cancer risk. By the intensification of polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis and reduction of lipid peroxidation products, the intake seems to be beneficial. The essential oil delivered through the drinking water (0.15 mg/L, daily intake approx. 2–3 mL) over a period of ten months, led to a significant increase of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and a decrease of monounsaturated acids in brain and liver, accompanied by a reduction of lipid peroxidation products, thus proposing SHEO for therapeutic and preventive purposes.
