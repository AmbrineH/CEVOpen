<p class="p">SHEO obtained from Turkish vegetal material (characterized by GC-MS as dominated by carvacrol, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and thymol) was evaluated as a natural insecticide against broadbean weevil (
 <italic class="italic">Bruchus dentipes</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The results suggested a good insecticidal activity, with an 83.3% mortality at a concentration of 5 µL/L and an exposure time of 6 h. The mortality increased with both the concentration of EO and exposure time, reaching a 100% mortality at a concentration of 20 µL/L and a contact time of 24 h. By discussing the differences observed between the insecticidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum acutidens</italic> correlated with their composition, the authors assign the toxic effect to carvacrol, in the same dime drawing attention to the potential synergistic and antagonistic effects of other compounds.
