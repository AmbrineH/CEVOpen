<p class="p">Essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> Iranian plants (with major constituents carvacrol, γ-terpinene, thymol, α-pinene and β-ocimene) was successfully encapsulated in chitosan/TPP (
 <italic class="italic">tripolyphosphate</italic>) nanoparticles by Ahmadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Having the advantage of a controlled release (established over a period of 600 h, thus offering a sustained release of the EO), the materials proposed showed a very good acaricidal activity against adults and eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">Tetranychus urticae</italic> Koch. The results indicated that encapsulation enhanced the SHEO fumigant toxicity after 24 h with the LC50 values significantly higher than the pure EO. This approach increased the longevity of lethal activity, with a mortality of 82% after 14 days, compared with the lethality of pure SHEO, reduced to 12% after the same time period.
