<p class="p">The potential application of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> essential oil as a natural herbicide was recently presented by Hazrati et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The SHEO obtained by hydrodistillation from aerial parts of plants collected at the beginning of the fruit stage was dominated by carvacrol and Î³-terpinene (55.66% and 31.98%, respectively, determined by GC-MS). The EO, formulated as nanoemulsion (EO concentration 5 mL/L) exhibited herbicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium album</italic> (at a nanoemulsion concentration of 1 mL/L in laboratory and 4 mL/L in greenhouse conditions), two weeds with world-wide spread.
