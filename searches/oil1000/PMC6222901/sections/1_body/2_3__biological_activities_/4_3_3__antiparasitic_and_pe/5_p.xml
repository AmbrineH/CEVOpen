 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] studied the insecticidal effect of some Lamiaceae extracts and essential oils obtained by several methods from plants growing in the Czech Republic. The extracts and the EO (dominated in composition by carvacrol, γ-terpinene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene) were tested in terms of acute toxicity, by measuring the mortality after 24 h, by application to the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> and to the adults of 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. decemlineata</italic>. Summer savory natural products (especially the EO and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract) were active against all tested insects, the most sensitive being the larvae of Colorado potato beetle, with a LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 22 µg.
