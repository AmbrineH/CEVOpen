<p class="p">The chemical composition of summer savory was revealed in several studies performed on 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> volatile oils and, in fewer cases, extracts. Considering the general composition, the fresh leaves contain moisture (72%), protein (4.2%), fat (1.65%), sugar (4.45%), fibre (8.60%) and ash (2.11%) [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Discussing the composition on a dry weight basis, the main source for bioactive compounds is the volatile oil (up to 5%), triterpenic acids, tannins (up to 8%), mucilage, resins, sugars, mineral salts, etc. [
