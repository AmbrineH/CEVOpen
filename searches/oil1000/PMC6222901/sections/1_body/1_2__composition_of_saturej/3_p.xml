<p class="p">The extracts obtained from aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> represents the subject of significantly fewer studies, when compared with the essential oils. The methanolic extract obtained by maceration was proven to be dominated by rosmarinic acid (24.9 mg/g), caffeic acid (1.3 mg/g), naringenin (1.1 mg/g), isoferulic acid (220 µg/g) and apigenin (165 µg/g). Other flavones (luteolin) and their glycosides (apigetrin and vitexin), as well as flavonol (quercetin), flavonol glycosides (isoquercitrin, astragalin, quercitrin) and coumarin derivatives (aesculin and aesculetin) were also detected [

A comparative study on the effect of different extraction procedures (Soxhlet extraction, maceration, ultrasound-assisted extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, subcritical water extraction) on the composition of the summer savory extracts showed a variation of the total phenolic content between 119 and 151 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g, total flavonoids content between 5 and 28 mg rutin equivalents (RU)/g, condensed tannins between 41 and 73 mg GAE/g, gallotannins between 12 and 35 mg GAE/g and total anthocyanins content between 103 and 144 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents (CGE)/g, all superior for the subcritical water extraction. The HPLC quantification of several compounds revealed the presence of rosmarinic acid, quercetin, apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, chlorogenic acid, rutin and apigenin-glycoside, among others, all molecules with demonstrated biological activities [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] evaluated variation in composition of the summer savory essential oil under different storage conditions, focusing on the content in α-thujene, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-phellandrene, myrcene, α-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene and carvacrol. Their conclusions were that due to several mechanisms presented by the authors, the quality of the essential oil increased with storage time (expressed by the increase in carvacrol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and β-phellandrene). The conclusion is of particular interest for industrial applications, in which the storage times are extensive.
