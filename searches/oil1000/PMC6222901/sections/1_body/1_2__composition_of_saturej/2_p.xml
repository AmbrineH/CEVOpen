<p class="p">The volatile oil isolated from summer savory has as major components carvacrol, thymol, phenols, and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Several studies identified in the volatile oils as main components thymol (0.3–28.2%), γ-terpinene (15.30–39%), carvacrol (11–67%), and

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Despite the obvious differences between their results, all studies generally present the same componence of the volatile oils (besides the major components identifying the presence of α-phellandrene, α- and β-pinene, sabinene, terpineol, α-thujene, etc.). The different results obtained by the authors are due to seasonal variation, climatic factors, agronomic procedure, genetic structure, etc. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02458" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Thus, when discussing the potential application of essential oil or extracts obtained from summer savory, at least the harvesting area and general composition should be provided, in order to present a clear picture of the reviewed results.
