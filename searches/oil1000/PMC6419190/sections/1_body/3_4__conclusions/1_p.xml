<p class="p">In this work, a new high environmentally friendly composites based on linen byproducts was obtained using industrial manufacturing by resin transfer molding (RTM). The developed material has a bio-based content of about 78%. As base epoxy resin, epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) was used and composites with three plies of flax fabrics were manufactured by RTM. As hardener, a binary mixture (50:50) of methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) and maleinized linseed oil (MLO) was used to increase the overall bio-based content without compromising other properties. In general, in absence of MLO as co-hardener, composites with high mechanical resistant properties are obtained due to the rigid MNA molecule. On the other hand, when MLO is used as co-hardener, the presence of long fatty acid chains provided improved ductile properties in composites materials (a percentage increase of 42% and 43% in elongation at break and Charpy’s impact energy respectively). Nevertheless, an unexpected behavior was observed due to combined effects of using MLO as co-hardener and using previous surface treatments of flax fabrics. In this case, composites show more flexibility than composites without previous surface treatment (with a percentage increase in Charpy’s impact energy and elongation at break of 26% and 87% in respectively). A previous surface treatment on flax fabrics using silanes or maleic anhydride leads to reduce the reactions sites between the ELO-based epoxy resin and the flax fiber. SEM images demonstrated how presence of MLO and treated fibers provide better fiber–matrix interaction. On the other hand, if a previous surface treatment is not carried out, the –OH groups present in the cellulose provide enough active points to create chemical bonds with MLO used as co-hardener resulting in stiffer materials, as tensile, flexural, Charpy impact test and DMA studies demonstrated. Results also suggest that the use of maleic anhydride gives the composite materials greater ductility due to esterification of cellulose surface. By selecting the amount of MLO it is possible to tailor the desired properties in a high environmental efficiency composite material, thus giving new opportunities to these green materials in a wide range of industrial applications.</p>
