<p class="p">Finally, it is must be taken into account that one of the main drawbacks to manufacture bio-composites using natural fibers, like flax, hemp, jute, kenaf and other lignocellulosic fibers, is the high intrinsic hydrophilicity due to presence of hydroxyl groups in the cellulose structure. This results in the possible formation of ineffective interfaces between the hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymeric matrices. This poor (or lack of) interactions result in debonding problems and presence of voids in the obtained composites [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. An important method to improve the compatibility along the interface between the fiber and the polymeric matrix is the use of chemical treatments on the fiber. Different functional groups can react with hydroxyl groups in cellulose to minimize the intrinsic hydrophilicity. Among others, it is worthy to remark the use of mercerization sodium hydroxide, and the use of peroxides, organics acids and silanes [
