<p class="p">Today, due to the growing environmental awareness, the scientific community and manufacturers have focused their attention on flax fiber, as it is the most widely used bio-fiber in composite materials [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Flax fibers and other bio-fibers are used as ecological alternatives to glass fiber in composites for engineering applications [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In 2010, 13% of the total reinforcement materials were bio-fibers, while a forecasting up to 2020, states that this percentage will be higher than 28% [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Bio-fibers, such as flax, have a potential as a raw material in composites used in building industries, sport equipment, packaging, paper, furniture, and automotive industries [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The chemical composition of flax fiber, as reported by several authors (about 64%–74% cellulose, 11%–17% hemicellulose, 2%–3% lignin, and 1%–2% pectin, 1.5% waxes, and 8%–10% water) allows an optimal equilibrium between mechanical and ductile properties [
