<p class="p">If flax fibers are compared with E-glass fibers (
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00301-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), one of the most common fibers used in composites, it is possible to realize that flax fibers have the capability to replace glass. If we also take into account their low price, low toxicity, high strength to weigh ratio, and the possibility of recovering energy at the end of the life cycle, it is clear that flax fibers are highly promising fibers [
