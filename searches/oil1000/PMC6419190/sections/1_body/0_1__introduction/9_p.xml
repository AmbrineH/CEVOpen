<p class="p">This work describes the manufacturing and characterization of high environmental friendly composites using different vegetable oil-derived products from 
 <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic>. The base resin consisted in an epoxy resin derived from linseed oil (LO), namely, epoxidized linseed oil (ELO). The hardener was partially bio-based as it was composed of petroleum-derived methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) and bio-based maleinized linseed oil (MLO) with a weight fraction of 50:50. Finally, flax fabrics were used as reinforcements and were converted into high environmental efficiency composite materials by resin transfer molding (RTM). The overall bio-based content of these composites is close to 78% (as it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> which shows the flax-derived components). Several surface treatments were carried out on fibers to overcome their intrinsic hydrophilicity. A surface treatment was carried with two different silanes, amino (I) and glycidyl (II) and a third treatment consisted on esterification of hydroxyl groups in cellulose by reaction with maleic anhydride (III).
