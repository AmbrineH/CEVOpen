<p class="p">As an environmentally friendly alternative to petrochemical hardeners used in bio-resins, vegetable oils can also be chemically modified to introduce the maleic anhydride in its structure by reacting maleic anhydride (MA) with unsaturations contained in vegetable oils through a combination of Diels-Alder condensation and “ene” reactions. Whang et al. studied the use of maleated castor oil to produce biodegradable foam plastics [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the two different pathways to modify the basic triglyceride structure of linseed oil used to give both the base epoxy resin (epoxidized linseed oil, ELO) and maleic anhydride-derived hardener (maleinized linseed oil, MLO). Therefore, chemical compounds derived from vegetable oils are a good alternative to reduce environmental impact, thus contributing to a sustainable development by reducing petroleum dependency and giving a response to the growing demand for greener products [
