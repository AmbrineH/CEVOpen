 <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic> in bio-composites do not only comprise its use as reinforcement fiber. The oil obtained from the seed, commonly known as linseed oil, is a triglyceride whose composition depends on the type of plant and growing conditions. Traditionally, this oil has been used as a binder in paint formulations and wood finish due to its drying ability [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Despite this, the high unsaturation degree (carbonâ€“carbon double bonds) present in the major fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic fatty acids with two and three unsaturations respectively, allows the possibility of converting this vegetable oil into thermosetting resins. To achieve this, polymerization can take place thorough reactions involving these double bonds [

 <xref rid="B18-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Although this direct polymerization, (homopolymerization) is feasible and technically viable, the most widely used route is the conversion of double bonds into functional groups that can then be easily polymerized due to an increase in reactivity. This is the case of the epoxidation process, which converts double bonds contained in the different fatty acids into oxirane rings by reaction of the oil with peroxoacids. Epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) has been used in the last decade as bio-based thermoset polymer in multiple studies [
