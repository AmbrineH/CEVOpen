It is important to take into account that basic cyclic anhydrides such as maleic anhydride (MA) and phthalic anhydride (PA) are solids at room temperature and, although they have been used in cross-linking epoxidized vegetable oils [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], it is worthy to note a particular family of cyclic anhydrides which are liquids at room temperature, which is a key feature in using them as curing agents [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Cyclic anhydrides such as methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MTHPA), dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA), methyl nadic anhydride (MNA), among others, are widely used as cross-linking agents in epoxy resins for high thermal performance [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It is necessary to take into account that the curing process of at thermosetting bio-resin with anhydrides is a complex reaction involving different chemical interactions, so that initiators and/or catalysts as imidazole and glycerol respectively are needed. The reactivity of a chemical compound involved in a cross-linking process is measured by the equivalent weight, which indicates the mass of a compound containing an equivalent gram of a reacting chemical group. In epoxy-based materials the equivalent epoxide weight (EEW) is used, while for anhydrides the anhydride equivalent weight (AEW) gives the appropriate information about their ability to form cross-links. Among the liquid cyclic anhydrides, it is worthy to note the increasing use of methyl-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride or nadic methyl anhydride (MNA). This petrochemical hardener has an AEW of 178 g equiv
