<p class="p">The morphology of the fractured samples from impact tests was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a Phenom (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) microscope. The coating process lasted 120 s using the model of sputter-coater Emitech mod. SC 7620 (Quorum Technologies, East Sussex, UK). SEM technique was mainly used to identify the fiberâ€“matrix interactions achieved after the different surface treatments on flax fabrics.</p>
