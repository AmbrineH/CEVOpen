<p class="p">The study of the mechanical properties of the different composites was completed by three different techniques. Tensile tests were carried out following the guidelines of ASTM D3039-08 on a universal testing machine Instron Model 3382. The load cell was 100 kN and a crosshead rate of 2 mm·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was used. On the other hand, flexural properties were also studied according the ASTM D790-10, using an universal testing model Lloyd 30 K with a crosshead rate of 1.7 mm·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and a load cell of 500 N. Impact toughness of the developed composites was studied by the Charpy impact test on a pendulum model Metrotec S.A. with a maximum energy of 6 J. A minimum of five different samples was characterized and average values for each mechanical property were calculated. All mechanical tests were carried out at room temperature.
