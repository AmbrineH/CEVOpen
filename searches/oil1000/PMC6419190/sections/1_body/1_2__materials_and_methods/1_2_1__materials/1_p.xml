<p class="p">As bio-based epoxy matrix an epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) supplied by Traquisa S.A (Barberá del Vallés, Barcelona, Spain) was used. The main parameters of this epoxy resin are a molecular weight of 1037 g mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, containing ±8% of epoxide oxygen and an average distribution of fatty acids as follows: 3%–5% stearic acid, 5%–7% palmitic acid, 14%–20% linoleic acid, 20%–26% oleic acid and 50%–56% linolenic acid. As a hardener a liquid mixture (50 wt%:50 wt%) from methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) and maleinized linseed oil (MLO) was used. MNA has an anhydride equivalent weight (AEW) of 178 g equiv
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and, it was supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). On the other hand, MLO has an acid value comprised between 105–130 mg KOH g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and a maximum viscosity at 20 °C of 10 dPa·s. MLO was supplied by Vandeputte Group (Mouscron, Belgium). As accelerator 2 wt.% of 1-methyl imidazole supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) was used. In the same way as the catalyst provider of hydroxyl groups, glycerol (0.8 wt.%) from Sigma Aldrich (Madrid, Spain) was used. These percentages were optimized in previous works [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Composites were manufactured with three layers with the same fiber orientation with a surface density of 200 g·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Flax fiber was supplied by Hilaturas Ferre (Hilaturas Ferre S.A., Banyeres, Spain). Flax fabrics were subjected to a previous surface treatment to reduce hydrophilicity. Two different silanes and maleic anhydride supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Madrid, Spain) were used. The first silane an aminosilane: [3-(2-aminoethylamine) propyl]-trimethoxysilane while the second silane consisted on a glycidyl silane: [2-(7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] hept-3-yl) ethyl] silane.
