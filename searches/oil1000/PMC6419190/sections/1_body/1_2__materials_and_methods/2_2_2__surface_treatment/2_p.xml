<p class="p">As an alternative to silanization, a surface treatment with maleic anhydride on flax fabrics was also carried out. This is an effective method to modify the chemical composition of flax fibers and improve the adhesion between the hydrophilic flax fiber and the hydrophobic resin. The procedure proposed by Cantero et al. was followed to carry out the esterification process [

Briefly, maleic anhydride was applied in an amount of 10% in respect to the total fibers weight and with a fiber:solvent ratio of 1:25. Fibers were immersed for 24 h in boiling acetone. After this process, fibers were washed with cold water until stabilization of pH was achieved, and finally dried in air recirculating oven at 100 Â°C for 12 h.
