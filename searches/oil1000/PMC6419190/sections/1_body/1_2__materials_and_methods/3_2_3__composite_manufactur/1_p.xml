<p class="p">The manufacturing process used to develop composite laminates was resin transfer molding (RTM). The equipment consisted of a Hypaject MKII (Plastech, Thermoset Tectonics, Gunnislake, UK). In order to reduce the intrinsic viscosity of the ELO and MNA/MLO hardener and enable the injection of the mixture into the mold, an injection temperature of 60 °C with a pressure of 100 kPa was used. The pressure in the mold cavity was 95 kPa and the selected curing cycle consisted of an isothermal process at 100 °C for 3 h, as optimized in previous works [
