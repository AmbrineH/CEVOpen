<p class="p">On one hand, the addition of MLO as co-hardener in a mixture with MNA, substantially improved the ductility of composites as it was expected. As Chern et al. and Balart et al. described [
 <xref rid="B59-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], this is due to the presence of long fatty acid chains in MLO structure which increase considerably ductile properties as elongation at break, maximum deflection in flexural test, or a decrease on glass transition temperature.
