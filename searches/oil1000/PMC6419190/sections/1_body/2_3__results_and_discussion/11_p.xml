<p class="p">The dynamic mechanical analysis of the composites has been carried out to study the mechanical properties under dynamic loading and increasing temperature. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows a plot evolution of the storage modulus (G’) as a function of the increasing temperature. Firstly, it is possible to see that DMA curves for composites containing MLO as co-hardener are located below the curve of composites without MLO (MNA and MNA:GLYC). The elastic-vitreous behavior of all composites developed could be detected below the glass transition temperature (

 <sub class="sub">g</sub>), with high storage modulus values. Maximum G′ values are obtained in MNA and MNA:GLYC composites, as expected, with values around 3000 MPa at 30 °C. On the other hand, the increase in ductile properties provided by the use of MLO as co-hardener, can be observed in MNA:MLO composite, manufactured without any surface treatment, which has a G′ of 1000 MPa. Moreover, when a surface treatment is applied on flax fabrics, the storage modulus decreases to values below 350 MPa (in the case of a glycidyl silane treatment). This is in total agreement with previous mechanical results, which suggested a clear softening effect when MLO was used as co-hardener combined with a surface treatment on flax fabrics. Once the glass transition is overpassed the elastic-viscous of the composite provides lower G′ values. It is important to remark that composites without MLO co-hardener offer a sharp decrease, with G′ values around 100 MPa at 100 °C. Meanwhile, the decrease in G′ values for composites containing MLO is much lower, changing from values around 1000 MPa down to 150 MPa, which are even higher than those corresponding to composites without MLO. The influence of the presence of MLO in the mechanical behavior of composites it is considered as a stabilizing effect due to in samples with presence of MLO, the decrease in G′ values are lower, giving as result higher values at high temperatures, in a similar way that has been reported with different byproducts from vegetal oils [
