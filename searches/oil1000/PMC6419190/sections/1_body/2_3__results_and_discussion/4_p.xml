<p class="p">These unexpected results are in opposition to what coupling agents or previous esterification usually promote. Multiple studies have reported that the use of surface treatments such as silane coupling agents and maleic anhydride esterification increase the mechanical properties as the hydrophobicity of the lignocellulosic reinforcement decreases so that there is increased affinity with to polymeric matrix [

This composite is characterized by the absence of MLO as co-hardener. Thus, it is possible to determinate that the presence of MLO as a hardener has a direct influence of the behavior of surface-treated flax fabrics. The MNA:GLYC composite has higher mechanical properties than all other composites, including the MNA composite. Thus, this behavior allows obtaining a series of conclusions:
