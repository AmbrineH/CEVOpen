<p class="p">Unexpected results are obtained when both the MLO co-hardener and a previous surface treatment on flax fabric are combined. Composites manufactured with flax fibers previously treated and the use of MLO as a co-hardener have greater ductility than composites without previous surface treatment on flax fibers. In order to explain the possible chemical interaction, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>A shows the possible reaction sites between cellulose and maleic anhydride-based hardeners. The multiple –OH groups naturally present in cellulose react with MLO and MNA by opening the maleic anhydride group, giving the corresponding esters and leading to multiple anchorage points. These reactions reduce molecular mobility and provide stiffness for composites. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>B shows the possible interaction with a previous surface treatment on fibers. In this case, the hydrolyzed groups present in the silanes, directly interact with the –OH groups present in cellulose, thus blocking hydroxyl groups in cellulose. Consequently, available reactions sites for MLO and the MNA are remarkable reduced. This reduction of the potential anchor points limits the chemical interaction and, therefore, the composite materials have greater ductility. On the other hand, as Raza et al. have demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B63-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] the use of maleinized vegetable oils provide hydrophobicity to cellulose fibers by attaching its nonpolar hydrocarbon chain on the surface of the fibers through its anhydride groups which can react to form a covalent ester bond at the interface.
