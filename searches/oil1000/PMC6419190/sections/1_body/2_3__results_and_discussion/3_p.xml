<p class="p">It is possible to observe that, when flax fabrics are previously treated with amino- or glycidyl silane or subjected to a previous esterification with maleic anhydride, mechanical resistant parameters decrease considerably. While MNA composite has a flexural modulus greater than 6600 MPa, composites with flax fabrics treated with amino silane, glycidyl silane and maleic anhydride have values 60.7%, 73.7% and 77.4% lower respectively. The same trend can be observed for flexural strength (
