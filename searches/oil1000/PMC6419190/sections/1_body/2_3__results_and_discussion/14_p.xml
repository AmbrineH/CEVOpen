 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>B–E show the fracture surface of composites cured with the presence of MLO as co-hardener. It is possible to observe differences with the abovementioned composites cured without MLO co-hardener. Gaps between fiber and polymeric matrix are reduced, which is a positive effect on the overall fiber–matrix continuity that allows improved load transfer. This good fiber–matrix interaction can be assessed by the presence of polymeric matrix chemically bonded to the fiber, which is not pullet out during the fracture process. As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>b, the use of a previous silanization treatment on fibers improves the overall matrix–fiber interaction but does not justify the existence of these polymer residues in the fibers. In fact, in this image the fiber treated with glycidyl silane appears clean. This polymer residue located on the fiber gives a positive effect on the fiber–matrix interaction. Therefore, this could be attributed to the effects of MLO co-hardener, which must be able to interact between both the flax fiber and the ELO matrix, leading to a synergistic effect: overall flexibilization as well as increasing the interaction. As we have demonstrated previously, these samples cured with MLO co-hardener are characterized by high ductile properties, with Charpy’s impact energy above 30 kJ·m

In view of the obtained results with these flax-based composites, it seems that a pre-treatment on fibers (silanization or esterification by maleic anhydride) together the use of MLO as co-hardener play an essential role on final mechanical properties.
