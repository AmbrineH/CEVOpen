<p class="p">Regarding the possible differences of the three surface treatments carried out, it should be noted that the composite material manufactured with MLO and a previous treatment of flax fibers with maleic anhydride, seems to give rise to the material with greater ductile properties. For example, the MNA:MLO:MAL composite has an elongation break 2.7 times higher than MNA composite and 1.9 times higher than MNA:MLO composite. This behavior was previously detailed by other authors, such as Sawpan et al. [
