 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref> shows a schematic representation of the chemical structures that take part in the cross-linking process and composite manufacturing. The mechanical results, as was proved previously, suggest that, like many other authors described, the use of silanes allows a better interaction between the flax fibers and the ELO-based polymeric matrix [
