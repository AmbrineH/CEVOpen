<p class="p">As indicated previously, all properties related with deformation are increased with MLO presence. It is possible to see that maximum deflection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>F) are clearly higher when 50 EEW% of MLO is added and a previous surface treatment of the flax fabrics is carried out. For this reason, it is possible to confirm a synergistic effect in ductile properties due to the combined effect of the addition of MLO as a co-hardener and previous treatments with silanes, or by maleic anhydride esterification.
