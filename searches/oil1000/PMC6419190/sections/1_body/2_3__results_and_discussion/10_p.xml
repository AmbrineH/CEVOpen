<p class="p">Regarding impact properties, the main results obtained in the Charpy impact test obtained are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. In the first approach, by analyzing the influence of MLO as co-hardener it is possible to conclude that the MNA:MLO composite has an impact energy (kJ·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) 45.7% higher than the same material using only MNA as hardener (MNA composite). Secondly, previous surface treatments of flax fabrics with amino-, glycidyl silane and anhydride maleic esterification provides increased toughness of around 100.3%, 120.2% and 58.9% respectively with regard to the MNA:MLO sample. The presence of long fatty acid chains in MLO used as partial substitute of MNA (co-hardener) increases considerably the impact properties of the developed composites. Finally, the comparison of results between MNA and MNA:GLYC composites allows demonstrating again that the surface treatment has been carried out in a correct way, and that it is effective only when MLO is not present. When MLO is not used as co-hardener, surface treatment leads to an increment of intermolecular bonding between ELO resin and flax fiber, thus leading to a stiffening effect on the composite (impact energy 1.77 kJ·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> respect 1.65 kJ·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). This typical trend has been reported by other authors such as Samper et al. [
