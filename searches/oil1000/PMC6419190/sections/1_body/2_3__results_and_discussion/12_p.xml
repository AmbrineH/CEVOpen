 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows its evolution with increasing temperature. Composites cross-linked with MLO co-hardener provide a shift of the phase angle peak to lower temperatures. The temperature peak of the phase angle represents the glass transition (

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> values, which is in total agreement with the previous mechanical test. In this case, the use of glycidyl silane provides stronger interaction between flax fiber and the ELO-based epoxy resin. When MLO is used as co-hardener, together with MNA (MNA:MLO composite) the corresponding

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> value falls down to 52.4 °C, which represents a percentage decrease of about 22,2% with regard to MNA composite. As it has been suggested before, this decrease in

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> values could be attributed to presence of flexible MLO molecules in composites, which reduce rigidity of the material under dynamic loading conditions [

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> values, thus giving evidence of a synergistic flexibilization effect by combining MLO co-hardener and previous surface treatments on flax fabrics. The lowest

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> of about 42% with regard to MNA composite. It is important to remark that phase angle peaks in composites cured with MLO as co-hardener, show a broadening effect in a similar way that Chem et al. have reported in polyurethane-modified. This phenomenon could be explained by the decrease in the cross-linking density of the epoxy using a MNA/MLO mixture as hardener, thus leading to a broader distribution and relaxation times of molecules in composite [
