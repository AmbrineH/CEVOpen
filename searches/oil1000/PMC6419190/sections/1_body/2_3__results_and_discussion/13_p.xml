<p class="p">The morphology of the fracture surface of the composites (after Charpy impact testing) was studied by SEM (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). It is possible to identify two different morphologies: a brittle fracture and ductile fracture morphology. With regard to brittle fractures, MNA and MNA:GLYC composites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>A,F) clearly show this brittle fracture morphology. These samples, both cured without MLO co-hardener are characterized by a homogenous fractured surface, without relevant changes in surface roughness. It can also be seen that the longitudinal surfaces of individual fibers are very clean, with no adhered matrix. This kind of surface is typical of a brittle fracture during impact test, with an associated impact energy value of 20 kJ·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Impact test-absorbed energy is directly related to the fragility of the material. However, with a more detailed analysis on these surfaces at higher magnifications (1000×) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>), it is possible to observe an improved fiber–polymer interaction, which can be seen by a reduction of the gap between lignocellulosic flax fiber and the ELO matrix, when flax fabric has been previously treated with glycidyl silane. It is possible to confirm that the interaction between the flax fiber and the surrounding polymeric ELO-based matrix has been improved, by reducing substantially the gap between them. This better fiber–matrix continuity is responsible for load/stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber. This phenomenon leads to a positive effect on mechanical performance of composites, as the Charpy’s impact energy showed. In fact, the impact-absorber energy for MNA:GLYC composite (with a previous silanization process with a glycidyl silane) is 19.6% than that of the MNA composite without any previous silane treatment).
