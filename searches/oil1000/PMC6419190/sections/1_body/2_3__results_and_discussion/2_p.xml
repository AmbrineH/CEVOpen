<p class="p">MNA composite is taken as the reference material as it is cross-linked without MLO and, on the other hand, flax fabrics are not subjected to any surface treatment. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A, the flexural modulus of MNA composite is greater than 6600 MPa. If this value is compared with MNA:MLO composite it is possible to see that the presence of MLO results in a less rigid material (4480 MPa). In the same way, flexural strength of both samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00301-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>C) suffers a decrease higher than 40%. Different authors such as Ray et al. and Lackinger et al. have reported this decrease in parameters related with resistant mechanical properties [

 <xref rid="B52-polymers-11-00301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. This behavior could be attributed to the presence of flexible MLO molecules, which reduce the rigidity of the cross-linked material. Therefore, replacing 50 EEW% of petrochemical hardener as MNA by MLO makes the material greener and more sustainable, but a decrease in mechanical resistant properties is observed while an improvement of ductile properties is expected.
