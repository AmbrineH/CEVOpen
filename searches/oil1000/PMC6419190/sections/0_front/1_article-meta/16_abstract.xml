 <p class="p">Green composites, with more than 78 wt.% of products obtained from linen 
  <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic>, were developed in this research work. Epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) was used as bio-based resin, a mix of nadic methyl anhydride (MNA) and maleinized linseed oil (MLO) were used as cross-linkers and finally, flax fabrics were used to obtain composite laminates by resin transfer molding (RTM). The flax fibers were modified using amino-silane, glycidyl-silane and maleic anhydride treatment in order to increase the compatibility between lignocellulosic fibers and the polymeric matrix. Mechanical and thermal properties were studied by flexural, tensile and impact test, as well as dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) to study the viscoelastic behavior. Contrary to what could be expected, when fibers are previously treated in presence of MLO, a reduction of anchorage points is obtained causing a substantial increase in the ductile properties compared with composites without previous fiber treatment or without MLO.
