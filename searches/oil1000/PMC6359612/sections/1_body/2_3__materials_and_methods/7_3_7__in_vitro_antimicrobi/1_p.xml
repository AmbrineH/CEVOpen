 <xref rid="B49-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The microorganisms were grown to exponential phase (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL) in nutrient broth (BIOXON, Mexico city, Mexico) at 35 °C for 18 h. One milliliter of the inoculum was transferred to 9 mL of trypticase soy broth, and the EO or extracts at different concentrations (50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/L) were added. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined as the lowest concentration without observed growth. Inoculated tubes without EO or extracts were used as the control. For the determination of the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), a loopful of tubes with no visible growth after incubation was inoculated in Trypticase Soy Agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MBC was reported as the concentration without microbial growth detected in plates.
