<p class="p">The free radical scavenging capacity was evaluated using the DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical. In an amber glass tube, an aliquot (50 µL) of EO or the extracts at different concentrations (0.000, 0.025, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, and 0.500 M) was added with (1.95 mL) DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) methanolic solution (9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> M). The mixture was stored in a dark environment at room temperature until the reaction was stable (1 h approximately). The absorbance was determined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 517 nm (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 25, Waltham, MA, USA). The results were expressed as IC50 (mg/mL DPPH) values.
