<p class="p">The iron reduction assay was determined according to the technique previously reported [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. For the extracts, ethanol was used as solvent. The EO or ethanolic extract (1 mL) was mixed with (2.5 mL) phosphate buffer and (2.5 mL) a solution of K
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>[Fe(CN)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>] (1%) in an amber glass tube. The mixture was incubated in a water bath at 50 °C for 30 min, then (2.5 mL) trichloroacetic acid (J.T. Baker, Mexico City, Mexico) was added to it before it was centrifuged (International Equipment, 4279M-6, Nashville, TN, USA) for 20 min at 1800 rpm. An aliquot (2.5 mL) of the supernatant was taken and mixed with (2.5 mL) distilled water and (0.5 mL) FeCl3. The absorbance was determined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 700 nm (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 25, Waltham, MA, USA). Ascorbic acid (J.T. Baker, Mexico City, Mexico) was used as the standard (slope = 8.66 mL/mg AAE; intercept = 0.017 abs; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.991). The results were expressed as mg equivalent of ascorbic acid (AAE) per g of dry weight. For the EO and extracts, an initial concentration of 10 mg/mL diluted in alcohol was used.
