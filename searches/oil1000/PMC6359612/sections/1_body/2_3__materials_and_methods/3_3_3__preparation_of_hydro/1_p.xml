<p class="p">Hydrosol (HS) was considered as the water retained in the distillation flask at the end of the oregano hydrodistillation process. The residual water was filtered (Whatman grade 4) two times and kept in the dark at 4 °C in liquid form for further analysis. Oregano bagasse was considered as the waste solid residues left after the distillation for EO preparation. The bagasse was used to obtain both ethanol extract (EOH) and ethyl acetate extract (EAc) by maceration, according to the methodology proposed in 2003 [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The waste solid residues (free of EO) were filtered from the hydrosol and dried at room temperature for 24–48 h. The dried bagasse (18 g) was placed in an amber flask, 160 mL of either ethanol or ethyl acetate (J.T. Baker, Mexico City, Mexico) was added, and the flask was hermetically closed. The flask was left undisturbed for 24 h in a dry, dark place, and was further filtered (Whatman grade 4) and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (total dryness) for its analysis. The WSR extracts, EOH and EAc, showed a green coloration due to high chlorophyll content (yield of 16.93 and 35.98 mg/g of oregano WSR, respectively).
