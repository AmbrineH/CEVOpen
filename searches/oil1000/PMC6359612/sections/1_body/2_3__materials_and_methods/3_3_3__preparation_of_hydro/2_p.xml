<p class="p">The ethanol and ethyl acetate bagasse extracts were further separated by liquid–liquid extraction. To an aliquot of 50 mL of the ethanol or ethyl acetate extract, without concentration, a formic acid solution (1% 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) was added to achieve a final pH value of 2. The mixture was placed in a separation funnel and chloroform was added for the liquid–liquid extraction procedure. The formic acid-soluble fraction was the polar phase and was transparent, i.e., chlorophyll-free; the organic non-polar phase chloroform-soluble contained an elevated concentration of chlorophyll and was green. The subfractions were identified as a polar subfraction of ethanol extract (PSOH), a polar subfraction of ethyl acetate extract (PSAc), a non-polar subfraction of ethanol extract (NPSOH) and a non-polar subfraction of ethyl acetate extract (NPSAc). The yields of the ethanolic subfractions, PSOH and NPSOH, were 19.91 and 25.13 mg/g of extract respectively, and the yield of the ethyl acetate subfractions was 12.76 mg/g of PSAc and 40.5 mg/g of NPSAc. The polar and non-polar extracts were concentrated until total dryness.
