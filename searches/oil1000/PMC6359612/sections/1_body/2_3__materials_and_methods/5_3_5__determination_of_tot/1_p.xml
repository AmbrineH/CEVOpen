In an amber glass, (2.23 mL) distilled water was mixed with (150 µL) Folin–Ciocalteau reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and (20 µL) the EO or extract. The mixture was left to stand for 10 min at room temperature. Afterwards, (600 µL) the Na

The TPs were determined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 25, Waltham, MA, USA) at 760 nm. The TPs were calculated as mg equivalent of gallic acid (GAE) per g of EO or g of dry weight in extracts, using a standard curve (slope = 0.0211 mL/mg GAE; intercept = 0.0155 abs; R
