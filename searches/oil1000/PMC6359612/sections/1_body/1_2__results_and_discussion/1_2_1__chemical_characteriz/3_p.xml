<p class="p">After EO extraction, the hydrosol or floral water was obtained (water remaining in the steam distillation equipment after EO extraction), and dried bagasse was also used for the preparation of ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts, as identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00022-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. GC–MS analysis of the ethanol (EOH) and ethyl acetate (EAc) extracts was not possible due to interference in the samples, but in subfractions, six volatile components were characterized (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00022-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Thymoquinone, thymol, carvacrol, thymol acetate, and carvacrol acetate were not identified in the WSR ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts by GC–MS analysis since their concentration was too low to be detected or it was not possible to separate them from noise. However, the compounds were concentrated in the subfractions, and it was possible to determine their relative abundance in the non-polar fractions.
