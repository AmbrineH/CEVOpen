<p class="p">In the polar subfraction of the ethyl acetate extract (PSAc) and the polar subfraction of the ethanol extract (PSOH), methylmaleic anhydride was detected; meanwhile, in the non-polar subfraction of the ethanol extract (NPSOH) and the non-polar subfraction of the ethyl acetate extract (NPSAc), thymoquinone, thymol, carvacrol, thymol acetate, and carvacrol acetate were detected. These last four compounds were also identified in the EO. A similar result was reported by Milos, which informed that thymoquinone, thymol, and carvacrol were determined in
