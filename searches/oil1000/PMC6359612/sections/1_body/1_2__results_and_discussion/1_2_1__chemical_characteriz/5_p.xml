<p class="p">Caffeic and rosmarinic acids (non-volatile compounds) were determined in extracts by HPLC. All extracts obtained from waste solid residues of oregano after EO extraction presented rosmarinic acid (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00022-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); however, caffeic acid was found only in residual water and polar subfractions. Regarding extracts from waste solid residues from the extraction process in 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic>, it was not possible to detect caffeic acid, but it was detected in the polar subfractions of the WSR solvent extracts. The concentration achieved during subfraction preparation led to the detection of caffeic acid in these samples, while only trace amounts that were undetected by the analytical method may have been present in the extracts. This information is consistent with results described by various authors who determined that the main phenolic acid of the Lamiaceae family is rosmarinic acid [
