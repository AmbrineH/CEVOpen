<p class="p">The analysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> EO chromatogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00022-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) shows 31 different chemical compounds. Qualitative analysis showed that thymol, carvacrol, terpinolene, and carvacrol methyl ether are the major compounds of EO (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00022-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In 2009 [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], a total of 11 chemical compounds were reported in 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> EO; all of them were also found in this study. Another report includes the concentration of the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> (cultivated in 2010) and four compounds that were not reported before [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In a previous report, a difference in chemical composition was reported, with 36 and 31 chemical compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> EO harvested in different years (2005 and 2006, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. A similar result was observed in 2016 for the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> subs glandulosum, where the chemical composition depended on the harvest year, with 38, 33 and 28 compounds in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Quantitative characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> EO shows a higher concentration of thymol (1.97 ± 0.05 mg/mL) than carvacrol (0.89 ± 0.10 mg/mL). The results are comparable to those obtained by other reports, showing that thymol is the greatest compound in oregano Labiatae EO [
