<p class="p">The quantification of total phenolic compounds in the hydrosol and WSR extracts from the hydrodistillation of 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> has not been reported before. 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00022-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the total phenol (TP) quantification and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> Mexican EO oil and its by-products. As expected, the higher content of TPs was obtained in EO, followed by EOH and EAc. The results obtained in this study for EO (27.85 mg equivalent of gallic acid/g (GAE/g)) were higher than those reported in 2013 for

 <xref rid="B31-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. On the other hand, higher concentrations of phenolic compounds (35.40â€“55.40 mg GAE/g) have been reported in the clonal and commercial oregano ethanolic extracts, respectively [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. As observed, the TPs obtained in each extract were significantly affected (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) by the solvent used; in this aspect, EOH showed the highest TPs, while EAc presented the lowest concentration of TPs.
