<p class="p">The determination of 50% inhibition (IC50) in 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity is usually done to compare the antioxidant capacity of different antioxidant compounds. Similar to the TPs and ferric ion reducing test, the EO showed the highest antioxidant capacity (83.70 ± 4.12 μg/mL DPPH). In this regard, the values obtained in this study are lower (higher antioxidant activity) than those reported in 2004 and 2010 for the EO of

 <xref rid="B28-plants-08-00022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], respectively. This variation may be attributed to the difference in the chemical composition of oregano. Moreover, the aqueous and bagasse extracts still had antioxidant capacity due to the rosmarinic and caffeic acid (structure 4 hydroxyl and 2 hydroxyls groups, respectively) and trace compounds of EO. Although the aqueous extract and bagasse are considered residues, in
