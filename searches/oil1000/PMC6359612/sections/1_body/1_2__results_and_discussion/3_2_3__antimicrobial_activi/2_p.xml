<p class="p">Hydrosol had a mild antimicrobial activity and was more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Although the volume needed for antimicrobial activity against most of the tested microorganisms can be considered high (3000 mg/L or higher), the hydrosol was not concentrated, and the bioactive compounds present can, therefore, be found in low concentrations. Regarding the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were high as compared with the EO, but antimicrobial activity can still be considered important for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic>.
