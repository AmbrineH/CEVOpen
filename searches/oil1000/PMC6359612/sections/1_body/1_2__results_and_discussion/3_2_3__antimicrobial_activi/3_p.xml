<p class="p">The non-polar subfractions contained a small number of volatile components and a high chlorophyll concentration, and the green color of the solution interfered with MIC determination; therefore, only the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) are reported (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00022-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). From the subfractions, the PSAc had MIC values of 500â€“750 mg/L, while the NPSAc had a bactericidal activity of 750 mg/L against S. aureus, and 1000 mg/L for all the other strains tested. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> was the most sensitive bacteria, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Based on the data of MBC, the hydrosol, the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extract as well as the subfractions from the ethanolic extract, did not present bactericidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Typhimurium at the tested concentration. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts and subfractions can also be attributed to phenolic acids present in the samples, but not determined in this research.
