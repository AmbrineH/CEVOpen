<p class="p">The chemical characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> Mexican oregano essential oil has shown thymol and carvacrol as the major components, along with other volatile compounds to sum a total of 31 identified components. The partial chemical characterization of the hydrosol, as well as the solvent extracts and subfractions obtained from waste solid residues, demonstrated the presence of caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, methylmaleic anhydride, thymoquinone thymol, carvacrol, thymol acetate, and carvacrol acetate; these last four compounds were also identified in the EO. 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> EO and the extracts presented an antioxidant capacity and a mild antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the hydrosol and the waste solid residue or bagasse left after EO extraction can be further used as a source of bioactive molecules.
