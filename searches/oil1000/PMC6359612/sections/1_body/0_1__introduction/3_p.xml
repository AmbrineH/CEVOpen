<p class="p">During the extraction of EOs from plants and spices, a large number of by-products is produced, which are discarded although they can still contain a large number of bioactive compounds. As an example, the bioactive compounds from waste solid residues (WSRs) from 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> sp. after EO extraction were obtained by solvent extraction aided with ultrasound [
