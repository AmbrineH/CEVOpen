<p class="p">Globally, the use of antioxidants as preservatives has been instrumental in improving the quality and extending the shelf life of muscle foods, especially during processing and storage [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. This is because meat and meat products are easily susceptible to oxidation and microbial contamination due to their chemical composition and rapid depletion of endogenous antioxidants postmortem [

Reports have shown that live muscle contains relative amount of endogenous antioxidants, including alpha-tocopherol, histidine-containing dipeptides, ubiquinone, glutathione, carnosine, and anserine, which are capable of scavenging free radicals and disrupting oxidative process

However, after slaughtering, this muscle tissue begins to lose its antioxidative potential due to various postslaughter conditions such as anaerobic environment, presence of free radicals (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species), and lack of enzymatic mechanisms [
