The rate at which the endogenous antioxidants decrease during postmortem may depend on animal species, breed (including heme pigments), nutrition, muscle part, antemortem stress, and physiological functions [

Recently, the application of synthetic antioxidant in food/meat products has been implicated in causing negative health effect on consumers [
