<p class="p">Organic essential oil from sweet basil leaf, extracted by hydrodistillation, was obtained (Faithful to Nature, South Africa). The phytoconstituents of the oil were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS analysis of essential oils was quantitatively performed using an Agilent 7890B GC system coupled with an Agilent 5977A, Chemetrix (pty) Ltd.; Agilent Technologies, DE (Germany) with a Zebron-5MS column (ZB-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m) (5%-phenylmethylpolysiloxane). GC-grade helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 2mL/min and splitless was also used at 1ml injection. The injector, source, and oven temperature were set at 280°C, 280°C and 70°C, respectively. The ramp setting was initially programmed at 15°C/min to 120°C, then 10°C/min to 180°C, and then 20°C/min to 270°C and held for 3 min. The identification of the chemical constituents of the essential oil was determined by their GC retention time, percentage composition (area %), and retention indices. The Kovat indices were calculated according to a set of standard hydrocarbons (C9-C20) [

Likewise, the retention indices were calculated in line with a homologous series of n-alkanes (C8–C32) under similar operating conditions by using a standard equation. Further identification of the components was made based on computer matching of the mass spectra with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database (NIST/EPA/NIH) mass spectral library 2014) with those of published data [
