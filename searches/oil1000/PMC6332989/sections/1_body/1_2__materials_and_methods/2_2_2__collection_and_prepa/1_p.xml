<p class="p">Fresh beef samples (
 <italic class="italic">longissimus thoracis et lumborum</italic> muscle) were obtained from Boran and Nguni cattle reared on a natural grazing pasture and slaughtered at the age of 18 months with an average live weight of 380 and 260 kg, respectively, in high throughput commercial abattoir (East London, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa). The meat samples from each breed were cut into small cubes after removal of visible fat and connective tissues and minced in a sterile meat grinder. A portion (500 g) from the ground meat was randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) C (control, meat without additives); (2) SB2 (meat with 2% sweet basil essential oil); (3) SB4 (meat with 4% sweet basil essential oil); and (4) SB6 (meat with 6% sweet basil essential oil); with four replicates per treatment. Immediately after adding the essential oil, the ground meat samples were aerobically packed in polyethylene bags (O2 permeability = 6000–8000 cm3/(24 h × m2 × atm), water vapour transmission = 83 g/ (24 h × m2) and 50% relative humidity), stored at 4 ± 1°C, and analyzed on 0, 2, 4, and 7 days of storage for colour and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS).
