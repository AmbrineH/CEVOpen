<p class="p">A total of 32 bioactive compounds were identified in SBEO, with reported preservative functions including antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, as well as anti-inflammatory, nematicidal, and anticancer compounds. The addition of 2% and 4% SBEO improved colour stability of minced beef during 7 days of refrigerated storage compared to the control. The TBARS were significantly lower in SB2 and SB4 on days 0 and 4, while SB6 was similar to or higher than C. The results indicate the potential of SBEO at 2 and 4% as a natural antioxidant additive to improve colour and lipid oxidative stability during refrigerated storage of aerobically packaged minced beef, and further studies investigating its antimicrobial activity are recommended.</p>
