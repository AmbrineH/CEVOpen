<p class="p">The results of the oxidative changes (TBARS) of samples treated with basil essential oil aregiven in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The findings show that adding sweet basil essential oil can protect ground beef against lipid oxidation. In comparison to control group, meat samples containing sweet basil EO at 2 and 4% had lower the TBARS values from day 0 to 4. The inhibitory effects of the sweet basil essential oil against the TBAS formation could be attributed to the inherent phenolic content, phytoconstituents and antioxidant activity. Many studies have reported a positive correlation between phytochemical content or antioxidant activity of plant essential oil and reduction in lipid oxidation in meat products [
