<p class="p">The chemical composition of the sweet basil essential oils is presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The GC-MS analysis of the oil indicated a total of thirty-two (32) individual compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), along with their retention indices, retention time, and percentage of composition. Our result demonstrated that the main constituents in the essential oil were Estragole (41.40%), 1,6-Octadien-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl (29.49%), trans-.alpha.-Bergamotene (5.32%), Eucalyptol (3.51), Citral (3.31%), N-Cyano-3-methylbut-2-enamine (3.08%), cis-.alpha.-Bisabolene (1.92%), Levomenthol (1.81%), and beta.-Myrcene (1.11%). Other important constituents identified in the oil with evidence of biological activities as antioxidant and antimicrobial were alpha.-Pinene (0.13%), cis-Linaloloxide (0.75%), Eugenol (0.40%), Copaene (0.38%), Humulene (0.59%), and Nerolidol (0.08%) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The amount of compounds detected from this study equalled those reported by ZÅ‚otek et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], Al Abbasy et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and Okoye et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] but were slightly lower than those reported by Widyawati et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and Tsasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This variation could be attributed to physiological status, climate change, geographic location, harvesting time, mode, and method of extraction [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The presence of essential oils and their composition determines the specific aroma and colour of plant and also an array of flavors when consumed [
