<p class="p">The result of the a-value of the beef samples in this study are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, with the value progressively decreasing across the days of storage within the treatments. This is in agreement with other studies who have reported remarkable decrease in redness intensity of meat samples (beef, mutton, and chicken) treated with essential oil during cold storage period [

At day 0, meat sample treated with 6% sweet basil EO had the highest redness values (19.18), followed by sample containing 4% (18.71) and 2 (18.45) sweet basil EO and least in control (17.89). Similar trend was also observed in day 4, with meat sample treated with sweet basil EO showing intense red colour (12.77), higher than the control group (11.44) and other treatments. Ãœnal et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] in their study also found higher a-value in fresh minced beef treated with essential oil compared to control. However, at the 7, meat sample treated with 2% basil EO had the highest redness (11.30), followed by the control group and least in sample treated with 4 and 6% basil EO. This reduction in redness colour intensity of beef samples treated with 4 and 6% sweet basil EO at day 7 compared to control could be due to self-oxidation of basil EO to now act as prooxidants to increase pigment oxidation. Reports have revealed that, at high concentration, essential oil can behave as prooxidant, damaging cellular biomolecules [
