<p id="Par30" class="p">For the quantitative analysis of α-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cimene and mircene, at 40 °C, three stock solutions O were prepared using 10 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions O were further used to prepare diluted working solutions P. In particular, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 mL of each stock solution O, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions P were 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008 and 0.01 mg/mL respectively. For the quantitative analysis of α-pinene, α-phellandrene and octylacetate, at 40 °C, two stock solutions Q were prepared using 10 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions Q were further used to prepare diluted working solutions R. In particular, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 mL of each stock solution Q, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions R were 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.035 mg/mL respectively. For the quantitative analysis of limonene, β-pinene, linalyl acetate, γ-terpinene and linalool at 40 °C, five stock solutions S were prepared using 100 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions S were further used to prepare diluted working solutions T. In particular, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 mL of each stock solution S, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions T were 0.07, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35 mg/mL respectively.
