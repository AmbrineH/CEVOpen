<p id="Par24" class="p">Thus, based on the study of these essential oils, the multivariate analysis (PCA and HCA) has suggested the existence of three chemical types among the twelve specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">P. guineense</italic> collected in different locations of the Brazilian Amazon. It would then be the chemical types α-pinene/limonene (Group I), β-bisabolene/
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-bisabolol (Group II) and β-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide (Group III). Taking into account that two essential oils with a predominance of α-pinene/limonene and β-bisabolene/
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-bisabolol, respectively, were previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], it is understood that adding these two chemical types to that one rich in β-caryophyllene + caryophyllene oxide, which was a product of this study, besides the other chemical type with a high value of spathulenol, before reported by Nascimento and colleagues (2018) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], will be now, at least, four chemical types known for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. guineense</italic> essential oils.
