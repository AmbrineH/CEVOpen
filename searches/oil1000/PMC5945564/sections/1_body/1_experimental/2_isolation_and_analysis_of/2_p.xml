<p id="Par15" class="p">The oils were analyzed on a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra system (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an AOC-20i auto-injector and the GCMS-Solution software containing the NIST (Nist, 2011) and FFNSC 2 (Mondello, 2011) libraries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. A Rxi-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness) silica capillary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used. The conditions of analysis were: injector temperature of 250 °C; Oven temperature programming of 60-240 °C (3 °C/min); Helium as carrier gas, adjusted to a linear velocity of 36.5 cm/s (1.0 mL/min); split mode injection for 1 μL of sample (oil 5 μL : hexane 500 μL); split ratio 1:20; ionization by electronic impact at 70 eV; ionization source and transfer line temperatures of 200 and 250 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were obtained by automatic scanning every 0.3 s, with mass fragments in the range of 35-400 m/z. The retention index was calculated for all volatile components using a homologous series of C8-C20 n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), according to the linear equation of Van den Dool and Kratz (1963) [

The quantitative data regarding the volatile constituents were obtained by peak-area normalization using a GC 6890 Plus Series, coupled to FID Detector, operated under similar conditions of the GC-MS system. The components of oils were identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra (molecular mass and fragmentation pattern) with data stored in the GCMS-Solution system libraries, including the Adams library (2007) [
