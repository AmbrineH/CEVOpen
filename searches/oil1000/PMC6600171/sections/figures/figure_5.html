 <p> Cytotoxicity of frankincense extracts against the triple negative metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. ( a) Cancer cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were treated for 72 h with B. sacra extract (sample # 1) and cell viability was analyzed by XTT assay (mean ± SEM, n = 3). The extract inhibits selectively the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells, PBMC are relatively resistant to the extract. ( b) Significant correlation between total concentration of PTA in the frankincense extracts ( w/ w) and the cytotoxicity towards breast cancer cells (Spearman’s rank test, p = 0.003). ( c) Comparison of cancer cell toxicity of various Boswellia extracts. Groups were compared by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variances and Mann-Whitney U test, data are mean ± SD, * p &lt; 0.05. </p>
