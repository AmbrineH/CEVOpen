 <p> Methanolic extraction of Boswellia oleogum resins. ( a) Average extraction efficacy obtained from sample # 1 ( B. sacra), sample # 18 ( B. serrata), and sample # 29 ( B. carterii) with increasing extraction cycles. ( b) Total amount of pentacyclic triterpenic acids (PTA) extracted from oleogum resins in µg/mg frankincense. Comparison of extraction efficacies of combined extraction cycles 1 –3 and 4–6. ( c) Comparison of the extraction yields ( w/ w) of different Boswellia species. Data are mean ± SD. Groups were compared by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and the Mann-Whitney U test (* p &lt; 0.05). </p>
