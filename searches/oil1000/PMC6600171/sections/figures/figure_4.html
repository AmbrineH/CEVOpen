 <p> Multivariate statistical analysis of pentacyclic triterpenic acid (PTA) concentrations in Boswellia oleogum resins. Samples # 1–11 ( B. sacra, red), samples # 12–14 ( B. dalzielli, violet), samples # 15–17 ( B. papyrifera, pink), samples # 18–24 ( B. serrata, blue), samples # 25–29 ( B. carterii, green), samples # 30–36 ( B. neglecta, yellow), sample # 37 ( B. rivae, grey), and samples # 38–40 ( B. frereana, grey). For further sample information refer to Table 2. ( a) Dendrogram of cluster analysis. The samples were assigned to four different clusters: cluster A (red), cluster B (blue), cluster C (grey), and cluster D (yellow). ( b) Biplot of principal component analysis (PCA) with clusters from cluster analysis and subgroup (violet) for B. dalzielli. Sample B.o. (ʹXʹ B.o., B. occulta) was added subsequently. </p>
