<p class="p">To obtain essential oil, 100 g 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> oleogum resin (sample # 1) was freshly ground, added to 250 mL water, and mixed for several min until a thick homogenous dispersion was formed. To perform hydrodistillation, the mixture was heated for 7 h in an oil bath at 120 Â°C with continuous stirring. Afterwards, the obtained essential oil (9.7 g) was carefully separated from the aqueous phase in a separating funnel. After hydrodistillation, the residue was extracted with methanol as described earlier.
