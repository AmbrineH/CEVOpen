<p class="p">The chromatographic separation was performed using an analytical reversed-phase HPLC column (Dr. Maisch ReproSil-Pur Basic-C18 HD, 3 μm, 125 × 3 mm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbruch, Germany) with a precolumn (Dr. Maisch ReproSil Universal RP, 5 μm, 10 × 4 mm). The flow rate was set to 600 μL/min and the injection volume was 20 μL. The mobile phase consisted of eluent A, methanol/water (80/20,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) acidified with 0.2% acetic acid, and eluent B, methanol acidified with 0.2% acetic acid. Initial conditions were 60% eluent A and 40% eluent B followed by a linear gradient to 90% eluent B over 15 min, then 90% eluent B until 25 min. Thereafter, followed a linear gradient to initial conditions until 25.5 min and reequilibration continued until 30 min. In order to stabilize the chromatographic system, the column was kept at a temperature of 28 °C.
