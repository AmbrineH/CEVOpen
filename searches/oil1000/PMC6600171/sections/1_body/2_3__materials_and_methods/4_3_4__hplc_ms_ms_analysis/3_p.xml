<p class="p">MS/MS analysis was performed in the negative atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization mode and the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) detection mode. The ion source was heated to 300 °C and the ion spray voltage was set to −4250 V. Collision energy was optimized to −40 V. The dwell time for the MRM was 500 ms. The precursor ion at

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 497.2 and 59.0 for α-ABA, β-ABA and ALA and the ions

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 471.4 and 423.0 for MA. Quantifications of the analyte concentrations of α-ABA, β-ABA, α-BA, β-BA, AKBA, KBA, ALA, and LA, were done using the external calibration method and maslinic acid (MA) as internal standard. Extract samples were dissolved in methanol and spiked with internal standard for sample preparation. To determine the analyte concentrations in oleogum resins, the results of the extract analysis were corrected by extraction yields. The internal standard was used to compensate possible equipment conditioned variabilities. Furthermore, the internal standard enables further applications, such as analysis of clinical matrices (e.g., human plasma). Absence of maslinic acid in frankincense was evaluated by analysis of samples of all investigated
