<p class="p">The HPLC-MS/MS method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). To obtain the linearity and to determine LOD and LOQ, standard solutions in the range from 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL (8 levels) were analyzed, each in triplicates. The regression, LOD and LOQ were calculated with Valoo software (Applica, Bremen, Germany) based on the standardization criteria of DIN 32645 as defined by the German standardization committee [

Hence, three samples were spiked at three levels and analyzed, each in triplicates. Precision was determined by analysis of reference standards at three levels with six replicates on four different days yielding the intraday variations and the interday variations. The results of the validation are shown in
