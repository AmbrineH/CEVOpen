<p class="p">All solvents and chemicals were of analytical reagent grade. The solvents used for the extraction and for HPLC-MS/MS analysis were methanol, acetic acid (both HiPerSolv Chromanorm, VWR chemicals, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), and ultrapure water (reverse-osmosis type water (pureAqua, Schnaitsee, Germany) coupled to a Milli-Q station (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany)). The reference substances, acetyl-α-boswellic acid (α-ABA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA), α-boswellic acid (α-BA), β-boswellic acid (β-BA), acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), and maslinic acid (MA) were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France). Acetyl-lupeolic acid (ALA) and lupeolic acid (LA) were isolated and characterized as previously published [
