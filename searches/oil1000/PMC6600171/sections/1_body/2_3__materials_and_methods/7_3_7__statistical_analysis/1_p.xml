<p class="p">Each experiment was repeated three times and the data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM) as indicated. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 18 software (Minitab, Munich, Germany). All data were tested for normal distribution by the Anderson-Darling test and equality of variances by Levene’s test. Sample groups were compared by one-way ANOVA and the Student´s t-test for parametric data and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Due to the small sample size, the sample of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. rivae</italic> was excluded from comparison of groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1). Correlations for non-parametric data were investigated by Spearman´s rank correlation. Cluster analysis was performed with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, Ward´s method, and squared Euclidean distances. Principal component analysis (PCA) was derived from a covariance matrix of the data.
