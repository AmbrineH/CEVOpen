<p class="p">A highly sensitive, selective, and accurate method for the determination of eight pentacyclic triterpenic acids in oleogum resins of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> by HPLC-MS/MS has been developed and validated. Forty-one different frankincense samples of nine different 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species were extracted and analyzed. Hence, patterns in the composition of the pentacyclic triterpenic acids were discovered assisting discrimination among different 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species and geographic growth locality. Moreover, this study provides evidence for the cytotoxic efficacy of frankincense extracts towards treatment-resistant human breast cancer cells in vitro. The cytotoxic activity correlates significantly with the pentacyclic triterpenic acid contents in the extracts. Enrichment of the acidic component fraction containing pentacyclic triterpenic acids increased the extractâ€™s cytotoxicity. Thus, acid fractions of the 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resin extracts deserve further studies aiming at the development of new anticancer drugs.
