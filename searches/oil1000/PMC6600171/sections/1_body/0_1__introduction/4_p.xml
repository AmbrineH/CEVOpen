<p class="p">To further study the pharmacotherapeutic potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resin extracts, we have developed and validated a HPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous, selective, and highly sensitive detection of eight different PTA, boswellic and lupeolic acids. We have characterized the PTA contents in frankincense extracts from nine different 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species grown in different localities of the Arabian Peninsula, in Africa, and India. The contents of individual PTA were quantified, evaluated by multivariate statistical methods, and correlated to the extractâ€™s toxicity towards highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). The aim of the study was to discover patterns in the PTA composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins of different species and to explore correlations between individual PTA contents and cytotoxic efficacies against cancer cells.
