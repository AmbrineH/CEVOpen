<p class="p">Frankincense trees grow mainly in dry areas of East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and in India. The trees have a shrubby appearance and a height of usually 2 â€“6 m, with just a few of them reaching up to 10 m [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The main representative species are Boswellia sacra Flueck (Oman), Boswellia carterii Birdw. (Somalia), and Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. (India). The chemical composition of oleogum resins from these species has been extensively studied [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Likewise, the oleogum resin of Boswellia papyrifera Hochst., abundant in Ethiopia and Sudan, has been investigated regarding its chemical constituents [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Yet, there are also less known species like 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia dalzielli</italic> Hutch. that are more prevalent in West Africa, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia neglecta</italic> S. Moore, which is abundant, for example in Kenya, or the recently discovered 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic> Thulin, DeCarlo &amp; S. P. Johnson, distributed in a small area of northwestern Somalia [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. There are about twenty-five different 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species, but this number might include some double-counted species [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The geographical distribution of various 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species often overlap, necessitating correct plant identification. However, a proper botanical classification of plant material is often hardly possible, because of their growth taking place in less developed and geopolitically unstable countries, such as Yemen, Somalia, Ethiopia, or Sudan. Hence, less is known about chemical composition and potential therapeutic value of oleogum resin ingredients from 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species grown in these areas.
