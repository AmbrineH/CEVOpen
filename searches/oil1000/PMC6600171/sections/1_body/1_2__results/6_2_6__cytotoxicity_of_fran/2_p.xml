 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values and concentrations of the individual substances revealed the highest positive correlation between cytotoxicity and the content of acetylated PTA without keto groups. Thus, the β-ABA exhibited the highest Spearman’s correlation between cytotoxicity and its content in oleogum resin (
