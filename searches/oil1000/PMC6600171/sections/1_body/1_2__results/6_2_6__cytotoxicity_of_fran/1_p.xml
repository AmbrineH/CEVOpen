<p class="p">An extract from 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> oleogum resin inhibited concentration-dependently the viability of treatment-resistant MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers consisting primarily of lymphocytes and monocytes were much less sensitive to the extract providing evidence for selectivity against cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02153-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a). Hence, all forty 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resin extracts have been investigated for their toxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) were determined. The extracts exhibited considerable cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 cells with an average IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 9.7 µg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02153-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b). Moreover, extracts obtained from oleogum resins of 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> exhibited the highest toxicity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 8.2 µg/mL (Mann-Whitney U test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.015). Although extracts obtained from resins of 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic> showed significantly lower cytotoxicity compared to 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> (Mann-Whitney U test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013), 
 <italic class="italic">B. serrata</italic> (Mann-Whitney U test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023), 
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic> (Mann-Whitney U test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.037), and 
 <italic class="italic">B. neglecta</italic> (Mann-Whitney U test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023), their toxicity against cancer cells is considerable and should not to be neglected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02153-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b). This indicates that, besides the PTA that were investigated by us, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins must contain additional substances toxic for cancer cells, which merit further investigation.
