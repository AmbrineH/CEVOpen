<p class="p">In addition to PTA, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins contain further ingredients toxic to breast cancer cells. These might be neutral pentacyclic triterpenic substances like amyrin and lupeol, or mono- and bicyclic monoterpenes like limonene and α-pinene [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Particularly, 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic> contains high amounts of 3-epi-lupeol [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], which could explain its toxicity against the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in the absence of PTA. Also, other studies indicated that the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resin extracts can be higher than that of purified individual boswellic acids [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Therefore, oleogum resin of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> (sample # 1) was separated into different fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02153-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-02153" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). After extraction with methanol, the extract was separated by liquid-liquid-extraction yielding an acid fraction and a neutral fraction. In a different approach, the oleogum resin was hydrodistilled to obtain the essential oil. Afterwards, the residue was extracted with methanol yielding an extract after hydrodistillation. By enrichment of acidic components, the total PTA concentration increased from 27.5% to 67.9%. The enriched acid fraction exhibited a higher cytotoxicity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 6.0 µg/mL compared to the non-fractionated extract with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 7.9 µg/mL (Student´s t-test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.012). The neutral fraction with decreased PTA concentration and the essential oil that was void of detectable PTA, both exhibited considerably lower cytotoxicity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 19.4 µg/mL and an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 25.2 µg/mL for the neutral fraction and the essential oil, respectively. Although the PTA contents of the extract after hydrodistillation could be increased by removal of the essential oil, it showed lower cytotoxicity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 8.8 µg/mL compared to the non-fractionated extract. It is possible that high temperatures during hydrodistillation degrade natural emulsifiers. As a result, solubility of the nonpolar PTA and thereby the availability for the cells could be decreased. In line with that, the bioavailability of boswellic acids in vivo depended critically on the presence of bile acids and was therefore significantly increased by a concomitant high-fat meal [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Likewise, bioavailability of boswellic acids in a formulation with lecithin, a natural emulsifier, was greatly enhanced [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The possible synergetic effects of acidic components and components of the essential oil could not be disregarded either.
