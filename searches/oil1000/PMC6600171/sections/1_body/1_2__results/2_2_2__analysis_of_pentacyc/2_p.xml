<p class="p">To discover differences regarding the PTA composition in frankincense, we extracted oleogum resins from different 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species and different geographic growth locations (sample # 1–40) and analyzed the extracts using HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed some major differences between the samples. The total percentage of PTA varies from 0% (&lt;LOD/LOQ) in 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic> (samples # 38–40) and &gt;35% in 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> (sample # 5) and 
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic> (sample # 26) (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-02153" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). Further, the results of the HPLC-MS/MS analysis of the extracts were corrected by the extraction yield to obtain the PTA concentrations in the corresponding oleogum resins.
