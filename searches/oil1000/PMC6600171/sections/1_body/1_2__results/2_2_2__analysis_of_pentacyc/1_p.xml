<p class="p">For chemical characterization of the frankincense extracts, eight pentacyclic triterpenic acids (PTA), α-boswellic acid (α-BA), acetyl-α-boswellic acid (α-ABA), β-boswellic acid (β-BA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA), 11-keto- β-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), lupeolic acid (LA), and acetyl-lupeolic acid (ALA), were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Since PTA have very similar structures, they exhibit similar physical properties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02153-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, PTA are highly lipophilic. Furthermore, α-BA, β-BA, and LA, as well as ALA, α-ABA and β-ABA are constitutional isomers and, thus, have identical molecular masses. Our HPLC method, still, separates PTA selectively by a reversed-phase C18 column. To enable quantification of individual PTA even in complex biological matrices like oleogum extracts, we developed a selective and sensitive detection method (
