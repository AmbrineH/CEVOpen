<p class="p">To visualize the data and to explore patterns of the PTA composition, the multivariate statistical methods, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis were applied to the data set. The cluster analysis combined samples with high similarities in the PTA composition into groups, so-called clusters (

Furthermore, PCA combined the individual PTA concentrations to principal components by eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance matrix. The principle components PC1 (eigenvalue percentage of 50.2%) and PC2 (eigenvalue percentage of 34.5%) are the basis for a new coordinate system of a two-dimensional subspace (biplot), in which all frankincense samples (scores) as well as the impacts of the PTA concentrations (loadings) are illustrated (

In combination with these clusters, the biplot of the PCA gave us information about similarity as well as the composition of the frankincense samples and disclosed hidden patterns of the data set.
