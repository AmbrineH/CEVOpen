<p class="p">The results of the HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed a remarkable variety in different PTA contents in 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species obtained from different growth localities (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02153-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Oleogum resins of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> from Oman are characterized by a high proportion of the acetylated PTA, α-ABA, β-ABA AKBA, and ALA. In contrast, resins of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. serrata</italic> from India are characterized by a high proportion of the deacetylated PTA, α-BA, β-BA, KBA, and LA.
