<p class="p">Cluster A includes the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. dalzielli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. papyrifera</italic> and is characterized by a high proportion of acetylated PTA. Interestingly, sample # 29 (
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic>) is also included in this cluster due to similarity. For further distinction, PC3 that has an eigenvalue percentage of 11.5% and is mainly influenced by the AKBA concentrations was examined. Here, sample # 29 (
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic>) and samples # 12–14 (
 <italic class="italic">B. dalzielli</italic>), as well as sample # 15 (
 <italic class="italic">B. papyrifera</italic> from Ethiopia) clearly deviated from samples of 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>. Due to the very high concentrations of AKBA in oleogum resins of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dalzielli</italic>, these samples were assigned to a particular subgroup. Cluster B contains all B. serrata samples as well as sample # 25 (
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic>) and it is identified by a high proportion of deacetylated PTA. With respect to PC3, sample # 25 clearly differs from samples of 
 <italic class="italic">B. serrata</italic> by its very low concentrations of AKBA and KBA. Cluster C includes all samples with very low PTA concentrations, such as 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. rivae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. neglecta</italic> from Kenia and the Bakool region in the south of Somalia. Cluster D is characterized by a very high proportion of deacetylated PTA in coincidence with a very low proportion of PTA with keto groups, such as LA, α-BA, and β-BA. This cluster contains samples of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. neglecta</italic> from Somalia and 
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic> from Somalia. Sample # 26 (
 <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic>) could not be assigned to any cluster and differs from all other samples, especially due to its very high amounts of ALA and β-ABA.
