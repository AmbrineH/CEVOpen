<p class="p">For comparative analysis, forty samples of mainly commercially available 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins (samples # 1â€“40) were extracted for analysis of their PTA contents and cancer cell toxicities. The average extraction yield was 65.4% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>). Extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic> showed a significantly higher average yield of 88.8% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) compared to the overall average value, as well as compared to 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>,
