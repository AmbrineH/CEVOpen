 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. It ensures optimal solubility of the extracts and is, therefore, used in sample analysis. To investigate, how many extraction cycles are necessary for an exhaustive extraction, three samples were extracted up to six times, each in triplicates. The experiment showed that the first three extraction cycles have an extraction efficiency of 99.6% (
