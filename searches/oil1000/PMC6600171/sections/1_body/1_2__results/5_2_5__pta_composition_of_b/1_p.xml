<p class="p">The method developed here and their statistical evaluation was also used to analyze a recently discovered 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species, 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic>. This species is distributed in a small area in Somaliland in northwestern Somalia and was first described by Thulin et al. in 2019 [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The extract obtained from the oleogum resin of 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> had a white, crystalline form with an extraction yield of 66.3% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>). PTA analysis by HPLC-MS/MS exhibited concentrations of 2.667 µg KBA, 4.386 µg LA, 6.991 µg α-BA, 23.854 µg β-BA, 33.644 µg AKBA, 15.389 µg ALA, 16.466 µg α-ABA, and 30.198 µg β-ABA, each per milligram oleogum resin yielding a total PTA content of 13.4% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) in the 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> oleogum resin. Calculation exhibited a Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> of 23,059 for 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic>. Based on these results, the sample showed similarity to oleogum resins of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>, especially to samples of the type Black Hojari (sample # 2: Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> = 35,612 and sample # 6: Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> = 13,137). Moreover, the PTA composition and Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> of the sample resemble oleogum resins of the species 
 <italic class="italic">B. papyrifera</italic>, especially those from Ethiopia and Sudan (sample # 15: Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> = 34,172 and sample # 17: Bos
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> = 32,469). Furthermore, by using the component coefficients calculated from PCA, the score for 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> was determined and added subsequently to the biplot (

 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. papyrifera</italic> regarding their PTA composition. For a more specific differentiation between these three species, determination of their essential oil compositions should be considered [
