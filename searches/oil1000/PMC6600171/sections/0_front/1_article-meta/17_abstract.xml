 <p class="p">Pentacyclic triterpenic acids from oleogum resins of 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species are of considerable therapeutic interest. Yet, their pharmaceutical development is hampered by uncertainties regarding botanical identification and the complexity of triterpenic acid mixtures. Here, a highly sensitive, selective, and accurate method for the simultaneous quantification of eight boswellic and lupeolic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed. The method was applied to the comparative analysis of 41 oleogum resins of the species 
  <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. dalzielli</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. papyrifera</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. serrata</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. carterii</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. neglecta</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. rivae</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic>. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data revealed differences in the triterpenic acid composition that could be assigned to distinct 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> species and to their geographic growth location. Extracts of the oleogum resins exhibited cytotoxicity against the human, treatment-resistant, metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Extracts from 
  <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> were the most potent ones with an average IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 8.3 ± 0.6 µg/mL. The oleogum resin of the 
  <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic> was further fractionated to enrich different groups of substances. The cytotoxic efficacy against the cancer cells correlates positively with the contents of pentacyclic triterpenic acids in 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> extracts.
