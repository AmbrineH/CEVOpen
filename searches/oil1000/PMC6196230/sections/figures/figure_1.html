 <p> Variation in water temperature found in tanks (experiments 1–3) and ponds during various days of culture of L. minor. (A) Experiment 1. (B) Experiment 2 has been divided in four phases depending on temperature—Phase I (October–November 2016), Phase II (November–December 2016), Phase III (December 2016–January 2017), and Phase IV (January–February 2017). The water temperature ranged from 22.5 to 18.5, 17.7 to 14.5, 14.3 to 11.2, and 14.2 to 19.4°C in first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. (C) Experiment 3 and (D) in ponds. There was no significant difference in temperature among various treatments of each experiment. Therefore, data for individual day of all treatments are presented as Mean ± SE. Data were collected at 9.00 a.m. </p>
