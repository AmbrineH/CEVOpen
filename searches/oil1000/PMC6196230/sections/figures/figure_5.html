 <p> Nitrite levels (in parenthesis) of water found in various treatments of tank experiments of L. minor. (A) Experiment 1, (B) experiment 2 (Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV), and (C) experiment 3. In each treatment (three replicates), average values of 13, 49 (Phase I−12, Phase II and III−16 each, and Phase IV−5 days), and 14 days of sampling for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were calculated. Data were presented as Mean ± SE. Bars with different superscripts were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) different. Data were collected at 9.00 a.m. OM, organic manures; IF, inorganic fertilizers; 2x OM, double dose of organic manures. </p>
