 <p> Light intensity monitored during various days of culture of L. minor in tanks. (A) Experiment 1. (B) Experiment 2 has been divided in four phases depending on temperature—Phase I (October–November 2016), Phase II (November–December 2016), Phase III (December 2016–January 2017), and Phase IV (January–February 2017). (C) Experiment 3. There was no significant difference in light intensity among various treatments of each experiment. Therefore, data for individual day of all treatments were presented as Mean ± SE. Data were collected at 9.00 a.m. (Data for experiment 4 has not given.). </p>
