   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Experiment 1. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Experiment 2 has been divided in four phases depending on temperature—Phase I (October–November 2016), Phase II (November–December 2016), Phase III (December 2016–January 2017), and Phase IV (January–February 2017). 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Experiment 3. There was no significant difference in light intensity among various treatments of each experiment. Therefore, data for individual day of all treatments were presented as Mean ± SE. Data were collected at 9.00 a.m. (Data for experiment 4 has not given.).
