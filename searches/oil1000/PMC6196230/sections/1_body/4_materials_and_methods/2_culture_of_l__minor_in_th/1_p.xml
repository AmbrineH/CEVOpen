<p class="p">In CIFE, Rohtak Center (Indian Council of Agricultural Research), Haryana three cemented ponds (200 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 20 m Ã— 10 m) were prepared for the culture of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> in June 2017. The bottom was cleaned thoroughly and the pond was filled with ground water (50 cm). The OMs, like cattle manure, poultry dropping, and mustard oil cake (1:1:1) were applied at the rate of 1.052 Kg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (Srivastava et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Organic manures applied for the production of duckweed were selected based on the results of outdoor cemented tanks. Three replicates were used for the study. The culture conditions of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> developed in the tank experiments were also applied in the pond. All manures were mixed properly and allowed to decompose for 5 days. Then fresh 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> cultured in cemented tanks of Department of Zoology, University of Delhi was seeded (wet weight) at the rate of 1 Kg/pond. It covered a small area of the pond. The experiment was continued for 30 days. Like outdoor tank experiments, one fourth dose of initial dose of manure was applied at every 10 days interval. Harvesting started when the plant covered the whole surface area of the pond. Total pond area (200 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was divided in four quadrates of 50 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> each. In first and second harvests, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was collected from two quadrants for 50% harvesting (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" class="xref">11A,B</xref>). In third harvest, all plants were collected and air dried (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" class="xref">11C</xref>). Production was expressed as Kg/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/month on wet weight basis.
