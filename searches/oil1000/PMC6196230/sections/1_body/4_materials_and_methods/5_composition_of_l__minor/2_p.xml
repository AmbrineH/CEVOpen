<p class="p">Amino acid composition was estimated using Automatic Amino Acid Analyzer L-8900 (Hitachi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Dry and powdered plant sample was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at 110°C for 22 h. Hydrolyzed sample was dried in Nitrogen Evaporator (PCi Analytic Private Limited, Maharashtra, India). Then 0.02 N HCl was added in the sample and concentration of protein in the sample was 0.5 mg/ml. The sample was kept in the Auto sampler. Sample injection volume was 20 μl. Methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan are destroyed during hydrolysis with 6 N HCl; these amino acids are treated with specific reagents. Methionine and cysteine were oxidized with performic acid and then treated with 48% hydrobromic acid. Macrophyte sample was hydrolyzed with 4 N methanesulfonic acid and 3-(2-aminoethyl) indole for the estimation of tryptophan. Rest of the methods were same for all amino acids. The ninhydrin derivative of proline and hydroxyproline was monitored at 440 nm, and other amino acids were monitored at 570 nm. The contents of detected amino acids were quantified by comparing their peak areas with those of authentic standards provided with the equipment. Amino Acids Mixture Standard Solutions, Type B and Type AN-2 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Limited) were used. Standard solutions for glutamine and tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were prepared before analysis.</p>
