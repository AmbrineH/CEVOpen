<p class="p">For fatty acid composition, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> samples were dried at 40°C and ground. The total lipid fraction was then extracted from 1 g of dried material by homogenization in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) using a tissue disrupter (Ultra-Turrax, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK), and lipid content determined by weighing (Folch et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1957</xref>). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of total lipid were then prepared by acid-catalyzed transesterification for 16 h at 50°C (Christie, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). The FAME were extracted and purified as described in detail previously (Tocher and Harvie, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>), and then separated and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography (Fisons GC-8160, Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) using a 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm ZB-wax column (Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK), on-column injection and ionization detection. Identification of FAMEs was by comparison to known standards and published data (Tocher and Harvie, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>), and data collected and quantified using Chromcard for Windows (Thermoquest Italia S.p.A., Milan, Italy).
