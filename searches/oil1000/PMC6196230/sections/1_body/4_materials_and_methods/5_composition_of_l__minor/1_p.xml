<p class="p">Biochemical (proximate) compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> cultured in tanks (OM and IF) were determined by standard methods (AOAC, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Moisture contents were recorded after drying at 110°C for 24 h, and the ash fraction obtained after incineration at 600°C for 16 h. The crude protein content was determined by measuring nitrogen content (N × 6.25) by Kjeldahl analysis (Tecator Kjeltec 1030 analyser, Foss, Warrington, UK). The crude lipid content was measured gravimetrically after extraction by Soxhlet (Tecator Soxtec 2050, Warrington, UK). Carbohydrate content was then determined by the subtraction method.
