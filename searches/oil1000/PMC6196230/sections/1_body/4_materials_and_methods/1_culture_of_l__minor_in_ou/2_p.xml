<p class="p">The second experiment was conducted during October 2016–February 2017 and the duration of the experiment was 105 days. The three different manures used in this experiment were selected based on the results of the first experiment. The first two manures, manure 1 (OM) and manure 2 (IF) were similar to the earlier experiment, and manure 3 (OM+IF) was a combination of manure 1 and manure 2. Third experiment was conducted during February–April 2017. In this experiment, manure 1 (OM) and manure 2 (IF) were selected. This selection was based on the production potential of these manures compared to the others.</p>
