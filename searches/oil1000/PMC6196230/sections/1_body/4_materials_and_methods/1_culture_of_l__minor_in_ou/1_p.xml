 <italic class="italic">Lemna minor</italic> was collected from a pond located in the Department of Botany, University of Delhi and the plant was identified based on the morphological characteristics (oval shaped fronds, 2–5 fronds remained together, presence of three nerves in each frond and cylindrical root sheath with two lateral wings) with the help of scientist of Department of Botany. Since then the macrophyte was cultured in the Department of Zoology. Three consecutive experiments were conducted to generate the baseline data for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>. Macrophytes were grown in cemented tanks (1.2 × 0.35 m) maintained in the outdoor facility of Department of Zoology, University of Delhi. The depth of water was 30 cm throughout the study period. Dechlorinated tap water, supplied by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was used for all experiments. The first experiment was conducted during September–October 2016 and the duration of the experiment was 30 days. Four different manures were used. In manure 1 (OM) and manure 3 (OM 2x OM), cattle manure (local), poultry droppings (local), and mustard oil cake (Double Hiran Mustard Oil-cake, Malook Chand Food Pvt. Ltd., Aligarh, U.P., India) (1:1:1) were used at the rate of 1.052 and 2.104 Kg/m

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>); manure 4 (2x OM+IF) was a combination of manure 2 and manure 3. The amount of IFs was calculated for 10 days and applied in the culture tank. In all these experiments, OMs were applied at the rate of one fourth dose of initial dose at every 10 days interval. In IFs, similar dose (initial amount) of manures was applied at every 10 days interval. Manures for individual tank were mixed with tap water and allowed to decompose for 5 days before application. All manures, except cattle manure were applied in dry conditions. The moisture content of cattle manure was measured and the weight was adjusted.
