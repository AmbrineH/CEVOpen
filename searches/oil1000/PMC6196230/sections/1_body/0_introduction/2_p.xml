<p class="p">Protein plays a significant role in fish nutrition. Fish-meal is one of the commonly used protein-rich ingredients in the aqua-feed industry. Non-availability of quality fish meal and competition for the same resources with the terrestrial live-stock industry has made aquaculturists search for economically viable alternative protein sources. The alternative protein source (to fish meal) should be available in the required amount, cost-effective and preferably non-conventional to avoid competition with other uses and industries. The amino acid profile of the ingredient should meet the nutritional requirement of the cultivable species and prepared feed should be palatable and digestible to the fish. Digestibility test of duckweeds in carps and tilapia showed promising results (Hassan and Chakrabarti,
