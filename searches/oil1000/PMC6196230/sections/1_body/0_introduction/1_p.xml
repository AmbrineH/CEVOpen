<p class="p">The surface floating macrophyte duckweed 
 <italic class="italic">Lemna</italic> is the largest genus of the family Lemnaceae. They are abundant in the tropical and subtropical countries; growing profusely in still, nutrient-rich small ponds, ditches, and swamps or in slowly moving water bodies. The entire plant body consists of metabolically active non-structural tissue (Wolverton and McDonald, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>) and the low fiber content of the plant has a beneficial impact on digestibility when used in animal feed. Duckweed grows on water with relatively high levels of N, P, and K and concentrates the minerals and synthesizes protein. The reported presence of various essential (arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine) and non-essential amino acids (FAO, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), Î²-carotene, and xanthophylls has made 
 <italic class="italic">Lemna</italic> spp. a potential feed source for livestock (Skillicorn et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Leng et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). In Taiwan, duckweeds are used as food for pig and poultry (FAO, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). In fish feed, 
 <italic class="italic">Lemna</italic> spp. are usually used in fresh state. In recent years, there is a growing interest in this free floating macrophyte in the aqua-feed industry (for production of pelleted diets) to replace the protein-rich and costly fish-meal. Chakrabarti (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported the production potential of duckweeds in freshwater bodies. Duckweeds are also used for treatment of waste water (Culley and Epps,

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>,
