<p class="p">The present investigation aimed to develop a suitable culture technique for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> in a sustainable manner. In our earlier study, it was found that the application of organic manures (OM) viz. cattle manure, poultry wastes, and mustard oil-cake was very effective in the mass production of live food organisms (Srivastava et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Application of these manures helped in the large scale production of zooplankton in the outdoor facility (Chakrabarti and Sharma, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). These manures are easily available. Therefore, in the present study, these OMs were selected along with the other IFs to evaluate their effect on the production of duckweed. The culture technique was first standardized in a small outdoor facility under controlled conditions using various organic and IFs. The best method was then adopted in pond conditions to evaluate the large scale production potential of the macrophyte. The nutritional value of the produced plant was determined to evaluate its suitability as a potential feed ingredient for the aqua-feed industry.
