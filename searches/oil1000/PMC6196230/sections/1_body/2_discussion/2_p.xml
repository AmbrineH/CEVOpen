<p class="p">Porath et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1979</xref>) reported the RGR of fresh 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> cultured in both laboratory and field conditions. They obtained the highest value of 0.346 g/g/day in laboratory condition, whereas the value became 0.099 g/g/day in the field condition. The fresh yield of duckweed ranged from âˆ’0.026 to 0.66 Kg/m

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>) reported that the RGRs of duckweeds ranged from 0.10 to 0.35 g/g/day. RGR of 
 <italic class="italic">Lemma gibba</italic> grown in desert ponds ranged from 0.081 to 0.191 g/g/day (Guy et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). Rejmankova (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>) observed 0.20 and 0.22 g/g/day RGR of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. gibba</italic>, respectively, in field conditions. In the present study, RGR of duckweed was comparable with the earlier studies.
