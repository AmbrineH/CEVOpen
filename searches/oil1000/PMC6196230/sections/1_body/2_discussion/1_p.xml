<p class="p">In the present study, suitable manures and their dose for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was studied first in outdoor-tanks and then the best condition was adopted in ponds. The results of three consecutive studies in outdoor systems showed that duckweed production was influenced by the quality of manures and doses, and environmental factors. Both organic and IFs were used separately and in combinations for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>. In experiments 1 and 3, the average RGR of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was higher in OM compared to IF. The average RGR-values of duckweeds in OM were same in experiment 1 in outdoor tanks and in the pond experiment (0.21 g/g/day). In experiment 1 and 3, total macrophytes production (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6Aâ€“C</xref>) was significantly higher in OM compared to the other treatments; whereas in experiment 2, there was no significant difference in total production between OM and IF. The growth of duckweed was affected by low temperature in OM in the third phase (i.e., fifth, sixth, and seventh harvests) of experiment 2. Reduced growth of duckweed affected the total production. In contrast, in the culture system treated with IFs the growth was continued in the cold condition (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5B</xref>). Production of macrophytes in 2x OM and 2x OM+IF of experiment 1, and OM+IF of experiment 2 were negligible. For this reason these manures were not adopted for the production of macrophytes and less discussed in the present study. Higher doses of manures resulted in significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher levels of ammonia that affected the growth and production of macrophytes in these treatments. RGR was always higher at first harvest regardless of treatments. In experiment 1, RGR in OM during second harvest was lower compared to 2x OM and 2x OM+IF as this was the first harvest for these two latter treatments. There was no production in all treatments, except OM at the time of third harvesting. Therefore, in experiment 1, the RGR was lower in OM during fourth harvest compared to the other treatments. Similarly, in experiment 3, the first harvest of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> from IF, was the third harvest for OM. The poor growth rate of duckweed resulted in slow production and delayed harvest. Availability of space and nutrient might influence the RGR in the first harvest compared to the successive harvests. The OMs are rich sources of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>), and potash (K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) and are usually applied in agricultural land in India (Gaur et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). The amount of nutrients of OM varied with season and geographical location. The mixture of these three manures fulfills the requirements of the plant. The decomposition of these manures enhances their availability to the plant. In the present study, mixture of manures was decomposed for 5 days before application in the water bodies.
