<p class="p">The impact of various water quality parameters on the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was documented in the present study. Temperature is known to be the master abiotic factor. In an outdoor facility, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> were cultured under a wide range of temperature of 11.5–28.4°C during September 2016–April 2017. In the OM-based culture system, production was greatly reduced as the water temperature become &lt; 18.5°C from November onwards. An increasing trend in duckweed production was recorded from February onwards as temperature rose to 19.4°C. In pond the experiment, 31.5–30.3°C temperature was favorable for duckweed production. Temperature tolerance and optima are species-specific. Maximum growth for most of the species of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was obtained between 17.5 and 30°C (Culley et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1981</xref>; Gaigher and Short, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1986</xref>). The growth rate declined at low temperature. Reduced growth rate was found in some duckweed at the temperature below 17°C (Culley et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1981</xref>). Most species seemed to die at 35°C water temperature. All these studies showed that 17–18°C was the critical temperature and 27–31°C was optimum temperature for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>.
