<p class="p">Like protein, lipid, and ash contents of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> grown in OM were higher compared to the macrophytes grown in IF in the present study. Culley et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1981</xref>) reported 6.3% ether extracts in 
 <italic class="italic">L. gibba</italic> from USA. In different species of duckweeds fat contents ranged from 4 to 7% (Appenroth et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was higher (7.15–8.45%) in the present study, but slightly lower than the 10.6% reported by Yan et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The duckweeds produced in nutrient poor water bodies showed lower lipid content (1.8–2.5%) compared to the plant grown (3–7% lipid) in water enriched with nutrient (Hassan and Chakrabarti, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The lipid and ash contents of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> grown in natural pond were 5.0 ± 0.1 and 25.0 ± 1.6%, respectively (Kalita et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Ash contents of various species of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> ranged from 11.1 to 17.6% (Hassan and Edwards, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>; Zaher et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). The ash content of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> ranged from 19.42 to 21.41% in the present study. Duckweeds are known to accumulate large amounts of minerals in their tissues. Higher amount of ash and fiber and lower amount of protein were found in duckweed colonies with slow growth rate (Skillicorn et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). The ash content of duckweed was not influenced by the nutrient status of water (Leng et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). The fatty acid content of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> cultured in the present study was generally similar to that measured by Yan et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), who reported a composition of around 25% saturated fatty acids, 5% monoenes and 70% PUFA, with a very similar level of LA (16%) but a higher proportion of LNA at ~54% of total fatty acids. The trace level of EPA found in the present study most likely simply reflects the presence of a very small amount of freshwater microalgae, which can often contain some EPA but rarely DHA, in the 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> harvest. Negesse et al. (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) also reported the presence of short chain fatty acids (SCFA, 16.6%) in 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> (C2 11%, C3 3.1%, C4 1.4%, and C5 0.4%) that could be useful for commercial utilization of duckweed as they can serve as preservatives, preventing bacterial growth. In recent study, Appenroth et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that in different species of duckweeds, polyunsaturated fatty acids content ranged from 48 to 71%; the high level of n3 fatty acids resulted in a favorable n6/n3 ratio and enhanced the nutritional value of the duckweeds.
