<p class="p">Duckweeds have wide range of pH tolerance. The biomass of duckweeds doubled in 2–4 days at pH 7–8 (Culley et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1981</xref>). Khondker et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>) showed that pH 6.9–7.8 was suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">L. perpusilla</italic> production. The optimum growth of 
 <italic class="italic">L. perpusilla</italic> was found at pH 7.36 (Van der Does and Klink, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1991</xref>). In the present study, pH ranged from 7.32 to 8.04 in all outdoor and pond culture systems in OM and IF. Application of higher dose of OMs resulted in pH &lt; 7.0 in 2x OM and 2x OM+IF in experiment 1. The pH of water decreased after the application of OMs in all experiments and then increased with the duration of study.
