<p class="p">Presence of high quality protein was reported in various studies (Porath et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1979</xref>; Rusoff et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>). The essential amino acid profile of duckweed was better compared to the most of the plant proteins and more closely resembled to animal protein. Guha (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>) reported that the protein of duckweeds was rich in certain amino acids that were often low in plant proteins. The nutritional value of duckweeds is comparable with alfalfa in terms of two essential amino acidsâ€”lysine and arginine. These are required in animal feeds. High amount of leucine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine and less amount of methionine and tyrosine are found in duckweeds. The amino acid content of the

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>). Amino acids like, lysine (4.8%), methionine and cystine (2.7%), and phenylalanine and tyrosine (7.7%) were also present in the duckweeds (Appenroth et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In the present study, the amino acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> confirmed its nutritional value as feed ingredient as it is a rich source for essential and non-essential amino acids. The presence of non-proteinogenic amino acids viz. taurine, citrulline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine etc. enhanced the nutritional value of duckweed.
