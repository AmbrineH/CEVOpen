<p class="p">In the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>, a direct effect of dissolved oxygen was not recorded. In OM, dissolved oxygen level was generally &lt; 1.0 mg/l, whereas a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen was always recorded in IF. But the production was lower in IF compared to OM in most of the harvestings (except third phase of experiment 2). Application of OMs reduced the oxygen level in the culture system. Dissolved oxygen might influence the nitrification of ammonia as higher level of nitrite and nitrate levels were found in IF compared to OM.
