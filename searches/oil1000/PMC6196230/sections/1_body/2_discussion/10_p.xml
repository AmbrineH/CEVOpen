<p class="p">Many studies showed the proximate composition of several species of duckweeds from different geographical areas. Protein content ranged from 14.0 to 23.5, 25.3 to 29.3, 9.4 to 38.5, and 26.3 to 45.5% in

 <italic class="italic">Lemma paucicostata</italic> (Mbagwu and Adenji, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>), respectively. In the present study, 36.07 ± 0.18 and 27.12 ± 0.4% protein contents were found in 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> cultured in OMs and IFs. The nutritional status of the water body influenced the crude protein content of the duckweed; protein content ranged from 9 to 20% in nutrient-poor water or under sub-optimum nutrient conditions, whereas it ranged 24–41% in nutrient-rich water. The crude protein content of duckweed increased up to 40% at ammonia concentration of 7–12 mg N/l (Leng et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). The protein content of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> collected from a natural pond of northeast region of India was 28.0 ± 1.7 (Kalita et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Appenroth et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that in different species of duckweeds protein contents ranged from 20 to 35%.
