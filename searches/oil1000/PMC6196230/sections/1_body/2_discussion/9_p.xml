<p class="p">Phosphorus is one of the limiting nutrients (after nitrogen) and is essential for rapid growth of the macrophyte. In OM, phosphate level was most of the time &gt;1.0 mg/l, whereas phosphate level was &lt; 1.0 mg/l in IF. This showed the phosphate limitation of this treatment. In some species of duckweeds, decreased growth rate was obtained at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-values &lt; 0.017 mg/l (Lüönd, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">L. perpusilla</italic>, a positive correlation was recorded between the concentrations of phosphate and silicate and the biomass (Khondker et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>). Phosphorous (PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-P) should range between 4 and 8 mg/l for the optimum production of duckweeds (Hassan and Chakrabarti, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The present study showed that the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was dependent on nutrient availability in terms of nitrogen and phosphorous and environmental factors like temperature and light intensity of the culture system.
