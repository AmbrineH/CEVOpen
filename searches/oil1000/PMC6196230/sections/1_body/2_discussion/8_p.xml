 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>) also suggested that the ammonia concentrations of cultured water should be 7–12 mg N/l for the maintenance of crude protein content of duckweed. In the present study, higher level of ammonia (18.8–32.0 mg/l) also affected the production of duckweed in culture systems fertilized with OMs, especially during winter. In experiment 2, significantly (

 </inline-formula>) uptake is temperature-sensitive in duckweed. Nitrite and nitrate levels were lowest in OM. Higher levels of nitrite and nitrate in IF showed the better nitrification rate in this treatment compared to the OM. Duckweeds preferred ammonia as nitrogen source compared to nitrate and grew better in presence of the former nutrient (Lüönd,
