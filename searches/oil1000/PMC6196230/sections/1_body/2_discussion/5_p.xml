<p class="p">The intensity of light also played major role in the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>. In the experiment 2, as light intensity reduced, particularly in the second and third phases (718–2,138 lux), production reduced drastically; an increasing trend was recorded as light intensity increased (3,463–3,728 lux) in experiment 2. In the present study, maximum 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production was recorded at 7,353–10,878 lux light intensity. Mkandawire and Dudel (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) suggested 4,200–6,700 lux light intensity at 14–16 h photoperiod for the optimum production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. gibba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>.
