<p class="p">Hassan and Chakrabarti (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) reported that variations in climatic conditions, nutritional status of the water body and differences in species resulted in the differences in the production of the macrophytes. Most of the data were generated from short-term studies in small-scale experimental systems. The data generated from longer duration study in commercial-sized systems are most wanted. In the present study, 702.5 Kg (dry mass)/ha/month (i.e., 8.43 tons/ha/year) 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> were produced from pond with the application of OMs. In UASB effluent and nutrient non-limiting water, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production were 10.7 and 16.1 tons (dry mass)/ha/year (Reddy and DeBusk, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1985</xref>; Vroon and Weller, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). In septage-fed pond, the production of 
 <italic class="italic">Lemna perpusilla</italic> was 11.2 tons (dry mass)/ha/year (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). It was suggested that in an aquatic environment with sufficient nutrients and optimum environmental conditions around 10–20 tons (dry mass)/ha/year duckweeds can be harvested (Hassan and Chakrabarti, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Seeding of the plant also played important role in the production. DWRP (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>) recommended 40 Kg/100 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> in order to obtain a dense cover in 3 days. But getting this amount of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> from control culture system for seeding was difficult. Therefore, only 1 Kg (wet weight) of plant was seeded in the 200 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> pond in the present study. The growth rate of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was 3–6 folds higher at the time of first harvest compared to the second and third harvests. Optimum water quality parameters 
 <italic class="italic">viz</italic>. temperature, ammonia, phosphate levels etc. influenced the growth of the macrophyte. In the month of July, the presence of moisture in the air also influenced the macrophytes production (compared to the dry season). Moreover, there was enough space at the initial phase; due to the growth of the plants, there was competition for space and nutrients at the later phase.
