 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). In OM and OM+IF, highest ammonia level was found at phase III. In OM, ammonia level ranged 1.74 to 5.86, 4.61 to 21.06, 16.36 to 31.56, and 14.23 to 22.93 mg/l in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. In IF, ammonia level ranged from 0.20 to 2.88, 0.11 to 2.18, 0.57 to 5.37, and 5.80 to 5.92 mg/l in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. In OM+IF, ammonia level ranged from 5.42 to 19.96, 9.86 to 51.6, 47.70 to 88.5, and 42.96 to 60.16 mg/l in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. Nitrite level was significantly (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5B</xref>). Nitrite levels were 0.01 to 0.08, 2.14 to 0.1, and 0.03 to 0.13 mg/l in OM, IF, and OM+IF, respectively, in all four phases. Nitrate level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in IF compared to the other two treatments in first and second phases (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6B</xref>). In OM+IF, significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher nitrate level was found in the third phase of the study. Nitrate levels were 0.16 to 1.95, 1.48 to 2.53, and 0.44 to 2.70 mg/l in OM, IF, and OM+IF, respectively, throughout the study period. Phosphate level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower in IF compared to the other two treatments throughout the study period (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7B</xref>). In OM, phosphate level ranged 2.03 to 2.54, 1.22 to 2.22, 0.45 to 1.21, and 1.35 to 1.60 mg/l in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. In IF, phosphate level ranged from 0.15 to 0.42, 0.22 to 0.65, 0.30 to 0.55, and 0.28 to 0.45 mg/l in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. Conductivity was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in OM+IF compared to the other two treatments throughout the study period (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8B</xref>). This group was followed by OM and IF.
