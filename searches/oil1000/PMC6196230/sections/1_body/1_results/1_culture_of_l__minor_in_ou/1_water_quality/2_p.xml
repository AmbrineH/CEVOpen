<p class="p">The second experiment was conducted during October 2016–February 2017. In this experiment, seasonal effect on water quality and 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production was recorded (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>). Depending on the range of water temperature and light intensity the whole study period was divided into four phases. In the first phase (October–November) of the study, water temperature ranged from 22.5 to 18.5°C and then it reduced. Water temperature ranged from 17.7 to 14.5, 14.3 to 11.2, and 14.2 to 19.4°C in second (November–December), third (December–January), and fourth (January–February) phases, respectively. Light intensity also varied significantly in four different phases (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>). Light intensity ranged from 4,111 ± 232 to 2,322 ± 130, 2,138 ± 178 to 781 ± 122, 718 ± 37 to 1,999 ± 34, and 3,463 ± 114 to 3,728 ± 57 lux in phase I, phase II, phase III, and phase IV, respectively. There was no significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) difference in temperature and light intensity in various treatments throughout the study period. In OM, pH ranged from 7.19 to 7.60, 7.23 to 7.88, 7.52 to 7.91, and 7.66 to 8.13 in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. In IF, pH ranged from 7.50 to 7.86, 7.63 to 8.07, 7.68 to 8.05, and 7.60 to 8.09 in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively. In OM+IF, pH ranged from 7.30 to 7.67, 7.32 to 7.86, 7.47 to 7.94, and 7.80 to 7.90 in the first, second, third, and fourth phases, respectively.
