<p class="p">Three consecutive experiments were conducted in outdoor tanks to generate the baseline data for the production of duckweed 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> in the pond conditions. Four, three, and two different manures were used in experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the pond experiment, only OM were applied for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic>. In experiment 1, water temperature ranged from 28.0 ± 0.4 to 25.5 ± 0.3°C in various treatments during September–October 2016. The intensity of light was recorded as 7,353 ± 138 to 4,642 ± 114 lux during this period in different culture tanks. There was no significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) difference in water temperature (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>) and light intensity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>) among various culture tanks. Water temperature and light intensity were higher at the beginning of the study and gradually reduced. The pH of water ranged from 7.10 to 7.41, 7.30 to 7.80, 6.96 to 7.35, and 6.99 to 7.52 in manures 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, throughout the study period. Dissolved oxygen level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in the culture system fertilized with IFs compared to the other treatments throughout the study period. Dissolved oxygen levels in other treatments were always less than one (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>). Ammonia (NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in 2x OM+IF treatment compared to the others throughout the study period (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>). Among these four treatments, lowest ammonia level was found in IF. Ammonia level ranged from 0.585 to 4.65, 0.03 to 0.51, 8.4 to 22.6, and 15.65 to 42.97 mg/l in OM, IF, 2x OM, and 2x OM+IF, respectively, throughout the study period. Nitrite level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in IF compared to the other treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5A</xref>). Highest level was recorded on day-1 of study in this treatment. Nitrite levels were 0.008 ± 0.002, 0.084 ± 0.024, 0.025 ± 0.008, and 0.033 ± 0.009 mg/l in OM, IF, 2x OM, and 2x OM+IF, respectively. Nitrate level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in IF compared to the other treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A</xref>). Nitrate levels were 1.30 ± 0.52, 15.30 ± 0.80, 5.23 ± 1.20, and 5.87 ± 1.22 mg/l in OM, IF, 2x OM, and 2x OM+IF, respectively. This showed the rate of nitrification among various treatments. Phosphate level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in 2x OM+IF compared to the other treatments. This group was followed by 2x OM, OM, and minimum level was found in IF (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7A</xref>). Highest level of phosphate was recorded on day-1 of study compared to the other days regardless of treatments. Conductivity was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in 2x OM+IF compared to the other treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8A</xref>). This group was followed by 2x OM, OM, and minimum level was found in IF.
