<p class="p">The third experiment was conducted during February–April 2017. In this experiment, water temperature was minimum at the beginning and gradually increased ranging from 19.43 to 28.42°C. Light intensity also showed an increasing trend ranging from 6,341 ± 10 to 12,550 ± 283 lux throughout the study period. There was no significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) difference in temperature (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>) and light intensity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>) between the two treatments throughout the study period. The pH of the water ranged from 7.41 to 7.83 and 7.60 to 9.14 in OM and IF, respectively, during the study period. Dissolved oxygen level was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in IF compared to the OM throughout the study period. Dissolved oxygen level ranged from 1.27 to 0.12 mg/l in various days of study in OM. Dissolved oxygen level was always &lt; 1 mg/l in OM, except on the first day after manure application (Figure
