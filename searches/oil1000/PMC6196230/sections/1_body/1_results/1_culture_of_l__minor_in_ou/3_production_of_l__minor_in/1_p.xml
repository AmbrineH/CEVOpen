<p class="p">In all these study, macrophytes were harvested when the surface area of the tanks were filled with macrophytes. There was difference in harvesting time in various treatments due to differences in the growth of plants. In all these treatments, 50% of the total biomass was harvested at each harvest, except the final one. In experiment 1, production of macrophytes was significantly (
