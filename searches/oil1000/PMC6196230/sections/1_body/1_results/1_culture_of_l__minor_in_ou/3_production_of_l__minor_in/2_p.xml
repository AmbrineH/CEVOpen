<p class="p">In experiment 2, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in OM compared to the other two treatments in first and second phases. In third phase, macrophyte was harvested thrice from IF. There was no harvesting from OM as the growth of duckweed was very less and it was not covering the whole surface area of the tank. Plants were harvested only when they covered the whole water body. The growth of macrophytes was very poor in OM+IF in the third phase. There was no survival of plants in this treatment. In fourth phase, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in OM compared to IF. Total production was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in OM and IF compared to OM+IF treatment. There was no significant (
