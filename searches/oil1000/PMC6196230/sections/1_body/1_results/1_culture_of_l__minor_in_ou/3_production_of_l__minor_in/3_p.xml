 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> production was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in OM compared to the IF (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">10C</xref>). In OM, macrophyte was first harvested after 14 days of inoculation of plants when the tank was totally covered with macrophytes. In IF, tanks were filled with macrophytes after 28 days of inoculation and then plants were harvested. The type of manures influenced the growth of macrophytes.
