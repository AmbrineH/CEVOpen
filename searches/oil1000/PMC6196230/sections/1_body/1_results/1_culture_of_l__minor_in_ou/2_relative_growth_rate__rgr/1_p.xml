<p class="p">The relative growth rate (RGR) of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> varied among different treatments in all three experiments. In experiment 1, 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was harvested 6, 5, 4, and 3 times in OM, IF, 2x OM, and 2x OM+IF, respectively, during 30 days of culture period. The RGR was always highest at first harvest regardless of treatments (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9Aâ€“C</xref>). In experiment 1, RGR ranged from 0.521 to 0.047, 0.463 to 0.083, 0.239 to 0.034, and 0.215 to 0.078 g/g/day in OM, IF, 2x OM and 2x OM+IF, respectively, in various days of sampling. In experiment 2, plants were harvested 5, 8, and 3 times from OM, IF, and OM+IF, respectively. The RGR ranged from 0.23 to 0.014, 0.196 to 0.021, and 0.169 to 0.056 g/g/day in OM, IF, and OM+IF, respectively, in various days of sampling. In experiment 3, plants were harvested 7 and 3 times from OM and IF, respectively. The RGR ranged from 0.30 to 0.035 and 0.140 to 0.023 g/g/day in OM and IF in various days of sampling.
