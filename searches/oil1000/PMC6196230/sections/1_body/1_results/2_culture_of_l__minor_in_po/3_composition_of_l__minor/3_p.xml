<p class="p">The fatty acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> was dominated by PUFA, which accounted for 60–63% of total fatty acids, largely α-linolenic acid (LNA, 18:3n-3) at around 41–47% and linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) at 17–18%, followed by saturated fatty acids (~23–26%) and monoenes (11–12%) (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). As with proximate composition, fatty acid profile was also influenced by manures, with 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> grown in OM having significantly higher proportions of LA, LNA, saturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids, and total PUFA when compared to the inorganic counterpart (IF). Due to the higher lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> grown in OM, all fatty acids were found in higher absolute amounts (mg/100 g dry mass) in macrophytes grown in OMs. Irrespective of manure, the 
 <italic class="italic">L. minor</italic> lipid profile contained no long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), although there was a trace of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3).
