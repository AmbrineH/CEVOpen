<p class="p">The amino acid profile of duckweed cultured in OM showed some interesting results (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The essential (39.20%), non-essential (53.64%), and non-proteinogenic (7.13%) amino acids were present in duckweed. All essential amino acids viz. histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine were found in adequate quantity. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine consisted 48.67% of the essential amino acids. Among non-essential amino acids, glutamic acid was 25.87%. Several non-proteinogenic amino acids viz. citrulline, hydroxiproline, taurine etc. were also present in the duckweed. The amino acid profile of duckweed cultured in IF was not provided.
