<p class="p">This experiment was conducted in cemented ponds during July–August 2017. The variations in water quality parameters reflected the seasonal variations as well as effect of manure application. Water temperature and pH ranged from 33.15 to 30.27°C and 7.32 to 8.04, respectively, throughout the study period. Water temperature was higher in July and gradually it decreased (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1D</xref>). Dissolved oxygen level ranged from 1.04 to 3.57 mg/l on various days of study. Dissolved oxygen level was higher at the beginning of the experiment; the level decreased after the application of manures and with the growth of macrophytes as it covered the surface area of the ponds. Ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels ranged from 5.02 to 10.57, 0.003 to 0.12, and 0.23 to 2.44 mg/l, respectively. Phosphate level ranged 1.15 to 1.70 mg/l during the study period (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Conductivity ranged from 1,022 to 1,351 μS/cm throughout the culture period of duckweed. Ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate levels varied with the days of manure application.
