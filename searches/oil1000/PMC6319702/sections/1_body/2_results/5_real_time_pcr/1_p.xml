 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210059.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>) showed that the EFA-treated lesions in group 2 animals displayed increased levels of leptin (2.88±0.65 vs. 1.00±0.61-fold change), IL-6 (2.84±0.575 vs. 1.00±0.206-fold change) and IFN-γ (3.53±1.31 vs. 1.00±0.13-fold change) in the initial stages (day 4) of wound healing compared with the MO-treated lesions in the control group. IGF-1 levels were higher on day 10 in the EFA-treated animals (2.15±0.325 vs. 1.00±0.118-fold change). Analyses of the remaining cytokine values were not significant. No statistical differences were found between SS-treated lesions and MO-treated ones.
