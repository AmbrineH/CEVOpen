<p class="p">Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats (strain NTacUnib:SD), with a median age of 7 weeks, were obtained from the University of Campinas Breeding Center (
 <italic class="italic">CEMIB</italic>). The study was approved by the University of Campinas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 2929–1 and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation and the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS). To follow the IACUC recommendations for using the lowest possible number of animals per group and to evaluate the systemic action of topically applied EFA oil (Saniplan, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil), we used a model in which the control group animals received two treatments [

The treatment group also received two topical agents: MO as the control and EFA oil as the treatment. The chemical content of the sunflower oil is as follows: capric acid, caprylic acid, caproic acid, lauric acid, linoleic acid, lecithin, retinol palmitate, tocopherol acetate and alpha-tocopherol [

The mineral oil used was manufactered by Rioquímica (São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil) and is made of liquid petrolatum. This oil is used to maintain the skin moist, by avoiding transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The petrolatum in not absorbed percutaneously; the absorption is predominant in the stratum corneum [
