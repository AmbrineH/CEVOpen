<p class="p">Serum samples from all animals were obtained via whole blood centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 3,500 RPM). We used Quantikine Quantitative Sandwich Enzyme Immunoassay ELISA kits for IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-6, IGF-1, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and TNF-α (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and for leptin and adiponectin (Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA). All plates were analyzed using a BioRad 680 microplate reader, (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 450 and 570-nm wavelengths, according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.</p>
