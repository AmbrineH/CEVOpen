<p class="p">Wounds were photographed on days two, four and 10 after surgical intervention with a constant focal length. The unhealed areas were quantified by the “number of pixels”. The reduction relative to the topographic opposite (on the left side) was determined for each wound treated (on the right side). In this way, the proportion of the treated wound that remained unhealed after the experiment began could be quantified in relation to the control side of the same animal. This proportion was considered 100% on day zero. [
