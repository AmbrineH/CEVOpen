<p class="p">To perform PCR, we used 40 ng of cDNA, 0.5 μl of specific primer, 5.0 μl of Taqman Universal Master Mix (4369016, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNase-free water at a final volume of 10 μl. TaqMan gene expression analyses were performed on a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The reference gene was rat GAPDH, cat. number 4352338E (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p>
