<p class="p">The target gene primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems and included the following: adiponectin (Rn00595250_m1), leptin (Rn00565158_m1), IL-2 (Rn00587673_m1), IL-4 (Rn01456866_m1), IL-6 (Rn01410330_m1), IL-12 (Rn00575112_m1), IFN-α (Rn01400027_g1), IFN-γ 
 <bold class="bold">(</bold>Rn00594078_m1), IGF-1(Rn00710306_m1), and TNF-α (Rn00562055_m1). The control group (MO) average on each treatment day (day 2, 4 or 10) was used to calibrate all groups. PCR efficiency was calculated prior to the experiments, and the 2^-DDCT method was used to calculate gene expression [
