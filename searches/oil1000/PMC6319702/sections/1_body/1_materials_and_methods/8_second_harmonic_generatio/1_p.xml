<p class="p">We used nonlinear imaging to evaluate collagen density in the skin via the SHG technique. Wound areas images were obtained at the National Institute of Photonics Applied to Cell Biology (INFABIC) using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 LSM780 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with 512 Ã— 512 pixels of spatial resolution. A MaiTai Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to excite the samples at 800 nm with a 10x objective lens. For quantitative image analyses, we used the ImageJ optical density tool (available from

The wound center was selected as the specific region of interest (ROI), and the same box (with the same area) was used in images obtained from animals euthanized on day 10.
