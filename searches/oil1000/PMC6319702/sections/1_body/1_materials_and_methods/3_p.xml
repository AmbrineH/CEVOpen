<p class="p">The animals were housed in individual polypropylene cages with free access to food and water. Room temperature was set at 22°C, and lighting was set on a 12:12-hour artificial light-dark cycle. The rats were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine at 50 mg/kg

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Using 6.0-mm biopsy punches, we produced eight wounds on the back of each animal: four on the left side and four on the right side. The animals were randomly divided into 2 groups of 15 animals as follows: group 1 –control (SS/MO) in which wounds were only cleansed with saline solution (SS) on the left side and treated with mineral oil (MO) on the right, and group 2 –(MO/EFA) in which lesions received MO on the left and treated with EFA oil on the right (

Lesions were covered with gauze and tape to avoid mixing of the different oils applied to the same animal. All animals were followed up after the procedure until the end of the anesthesia, to find out how they would wake up and to get food and water. To diminish/control pain, animals had access to water with paracetamol (200 mg.kg
