<p class="p">IFN-γ mRNA levels were higher in animals treated with EFA in our experiment. A previous study found that this substance delayed the wound healing process in burn injuries and that knockout mice exhibited better angiogenesis and myofibroblast responses due to a dampening of excessive inflammation [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Our results showed the opposite response; the EFA-treated group had better wound healing but higher IFN-γ mRNA levels. This can be explained by the other cytokines involved in the wound healing cascade, which may have overlapped with the effects of interferon. In addition, its higher levels may have been related to the high cellularity our group found at day 10.
