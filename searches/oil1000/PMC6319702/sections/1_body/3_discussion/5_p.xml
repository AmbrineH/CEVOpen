<p class="p">IGF-1 can be produced by fibroblasts and may induce mitogenic and motogenic responses in keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Thus, our results indicated that wounded skin treated with EFA had higher local IGF-1 mRNA expression throughout the experiment, which may benefit the wound healing outcome. Gene therapy with the IGF-1 gene transferred to fibroblasts was found to upregulate the expression of IGF-1 and improve wound healing outcome [
