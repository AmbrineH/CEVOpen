<p class="p">We found statistically significant results with regard to local leptin, IL-6, IGF-1 and IFN-γ mRNA levels. A study performed by Tadokoro and colleagues revealed that leptin applied at the wound site accelerated wound healing by promoting keratinocyte proliferation [

 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Our results are consistent with those presented in Tadokoro’s research. An interesting finding of our research is the lower levels of this adipokine mRNA at later healing stages, which may have prevented exaggerated wound healing responses.
