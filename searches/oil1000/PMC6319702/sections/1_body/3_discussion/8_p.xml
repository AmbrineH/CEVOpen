<p class="p">Our model allowed observation of cytokine and growth factor production between the groups, as well as the cellularity level both between groups and between different treatments in the same group. We found increased IL-6 expression at day 4, in the beginning of the wound healing process and a systemic downregulation at day 10. In a work performed by Wiik and colleagues, it was found an opposite situation: higher local levels and lower systemic levels [

Since the animals of all groups were kept at the same conditions throughout the experiment, we may exclude an external cause for this discrepancy. As cited above, higher levels of IL-6 at the early stages of wound healing is positive, as well as decreased levels at later stages. In order to thoroughly assess the role of IL-6, further studies should be performed, also for other cytokines enrolled in the process that we could not detect statistical differences.
