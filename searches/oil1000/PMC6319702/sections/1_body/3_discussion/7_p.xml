<p class="p">Cytokines produced by the skin may have access to capillary vessels through diffusion, even though the rate of diffusion depend on factors such as degradation level, distance between production and the vessels [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]; one of these cytokines produced in the skin is IL-6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The significant changes in the serum IL-6 levels provided evidence that topically applying EFA-rich oil produced a systemic effect. This is a new and important finding that demonstrates the systemic effects of topical application of this oil by comparing the serum level of cytokines in MO/EFA-treated mice with those in SS/MO-treated mice. As it is largely used in open wounds regardless of their size and in some cases during the entire treatment, there is a risk of systemic adverse side effects. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that also coordinates an anti-inflammatory environment to resolve inflammation [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. High IL-6 levels are directly related to rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], depression [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and myeloma, leading to a medical interest in controlling IL-6 activity, since it can act in tumor cell growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Low IL-6 levels were found in patients with IgA nephropathy [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, IL-6 is putatively involved both in skin burns [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and excisional wound healing [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In both cases, higher IL-6 levels at initial healing stages were associated with better outcomes. Goodman and Stein [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] reported that aging fibroblasts produced lower IL-6 levels, which in older persons could lead to poor wound healing and infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This same scenario could be induced by extensive EFA oil when topically used for wound healing, thus worsening the process [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Another study found that animals fed with an EFA oil-enriched diet had lower systemic IL-6 levels than the control group [
 <xref rid="pone.0210059.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>].
