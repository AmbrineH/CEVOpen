 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are attracted to a human body temperature (37 C degree) source and repellency of different chemicals can be conveniently tested by measuring the reduction in numbers of mosquitoes attracted to the heat source. In the dose response curve, DEET and all of the catnip treatments at 1.00%, decreased the landings of mosquitoes by &gt;95% and grouped together statistically for repellency (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). At 0.01%, 0.10% and 1.00% DEET repelled 31.7% ± 13.5, 80.0% ± 12.6 and 98.0 ± 1.5 of the mosquitoes respectively. At 0.01%, 0.10% and 1.00% the CR3 crude essential oil repelled 66.3% ± 12.7, 74.1% ± 17.3 and 97.2% ± 6.9 of the mosquitoes respectively. At 0.01%, 0.10% and 1.00% the CR9 crude essential oil repelled 65.9% ± 18.1, 80.6% ± 6.6 and 99.8% ± 0.2 respectively. At 0.01%, 0.10% and 1.00% the commercial essential oil repelled 58.7% ± 16.0, 83.1% ± 5.9 and 99.8% ± 0.3 respectively. At 0.01%, 0.10% and 1.00% the purified Z, E isomer repelled 53.1% ± 11.1, 90.9% ± 5.7 and 99.7% ± 0.3 of the 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes respectively and the purified E, Z isomer repelled 55.7% ± 14.4, 74.2% ± 14.7 and 96.8% ± 3.3 respectively.
