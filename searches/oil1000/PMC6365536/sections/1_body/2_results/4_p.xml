<p id="Par22" class="p">In the time course assay a higher concentration (10%) was used to more closely match the bioactive repellents found in commercially available formulations of insect repellents. The 10% CR9 essential oil treatment generated &gt;95% repellency for the first two hours and was statistically similar to DEET (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). At the 0 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr and 24 hour time intervals after treatment, DEET repelled 99.8% ± 0.3, 99.1% ± 1.0, 99.8% ± 0.3, 99.1% ± 1.0, 94.1% ± 7.0 and 97.5% ± 2.3 mosquitoes respectively. At the 0 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr and 24 hour time intervals after treatment, CR9 essential oil repelled 99.7% ± 0.2, 98.7% ± 1.1, 97.2% ± 3.2, 87.8% ± 12.6, 81.0% ± 10.7, and 76.2% ± 18.3 mosquitoes respectively.
