<p id="Par5" class="p">Natural insect repellent formulations using essential oils from aromatic plants in the Lamiaceae family are sourced from the glandular trichromes on the epidermis of leaves and flowers. Plants biosynthesize multiple compounds in their essential oil, not just a single desirable chemical and breeding programs have increased the bioactive compounds concentration within the essential oil of multiple species of plants across the kingdom

 </sup>. Botanicals from the Lamiaceae family have also demonstrated that their essential oils can act as a mosquito repellent comparable to DEET

 </sup>. One member of this family, 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta cataria</italic> (catnip), has had its essential oils containing various nepetalactone stereoisomers tested and the results showed that it is comparable to DEET at repelling mosquitoes, while offering better spatial repellency
