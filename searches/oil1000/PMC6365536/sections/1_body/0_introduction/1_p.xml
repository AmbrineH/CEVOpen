 </sup>. Recently, a newer threat known as the Zika virus reemerged and is being rapidly spread by 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, as well as from a viremic mother to her newborn and by sexual intercourse throughout the western hemisphere, potentially causing neurological disorders and microcephaly
