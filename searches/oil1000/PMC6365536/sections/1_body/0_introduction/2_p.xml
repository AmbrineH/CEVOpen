 </sup>. DEET (N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) has been the benchmark of insect repellents since its development for the United States Army to use in tropical regions where there is a high incidence of insect transmitted diseases

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. While DEET is extremely effective, it is not as volatile as other insect repellents and leads to a limited spatial range of repellency for mosquitoes and other insects

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Whereas another critical concern associated with the consistent use of DEET is its potential toxicity. Studies have shown DEET inhibits human acetyl cholinesterase, modulates G-protein coupled receptors and inhibits ion channels

 </sup>. Numerous publications exist urging caution in its use and claim that DEET is unsuitable for young children and pregnant females, though the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC; Atlanta, GA) still recommends the use of it for vector protection

 </sup>. However, other reviews suggest that it does not cause adverse health effects

 </sup>. The costs of DEET have made it unaffordable to many of those living in regions affected by disease vectoring mosquitoes such as sub-Saharan Africa, China and India. Between the costs, access, and public concern about the dangers of DEET individuals and families could prefer locally sourced natural insect repellants derived from eucalyptus, mints, cloves, basils and neem leaves rather than DEET
