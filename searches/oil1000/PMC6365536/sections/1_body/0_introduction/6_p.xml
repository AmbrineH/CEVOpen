<p id="Par7" class="p">Due to the need for effective safe insect repellents and since the essential oils and purified compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic> have shown to be effective at repelling mosquitoes, we investigated several different established nepetalactone based chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic>, their respective purified isomers and compared them to DEET to generate a landing reduction dose response repellency curve. We also conducted a time course analysis of a crude essential oil extract compared to DEET over a 24â€‰hr period to assess repellency.
