 <italic class="italic">wt</italic>. Orlando) eggs were reared in water at 27 °C with 80% humidity under a 12-hour day/night light cycle and were transferred during the rearing process with an eyedropper. General fish food tablets were used as the energy source for the maturing mosquitoes. The 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> eggs were placed in a container holding water and once hatched and formed into larvae, they were separated from the unhatched eggs and placed into fresh water. As the mosquitoes began to form into pupae, they were separated from the smaller less developed larvae and placed into fresh water. This container was then placed into a rearing cage where the pupae were allowed to mature into adults. Mature females were visually identified, then separated out of the population by aspirating them into a separate rearing cage where they were given a 10% sucrose solution as an energy source. Mature females were kept at these conditions until experimentation.
