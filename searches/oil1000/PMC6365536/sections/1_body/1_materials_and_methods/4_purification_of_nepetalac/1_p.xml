<p id="Par14" class="p">Approximately 12 grams of the different catnip essential oils were repeatedly chromatographed on a silica gel column using a stepwise gradient of hexane-EtOAc from 100%:0% to 80%:20%. CR9 crude essential oil was used for

 <italic class="italic">E, Z</italic>-nepetalactone purification. Achieved fractions containing the target components were monitored by silica H TLC (hexane-EtOAc/90%:10%) and LC–MS obtaining Z, E-nepetalactone (800 mg) and E, Z-nepetalactone (200 mg). For LC-MS analysis, a Hewlett Packard Agilent 1100 Series LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with an autosampler, quaternary pump system, DAD, degasser, MSD trap with an electrospray ion source, and software for data processing (HP ChemStation) was applied. The structures of these two purified compounds were determined and verified by UV, MS and NMR spectrometric methods, the latter using a Bruker NMR 400 MHz, and in comparison with references
