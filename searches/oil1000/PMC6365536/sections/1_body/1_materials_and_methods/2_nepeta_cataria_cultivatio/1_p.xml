 </sup>. The CR3 essential oil chemotype is mainly comprised of the E, Z-nepetalactone isomer yet also produces Z, E-nepetalactone. The CR9 essential oil chemotype is dominated by the Z, E-nepetalactone isomer and produces little E, Z-nepetalactone. The hydro-distilled essential oil from these two populations served as the source for the crude essential oil treatments and partitioned for subsequent fractionation and nepetalactone purification.
