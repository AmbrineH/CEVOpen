<p id="Par11" class="p">These two genetically distinct populations were propagated at the Rutgers University Research Greenhouses (New Brunswick, NJ) where vegetative clones were made by making cuttings at the terminal nodes and briefly dipping them in Hormodin 2, 0.3% indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to induce root formation and placed in a mist house until roots developed. The clones were then transplanted on June 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>, 2015 to the Rutgers University Clifford E. &amp; Melda C. Snyder Research and Extension Farm in Pittstown, NJ. Just before the plants were in full flower, they were harvested and dried at 37 °C with an onsite Powell walk-in forced air heat dryer. Once the plants had lost all moisture, the leaves and flowers were separated from the stems before hydro-distillation. Essential oils were extracted by hydro-distilling 60 g of dried
