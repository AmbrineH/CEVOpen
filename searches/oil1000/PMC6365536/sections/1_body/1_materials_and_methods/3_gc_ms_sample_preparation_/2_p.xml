<p id="Par13" class="p">An injection volume of 1 µL was separated using chromatographic grade helium on a H-Rxi-5Sil MS column held at 35 °C for 4 min then heated to 250 °C at 20 °C/min then held for 1.25 min at 250 °C. The inlet temperature was 250 °C with a splitless injection. The ion source temperature was set at 200 °C, the interface temperature was set at 250 °C, the solvent cut time was 3.5 min, and the detector voltage was set to 0.2 kV with a threshold of 1000. Peak integration percentages were generated using the GCMSsolution v4.3© software from Shimadzu Corporation. Individual identities were determined by comparing the mass spectral results to current literature and screening them in the NIST05.LIB, NIST05s.LIB, W10N14.lib and the W10N14R.lib mass spectral libraries.</p>
