<p id="Par17" class="p">This assay was performed the same way as the dose response curve, except we were evaluating how long the essential oils can be an effective repellent. During a 24 hr period, the efficacy of a 10% CR9 essential oil and DEET treatment was monitored at 0 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr and 24 hr intervals. Six repetitions were done for each treatment where the mosquito landings were counted and analyzed similarly to the dose response curve method and at each time point along with an acetone control before and after to ensure mosquito behavior reproducibility where percent repellencies for each treatment represented the percent reduction in mosquito landings from the prior control. After the acetone treatment was applied to the filter paper and the 0 hr treatment sample was done, the filter paper was collected and used in the subsequent time intervals.</p>
