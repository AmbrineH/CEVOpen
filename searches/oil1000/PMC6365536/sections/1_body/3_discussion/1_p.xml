<p id="Par23" class="p">The data presented herein demonstrates that the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic> can serve as a natural source for an effective 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> repellent that is comparable to DEET for the first two hours after application but needs to be reapplied to maintain complete repellency from 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Since the two main chemotypes of the essential oils (CR3, CR9) were not statistically different from one another and DEET at 1.00%, individuals who are in need of an immediately effective insect repellent could use either 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic> essential oil chemotype for protection and for two hours of protection they can use the ‘CR9’ chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic>. The data from the 0.01% treatment in the dose response curve is in contrast to a biting deterrent study in which DEET was shown to be more effective than either of the nepetalactones and can be attributed to the differences in the tests and/or mosquitoes. However, results from the time course assay demonstrate that the CR9 essential oil is as effective as DEET for the first two hours after application in the landing reduction assay. The two isomers were equally effective at repelling mosquitoes so repellents made from these will be effective as long as it has a high enough concentration of either nepetalactone isomer. While the 10.00% solution of the CR9 chemotype is just as effective as DEET for the first 2hrs, a reapplication would be required after that to keep the numbers of landings reduced by 95% or greater. Efforts to increase the effective repellency duration of the catnip essential oils through formulation development should be considered so that the repellent maintains the &gt;95% landing reductions for over 2hrs so reapplication would be less frequent.
