   <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes with 10% DEET and crude CR9 essential oil treatments over 24 hours. The samples were tested at 0 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours after application of the treatments. Values are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD).
