 <italic class="italic">T. vulgare</italic> were collected in July 2014 in Chicoutimi, Quebec, QC, Canada. Voucher specimen no. QFA0610840 has been filed at the Louis-Marie herbarium of Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada. Essential oil was obtained from freshly harvested aerial parts by industrial steam distillation over a 3-h period (Groupe BoréaRessources, Ferland-Boileau, QC, Canada). The essential oil extraction yields depended on the total amount of the raw material. The extracted essential oil was then stored in the dark at a temperature of 4 °C.
