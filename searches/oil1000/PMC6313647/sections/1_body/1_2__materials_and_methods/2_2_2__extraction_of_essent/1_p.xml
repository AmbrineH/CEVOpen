<p class="p">A portion of ca. 150 g of leaf material was cut into small pieces and added to 400 mL of de-ionised water in a blender (Waring, HGB2WTS3, New Hartford, CT, USA). The material was macerated for 1 min and then combined with two additional portions (ca. 450 g total) and subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for approximately 3 h. The oil/water emulsion produced was collected and stored at 4 Â°C overnight to separate the essential oil from the residual water. The essential oil was then removed and stored in an amber glass bottle at room temperature until further use. </p>
