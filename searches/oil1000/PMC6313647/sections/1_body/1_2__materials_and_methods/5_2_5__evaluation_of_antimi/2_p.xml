<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each oil was determined using a broth microdilution method based on protocols published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) [

 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The method was modified slightly by incorporating a final concentration of 0.001% Tween 80 to enhance oil solubility. In brief, each 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil was serially diluted two-fold in 100 µL volumes in a 96-well microtitre tray so that after inoculation with 100 µL of inoculum per well, the final concentrations ranged from 8.0% to 0.0016% (

 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] as a conversion factor, these percentage values corresponded to a range of 74.136 mg/mL–0.145 mg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil. A positive growth control well containing growth medium and 0.001% Tween 80 but without 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil was included. The inocula were prepared from overnight cultures as described above and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland for bacteria, which corresponded to approximately 10
