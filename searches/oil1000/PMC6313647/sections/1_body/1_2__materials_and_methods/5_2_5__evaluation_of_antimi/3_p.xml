<p class="p">The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) or minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined by removing 10 µL volumes from each well showing no visible growth and spot-inoculating onto Mueller–Hinton agar. After incubation, colonies were counted and the MBC/MFC was identified as the lowest concentration of oil that killed ≥99.9% of the inoculum. The assay was conducted three times on separate occasions, and modal MIC/MBC/MFC values were selected.</p>
