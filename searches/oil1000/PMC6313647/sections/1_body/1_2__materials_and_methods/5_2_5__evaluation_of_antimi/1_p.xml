 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils and 1,8-cineole were initially screened for activity against one Gram-positive strain (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213) and one Gram-negative reference strain (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922) using an agar diffusion assay. The inocula were prepared by inoculating the organisms onto the blood agar and incubating overnight at 35 °C. the colonies were then suspended in 0.85% saline, and the suspension was adjusted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland (10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL) using a nephelometer. The suspension was then swab-inoculated onto Mueller–Hinton agar, and 8 mm diameter wells were punched into the agar. Volumes of 25 µL and 50 µL of each 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil and 1,8-cineole were then aliquoted into the wells. Trimethoprim (5 µg/disc) was used as a positive control. After incubation at 35 °C for 24 h, zones of inhibition were measured, and the results were reported in millimetres (mm). Each oil was tested at least three times on separate occasions, and mean values were calculated.
