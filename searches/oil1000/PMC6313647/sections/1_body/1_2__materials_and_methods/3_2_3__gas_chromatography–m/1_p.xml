<p class="p">GC–MS was performed with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 (Kyoto, Japan). GC columns used included a Rtx-5 column (5% diphenyl-dimethyl-polysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.1 μm film thickness, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA), and a DB-wax column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness, J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min on both columns. A scan range of

The ion source was set to 230 °C, and the transfer line temperature to 250 °C. The oven temperature program was 40 °C, held for 1 min then ramped at 7 °C/min to 250 °C and held for 10 min. Retention indices (RI) were calculated on both columns using the same linear gradient method with comparison to an n-hydrocarbon mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, p/n 46827-U). The main peaks in the total ion chromatogram of each oil were then integrated using the MS software, and the relative percentage abundance of peaks was determined.
