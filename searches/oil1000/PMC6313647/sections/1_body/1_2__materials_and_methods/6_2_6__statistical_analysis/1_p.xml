<p class="p">Geometric means of MICs and MBC/MFCs were determined for each 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil and for each microorganism. Geometric means were also determined to examine the difference in sensitivity between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To enable the analyses, values &gt;8.0% were converted to the next highest doubling dilution value of 16.0%. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the MIC results between the two 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains and the two 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis</italic> strains. A 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.
