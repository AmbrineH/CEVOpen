<p class="p">Although a number of researchers have previously investigated the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> essential oils, relatively little is known about the composition and activity of several Western Australian (WA) 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils. The aim of this work was therefore to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of WA 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species, namely, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus loxophleba</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus polybractea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus kochii</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">plenissima</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. kochii</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">borealis</italic>, also known as “oil mallees”, and to examine their antimicrobial activities against a range of common pathogenic bacteria.
