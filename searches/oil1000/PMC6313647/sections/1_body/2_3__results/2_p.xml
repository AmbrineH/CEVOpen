<p class="p">When the oils were screened for activity using the semi-quantitative agar diffusion assay, all 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils and 1,8-cineole produced zones of inhibition against the two test bacteria (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-06-00122-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The largest zone of inhibition was observed for 50 ÂµL of 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic> oil against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213. For the remaining oils, zone sizes were relatively modest and ranged from 11.0 to 16.7 mm. On the basis of this data, more comprehensive antibacterial studies were conducted, using an expanded range of test organisms.
