<p class="p">This study showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils from some selected WA species had moderate antimicrobial activity, which varied according to the Eucalypt species and the test microorganism. The data suggest that WA 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils are potentially a good source of antimicrobial agents, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. As such, further studies with additional test organisms and additional oil samples are warranted.
