<p class="p">The major compound present in all oils was 1,8-cineole, which is in keeping with previous studies indicating that 1,8-cineole is often the major component of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The percentages of 1,8-cineole in 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. kochii</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">plenissima</italic> oils were largely in agreement with those previously reported [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">E. kochii</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">borealis</italic> was previously known as both 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus oleosa</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">borealis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus horistes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and the levels of 1,8-cineole reported for the oils from these species were 75.5% [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and 90.17% [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], respectively. The two 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> oils varied in composition, possibly due to differences in the local climatic and environmental conditions under which the plants grew (given that they were from different regions), as well as the genetic characteristics and the age of the trees [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. It is also possible that they were different subspecies, as 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> has three subspecies, including 
 <italic class="italic">loxophleba</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lissophloia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">gratiae</italic>. Bignell et al. (1997) found 1,8-cineole levels of 25.2% in 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">loxophleba</italic> and 63.0% in 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lissophloia</italic>, indicating large differences in composition [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Regardless, relatively little information is published on the chemical composition of WA 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils, and, as such, a comparison of the current data with previous findings is limited.
