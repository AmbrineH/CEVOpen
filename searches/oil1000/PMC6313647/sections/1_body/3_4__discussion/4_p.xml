<p class="p">It was not surprising that the two 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> oils had substantially different antimicrobial activity, given that these two oils varied in composition and that 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> comprises a complex of several sub-species, rather than a single species [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Whilst it is not known which sub-species of 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> the oils in the current study were from, the variability in activity may be attributed to differences in the composition such as the presence of trans-pinocarveol (4.66%) in 
 <italic class="italic">E. loxophleba</italic> 2 oil, which has been shown to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. These observations also suggest that a high 1,8-cineole content is not necessarily fully responsible for the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil and that moderate and minor compounds also play a vital role in the overall activity. Components other than 1,8-cineole may contribute to the activity as a result of their individual actions, by acting in combination with each other, or by acting in combination with 1,8-cineole. Such interactions between 1,8-cineole and other essential oil components have been demonstrated in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>].
