<p class="p">A number of clinical studies indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil and 1,8-cineole have significant potential as therapeutic agents, due to several different properties. For example, the benefits of 1,8-cineole for airway disease [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil as an insect repellent [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] have recently been reviewed. The toxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil has been extensively studied both in vitro and in animal studies, with the latter indicating that 1,8-cineole has low toxicity [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Furthermore, studies with human volunteers indicate that, when applied correctly, the oil has relatively low allergenicity and toxicity [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Whilst many studies have investigated the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil in vitro, fewer clinical studies have been performed. As such, there is no clear overall picture of the clinical usefulness of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil as an antimicrobial agent. Further studies are required to determine how the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oil can be best therapeutically utilised.
