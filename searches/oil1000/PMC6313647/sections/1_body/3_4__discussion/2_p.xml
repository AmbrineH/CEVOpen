<p class="p">With regard to antimicrobial activity, numerous publications have described the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> using the agar diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the current study, low to modest activity (with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic>) was observed by agar diffusion, which concurs with these previous studies. However, although 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic> oil was the only oil that exhibited a considerable zone of inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, Gilles et al. (2010) reported considerable zones of inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, ranging from 25.4 to &gt;90 mm, for oils from four other 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These differences in results may be attributable to variation in the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> oils tested, as well as to variations in the experimental conditions. Finally, there was little correlation between the zone of inhibition and the MIC results, particularly for 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic> oil which showed the largest zone of inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> but not the lowest MICs. This could be due to the presence of components in the 
 <italic class="italic">E. polybractea</italic> oil that are relatively more water-soluble and able to diffuse further through the agar. The lack of correlation between the results from the two assays suggests that the two methods are not necessarily comparable. The agar diffusion method has long been regarded as problematic for the antimicrobial testing of natural products [
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Because of issues with inconsistent diffusion of antimicrobial components through the agar, potential evaporation of volatile components, and lack of standardization between laboratories [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-06-00122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], data generated by agar diffusion must be regarded as largely qualitative, and the assay as useful for screening purposes only.
