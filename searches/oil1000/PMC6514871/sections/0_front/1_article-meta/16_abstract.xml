 <p class="p">As a result of manufacture, composite materials can appear to have variations to their properties due to the existence of structural changes. In this paper, we studied the influence of material irregularity on the mechanical behavior of two categories of bars for which we have used hemp fabric as a reinforcing material. The common matrix is a hybrid resin based on Dammar and epoxy resin. We molded two types of bars within each of the previously mentioned categories. The first type, also called “ideal bar”, was made of layers in which the volume proportion and the orientation of the reinforcing material was the same in each section. The ideal bar does not show variations of mechanical properties along it. The second type of bar was molded to have one or two layers where, between certain sections, the reinforcing material was interrupted in several segments. We have determined some mechanical properties, the characteristic curves (strain-stress), the tensile strength, and elongation at break for all the sample sets on trial. Moreover, we have studied the influence of the non-uniformities on the mechanical behavior of the composites by entering certain quality factors that have been calculated after experimental determinations.</p>
