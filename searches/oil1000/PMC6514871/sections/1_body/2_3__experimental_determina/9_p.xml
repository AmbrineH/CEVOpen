<p class="p">For every sample reinforced with type “A” hemp fabric, we give the below (
 <xref rid="materials-12-01232-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) the lower and upper values (arithmetical average value and deviation value) for the elasticity modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break. We have not made a statistical analysis for those values simply because all the outcomes are strictly related to samples in the study. The mechanical properties of hemp fibers come under many influences, so a statistical analysis in this case would have not been relevant.
