<p class="p">The synthetic resins have the disadvantage of a processing limit due to high viscosity when melted, a phenomenon that occurs during injection molding. Thus, the final product is hard to recycle. This disadvantage can be eliminated by using thermo-rigid biological matrices, based on vegetable oil resins, since the latter are biodegradable and there is no need for a polymerization process [

The bio-resins are resins derived from a biological source, and in general they are biodegradable or compostable; therefore, hypothetically, they can be decomposed after use. The natural resins may be fossil (amber), vegetable (Sandarac, Copal, Dammar), or animal (Shellac). Natural resins are insoluble in water but are slightly soluble in oil, alcohol, and, partially, petrol. They form, together with certain organic solvents, solutions used as covering varnishes. Turpentine, rosin, and mastic are products resulting from coniferous resin distillation. An analysis of the chemical composition and the properties of these resins is made in [
