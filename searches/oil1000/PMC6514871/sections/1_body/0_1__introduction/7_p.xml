<p class="p">Most composite materials studied so far have focused on natural fibers as reinforcing materials in combination with thermoplastic matrices (polypropylene, polyethylene, and vinyl polychloride), or thermo-rigid matrices (phenolic, epoxy, and polyester resins) [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-01232" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The composites made of hemp fibers with thermoplastic, heat resistant, and biodegradable matrices have shown good mechanical properties. In addition, the surface treatments applied to the hemp fibers, with the purpose of improving the bond on the interface between the fibers and the matrix, have led to considerable improvements in mechanical properties. Some mechanical properties which characterize tensile mechanical behavior, torsion, and bending the polypropylene matrix composite material and reinforced with hemp are shown in [
