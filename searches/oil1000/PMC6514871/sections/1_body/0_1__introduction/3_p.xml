<p class="p">An important aspect concerning the mechanical properties of composite materials is given by the non-uniformities that appear in the technological process of fabrication. In the case of fiber-reinforced composites the uneven distribution of the matrix-fibers represents the main factor influencing their mechanical behavior. The resin transfer, the structural reactions, and the interface effects are phenomena that can be taken into account when considering the non-uniformity degree (see [
