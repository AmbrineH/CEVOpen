<p class="p">The non-uniformities and discontinuities can be used with a view to obtaining composite materials with controlled properties. The traditional laminated composites, reinforced by fibers, are made of multiple laminae in which the fiber-reinforcing direction is constant. Property control is exercised only by modifying the layer sequence in the laminate. Reference [

Each layer in these composites is made of several pieces, each piece with its own type of fiber orientation, length, and distribution. References [

They made composite materials that had improved damage tolerance because there is a mechanism of slowing crack propagation fissure speed by decreasing the cohesion between the adjacent elements. A theory that anticipates crack initiation and propagation is studied in [
