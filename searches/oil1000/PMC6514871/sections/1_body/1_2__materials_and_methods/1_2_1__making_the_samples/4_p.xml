<p class="p">The second step consisted of making Dammar-based composite materials by reinforcing them with two types of hemp fabric. The first type of fabric, symbolized by “A” is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01232-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a, the fabric with the characteristic mass of 330 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. For this type of fabric, on a surface of 10 cm × 10 cm, we had 50 strands oriented in the direction of the tensile test (longitudinal direction) and 33 strands in transversal direction. The second type of fabric, symbolized by “B”, is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01232-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b, the characteristic mass of this fabric being 350 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. In this type of fabric, on a surface of 10 cm × 10 cm, we had 62 strands oriented in the direction of the tensile test (longitudinal direction) and 28 strands in transversal direction. The plates obtained had five layers of fabric. In the plates considered as ideal, all five layers are continuous, without interruption. To identify the studied composite materials, we use symbols made of one letter and two digits. The letter may be “A” or “B”, depending on the type of fabric used. The first digit is 0, 1, or 2 and represents the number of interrupted layers. For instance, A24 stands for composite material with a reinforcement of the type “A” fabric, with two interrupted layers and the interruption length of the layers of four centimeters.
