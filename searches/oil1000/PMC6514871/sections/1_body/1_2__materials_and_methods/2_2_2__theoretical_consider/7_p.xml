<p class="p">We have two bar types. The first type, called ideal, is made of layers that do not show property variations along the bar. In this type of bar, the volume proportion and the reinforcement orientation, for each layer, is considered to be the same in any section of the bar. The second bar type is considered to have layers where, between certain sections, the reinforcement is removed and the resin remains alone.</p>
