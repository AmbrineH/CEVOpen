<p class="p">These three factors give information on the properties of the analyzed sample material, properties that are compared to those of the reference material, which is considered ideal. The decrease in the elasticity factor shows the decrease in the modulus of elasticity and the decrease of the resistance factor shows the decrease in the tensile strength of the analyzed materials. The decrease in the roughness factor shows the presence of some areas in the material with discontinuities of the mechanical properties.</p>
