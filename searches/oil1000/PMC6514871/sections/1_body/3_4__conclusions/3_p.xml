<p class="p">It is noted that both the elastic modulus and the tensile stress decreased to increase the number of discontinued layers. Tensile strength decreases to increase the number of interrupted layers regardless of length of the interruption zone. The modules of elasticity for the specimens to the length of the discontinued zone is zero (interrupted layers have the reinforced sectioned in place), and are close to the modules of elasticity of the reference specimens that were considered ideal. For the test pieces with interrupted zone length of 20 mm or 40 mm, the modulus of elasticity decreases to increase the number of discontinued layers. In addition, the modulus of elasticity decreases to increase the length of the interrupted area. A particular trend is found for the elongation at breaking. Both for composite materials reinforced with hemp type “A” and those reinforced with hemp type “B” of the reference specimens (indicated A00 and B00) present the highest breaking elongation. Increasing the number of interrupted layers leads to a decrease of breaking elongation. However, for specimens with the same number of interrupted layers, the breaking elongation increases to increase the length of the discontinued area.</p>
