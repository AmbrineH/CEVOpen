<p class="p">We believe that the reference values of the elasticity modulus and tensile strength of the materials considered as ideal are the average values of the limits between which these sizes vary in samples with all their layers without discontinuities (see

 <xref rid="materials-12-01232-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For type-A00 samples the reference value of the elasticity modulus is 4547 MPa and the tensile strength is 56 MPa. For type-B00 samples the reference value of the elasticity modulus is 6617 MPa and the tensile strength is 75 MPa. We notice that both the elasticity modulus and the tensile strength of the composites reinforced by type “B” fabric have significantly higher values than those of the composites reinforced by type “A” fabric. This can be explained by the different number of strands oriented in the direction of the tensile test (50 for type “A” fabric and 62 for type “B” fabric). The fact that the elasticity modulus of the samples in the reference sets is in correlation with the elasticity modules of the fabrics used for reinforcing, and with the number of fibers oriented in the direction of the stress, shows that the longitudinal modulus of elasticity of the composite material is proportional to the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcing material and its volume proportion, just as in classic mixture theory.
