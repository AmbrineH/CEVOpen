<p class="p">For all the specimens, which have one or two interrupted layers, both the modulus of elasticity and the breaking resistance are proportional to the modulus of elasticity and the tensile strength of the materials considered as ideal. Thus, the ratio of the average modulus of elasticity of the A00-abbreviated specimens and the average modulus of elasticity of the B00-abbreviated specimens is 0.687. Similar values are obtained for the ratios between the modules of elasticity to the composite materials reinforced with hemp weaving “A” and the modules of elasticity to the composite materials reinforced with hemp weaving “B” (ratios are calculated between the modules of elasticity of the specimens with the same number of interrupted layers and the same length of the discontinued area). The ratio of the average breaking strength of the A00-abbreviated specimens and the average breaking strength of the B00-abbreviated specimens is 0.747. Similar values are obtained for the ratios of the tensile stress for composites reinforced with woven hemp type “A” and the tensile stress for composites reinforced with woven hemp type “B” (ratios are calculated between the modules of elasticity of the specimens with the same number of interrupted layers and the same length of the discontinued area).</p>
