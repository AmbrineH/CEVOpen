<p class="p">The presence of areas with low mechanical properties in composite materials can lead to alteration in the overall properties of the composite materials. Meanwhile, industrial finished products with variable mechanical properties can be obtained that have a mechanically controlled behavior. Specifically, materials can be obtained that should yield to certain applications, and the breakage should occur in areas particularly chosen from the design.</p>
