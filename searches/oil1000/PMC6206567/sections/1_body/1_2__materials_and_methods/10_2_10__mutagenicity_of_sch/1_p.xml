<p class="p">The micronucleus test was the parameter used to evaluate mutagenicity. For this, the cultures were used, and the method described above was performed according to the technique described by Schmid [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and presented as an index as described by Fenech [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Besides this, a chromosomal instability test was also carried out. The chromosomal instability was evaluated by the cytogenetics for Band G, a technique described by Yunis [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], which requires the addition of 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/mL colchicine to each properly treated cell culture. The addition was followed by incubation for 1 hour at 37°C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1800 rpm. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in hypotonic KCl solution and incubated at 37°C for 16 minutes. Another centrifugation was conducted, and the pellet was suspended in acetic acid/methanol (1:3) and again subjected to successive centrifugations. Finally, the pellets obtained were placed onto precleaned slides with 70% ethanol and drying was performed at room temperature. Staining was done with giemsa dye, and the slides were analyzed under a microscope at 1000x magnification.
