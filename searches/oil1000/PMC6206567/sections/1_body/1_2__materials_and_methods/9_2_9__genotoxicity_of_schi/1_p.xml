<p class="p">The genotoxicity was evaluated using a comet assay as described by Singh [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For this, previously prepared slides covered with high-melting-point agarose with a sample outlet were homogenized with low-melting-point agarose and after being dried were disposed in a vat containing lysing solution for one week. After this process, the slides were subjected to 20 min, 300 mA, 25 V electrophoresis in 300 mM NaOH buffer and pH&gt;13. Held in electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized and dried at room temperature. After drying, the slides were fixed, dried again, rehydrated, stained with silver nitrate solution, and dried at room temperature. The DNA damage was calculated from the cells with different classifications of damage; the damage index ranges from 0 (100 cells x 0, when there was no damage) to 400 (100 cells x 4, when the maximum damage occurred).
