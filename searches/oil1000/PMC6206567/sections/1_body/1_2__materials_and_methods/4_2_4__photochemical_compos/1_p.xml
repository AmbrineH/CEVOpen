<p class="p">The essential oil was subjected to separation by gas chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry (CG-MS). The analysis was performed on a model 6890N chromatograph coupled with a model 5975B mass detector, both from Agilent Technologies. Chromatographic conditions were as follows: initial oven temperature was 50°C for one minute, followed by heating at 50°C/min to 300°C, keeping this temperature for 9 minutes, for a total of 60 minutes. Separation was achieved on a DB-5MS column (30 m x 320

Identification of components was done based on the retention index (RI), determined by the homologous series of n-alkanes, C7-C30 under similar experimental conditions, compared with the search mass spectra libraries (NIST and WILEY) and mass spectra data in the literature [
