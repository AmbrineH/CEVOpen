<p class="p">In the evaluation of DNA damage, only LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">50/10</sub> showed significant damage to the macrophages compared to the NC group, representing more than 20% DNA damage each. By contrast, the EO caused no significant DNA damage at any of the concentrations tested in the lymphocytes culture; in the same way it did not change the frequency of micronuclei, certifying that the EO concentrations tested showed no mutagenic effects in the same cells. As for the macrophages, it presented significant, concentration-dependent changes, with a higher frequency of micronuclei compared to the NC for LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LD
 <sub class="sub">50/10</sub>, and LD
 <sub class="sub">50/100</sub>. These results may be related to the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, which at concentrations of 25, 30, and 35 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>M is able to promote significant changes in the frequency of micronuclei and concentration-dependent genotoxicity in hamster cell cultures (V79-Cl3), as described in research by Catanzaro et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Türkez and Aydin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] evaluated the effect of exposure of human lymphocytes to 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (10–200 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) using mutagen parameters (micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration) and concluded that the cells did not change significantly compared to the control. As for the analysis of chromosomal instability developed in this study, the tested concentrations did not promote changes in any of the studied cells, so that they also did not cause changes in the mitotic index for either HLs or HMs compared to the NC.
