<p class="p">Cytokines are proteins, which are engaged in the communication between cells of the immune system. IL-6 is a 184-amino acid glycosylated protein, which can be synthesized and secreted by many cell types including monocytes, T-cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. IL-6 binds to a specific receptor (IL-6R), an 80 kDa. During inflammation or infection, IL-6 is secreted by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and T-cells type I transmembrane protein [

In our study, none of the concentrations tested caused alterations in the relative production of IL-6, both in lymphocytes and in macrophages. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that was originally labeled cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor due to its ability to inhibit production of TNF-

 <italic class="italic">α</italic>) is a central proinflammatory cytokine involved in various inflammatory conditions. TNF is a trimeric protein, expressed from a wide variety of cells, and exists in both soluble and membrane-associated forms [

Generated by many cell types in a variety of tissues, in mammals it acts as a vascular relaxing agent, a neurotransmitter, and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. NO plays several roles in immunity—as a toxic agent towards infectious organisms, an inducer or suppressor of apoptosis, or an immunoregulator [
