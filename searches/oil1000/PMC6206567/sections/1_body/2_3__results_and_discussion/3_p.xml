<p class="p">The determination of LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was carried out per the results found in the analysis of cell proliferation, which was evaluated by the statistical method of nonlinear regression for both types of cell studied. For this, first we made a curve with five EO concentrations in cell cultures, which were 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01
