<p class="p">Work performed by Ruffa et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], which investigated the cytotoxic effects of the methanol extract of
 <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle</italic> L. in concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL for hepatic carcinoma cell cultures, demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect and that the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the studied cells was 50 ± 7 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Thus, for the development of other tests, the concentrations to be tested were determined, based on LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> found for lymphocytes and macrophages, and these were LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LD
 <sub class="sub">50/10</sub>, LD
 <sub class="sub">50/100,</sub> LD
 <sub class="sub">50/1000,</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">50/10000</sub>.
