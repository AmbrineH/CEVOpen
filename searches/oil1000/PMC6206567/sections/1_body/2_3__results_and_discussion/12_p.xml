<p class="p">Our work is the first to evaluate these markers in these cells. We can infer that the results obtained are a cascade of effects. Oil components such as 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, which are known to have this action (REF), inflame the production of nitric oxide, which in turn inhibits the production of interleukin-10 and results in increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. By adding these actions, we have an immune response activation by the components of the oil. Our study needs to determine whether this immune activation would be beneficial (in the case of a foreign agent) or harmful to the body (in a mechanism like an autoimmune disease) [
