<p class="p">The cytotoxicity observed may be related to the presence of certain compounds in the EO, which may promote these cytotoxic effects together and/or in isolation, as described in the study by Sobral-Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], which investigated the cytotoxic effect of the compound 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene in cultures of fibroblasts at concentrations of 50 and 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. This study found a low cytotoxicity at a concentration of 50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL in fibroblast cultures. Thus, cytotoxicity could be related to the presence of certain compounds, such as, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, which is the major compound of the EO studied; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that other compounds are contributing to this effect.
