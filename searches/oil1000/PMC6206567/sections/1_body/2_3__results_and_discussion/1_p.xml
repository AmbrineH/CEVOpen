<p class="p">The yield achieved from EO extraction of
 <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle</italic> L. leaves in June/2015 was 0.364%. After determining the yield, work began assessing the phytochemical composition thereof by GC-MS, which resulted in the detection of thirty compounds (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); of these, the highest concentrations found were of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Pinene, Sabinene, Bicyclogermacrene, and Limonene, with percentage of 23.49, 11.36, 10.13, and 9.02, respectively. These four compounds together represent more than 50% of the compounds present and identified in the oil. Other studies have also identified
