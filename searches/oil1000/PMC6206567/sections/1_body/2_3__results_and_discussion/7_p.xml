<p class="p">Regarding the mitotic index, none of the doses showed effects on the cells tested at these concentrations. Our results for
 <italic class="italic"> S. molle </italic>L. are opposed to those found in the study conducted by Pawlowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] which investigated the effects of EO extracted from the leaves of
 <italic class="italic"> S. terebinthifolius</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. molle</italic> in root meristem onion and lettuce and found that the EO metaphase index was reduced. In addition, they showed that the groups treated with
 <italic class="italic"> S. terebinthifolius </italic>EO compared to the NC promoted a reduction in the mitotic index of onions and lettuce, higher than 80% and 70%, respectively. The groups treated with
 <italic class="italic"> S. molle</italic> L. had a reduced mitotic index for both onions and lettuce, obtaining around 20% and 30%, respectively.
