  <italic class="italic">Schinus molle</italic> L. is used to treat various diseases; however, the literature lacks information regarding its possible immunotoxic effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the immunotoxic effects of essential oil from leaves of
  <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle L</italic>. in cultures of human lymphocytes and macrophages. The cultures were treated with essential oil (EO) of
  <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle</italic> L. and subsequently subjected to genotoxic analysis (comet assay), mutagenic analysis (micronucleus frequency and chromosomal aberration), and cytotoxic (cell viability) and functional parameters (interleukins secretions). Our analyses have determined that the essential oil from leaves of
  <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle</italic> L. presents several compounds with 
  <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>-pinene being the major compound; in addition, the compound verbenene was firstly identified; genotoxic effects were detected only in macrophages and only at the two highest concentrations tested. An important finding is that
  <italic class="italic"> Schinus molle</italic> L. oil causes an activation of the immune system. This action has its mechanism centered by the cascade nitric oxide-interleukin-10-tumor necrosis factor alpha.
