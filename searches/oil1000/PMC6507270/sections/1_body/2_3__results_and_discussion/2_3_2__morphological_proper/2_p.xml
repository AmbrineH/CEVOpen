<p class="p">Smaller sizes are also desired to obtain quality products due to the processing without opening. For this reason, the capers have been commercially divided into 5 groups: Nonpareils (7 mm), Surfines (7/8 mm), Capuchins (8/9 mm), Capotes (9/11), Seconds (11/12), and Hors calibers (≥ 13) [

In this study, we have found that the very small seeds account for more than 60% of the total capers collected (SAFI region) and 29%, 29%, 18%, 16%, 6%, and 2% of Nonpareils, surfing, Capuchins, Capotes, Seconds and Hors calibers, respectively (

 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> studied by Özcan et al. (2004) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] included 10.34 mm for length, 9.21 mm for diameter, and 0.925 mm for sphericity and those published by Ulukapi et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] were 9.19 mm for length, 7.51 mm for width, 9.78 mm for thickness, 8.74 mm for geometric mean diameter, and 0.9 mm for surface area. In this study, it has been seen that dimensional properties of Moroccan

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
