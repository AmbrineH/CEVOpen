 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> displays the different morphological parameters studied. The variance analysis of the parameters, length, width, thickness, weight, geometric mean diameter, sphericity, and surface area, showed a significant difference between the two populations. Generally, the mean size of 100 beads from the two regions varies between 8.65 mm and 7.97 mm, 6.03 mm, 7.44 mm, 0.87 mm, and 1.84 cm for length, width, thickness, geometric mean diameter, sphericity, and surface area, respectively, and 7.89 mm length, 7.44 mm width, 5.34 mm thicknesses, 6.77 mm geometric mean diameter, 0.86 mm sphericity, and 1.51 cm surface area. The width/length of seeds increases in parallel with the size. Our results also exhibited a crucial difference in weight and the population with the highest weight was FEZ (13.7 g). The low weight of the seeds results from small dimensions.
