<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> protein contents</italic> of three different sizes are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. The protein content varies between 23.1 and 29.8 % on a dry weight basis (DW %). In general, the highest crude protein has been found in small seeds and it is higher in Fez's
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seeds. These results were consistent with those published by Tlili et al. (2011) [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and Giuffrida et al. (2002) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. While we found higher protein content than Turkish capers (22%) studied by Akgul and Ã–zcan (1999) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], we found a significant difference between populations. This difference was probably due to geographic distribution, which is in agreement with other studies [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
