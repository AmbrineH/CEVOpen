<p class="p">The results in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> show the some chemical values of three different sizes of
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seeds from two different locations in Morocco (FEZ and SAFI region). Water (76.8 - 81.6%), crude oil (2.7 - 3.4%), and reducing sugar (4.87 - 6.45%) values have been augmented by the size of
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> seeds. These outcomes were in agreement with the study published by Özcan et al. (2004) and Arslan et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] who reported that crude protein decreased in size and water and crude oil and reducing sugars have been increased in size of caper. Also the values found in our study were significantly higher than the values reported by Özcan et al. (2004) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], except for water. Additionally, our results were also in agreement with the study published by Sessiz et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] who reported that length, width, thickness, geometric mean diameter, and sphericity of seeds have been increased linearly with the increase in moisture. In the study conducted by Ulukapi et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] who worked on biochemical and dimensional properties of naturally grown
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa, </italic>they found that
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa seeds </italic>were rich in glucose (8113.42 mg/Kg), saccharose (14546.0 mg/Kg), and fructose (3653.07 mg/Kg), which encourages its use for animal feeding.
