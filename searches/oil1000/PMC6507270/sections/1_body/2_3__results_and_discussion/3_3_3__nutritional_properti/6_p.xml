<p class="p">As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the content of total carotenoids of
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seed ranged between 6.26 and 11.63 (FEZ) and between 8.64 and 11.13mg/100 g (SAFI). Results displayed that big seeds contained more of total carotenoids than the smaller size, which is in agreement with the study reported by Özcan and Akgul (1998) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. These results demonstrate that seeds of
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> contained significant concentrations of carotenoids (6.96 - 17.5 mg/Kg). Similar findings have also been published by Tlili et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] who reported that the total carotenoid constituents of leaves and flower buds from Tunisian
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> ranged between 18.52 and 4.83 mg/100 g FW, respectively. These authors reported a high content of lutein (ca. 8 and 2.2 mg/100 g, for leaves and seeds, resp.) and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-carotene (ca. 5 and 1.1 mg/100 g, for leaves and seeds, resp.).
