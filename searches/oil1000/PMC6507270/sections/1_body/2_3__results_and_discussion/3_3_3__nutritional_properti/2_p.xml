<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> lipid content</italic> determined in our study varies between 2.7 and 3.4 %. This value was not affected by location, but the highest crude lipid was found in big seeds. These outcomes are lower than that found by Tlili et al. (2009, 2010) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], while they were higher than those published by Özcan and Akgul (1998) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and Özcan et al. (2004) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] who reported that the Turkish capers (
 <italic class="italic">Capparis spinosa</italic>) contained 1.65 and 1.35 ± 0.04% of crude oil, respectively. These differences could be due to geographic distribution, soil, climatic conditions of an area, and size of seeds or/and using different analysis methods [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In another study carried out by Mattus and Özcan (2005) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], the composition of fatty acids, tocopherols, and sterols of
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> oil seeds has been characterized. These authors clarified that the oil contains linoleic acid as the major fatty acid accompanied by oleic acid (24.6-50.5%) and its isomer vaccenic acid (10 and 30%). The seed oils were also rich in tocopherols with the following composition: 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-tocopherol, 124.3-1944.9 mg/100 g; 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherol, 2.7-269.5 mg/100 g; and R-tocopherol, 0.6-13.8 mg/100 g. In line with this, several studies [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], have indicated that
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> oil has also rich amount of minerals (Ca, B, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Fe, and Zn).
