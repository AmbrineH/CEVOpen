<p class="p">To our knowledge, no detailed studies concerning physical and chemical properties of Moroccan
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> seeds have been performed; therefore knowledge of these physical properties is very important for industries that provide essential engineering data. Additionally, the size, shape, and physical dimensions of seeds are crucial in sizing, sorting, and separation. For this reason, the aim of this study is to determine and compare the morphological and biochemical (lipids, proteins, and carotenoids) properties of raw
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> seeds (capers) collected from two regions in Morocco (FEZ and SAFI) and having different seed sizes in order to provide new basic data on the composition of Moroccan caper. Moreover, preliminary morphological and anatomical characterizations of leaves and stems have been determined.
