<p class="p">In this study, both morphological properties and nutritional values of Moroccan
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seeds naturally grown in Morocco Mediterranean climate have been investigated. In this case, results show an important level of protein (ca. 27%) in
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seed and high total lipid content (ca. 3.3%). In addition, reducing sugars and crude protein content of small bud size have been found to be higher than those in other sizes; however, crude oil, carotenoids, and water were higher in big seeds. Moreover,
 <italic class="italic"> C. spinosa</italic> seeds are a crucial source of carotenoids. In conclusion, the morphological properties and chemical compositions of capers have been affected by size and location.
