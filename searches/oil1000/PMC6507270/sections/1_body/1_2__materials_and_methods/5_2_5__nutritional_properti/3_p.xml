Shortly, 0.5g of caper has been extracted by the alkaline solution containing 50 mmol Trisâ€“HCl, 200 mmol NaCl, SDS, pH 8.5, and centrifuged (14,000g for 15 min). 4 ml of Biuret reagent has been added to 1ml of protein extract. The absorbance has been measured at 540 nm. BSA has been used as the standard for the calibration curve (0 to 1g/l). Finally, the rest of the biochemical properties of seeds have been analyzed according to AOAC (1984) [
