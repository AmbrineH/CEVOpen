<p class="p">The sample has been ground and then extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type apparatus: the extraction lasted 5h30â€² by placing 200 g of dry leaves in a flask with distilled water and then heating; the vapors are condensed in a condenser and the oils are separated from water by difference in density. The yield is defined as the ratio between the mass of the essential oil obtained and the mass of plant material to be treated.</p>
