<p class="p">Three caper plants have been chosen from each region. To add, samples of 90 leaves and 9 stems distributed over the three selected plants (30 leaves and 3 stems per plant) have been taken for the characterization of each region. Thus, four characters have been described and divided into classes: shape and color of the leaf, shape and color of the stems, and shape and color of the spines. Also, four other quantitative traits have been measured: length and width of the leaf, petiole length, and number of ribs leaves.</p>
