<p class="p">For anatomical studies, fresh samples of stems have been cross-sectioned by hand. In addition, the slide preparations have been stained independently with green carmine-iodine and then observed under a petrographic microscope (Olympus BX40). Microphotographs have been taken using a digital camera (Ikegami) focused through the microscope eyepiece.</p>
