 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> seeds have been manually cleaned to remove all foreign and broken seeds. In order to determine the physical properties of
 <italic class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</italic> seeds, the length, width, and thickness of 100 random seeds (capers) have been measured using a micrometer with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. The mass of 100 seeds has been weighed by a precision numerical balance.
