 <p class="p">Considering the nutraceutical properties, the high commercial value from pigments and essential lipids and the environmental sustainability, the purposes of this study were to assess the major carotenoids and fatty acids composition of nine microalgae species as a source of nutraceutical compounds and as fatty raw material for biodiesel production. The carotenoid and fatty acid content were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection method with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode (HPLC/APCI-MS/MS) and by high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). For the carotenoid analysis, the developed method presented a rapid response, a good chromatographic separation, higher sensitivity and can provides more compounds information due the mass spectrum. Among the microalgae evaluated, 
  <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus protuberans</italic> (10.3 mg g
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), 
  <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus denticulatus</italic> var. 
  <italic class="italic">linearis</italic> (8.43 mg g
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and 
  <italic class="italic">Chlamydomonas planctogloea</italic> (7.4 mg g
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) are good lutein sources. 
  <italic class="italic">Coelastrum sphaericum</italic> (15.29 mg g
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and 
  <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic> (22.96 mg g
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) showed high astaxanthin content; the others microalgae species presents low carotenoid content. In addition, 
  <italic class="italic">Chlorella zofingiensis</italic> provides high quantities of Î³-linolenic acid (4.3%). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were lower than 1.1 %. Regarding for biodiesel production, the promising strains are 
  <italic class="italic">Coelastrum sphaericum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic>.
