<p id="p0180" class="p">The MS/MS-APCI detector is rapid and sensitive detector to determine and differentiate carotenoids, as well as has high specificity, due the mass spectrum obtained from the chromatographic peaks, which allows the elucidation of compound structure, even for peaks that co-elute. Among the evaluated microalgae species, for pigment production,

 <italic class="italic">linearis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Chlamydomonas planctogloea</italic> are good sources for lutein and

 <italic class="italic">Chlorella zofingiensis</italic> provides high levels of Î³-linolenic. According to their fatty acids profiles and aiming at biodiesel production, the microalgae 
 <italic class="italic">Coelastrum sphaericum</italic> and
