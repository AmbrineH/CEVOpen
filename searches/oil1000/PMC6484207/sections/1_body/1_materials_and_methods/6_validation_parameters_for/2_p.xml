<p id="p0065" class="p">The calibration curves were prepared based on internal standardization method using apocarotenal as internal standard (IS) at 10 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in methanol. For lutein, astaxanthin, α-carotene and cryptoxanthin the curves were prepared at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; canthaxanthin with the concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 μg mL

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; and for β-carotene with the of concentrations of 5; 10; 20; 40; 60; 80 and 100 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Each standard solution was injected in triplicate, and the mean peak area for each concentration was used. The standard curves were prepared by plotting concentration ratio (standard versus internal standard) against its area ratio. The regression equation and correlation coefficient (
