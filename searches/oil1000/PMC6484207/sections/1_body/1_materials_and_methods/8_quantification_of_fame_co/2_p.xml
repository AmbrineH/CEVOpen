 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares et al. (2014)</xref>. The organic phase (upper) containing the FAME was collected and analyzed using gas chromatography. The chromatographic analysis of the FAME composition used an Agilent 7890 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a split/splitless injector, using a DB-WAX capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The oven was operated with an initial temperature of 70 °C, heated at 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> until 240 °C, remaining at this temperature for 13 min, and then heated 5 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 250 °C. The injector temperature was maintained at 310 °C with an injection volume of 2 μL, in the split mode, with a split ratio of 10:1. The detector temperature was kept at 310 °C. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a linear velocity of 42 cm s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and nitrogen was used as the auxiliary make-up gas at 20 mL min

The FAME were identified by direct comparison with oil samples of known composition (soybean, canola, and crambe) through the injection of FAME reference standards (Nu-ChekPrep®, code 17A and 19A) and analyses via high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS), as described in previous paper by
