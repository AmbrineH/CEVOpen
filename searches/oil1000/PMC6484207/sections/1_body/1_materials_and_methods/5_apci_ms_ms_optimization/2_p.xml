<p id="p0060" class="p">Each methanolic analyte solution (10 ppb) in a mixture with eluent A-methanol/acetonitrile/water (84:14:2, v/v/v) was injected under direct infusion with a syringe pump coupled a T part to HPLC pump and the APCI source, in order to: (i) confirm the presence of the molecular ion; (ii) determine the predominant fragments formed in Q1 and (iii) optimized the compound-dependent parameters. The APCI source was operated in positive and negative mode and the optimal values (fragmentation and signal intensity) was selected to optimize the compound fragmentation and mass spectrometry conditions (CAD, CUR, NC, EP and temperature - item 2.2). The syringe pump flow rate was 10 μL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and for quaternary HPLC pump was 200 μL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The mass spectrum for each carotenoid was obtained in Q1 MS scan type (1000 Da s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) with cycle of 10. Next, the declustering potential (DP), collision energy (CE) and collision cell exit potential (CXP) for each transition Q1-Q3 of each standard carotenoid solution was optimized. For the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was used a dwell time of 150. The most abundant transition was selected for quantification and the others for the compounds identification.
