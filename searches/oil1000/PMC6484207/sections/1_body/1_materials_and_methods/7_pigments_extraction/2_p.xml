 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares et al. (2016)</xref>. Approximately 500 mg of microalgae biomass was weighted in an erlenmeyer flask and 10.0 mL of the hexane:ethanol mixture (1:1) were added. This mixture was left in ultrasonic bath for 40 minutes at room temperature (23°C ± 2 °C). After that, 7.5 mL of Na

The upper phase, rich in carotenoids, was collected and saved in a round-bottom flask. This procedure was repeated for four times with the residue within erlenmeyer, totaling five extractions. The combined upper phases were evaporated in a rotatory evaporator (Quimis - Q344b2, Diadema, Brasil). The extracted was dissolved in 2.0 mL of methanol and filtered in a PTFE sterile membrane for HPLC analysis.
