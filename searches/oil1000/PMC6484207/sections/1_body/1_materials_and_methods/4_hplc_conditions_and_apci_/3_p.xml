<p id="p0050" class="p">For detection and quantification, the following APCI conditions were applied: (i) ion source temperature - 450 °C; (ii) curtain gas (CUR) - 20; (iii) nitrogen - 20 psi; (iv) collision gas (CAD) - high; (v) nebulizer current (NC) - 4 μA; (vi) entrance potential (EP) - 10; (vii) ion source gas (GS1) - 45 L mim
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; (viii) channel electron multiplier (CEM) - 2100. The selected ions were monitored by MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) with a dwell time of 150 ms for each Q1-Q3 transitions.
