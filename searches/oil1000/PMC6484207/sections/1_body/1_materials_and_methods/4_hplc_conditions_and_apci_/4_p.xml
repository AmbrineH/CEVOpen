<p id="p0055" class="p">After several trial studies, a mobile phase system of methanol/acetonitrile/water (84:14:2, v/v/v) (A) and dichloromethane (B) was found appropriate with the gradient conditions being 100% A and 0% B for 11 min, decreased to 95% A in 18 min, 90% A in 21 min, 85% A in 24 min, 80% A in 27 min, 75% A in 35 min, 50% A in 40 min, 75% A in 41 min, returned to 100% A in 43 min and maintained for 7 min. The total analysis was 50 min. The injection volume was 20 μL, the column temperature controller was set at 40 °C and the flow rate of 1 mL min
