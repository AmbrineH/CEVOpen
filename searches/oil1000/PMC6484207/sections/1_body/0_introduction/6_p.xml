<p id="p0030" class="p">The present work aimed to identify and quantify the major carotenoids in nine microalgae species by an analytical method using mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode (APCI-MS/MS). Also, determine the FAME composition by gas chromatography and to predict the potential species as a source of essential fatty acids and as a feedstock for the production biodiesel.</p>
