<p id="p0020" class="p">The most important pigments from a commercial and medicinal standpoint are the carotenoids. They are divided into two groups: (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) carotenes, which are molecules that have only hydrogen and carbon in their chemical structure, and (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) xanthophylls, which are carotenes oxidized by the presence of oxygen. Both carotenes and xanthophylls can be found in their free form or esterified to fatty acids (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Amorim-Carrilho et al., 2014</xref>). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of carotenoids is difficult and challenging due to their instability in the presence of light, heat, acids, and oxygen, as well as their similar structures. Such compounds are susceptible to oxidation reactions, isomerization, cyclization, hydrogenation, among others, which leads to their structure modification (
