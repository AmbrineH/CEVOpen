<p id="p0130" class="p">The intra- and inter-day precision for each analyte was determined according to Eqs. 
 <xref rid="fd3" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(3) and (4)</xref>, and are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The inter-day precision was evaluated on three different days, and the repeatability by five same day injections. For the tandem MS detector, the inter-day precision was higher than intra-day for α-carotene, fucoxanthin, and lutein. According to 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anvisa (2002)</xref>, the RSD parameters cannot be higher than 5%, while 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AOAC (2012)</xref> determines the RSD acceptability as a function of the analyte concentration level. Hence, for an analyte in a concentration ranging from 1 ppm to 10 ppm, a RSD between 11% and 7.3% is acceptable. For concentrations between 10 ppm and 100 ppm, the maximum accepted value is between 7.3% and 5.3%, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taverniers et al., 2004</xref>). The RSD values found for the carotenoids are lower than the limits specified by the two parameters (ANVISA and AOAC). Therefore, the RSD value obtained for intra- and inter-day guarantees the precision of the quantification method for α-carotene, astaxanthin, β-carotene, canthaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, fucoxanthin, and lutein.
