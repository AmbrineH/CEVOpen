<p id="p0120" class="p">For MS/MS detector, the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> astaxanthin and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> canthaxanthin peaks are overlapping at 15.62 min; however, they could be differentiated using the mass spectrum extracted from this peak. It is possible to identify two peaks with different spectrums, one in 15.62 min characteristic of astaxanthin and another in 15.9 min of canthaxanthin. When the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> canthaxanthin peak was extracted at retention time of 23 min, three more peaks were shown in small amount, with retention time of 15.9, 17.85, 25.98 min. These three little peaks, presenting the characteristic ions fragments identified of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> canthaxanthin as well as the same Q1/Q3 transitions, indicate the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> isomer forms of canthaxanthin and one 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> compound overlapping with 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> astaxanthin peak. The mass spectrometry selectivity is higher for multi-compound analysis, especially when using the MRM mode, even for analytes that co-elute (
