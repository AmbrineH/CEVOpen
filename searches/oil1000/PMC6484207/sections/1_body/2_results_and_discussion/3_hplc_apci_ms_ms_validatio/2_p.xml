<p id="p0115" class="p">The chromatography separation by HPLC/APCI-MS/MS demonstrated that the techniques can be used to identify and quantify carotenoids, due to excellent response for each component, with well separated chromatographic peaks, which indicated a strong selectivity of the carotenoids. In addition, the chromatographic conditions ensure good specificity, as each pigment identification was not affected by the presence of the other compounds, because a small amount of cis compounds can be reliably detected.</p>
