<p id="p0170" class="p">Considering the environmental sustainability, like biodiesel production, taking account that European legislation (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Committee, 2008</xref>) establishes a maximum of 12% for linoleic acid and 1% for polyunsaturated acids (PUFA) (EN 14214). In addition to linolenic acid, γ-linolenic acid (C16:3 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> 6,9,12), C16:3 and C17:3 may also be present in microalgae species (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menezes et al., 2016</xref>). Since these are similar to linolenic acid, they need to be taken into consideration. The 12% limit should include the sum of the levels of tri-unsaturated fatty acids rather than linolenic acid levels alone. 
 <italic class="italic">C. sphaericum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> have PUFA levels of 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively, also, TUFA levels of 10.1% and 12.0%, respectively, which gives these microalgae a fatty acid composition similar to that accepted by the European community. Also, these species presented a considerable amount of MUFA, 38.4% and 46.1%, respectively. To improve fatty acid composition, studies modifying culture conditions to reduce polyunsaturated acid content should be conducted.
