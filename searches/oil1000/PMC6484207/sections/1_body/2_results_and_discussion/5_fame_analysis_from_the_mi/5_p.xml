<p id="p0175" class="p">Of the nine microalgae studied, 
 <italic class="italic">E. fottii</italic> has demonstrated biodiesel production potential, with 0.3% of PUFA content. However, there is still a need to induce a reduction in the TUFA yield. This microalga showed the highest C16:3 content. Unlike, 
 <italic class="italic">C. planctogloea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. zofingiensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. bibraianum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">D. protuberans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D. denticulatus</italic> are composed with PUFA yield higher than 7.4% of its total fatty acids. Analysis shows a high concentration of C16:4 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> 6,9,12,15 and C18:4 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> 6,9,12,15 was also found. These microalgae strains are not a suitable for biodiesel production.
