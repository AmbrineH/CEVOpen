The chromatographic conditions that were established made it possible to highlight and separate fatty acid methyl esters with 14–24 carbon atoms such as those found in vegetable oils and animal fats in analyses lasting up to 30 minutes. However, the fatty acid content of conventional vegetable oils and animal fats, and even of microalgae of the same class varies qualitatively and quantitatively (
