 <italic class="italic">Parachlorella kessleri</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Coelastrum sphaericum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella zofingiensis</italic> are a natural source of astaxanthin. Although the astaxanthin is predominantly in the ester form, 
 <italic class="italic">C. sphaericum</italic> presents astaxanthin in free form, which, based on the weight of lyophilized biomass, corresponds to 6.47 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The commercial microalgae 
 <italic class="italic">Haematococcus pluvialis</italic>, which is the main source used to produce astaxanthin, exhibits 5% of free astaxanthin (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ranga et al., 2009</xref>). The ester form was confirmed by the presence of the protonated molecular ion for the fatty acid palmitic (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 257.2) and oleic (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 283.1) in the mass spectrum. The highest yield of astaxanthin was from the microalga 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic>, almost 23 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Considering only the astaxanthin and lutein production based on the weight of biomass, the astaxanthin yield is around 16 times higher than lutein; however, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Minhas et al. (2016)</xref> mentioned that astaxanthin productivity per day of 
 <italic class="italic">P. kessleri</italic> is about two times higher than lutein productivity. The astaxanthin content in 
 <italic class="italic">C. zofingiensis</italic> showed 5.65 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> per biomass, similar to that reported by 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pelah et al. (2004)</xref>, who mentioned that the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zofingiensis</italic> under stress conditions may accumulate 70% of astaxanthin and 30% of canthaxanthin and that the estimated ratio between canthaxanthin and astaxanthin content was 0.558. Here, this ratio was 0.032, because the microalga was cultivated under low light irradiance and low salinity content. Compared with shrimp samples, raw and cooked shrimp present astaxanthin content of 0.42 and 0.664 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sanches-Silva et al., 2013</xref>). In eggs of rainbow trout species, the astaxanthin content was 0.17 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tzanova et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the microalgae studied in this work are promising astaxanthin sources.
