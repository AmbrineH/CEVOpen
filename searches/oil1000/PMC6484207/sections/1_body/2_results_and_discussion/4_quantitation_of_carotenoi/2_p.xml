<p id="p0140" class="p">Microalgae are a good source of bioactive compounds with anti-oxidant potential, such as carotenoids, that work as pharmacological molecules within therapeutic treatment/prevention of diseases (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Suleria et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, new species of microalgae have been investigated as a natural source of medicinal substances. This study evaluated the carotenoid composition of nine microalgae. The calibration curves from MS-MS/APCI were used to quantify the carotenoids in microalgae (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The main sources of lutein are 
 <italic class="italic">Chlamydomonas planctogloea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus protuberans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus denticulatus</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">linearis,</italic> with lutein content in microalgae biomass of 7.4, 10.53, and 8.46 mg g

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, these microalgae can produce around 35 to 263 times more lutein. Nevertheless, no carotenoid profile was found for these microalgae species in the literature. Taking as reference the same genus 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus</italic>, in 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares et al. (2016)</xref> when the carotenoids were extracted with hexane:ethanol, the lutein yield was 17% of the total carotenoids in the microalga biomass. When the biomass saponification was carried out with potassium hydroxide followed by solvent extraction, the lutein amount was 47.4%.
