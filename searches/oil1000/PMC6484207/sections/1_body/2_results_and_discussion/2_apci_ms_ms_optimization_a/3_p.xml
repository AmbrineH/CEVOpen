<p id="p0095" class="p">During the analysis, the MS/MS parameters for CUR, CAD, NC, and EP barely alter the protonated molecular ion signal intensity, thus the values were 20, high, 4 μA, and 10, respectively. The source temperature ranged from 400 to 450 °C; however, most carotenoids presented better signal intensity at 450 °C, and this value was used for all analyzes. The resulting transitions (Q1-Q3) per analyte and respective settings optimized to the parameters of DP, CE, and CXP are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes were carried out in MRM mode, by monitoring the m/z transitions to the precursor ion. The most intense signal was used for the quantification and the less intense transitions for the compound confirmation.
