<p id="p0105" class="p">Next, the effect of column temperature was studied at 10, 20, and 40 °C. The maximum column temperature recommended by the manufacturer is 40 °C, and this showed better separation efficiency for the investigated carotenoids. On the other hand, the best carotenoid separation obtained by 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huck et al. (2000)</xref> with a Phenomenex C18 column (250 × 2 mm, 5 μm) in isocratic gradient was at a temperature of 21 °C. In these column and gradient conditions, at temperatures higher than 34 °C, the zeaxanthin and lutein were not easily separated.
