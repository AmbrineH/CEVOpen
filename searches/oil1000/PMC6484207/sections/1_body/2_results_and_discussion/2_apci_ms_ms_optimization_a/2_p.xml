<p id="p0090" class="p">To investigate the MS/MS performance with APCI ionization source for detection and quantification of carotenoids, preliminary studies were done using the direct infusion method of the system by injecting each standard solution in a full scan acquisition, in both positive and negative modes. The data showed that the signal output in positive mode analyses was better than negative mode. Additionally, low in-source fragmentation was observed in negative mode, compared with their corresponding spectra in positive mode. Thus, the subsequent MS/MS experiment and compound parameters were optimized in positive mode. The mass spectra in the positive mode from the carotenoids are demonstrated on Supplementary Material.</p>
