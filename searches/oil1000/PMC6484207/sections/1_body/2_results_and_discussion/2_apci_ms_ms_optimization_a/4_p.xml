<p id="p0100" class="p">After the MRM mode optimization via infusion, the chromatographic separation condition was adjusted. The chromatographic separation was developed using a standard carotenoid mixture and comparing the separation for the substances studied. Initially a gradient solvent system of methanol/acetonitrile/water (84:14:2, v/v/v) and methylene chloride developed by 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares etÂ al. (2016)</xref> was used to separate the carotenoid mixture using a C30 column. For this, four different flow rates were evaluated (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 ml min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The peak chromatographic separation and the analysis time were influenced by the flow rate. Using a low flow rate, the peak separation was impaired and the time analysis was longer; the peaks resolutions were also affected. For further separation, a flow rate of 1.0 ml min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was used.
