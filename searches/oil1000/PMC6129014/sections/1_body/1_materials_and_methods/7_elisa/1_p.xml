<p class="p">The production of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and CCL-5 was determined by ELISA. Briefly, RAW264.7 macrophages were seeded in 24-well culture plates at 1×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well. After a 24 h cultivation, the cells were treated with DCEO at various concentrations for 1 h and then supplemented with or without LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Cell-free supernatants were collected for determination of cytokine and chemokine concentrations according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Four replicate wells were used in this experiment.
