<p class="p">The effect of DCEO on the viability of RAW264.7 cells was determined using the MTT assay. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5×10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well. After a 24 h cultivation, DCEO was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h, and then, the cells were treated with or without LPS (100 ng/mL dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) for 24 h. Next, 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Then, 100 μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the MTT–formazan crystal. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Cell viability in the control group (cells were not treated by DCEO or LPS) was set as 100%. Six replicate wells were used in this experiment.
