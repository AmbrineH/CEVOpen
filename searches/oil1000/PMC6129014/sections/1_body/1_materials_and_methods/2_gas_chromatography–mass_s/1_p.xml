<p class="p">DCEO was analyzed using GC–MS (model QP 2010; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent J&amp;W Scientific) was used; the column flow rate was 1 mL/min, injector temperature was 240°C, and detector temperature was 230°C under operating conditions. Oven temperature program was set as follows: temperature was maintained at 60°C for 1 min; then consecutively ramped to 140°C at 4°C/min, from 140°C to 200°C at 2.5°C/min and from 200°C to 280°C at 8°C/min; and maintained at a constant temperature for 5 min. In all, 1 μL (2 mg of DCEO in 1 mL of methanol) was then injected. Identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their mass spectra with the NIST 147 Library GC–MS system. The relative concentration of each compound in DCEO was quantified based on the peak area integrated by the analysis program.</p>
