<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 60-mm-diameter culture dishes (4×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) for 24 h and treated with DCEO at various concentrations. LPS (100 ng/mL) was added 1 h after DCEO treatment, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 6 h. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and reverse-transcripted with oligo-dT using the Prime-Script™ RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was carried out by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of SYBR Green using the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (iNOS primers: forward AGCAACTACTGCT GGTGGTG and reverse TCTTCAGAGTCTGCCCATTG, COX-2 primers: forward CTGGAACATGGACTCACTCAGTTTG and reverse AGGCCTTTGCCACTGCTTGT, IL-6 primers: forward AGTCCGGAGAGGAGACTTCA and reverse ATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGAG, IL-1β primers: forward GAAGAAGAGCCCATCCTCTG and reverse TCATCTCGGAGCCTGTAGTG, TNF-α primers: forward ATGAGAAGTTCCCAAATGGC and reverse CTCCACTTGGTGGTTTGCTA, CCL-5 primers: forward CATATGGCTCGGACACCA and reverse ACACACTTGGCGGTTCCT, MCP-1 primers: forward AATGCTAACGCCACCGAGAG and reverse CCTTGTTCTGCTCCTCATAGTCC, MIP-1α primers: forward CCCAGCCAGGTGTCATTTTCC and reverse GCATTCAGTTCCAGGTCAGTG, and GAPDHprimers: forward GGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTACC and reverse TGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC). Each sample was amplified in triplicate for quantification. Data were analyzed by relative quantification using the ΔΔ
