<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells were directly cultured on chamber slides (Cat. 177399; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 24 h to detect NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization by immunofluorescence assays using a fluorescence microscope. Briefly, after a 60 min stimulation with LPS in the presence or absence of DCEO, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X for 30 min at 37°C and followed by 10 min at room temperature. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody anti-NF-κB/p65 overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS for three times, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody, the nuclei were stained with DAPI, and fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>
