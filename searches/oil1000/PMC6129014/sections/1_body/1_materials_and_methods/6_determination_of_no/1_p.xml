<p class="p">Nitrite (NO

 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) levels, an index of cellular NO production, in culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells were determined using a modified Griess reagent as described previously.
 <xref rid="b25-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> Briefly, cells were seeded at 1×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL in 24-well culture plates. After a 24 h cultivation, these cells were treated with DCEO at various concentrations for 1 h and then at the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured with a NaNO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> standard curve, and nitrite production was determined. Four replicate wells were used in this experiment.
