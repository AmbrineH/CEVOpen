<p class="p">Cell lysates were prepared as previously described.
 <xref rid="b26-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 60-mm-diameter culture dishes (4×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) for 24 h and treated with DCEO at various concentrations. LPS (100 ng/mL) was added 1 h after DCEO pretreatment, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 or 60 min. The cells were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris–HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.35% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA of pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupetin, and 10 μg/mL pepstatin A. The supernatant was collected after the cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>/min for 15 min at 4°C. The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). Equal amount of protein sample (30 μg) was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample loading buffer and denatured for 10 min at 95°C. Subsequently, the samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 80 V for 3 h at 4°C. Membranes were probed with indicated primary antibodies over night at 4°C and were then blotted with respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. The specific proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instruction, and the blots were analyzed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD, USA).
