<p class="p">Inflammation is a defense mechanism that occurs as a result of exposure of tissues and organs to harmful stimuli such as microbial pathogens, irritants, or toxic cellular components.
 <xref rid="b1-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref> Chronic inflammation may induce various diseases, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.
 <xref rid="b2-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> These diseases impose a considerable economic burden on the society and shorten the average life expectancy of patients.
 <xref rid="b3-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> Macrophages release inflammatory mediators in response to harmful stimuli, playing a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases.
 <xref rid="b4-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major structural component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent activator of macrophages.
 <xref rid="b5-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref> Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its downstream signaling pathways involving interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), IRAK/activator protein-1 (AP-1) and TRIF/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) are activated in LPS-exposed macrophages,
 <xref rid="b6-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> leading to the production of inflammatory mediators (eg, nitric oxide [NO], interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α], and interleukin-1β [IL-1β]) regulated by these pathways.

 <xref rid="b8-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref> These inflammatory mediators will further activate macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, initiating cellular injury and tissue damage.
