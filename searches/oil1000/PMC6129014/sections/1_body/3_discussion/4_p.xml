<p class="p">TLR4 is the primary recognition molecule for inflammatory responses initiated by LPS.
 <xref rid="b51-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref> After ligation with LPS, TLR4 recruits intracellular adapters including MyD88, an adaptor recruits IRAK4, thereby allowing the phosphorylation and degradation of IRAK1.
 <xref rid="b29-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref> This leads to the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and induces the activation of TAK1, which in turn phosphorylates the IKK complex (including IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ).
 <xref rid="b52-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref> The activated IKK complex then phosphorylates IκB, which leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
 <xref rid="b53-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="b54-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref> Removal of IκBs liberates NF-κB for nuclear translocation and binding to cognate DNA binding sites to regulate the transcription of a number of genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, and stress response proteins.
 <xref rid="b55-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref> Our results show that DCEO treatment inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. We also found that the phosphorylation levels of IκBα and IKKα/β were decreased by DCEO treatment, indicating DCEO inhibits IKKα/β/IκBα/NF-κB signaling. IRAK4, IRAK1, and TAK1 take part in the activation of IKKs and MAPKs.
 <xref rid="b56-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref> We found that the level of phosphorylated TAK1 was downregulated by DCEO treatment. We also found that DCEO treatment obviously reduces LPS-mediated degradation of IRAK1 and IRAK4, indicating an inhibitory effect of DCEO on IRAK/TAK1 signaling.
