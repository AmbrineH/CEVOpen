<p class="p">Other than NF-κB, the AP-1 complex (composed of c-Fos and c-Jun subunits) also plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of genes that encode inflammatory mediators.

 <xref rid="b61-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref> MAPKs regulate the transcriptional activity and half-life of AP-1.
 <xref rid="b62-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref> Therefore, we also investigated the effect of DCEO on MAPKs and AP-1 activities. Results showed that the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) and AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) was suppressed by DCEO treatment, indicating that DCEO inhibits the MAPKs/NF-κB and MAPKs/AP-1 signaling pathways.
