<p class="p">PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt appear to be important components of LPS-induced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
 <xref rid="b57-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref> Upon exposure to LPS, PI3K interacts with TRAF6 and actives the downstream target Akt.
 <xref rid="b58-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref> The activated Akt phosphorylates IKKα, leading to IκB degradation and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and resulting in specific cytokine gene expression.
 <xref rid="b59-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref> Consistent with a previous report,
 <xref rid="b57-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref> our study indicates that the phosphorylated PI3K subunit p85 and Akt (Ser473) are markedly elevated following LPS stimulation. DCEO treatment suppresses the phosphorylation of p85 and Akt in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that DCEO inhibits LPS-triggered PI3K/Akt signaling, which may, at least partially, contribute to the suppressive effect of DCEO on NF-κB signaling.
