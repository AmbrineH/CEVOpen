<p class="p">In the present study, 27 compounds were identified in DCEO using the GC–MS analysis. The main constituents of DCEO, such as benzaldehyde, α-terpineol, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid and oleic acid, have been reported to possess strong anti-inflammatory effects.

 <xref rid="b37-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid inhibits the activity of phospholipase A2 to control inflammation.
 <xref rid="b34-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref> α-Terpineol reduces IL-6 formation through binding to the IL-6 receptor and subsequent internalization of the entire ligand–receptor complex.
 <xref rid="b35-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref> Benzaldehyde exhibits anti-asthmatic effect via downregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
 <xref rid="b36-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref> Oleic acid exerts anti-arthritic effect by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration.
 <xref rid="b37-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref> These reports imply that the inflammatory mediator inhibitory effect of DCEO may be, at least in part, due to the presence of these compounds. Further studies are needed to identify active constituents inside DCEO.
