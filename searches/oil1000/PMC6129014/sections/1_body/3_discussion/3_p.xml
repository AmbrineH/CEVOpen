<p class="p">LPS-activated macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that exacerbate inflammatory responses and lead to tissue injury.
 <xref rid="b46-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref> Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including allergic asthma, infection, and rheumatoid arthritis.

 <xref rid="b49-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref> Chemokines are a family of chemoattractant molecules that have a role in neutrophil, eosinophil, and monocyte migration during acute and chronic inflammation.
 <xref rid="b50-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref> Our data indicate that DCEO treatment significantly inhibits LPS-induced release of TLR4-regulated cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α, and CCL-5) in RAW264.7 cells. Based on these data, it can be concluded that DCEO has inhibitory effect on inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
