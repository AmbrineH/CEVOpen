<p class="p">Besides MyD88-dependent pathways, the TRIF-dependent pathway also plays a role in LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages.
 <xref rid="b63-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref> LPS can also trigger TRIF signaling that activates TBK1, which in turn phosphorylates IRF3 and triggers its dimerization and nuclear translocation, leading to the expression of IFN-Î² and CCL-5.

 <xref rid="b65-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref> In our present study, DCEO treatment inhibits LPS-induced phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3. The results are in agreement with the inhibitory effect of DCEO on CCL-5 production. We then examined the effects of DCEO on the phosphorylation of TBK1 that is upstream of IRF3 and found that DCEO reduced the phosphorylation of TBK1, suggesting that DCEO inhibits TBK1/IRF3 signaling.
