<p class="p">In this study, we found that suppression of the IRAK/NF-ÎºB, IRAK/AP-1, and TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathways is associated with the inhibitory effect of DCEO on inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages (

These findings provide a pharmacological justification for the use of Dingchuan tang in managing inflammatory disorders, as Dingchuan tang is traditionally used for treating asthma, which is typically characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation.
