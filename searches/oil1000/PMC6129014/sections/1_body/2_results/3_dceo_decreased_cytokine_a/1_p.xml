<p class="p">Activation of macrophages via TLR4 signaling induces production of critical proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and chemokines (eg, MCP-1, CCL-5, and MIP-1α) that are necessary to activate inflammatory responses.
 <xref rid="b29-dddt-12-2731" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref> Therefore, these cytokines and chemokines are regarded as targets for inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Our ELISA data showed that production of TLR4-mediated cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1, CCL-5, and MIP-1α) was markedly increased upon LPS stimulation, and the increments were concentration-dependently inhibited by DCEO treatment (
