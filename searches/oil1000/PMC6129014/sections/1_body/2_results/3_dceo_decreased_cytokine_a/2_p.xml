<p class="p">We further investigate the effect of DCEO on the gene expression of the corresponding cytokines and chemokines. In line with the ELISA results, stimulation with LPS upregulated mRNA levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1, CCL-5, and MIP-1α) in RAW264.7 macrophages, and the levels of mRNA of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, CCL-5, and MIP-1α were significantly lowered by DCEO treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (
