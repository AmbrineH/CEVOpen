<p class="p">The viability of RAW264.7 cells was not significantly altered by a 24-h incubation of up to 50 μg/mL of DCEO in the presence of 100 ng/mL of LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">Figure 1A</xref>). Concentrations of DCEO of 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL were used in subsequent experiments. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">Figure 1B and C</xref>, significant increases in NO and PGE2 resulting from LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells were suppressed by DCEO treatment in a dose-dependent manner.
