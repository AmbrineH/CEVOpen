 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">Figure 1Dâ€“F</xref> showed that treatment with DCEO decreased LPS-triggered upregulation of cellular protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DCEO treatment significantly decreased the elevated levels of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA induced by LPS in a concentration-dependent manner (
