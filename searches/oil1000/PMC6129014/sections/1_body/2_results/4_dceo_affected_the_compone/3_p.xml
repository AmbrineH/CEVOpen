<p class="p">It has been reported that NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF3 are the key transcriptional factors in TLR4 signaling. Nuclear translocation of these transcription factors initiates the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory mediators and cytokines.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">Figure 6A and B</xref>, nuclear protein levels of IRF3, NF-κB heterodimer components (p65 and p50), and one of the AP-1 components (c-Jun) were markedly increased 60 min after LPS treatment. DCEO treatment inhibited the increment of nuclear IRF3, p65, p50, and c-Jun. Immunofluorescence staining of p65 confirmed the inhibitory effect of DCEO on NF-κB nuclear localization (
