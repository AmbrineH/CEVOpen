<p class="p">The above data showed that DCEO could inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines regulated by TLR4 signaling. The involvement of TLR4 signaling in the effects of DCEO was further explored in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. TLR4 signaling cascades involve MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway involves the early phase of NF-κB and AP-1 activation, which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">5B</xref>, phosphorylated PI3K subunits p85 and Akt (ser473) were remarkably elevated after LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 macrophages, while DCEO suppressed the elevation in a concentration-dependent manner. While the effects of DCEO on NF-κB and AP-1 were relatively weak, the underlying reasons will be explored in the future.
