<p class="p">We also investigated the effects of DCEO on the TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dddt-12-2731" class="xref">5</xref>, the phosphorylation levels of TBK1 and IRF3 were obviously upregulated after LPS stimulation. DCEO treatment decreased the levels of phosphorylated TBK1 and IRF3 in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting an inhibitory effect of DCEO on TBK1/IRF3 signaling.
