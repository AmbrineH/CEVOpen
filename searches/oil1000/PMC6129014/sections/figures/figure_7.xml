  <p class="p">DCEO inhibited nuclear localization of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.</p>
  <p class="p">
   <bold class="bold">Notes:</bold> Cells were treated with DCEO with indicated concentrations for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 60 min. The subcellular localization of NF-κB (p65) was detected using immunofluorescence assay, and the images were acquired using the Leica DM 2500 fluorescent microscope. Bar represents 25 μm.
