 <p> DCEO affected the molecular components of the IRAK/NF-κB, IRAK/AP-1, and TBK1/IRF3 pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Notes: Cells were treated with DCEO at the indicated concentrations for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 30 or 60 min. Total and phosphorylated forms of individual proteins were detected by Western blot ( A and B). A representative of three independent experiments is shown. Abbreviations: DCEO, Dingchuan tang essential oil; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; AP-1, activator protein-1; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; p, phosphorylated; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p38, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; IKKα/β, IκB kinase α/β; TAK1, TGF β-activated kinase 1; Akt, protein kinase B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. </p>
