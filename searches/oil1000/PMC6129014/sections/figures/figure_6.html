 <p> DCEO inhibited nuclear localization of NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF3 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Notes: Cells were treated with DCEO with indicated concentrations for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 60 min. The cytoplasmic and nuclear protein levels of NF-κB (p65 and p50), c-Jun, and IRF3 were determined by Western blot ( A). Bar graphs show the relative levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear p65, p50, IRF3, and c-Jun. Data are the mean SEM of three independent experiments. ** P&lt;0.01 vs unstimulated cells. *** P&lt;0.05 and **** P&lt;0.01 vs LPS-stimulated cells determined by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test ( B). Abbreviations: DCEO, Dingchuan tang essential oil; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; AP-1, activator protein-1; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SEM, standard error of the mean. </p>
