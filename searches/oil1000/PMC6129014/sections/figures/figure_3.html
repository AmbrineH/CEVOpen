 <p> DCEO decreased mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Notes: Cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of DCEO for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 6 h. The mRNA levels of IL-1β ( A), IL-6 ( B), TNF-α ( C), MCP-1 ( D), CCL-5 ( E), and MIP-1α ( F) were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data presented in bar charts are mean±SEM values from three independent experiments. ** P&lt;0.01 vs unstimulated cells. *** P&lt;0.05 and **** P&lt;0.01 vs LPS-stimulated cells determined by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Abbreviations: DCEO, Dingchuan tang essential oil; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; CCL-5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5; MIP-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; SEM, standard error of the mean. </p>
