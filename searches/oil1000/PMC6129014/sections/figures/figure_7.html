 <p> DCEO inhibited nuclear localization of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Notes: Cells were treated with DCEO with indicated concentrations for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 60 min. The subcellular localization of NF-κB (p65) was detected using immunofluorescence assay, and the images were acquired using the Leica DM 2500 fluorescent microscope. Bar represents 25 μm. Abbreviations: DCEO, Dingchuan tang essential oil; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. </p>
