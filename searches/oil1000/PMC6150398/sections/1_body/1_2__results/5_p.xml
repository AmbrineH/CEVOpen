<p class="p">As for marjoram oils, the greatest number of compounds was identified in the commercial oil (21 components), while in the extract there were 15 components for cold and 12 components for hot extraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The chemical analysis of these oils revealed that they are mainly composed of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids. In the commercial oil their composition was similar, and equalled 40%. In the oils obtained by extraction methods, the percentage of monoterpenes was 26–27%, and the amount of monoterpenoids was two times larger and equalled 55% (
