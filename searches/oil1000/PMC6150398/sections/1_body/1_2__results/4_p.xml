<p class="p">Eighteen compounds were identified in the commercial oregano oil, and more in extracts (21 and 23 components) (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The commercial oregano oil contained monoterpenes in comparable amounts (51%) and their oxygen derivatives (49%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Compositions of oils obtained by the extraction methods were differentiated and different from the composition of the commercial oregano oil—monoterpenes and their derivatives constituted 36% each, and sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids constituted 40–50% (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-Thymol and thymol of the monoterpenoid group constituted the main components of the commercial oil (total of 43.9%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01887-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Their presence in extracts obtained in the cold and hot manner was significantly lower and equalled 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). However, the main elements of extracts included the following: caryophyllene, triacontyl acetate, and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01887-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), which were not identified in the commercial oil. On the other hand, carvacrol, a compound revealing biocidal properties, was identified only in the cold extract, in the amount of 1.8% (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), although it is enumerated as one of the main components of commercial oils. The lack of this compound can be caused by genetic changes in the plants, as well as the environmental conditions in oregano plantations.
