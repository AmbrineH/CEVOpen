<p class="p">In the commercial juniper oil, there were 38 identified components, and in the extracted oils, 23 in each of the extracts (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Monoterpenes constituted 88% of the commercial juniper oil composition and in the extracts their amount was two times lower and equalled 45%, on average. The second group of compounds in extracts, regardless of the manner of obtaining them, was sesquiterpenes in the amount of 21%, on average (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Pinene was the main component to be found in the greatest amounts in all the tested juniper oils (approximately 22%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01887-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). However, these oils differed in terms of the quantitative-qualitative composition of the remaining components. Terpinolene, 3-carene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-phellandrene of the monoterpene group were identified only in the commercial oil, and the extracts contained 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-thujene and sesquiterpenes in considerable amounts (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-humulene).
