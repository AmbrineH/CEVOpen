<p class="p">The tested oils revealed a diversified qualitative-quantitative composition. In clove oil, a different number of chemical compounds was identified: the most in the commercial oil (20 components), and the least in cold and hot extracts, 14 and 13 components, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01887-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Monoterpenes constituted the main components of these oils and in the commercial oil and after maceration they amounted to 78% and, after hot extraction, 82% (

Eugenol was the most important part of this group of compounds, which made up 62% of the whole composition while, in the remaining extracts, it comprised approximately 55%. However, eugenol acetate was present in considerable amounts (23.5% and 27.5%) only in extracts (

The sesquiterpene-type compounds constituted around 20% of the commercial oil and maceration-obtained compositions, while 16% of the composition of the extract obtained as the result of extraction in the Soxhlet apparatus. In this group of compounds,
