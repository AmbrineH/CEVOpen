<p class="p">A different reaction of bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was observed against the commercial juniper oil. These strains did not show sensitivity to the components of this oil; however, they were sensitive to the action of the obtained juniper extracts. The bactericidal activity of juniper extracts against the strains of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> is most probably connected with the presence of sesquiterpenes which were not isolated from the commercial essential oil. The commercial juniper oil contained mainly terpenes (88%) and terpenoids (8%), and the extracts (depending on the applied procedure) contained lower amounts of terpenes (42–48%) and terpenoids (approximately 1%), yet high amounts of sesquiterpenes (25–30%). The anti-microbiotic properties of the juniper oil obtained in the maceration process seem to be caused by the synergistic activity of mono- and sesquiterpenes, which was also observed in the case of the activity of coriander oil against yeasts
