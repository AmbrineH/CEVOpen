<p class="p">Essential oils show a differentiated chemical composition, which depends on various factors, such as the source of the raw material, climate conditions of plantations, the methods of obtaining the oils, etc. [

The tested commercial essential oils revealed considerable differences in terms of the composition and diversity of terpenes, terpenoids, and sesquiterpenes as compared with the extracts obtained from plant material. The clove, juniper, and marjoram oils contained a lower number of components as compared with their commercial counterparts, which may be caused by the loss of high-volatility compounds in the process of drying of the plant material used as the raw material for extraction [

On the other hand, the choice of extraction method mainly affected the quantitative composition of the oils, e.g., a higher share of sesquiterpenes was observed as compared with monoterpenes, which also may result from the nature of the raw material used for extraction purposes.
