<p class="p">Other authors also connect the antibacterial properties of essential oils with the presence of monoterpenes. For instance, Król et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01887" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and Dorman and Deans [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-01887" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] link the activity of clove oil with the presence of eugenol, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-terpinene. Additionally, de Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01887" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] showed in their study that eugenol is responsible for the phytotoxic activity of clove essential oil. On the other hand, Fun and Baerheim [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-01887" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] claim that the activity of marjoram oil is induced by limonene (23.5%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, and that a high concentration of monoterpene tricyclene leads to the reduction of the antibacterial activity of this oil. The latter statement is confirmed by the results of our own study, since the marjoram obtained in the extraction process with a high concentration of tricyclene (24%) did not inhibit the growth of any tested strain of
