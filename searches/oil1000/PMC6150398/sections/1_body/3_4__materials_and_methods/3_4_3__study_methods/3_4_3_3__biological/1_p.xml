 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-01887" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The media were inoculated with 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of standard bacterial suspension with the optical density of ζ = 2 and the wavelength of 550 nm. The results were presented as a mean value of the growth inhibition diameter (in mm). The inhibition effect was assumed to be the lack of growth around wells, growth stimulation–intensified growth around wells and the neutral effect–growth inhibition at the edges of the wells. The control was water with 0.05% Tween 80. Essential oils and extract were used in the following concentrations: 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% (
