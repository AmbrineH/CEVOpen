<p class="p">The Hewlett Packard HP 6890 series GC system chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) was used for the study, which was coupled with the Hewlett Packard 5973 mass selective detector (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) The chromatograph was equipped with the non-polar, high-temperature ZB-5HT capillary column (length, 30 m; inner diameter, 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm, Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, California, USA). The on-column injector was used and 1 μm of a sample was introduced. The results of carrying out the process: initial temperatures, both of the injector and the oven were 60 °C, and the temperature was increased by 10 °C per minute up to 280 °C, the auxiliary temperature was 300 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas and its flow was 2 mL/min. The components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with the spectrometer database of the NIST 11 Library (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Each chromatographic analysis was repeated three times. The average value of relative composition of essential oil percentage were calculated from the peak areas.</p>
