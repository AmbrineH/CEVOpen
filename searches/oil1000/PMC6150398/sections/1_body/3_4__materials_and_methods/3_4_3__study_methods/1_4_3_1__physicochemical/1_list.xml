  <p class="p">Maceration—Twenty grams of dry plant material was minced in a mortar and ground with 100 cm
   <sup class="sup">3</sup> of dichloromethane. The mixture was percolated under reduced pressure. Next, anhydrous magnesium sulphate was added to the solution which was percolated again. The solution was placed in the weighed round-bottom flask and concentrated in the rotary evaporator Heidolph Laborota 4000 efficient (Heidolph Instruments GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany). The cooled flask was weighed again, and the extraction efficiency was calculated (%).

  <p class="p">Extraction in the Soxhlet apparatus—Fifteen grams of dry plant material was minced in a mortar and moved to the thimble, which was placed in the Soxhlet apparatus. Dichloromethane (150 cm
   <sup class="sup">3</sup>) was poured into the round-bottom flask together with a boiling stone. The extraction set was mounted and the process was carried out for 4 h. After cooling, anhydrous magnesium sulphate was added to the solution, which was then percolated under reduced pressure. The solution was placed in the weighed flask and the solvent was evaporated in the rotary evaporator. The cooled flask was weighed again and the extraction efficiency was calculated (in %).
