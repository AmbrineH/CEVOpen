<p class="p">Depending on the chemical composition, essential oils and extracts can be divided into terpene and non-terpene oils. Terpene oils contain mainly terpenes, most frequently mono-, sesqui-, and less frequently, di-terpenes, and the non-terpene oils contain phenylpropane derivatives. Compounds found in both of these oil groups are present, for example, in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, phenols, esters, and acids. Some oils may also contain compounds containing sulphur, nitrogen, and coumarins [
