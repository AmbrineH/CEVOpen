<p class="p">The efficacy of antimicrobial action of oils and extracts depends to a great degree on the chemical composition, which is connected with the type of oily plants, the growth conditions, harvesting, and processing, as well as the manner of obtaining the extracts. Differences in the chemical composition and biological activity were observed in garlic oils containing sulphur compounds [
