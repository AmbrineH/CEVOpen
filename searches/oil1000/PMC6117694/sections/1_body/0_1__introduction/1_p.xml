 <xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are found in the extracts of fish oils. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, are the predominant PUFAs derived from fish oils. The interest in fish oils arose from the reports on Eskimos’ high dietary intake of fish oils associated with a very low occurrence of inflammation-related diseases and ischemic heart disorders [

The PUFAs in fish oils have proved to be beneficial for treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, asthma, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular events, cancers, and depression [
