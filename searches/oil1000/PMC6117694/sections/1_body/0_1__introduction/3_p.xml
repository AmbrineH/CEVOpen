<p class="p">The benefits of fish oil are primarily attributed to omega-3 fatty acids, found mainly in oily fish. Since fish liver is high in lipids, most fish oils are derived from the hepatic region. The fish oil formulations are available from different species, including shark, tuna, lemuru, capelin, polar cod, saithe, mackerel, herring, and sprat [

The composition of omega-3 PUFAs in the commercially available products depends upon the source of the fish, the body part of the fish, and the extraction methods employed. The public awareness of the need to take fish oils to benefit the skin has been identified with the increasing research in the fields of cosmetology and dermatology. The lack of PUFAs can cause increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), resulting in skin barrier function deficiency [

 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. These findings highlight the importance of PUFAs for epidermal homeostasis. Some topically applied formulations of fish oil extract are developed for cosmetic and pharmaceutical products [

In this review, we highlight recent advances in the application of fatty acids in fish oils for preventing or treating skin-associated disorders. Fish oil-based therapy is reported to treat various diseases such as photoaging, skin cancers, dermatitis, melanogenesis, and cutaneous infection. The promising perspective in this emerging application is also discussed.
