The results displayed a significant reduction in the ear thickness, cutaneous eosinophils, and mast cells after fatty acid administration. Fatty acids also decreased the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and collagen fibers. Weise et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] investigated the amelioration of dietary DHA and AA with respect to the severity of ovalbumin-induced dermatitis in mice. The mice consumed a daily dose of 24 mg/kg DHA and/or 48 mg/kg AA. The clinical outcome of dermatitis was significantly reduced by combined DHA and AA. The improvement was accompanied by a significant decrease in Ki67 expression to 62.5% of the control. The elevated IL-10 was also found in the cutaneous lesion of the DHA/AA-treated animal.
