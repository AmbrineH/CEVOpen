<p class="p">Dermatitis is an inflammatory and itchy skin condition with a predilection for cutaneous flexure. It is characterized by symptoms such as intense pruritus, erythematous papules with excoriation, vesicles over erythematous skin, thickened plaques of skin, accentuated skin marking (lichenification), and fibrotic papules (prurigo nodularis) [

The symptoms of dermatitis can cause barrier function defects, followed by the invasion of bacteria and allergens, as well as transepidermal water loss and fat loss. After the diagnosis based on developed criteria, dermatitis can be classified according to several types: atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, discoid eczema, and frictional lichenoid dermatitis [

 <xref rid="B84-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] demonstrated the reduction of cutaneous dryness and pruritus by oral supplementation of fish oil in rats. Dry skin is a consequence of the subtraction of epidermal water content due to stratum corneum barrier function loss [

A 30% increase in cutaneous hydration was detected after fish oil consumption for 60 days, persisting at 90 days in the acetone-induced dry skin animal model. The itch-related scratching behavior was also eliminated after supplementation. The 90-day supplementation led to an increased uptake of DHA (1.8×), EPA (2.2×), and docosapentaenoic acid (1.7×) into the skin.
