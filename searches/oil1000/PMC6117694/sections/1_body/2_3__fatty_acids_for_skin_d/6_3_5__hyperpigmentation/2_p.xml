<p class="p">ALA and LA are reported to reveal skin-whitening capability through the mechanism of tyrosinase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B114-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. Ando et al. [
 <xref rid="B115-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>] evaluated the impact of ALA and LA on hyperpigmentation suppression in the skin. Hyperpigmentation was induced by UVB (1 J/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in guinea pigs. After a 3-week application, the lightness value (L*) of the skin was increased from 40.6 (UVB-treated control) to 47.1 and 48.8 by ALA and LA, respectively. The melanin content decreased to 16.4% and 28.0% compared with the control after ALA and LA treatment. Shigeta et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] prepared LA-loaded liposomes as the carrier for skin whitening in humans. The hyperpigmentation of the volunteers was induced by UVB exposure (1.2x MED) on the forearm. The whitening effect was greater for liposomal LA (0.1%) than for free LA according to the measurement of L*. Liposomal encapsulation was applicable for the protection of unstable LA from oxidation.
