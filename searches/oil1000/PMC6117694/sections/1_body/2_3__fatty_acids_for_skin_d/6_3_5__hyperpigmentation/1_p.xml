 <xref rid="B112-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>] to explore the effect of DHA on melanin synthesis by using B16F10 melanoma as the cell model. DHA at 1–25 μM did not influence cell viability but decreased α-MSH-activated melanin production. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a predominant regulator for tyrosinase expression [
