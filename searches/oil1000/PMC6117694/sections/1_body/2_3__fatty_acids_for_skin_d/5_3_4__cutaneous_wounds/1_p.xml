<p class="p">Skin wounds, such as second-degree burns, chronic wounds, and ulcers, have affected millions of people worldwide. Though there are several skin replacement products and wound dressings for promoting wound healing, the development of efficient and safe approaches for cutaneous wound healing is urgently needed [
 <xref rid="B95-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Wound healing is divided into three stages: inflammatory response, proliferation, and maturation [
 <xref rid="B96-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. The cellular and molecular processes in the inflammatory phase of wound healing are initiated and amplified to a large degree by proinflammatory cytokines. The synthesis and activity of cytokines can be regulated by PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B97-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. These fatty acids have been proved to play a key role in cell membrane structure and anabolic events during skin tissue reconstruction. It is possible that omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs modulate or enhance local inflammatory response at wound areas, accelerating the healing rate [
 <xref rid="B98-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Shingel et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] described the preparation of a solid emulsion gel for cell-targeted PUFA delivery to skin wounds. The emulsion hydrogel is a combination of a protein-stabilized lipid emulsion and a hydrogel vehicle. The full-thickness skin wound reaching muscular fascia was created in the pig with a 25-mm diameter. The wound treated with the fish-oil-containing gel showed a faster wound closure compared to the gel containing olive oil. A significant wound closure was achieved at day 2 and day 10 by fish oil and olive oil, respectively. Fish oil was found to stimulate early angiogenesis for promoting wound healing.
