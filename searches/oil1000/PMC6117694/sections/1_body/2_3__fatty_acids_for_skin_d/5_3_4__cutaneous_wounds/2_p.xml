 <xref rid="B101-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] assessed the efficacy of SMOFlipid rich in omega-3 PUFAs on wound healing in rats. SMOFlipid was intravenously injected at 0.2 mL/kg immediately after excision for 72 h. The SMOFlipid accelerated the healing process more than the placebo by reducing the surface area of the wound by ≈20–25% at day 3. The IL-10 level and collagen fiber organization were greater in the SMOFlipid group than the placebo after 48 h of treatment. The topical use of DHA (30 μM) hastened the skin wound healing through the inflammatory activity modulation in rats [

Upon DHA treatment, the wound healing was accompanied by the activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120, a receptor for DHA with anti-inflammatory activity. The expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and keratinocyte marker involucrin was upregulated after DHA application. The DHA analogues 14

 <xref rid="B104-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>], the small blisters on the forearms were created to examine the effect of the daily intake of DHA (1.1 g) and EPA (1.6 g) on the healing rate. A significantly greater IL-1β expression was detected in the blister fluid of the DHA/EPA group than in the control. It is hypothesized that the increased proinflammatory cytokines at the wound site may be responsible for wound healing.
