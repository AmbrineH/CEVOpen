<p class="p">Skin cancers are generally classified into melanoma and non-melanoma skin carcinoma (NMSC). UVB radiation is the most prevalent risk factor responsible for the development of skin cancers. However, it has been recognized that UVA is also responsible for procarcinogenic action on the skin [

DHA or EPA at 50 μM lowered the number of viable keratinocytes by 60–80% compared to the control. The combined anti-cancer drugs and dietary PUFAs may be advantageous to achieving synergistic inhibition on carcinogenesis. Chiu et al. [

Celecoxib and indomethacin revealed additive effects on DHA-induced inhibition. Aspirin promoted DHA-induced growth inhibition by 43% at 480 μM. The IC
