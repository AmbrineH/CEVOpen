<p class="p">Imiquimod is a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist prescribed as a topical drug for treating actinic keratosis, skin warts, and malignancy [
 <xref rid="B69-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is known to cause severe skin inflammation. Based on the concept of synergistic carcinoma inhibition for lowering the administered dose, fish oil was used in combination with imiquimod to treat human basal (BCC) and squamous carcinoma cells (SCC) [
 <xref rid="B70-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The fish oil utilized in this case was composed of 21% DHA and 42% EPA. The combined imiquimod and fish oil demonstrated greater cell viability inhibition and immunomodulatory potency as compared to imiquimod alone. The pure DHA or EPA was more potent than fish oil for the immunomodulatory effect against the carcinoma cells. The omega-3 PUFAs served as the inducers of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and as the suppressors of IL-6 and TNF-Î± to depress cell growth. Rehman and Zulfakar [
 <xref rid="B71-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] further developed the imiquimod-loaded fish oil bigel colloidal delivery system for treating skin cancer in a mouse model. Bigel is defined as an intimate hydrogel/oleogel colloidal semisolid vehicle for topical application [
 <xref rid="B72-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Fish oil as a source of DHA and EPA is also employed as the permeation enhancer to improve drug delivery into the skin [
 <xref rid="B73-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. After topical delivery of the imiquimod formulations on the mouse bearing the skin tumor induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), there was a significant reduction of the tumor size by bigel (2.07 mm) and the commercial imiquimod cream (1.98 mm) as compared with the sham control (6.48 mm). The mouse treated with bigel exhibited greater IL-10 expression (40.86 pg/mL) than commercial cream (27.82 pg/mL) and the control (0.63 pg/mL). The fish oil rich in omega-3 PUFAs was topically applied on the mouse skin with papilloma prompted by benzo(a)pyrene and croton oil [
 <xref rid="B74-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Fish oil blocked the binding of benzo(a)pyrene to DNA, resulting in the reduction of the mean papilloma number per mouse from 6.0 to 3.1. In addition to topical delivery, the oral administration of a high-fat diet containing fish oil rich in omega-3 PUFAs in mice also repressed UVB-induced carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B75-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Fish oil intake could increase the latency to the development of UVB-induced tumor and decrease the size of the papilloma, keratoacanthoma, and carcinoma in mice by 98%, 80%, and 83%, respectively. The tumor inhibition was not observed in the group receiving the high-fat diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids.
