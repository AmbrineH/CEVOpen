<p class="p">Conjugated LA was orally administered to the mouse bearing skin cancer to determine the presence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-δ and keratinocyte fatty acid binding protein (K-FABP), which are involved in cutaneous tumor promotion [
 <xref rid="B81-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The skin malignancy was developed by topical administration of DMBA and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The results showed that PPAR-δ and K-FABP in the mRNA level were decreased by feeding the diet containing 0.5–1.5% conjugated LA. It is suggested that conjugated LA inhibited skin tumor promotion via the mechanism of PPAR-δ.
