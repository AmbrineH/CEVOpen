<p class="p">The anti-photoaging effect of PUFAs occurs in cell-based and animal-based studies as well as in human studies. In the early 1990s, a short-term supplementation of fish oil was conducted in humans [
 <xref rid="B51-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The volunteers received oral fish oil containing rich omega-3 PUFAs (1.2 g DHA and 2.8 g EPA) each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, there was a significant increase in the minimal erythema dose (MED) to UVB with a decreased serum triglyceride level to 40 mg/dL. Rhodes et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] examined the photoprotective effect of fish oil on light-sensitive patients. Thirteen patients with polymorphic light eruption received oral supplementation of fish oil containing DHA, EPA, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid for 3 months. The mean MED increased from 19.8 to 33.8 mJ/cm

 <xref rid="B53-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] evaluated the percutaneous absorption and the photoprotective effect of three fish oils rich in DHA and EPA, including mackerel, sardine, and horse mackerel. The in vitro skin permeation showed that the fish oil from sardines facilely penetrated into the skin as compared to the oil from the others. The clinical experiment was carried out in ten volunteers with the irradiation of UVB at doubled MED. The topical application of combined sardine extract and ketoprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, inhibited the UVB-induced erythema by 60.5%, which was greater than the inhibition achieved by sardine oil extract (24.5%) and ketoprofen (46.6%) alone.
