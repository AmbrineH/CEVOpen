<p class="p">The influence of dietary EPA on UVB-generated PGE2 and proinflammatory cytokines was examined in a double-blind, randomized study [
 <xref rid="B54-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Twenty-eight volunteers received 4 g daily of 95% ethyl esters of EPA or oleic acid for 3 months. The group of EPA but not oleic acid exhibited a significant enhancement of MED. PGE2’s increase by UVB (26.5 pg/mL) could be eliminated by EPA (19.3 pg/mL), approximating the baseline data (14.0 pg/mL). However, this study demonstrates no evidence that the reduced sunburn response by EPA was mediated by cytokines. The PUFAs are not always beneficial to various facets of cutaneous photoaging. Langerhans cells are sentinels of the immune system in the skin. Following UV exposure, the loss of this cell in the epidermis is detected [

 <xref rid="B56-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] explored the effect of dietary EPA on epidermal Langerhans cells and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). The healthy volunteers received EPA-rich capsules (5 g EPA) or control lipid (glyceryl tricoprylate caprate) for 12 weeks. The clinical data revealed that there was no impact of EPA supplementation on the Langerhans cell number and the PGD2 level after UV irradiation compared to the control. There was no evidence that EPA reduced UV suppression on skin immunity through this mechanism. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] investigated whether topical EPA could inhibit both UV-induced photoaging and intrinsic aging to young and aged volunteers, respectively. The buttock skin was irradiated with UVB at doubled MED (about 70–90 mJ/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). UVB increased epidermal thickness by 214%, and topical EPA reduced the thickness by 72%. UVB light reduced the procollagen expression to 18% of the untreated control. EPA could restore the procollagen level to 46% of the control group. This PUFA also attenuated COX-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9 elevated by UVB.
