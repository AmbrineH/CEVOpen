<p class="p">Interleukin (IL)-8, a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the C-X-C chemokine subfamily, is of major significance in the mediation of UVB-induced keratinocyte inflammation [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Storey et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] investigated whether the inhibition of UVB-induced inflammation by DHA and EPA is mediated by the modulation of IL-8 in keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts. In keratinocytes, DHA and EPA reduced the IL-8 level by 65% and 66% after UVB irradiation at 100 mJ/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. A similar pattern was observed in fibroblasts. Oleic acid showed no influence on IL-8 release. Serini et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] explored the ability of DHA to influence the resistance to UV-activated apoptosis in keratinocytes. DHA reverted HaCaT cell resistance to UV-induced apoptosis, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, and decreased COX-2 by the inhibition of human antigen R (HuR), a COX-2 mRNA stabilizer in keratinocytes. The incorporation of DHA at 50 μM to the UV-irradiated cells decreased cytoplasmic HuR by 71%. UV-induced metalloproteinases (MMPs) elicit connective tissue damage, resulting in the skin’s aging and wrinkling [

 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] investigated the effect of EPA on UV-induced MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. The broadband UV (275–380 nm) at 25–75 mJ/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was used as the UV source. Pretreatment of EPA at 5 and 10 μM inhibited MMP-1 by 33% and 79% compared to the UV-treated group, respectively. EPA could suppress MMP-1 by inhibiting the ERK and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. On the other hand, AA and oleic acid pretreatment slightly increased or did not affect MMP-1 expression.
