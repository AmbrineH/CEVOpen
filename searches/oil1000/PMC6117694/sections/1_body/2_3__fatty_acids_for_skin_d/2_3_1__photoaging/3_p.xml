 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The daily oral dose of 300 mg/kg EPA for 2 weeks could suppress the ear edema. However, no function was observed in the groups receiving ≈30–100 mg/kg EPA. No amelioration of ear edema was detected with the use of oral DHA and safflower oil in this case. Topical administration provides a direct and efficient way to deliver the active agents into the cutaneous nidus with higher bioavailability than the oral route. Rahman et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] investigated the inhibitory effect of topically applied DHA on UVB-induced skin inflammation in hairless mice. Topical pretreatment of DHA (2.5 and 10 μmol) significantly decreased COX-2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH): oxidase-4 (NOX-4) in mouse skin. Both COX-2 and NOX-4 are important in evoking oxidative stress and inciting inflammation. The molecular mechanisms of this inhibition could be the suppression of UVB-induced NF-κB activation and COX-2/NOX-4 expression by blocking the phosphorylation of stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK1), which is a kinase downstream of ERK and p38. The transcription factor Nrf2 is a major regulator of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant gene expression [
