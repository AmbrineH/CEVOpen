<p class="p">Cutaneous aging can be divided into chronological aging and photoaging. Photoaging is activated via the human skin damage attributable to repeated ultraviolet (UV) exposure from sunlight. UV irradiation elicits both acute and chronic adverse effects on the skin. These include sunburn, photosensitivity, inflammation, immunosuppression, and photocarcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. UV exposure of the skin creates reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the massive infiltration of immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages in viable skin [
 <xref rid="B38-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. One of the key proteins mediating the inflammatory signals in UV-induced injury is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which catalyzes the biosynthesis process of prostaglandins [

The fatty acids derived from fish oil have been considered to be associated with the skin’s photoprotection. Omega-3 PUFAs can decrease the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids through direct competition with the metabolism of AA [

The other mechanisms of omega-3 PUFAs for suppressing UV-induced keratinocyte damage can be the regulation of COX-2, NF-Κb, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways [
