<p class="p">In addition to the PUFAs with the longer chains (&gt;20 carbon atoms), the short-chain PUFAs are useful in suppressing UV-induced cutaneous injury. The effect of orally and topically applied oils enriched with LA and ALA on UV-induced damage was compared in hairless mice [
 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Both LA and ALA lowered the erythema score compared to the basal cream after topical administration. On the other hand, dietary ALA demonstrated greater erythema inhibition than LA by the oral route. The PGE2 expression increased 8-fold after UVB exposure. Dietary LA did not diminish the increased PGE2, whereas the PGE2 level in the ALA group was 75% lower than that in the LA group. The results indicated that both omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs could play a role in the constraint of UVB-elicited lesions. Conjugated LA represents the positional and geometrical isomers of LA. These isomers are reported to block LA metabolism to Î³-linolenic acid in omega-6 PUFAs [

 <xref rid="B60-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Storey et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] examined the capability of conjugated LA to inhibit IL-8 and PGE2 in UV-irradiated keratinocytes. Supplementation of keratinocytes with 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>9,
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>11-conjugated LA downregulated UVB-induced IL-8 from 37.11 to 14.17 ng/mg. Another LA isomer, 
 <italic class="italic">tt</italic>-conjugated LA, reduced UVB-induced PGE2 release from 4.8 to 1.6 pg/mg. According to the above description, it is believed that oral or topical application of PUFAs from fish oil is helpful in preventing or treating skin aging. This is the appeal of many cosmetic products. These fatty acids are included in some skin creams for cosmetic purposes [
 <xref rid="B62-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The detailed information about the fatty acids existed in fish oils for attenuating cutaneous photoaging is summarized in
