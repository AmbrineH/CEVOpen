<p class="p">The main derivatives of the ALA metabolism are DHA and EPA. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00256-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the metabolic pathways of ALA to produce DHA and EPA. They always act as the indicator components of fish oil. The first double bond of both long-chain PUFAs is located at the third carbon atom from the methyl end. DHA and EPA have been used nutritionally and therapeutically in several diseases with variable success. DHA mainly resides in the retina and brain to maintain the membrane order and the activity of membrane-bound enzymes. DHA deficiency occurs during aging and dementia, impairs memory and learning, and promotes age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease. DHA is reported to have the ability of tumor inhibition and chemoprevention against colon cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer [

EPA can compete with AA, an omega-6 PUFA, through the same metabolic pathways, but it produces eicosanoids that are functionally different from the AA derivatives. EPA is less potent as an inflammatory mediator compared to AA. Because of the competitive relationship, EPA can restrain AA-derived PGE2 synthesis [
