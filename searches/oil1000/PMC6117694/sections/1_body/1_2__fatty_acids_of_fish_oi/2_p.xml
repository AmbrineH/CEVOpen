<p class="p">Both omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs are essential fatty acids because the mammalian cells lack the desaturase enzymes capable of placing double bonds at the positions of ω6 and ω3 [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Both PUFAs should be obtained from diet and supplementation. The omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are needed for normal growth and health maintenance. They are metabolized via the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. The various types of metabolites are essential in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. LA and ALA, the PUFAs with the shorter chain length (18 carbon atoms), are the precursors to the biosynthesis of the omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs with the longer chain lengths, respectively [
