<p class="p">Fish oil is abundant in fats and fatty acids, which can contain vitamin A, vitamin D, cholesterol, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and sterylesters [

 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Among these components, esters are the main ingredient and they gain most attention for being associated with the bioactivities. Fatty acids in fish oil are present in both the neutral lipid and free acid forms. The typical fatty acid composition of the fish oil extract can be divided into saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and PUFAs. The main saturated fatty acids found in fish oil include myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), and behenic acid (22:0) [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-16-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The monounsaturated fatty acids in fish oil include myristoleic acid (14:1ω5), palmitoleic acid (16:1ω7), oleic acid (18:1ω9), eicosenoic acid (20:1ω9), gadoleic acid (20:1ω11), erucic acid (22:1ω9), and catoleic acid (22:1ω11). The major PUFAs in fish oil are presented as linoleic acid (LA, 18:2ω6), α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3ω3), DHA (22:6ω3), and EPA (22:5ω3).
