<p class="p">Heat treatment significantly affects the antimicrobial activity of the oils. In particular, heat shock seems to greatly improve the antimicrobial activity of oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> (MaH2 and MaH3). We successively tried to understand the mechanism underlying the toxicity against bacteria, with the use of fluorescence microscopy. Our data show that the possible target of the active molecule(s) extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> is the bacterial membrane. In support of this hypothesis, membrane damage seems to be strongly related to the antimicrobial activity of the various oils. In order to confirm the fluorescence microscopy data, the samples treated with the MpH1 oil, the one showing the greatest antimicrobial activity, were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Under TEM microscopy, the untreated control bacteria had a well-known typical appearance of quite electron dense protoplasm delimited by a solid cell wall. The changed appearance of the bacteria suggests that the protoplasm, under the toxic effect of the mintoil, loses most or even all of its content, giving an electron clear or even empty appearance to the cell. Nevertheless, the cell walls still featured a solid, electron dense structure. All this suggests that the oil induced the lysis of the protoplasm, whilst not damaging the ultrastructure of the cell wall. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the cell membrane is the target of the mint essential oil. In fact, it was already reported that monoterpenes and particularly menthol, act against both the gram-positive and the gram-negative bacteria damaging biomembranes, in particular perturbing the lipid fraction of microorganism plasma membrane, resulting in alterations of membrane permeability and in leakage of intracellular materials [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the oil might cross the cell membranes, penetrating into the interior of the cell and interacting with intracellular sites critical for antibacterial activity. Since it can be related to the physicochemical characteristics of the drugs (such as lipophilicity and water solubility), this effect seems to be dependent on lipid composition and net surface charge of microbial membranes.
