<p class="p">The effect of heat stress on the chemical composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> (Mp) and 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> (Ma) is showed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01903-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. As we can see, the percentages of menthol seem to decrease for both the mint species at the increasing of the temperature, while on the contrary the percentages of both pulegone and menthyl acetate increase as temperature rises. Other components that vary strongly at the different temperatures are menthone and menthofuran, whose percentages are greatly affected by heat stress.
