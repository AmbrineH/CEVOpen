<p class="p">In 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>, there are two major pathways to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, that are the most important secondary metabolite in the volatile oils. The MEP pathway produces monoterpenes from pyruvate, while the MVA pathway produces sesquiterpenes from Acetyl Co. A [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. During the MEP pathway, pyruvate is converted to limonene in plastids. After the transfer to endoplasmic reticulum, limonene is converted to isopiperitenol, that in mitochondria changes to isopiperitenone. After that, isopiperitenone is released in the cytoplasm and converts to pulegone, that in cytoplasm produces menthol while in endoplasmic reticulum produces menthofuran [
