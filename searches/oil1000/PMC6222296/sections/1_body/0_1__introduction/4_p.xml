<p class="p">Although medicinal plants have considerable adaptability to a large spectrum of conditions, in certain environmental conditions they can reduce their potential to produce biomass and metabolites. Different abiotic stresses affect productivity and growth of plants such as temperature, content of salt, drought, anaerobic and flooding conditions [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. One of the factors that can affect essential oil production is heat stress. Heat (or cold) stress can have murderous effects on plants [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The greenhouse effect increases the temperature in the world and changes the climates, therefore heat is becoming a major abiotic stress and has been recognized as an agrarian effect in various semi-arid and arid regions. High temperature creates a series of physiological and biochemical modifications in plants, which affect plant growth and development and can lead to acute reduction in economic yields [
