<p class="p">Based on the above, the objective of this research was to investigate the changes in the quality, quantity and antibacterial activity of essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> L. var. Mitcham (Mitcham mint) and 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha arvensis</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">piperascens</italic> Malinv. ex L. H. Bailey (Japanese mint) under heat stress conditions. To investigate the effect of heat stress on essential oil composition in the two 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species, three different temperature conditions in growth chambers were used [
