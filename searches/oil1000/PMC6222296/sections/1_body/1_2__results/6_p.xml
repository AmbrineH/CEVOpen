<p class="p">The same dose-response curves were performed for 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> oils. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, these oils had a lower antimicrobial activity compared to the oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>. The effect of heat shock stress seems to be necessary to obtain a better antimicrobial activity, which is the highest in the MaH3 oil for all strains analysed. Only on the bacilli and only for MaH3 to 1% of concentration 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> there is a complete death of the bacteria.
