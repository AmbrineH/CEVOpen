<p class="p">The relative concentrations of the volatile components identified in the essential oils of the six samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01903-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, according to their retention indices Ki on a HP-5 MS column. A total of 26 compounds were identified in the oils. On the whole, qualitative profiles of all essential oils were characterized by a greater amount of oxygenated monoterpenes (88.3–94.8%) and particularly five compounds were the most representative: menthone (7.6–15.9%), menthofuran (7.8–35.0%), menthol (5.6–56.6%), pulegone (5.6–28.1%) and menthyl acetate (2.1–15.4%). As regards the single components, the peppermint oil was characterized by higher amounts of menthol, that for the sample MpH1 accounted for more than the half of the total oil (56.6%) but was also abundant in MpH2 and MpH3 (38.5% and 27.5%, respectively). For 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> oil, the compound present in higher percentages was instead menthofuran, accounting for 35.0% of the total oil in MaH1, 25.4% in MaH2 and 34.0% in MaH3.
