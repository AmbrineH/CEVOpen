<p class="p">Our TEM observations showed that the untreated control cells had quite electron dense protoplasm surrounded by a very electron dense cell wall with a solid texture (

Treatments with mint extracts induced the appearance of changed bacteria with electron clear or even almost empty protoplasm delimited by still well visible, electron dense cell walls. Control-like bacteria are still present, along with altered cells, despite the treatments and even at the highest concentration (
