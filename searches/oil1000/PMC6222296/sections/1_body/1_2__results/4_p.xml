<p class="p">In order to characterize the antimicrobial activity of the oils extracted from the two different mint species, we have carried out 
 <italic class="italic">Kirby</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bauer</italic> assays [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The normalization of oils inhibition halo is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>: as we can see, the oils were active against the four bacterial strains used for the experiments and they were particularly active against the bacilli. Generally, essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> showed a higher antimicrobial activity than the others, while in the case of the oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> the effect of temperature was essential to increase their activity against the tested bacteria.
