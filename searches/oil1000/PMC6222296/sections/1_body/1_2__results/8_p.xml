<p class="p">In order to gain an insight into the possible mechanism of action of the active molecule present in different mint essential oils, we used fluorescence microscopy to study their effect on the selected bacterial strain. We have chosen 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> for the following microscopy experiments. 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> is a significant cause of toxin-induced food poisoning characterized by emesis and diarrhoea. Although a variety of foods have been implicated, including infant cereal, contaminated fried rice most frequently is associated with the emetic form of disease, which is caused by heat-resistant, preformed toxin, cereulide, or 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> spores that germinate when boiled rice is left unrefrigerated [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01903" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The organism typically is introduced by a projectile foreign body or open globe injury, producing a rapidly severe infection that frequently results in enucleation or poor visual outcome. A postsurgical endophthalmitis outbreak has been described, but 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> is an uncommon cause of postoperative endophthalmitis. Management is aggressive, including surgical intervention and parenteral, intravitreal and topical antimicrobial treatment. 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> is resistant uniformly to Î²-lactam antibiotics. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the interaction between the oils and the 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> strain using DAPI as DNA fluorescent stain and the fluorescent PI dye, that is only able to penetrate damaged membranes and is generally excluded from viable cells. Our results, obtained using 1% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> of MpH1 essential oil, showed that all the treated cells emit red fluorescence light as a consequence of an impairment of membrane integrity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>(2,B)). The other oils have an intermediate amount of red and blue cells, very consistent with the antimicrobial activity measured by the inhibition halo and described by dose-response curves and MIC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>(3,C,4,D)). The only oil that does not seem to possess antimicrobial activity and does not allow the PI to enter inside the cells is MaH1, in fact, as we can see in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>(6,F), bacterial cells appeared blue. As expected, fluorescence of untreated cells was blue because PI could not cross their intact plasma membranes (
