<p class="p">Successively we analysed separately, realizing dose-response curves, the oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>, using various % 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> as indicated in the methods. As shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01903-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, MpH1 was the most active on all the bacterial strains used: in particular, at the concentration of 1%, it killed all the bacteria. Besides, increasing the temperature of the heat shock the antimicrobial activity seems to decrease, in all cases except for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. All the oils were more active on the bacilli and slightly less on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>.
