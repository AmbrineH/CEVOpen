In the field and in nature, the heat stress happened only in the third harvest (in summer in the hot area) so in this period in two-stages, we harvested the shoots. To choose the heat stress temperature to use, we analysed the variation of temperature in different areas of Iran, considering the average of 50 years meteorological data. Therefore, we individuated two different heat stress conditions (hot and extremely hot), to compare to the moderate climate. The hottest area is particularly important because around the city of Dezful, Khuzestan there is a big river for irrigation and the biomass of peppermint is higher than in other areas (more growth rate, more harvest per year and longer season growing); in

Considering these data, we programmed the growth chamber (16/8 h brightness/darkness) and step by step we increased the temperature during the 20 days, from a normal cycle of temperature occurring in moderate climatic of Iran (14–32 °C) in H1, to warm cycle corresponding to hot areas of Iran (26–40 °C) in H2 and to the very hot cycle corresponding in very hot Iranian areas (27–45 °C) in H3.
