At every step, bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min so to obtain a pellet and the supernatant was substitutes with the following agent. After a 2 day-polymerization in an oven at 70 °C, resin blocks were cut into ultra-thin (50 nm thick) sections, which were mounted on 300-mesh copper grids, then stained with Uranyl Acetate Replacement stain UAR (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and lead citrate and observed with a Philips EM 208S TEM. Electron microscopy observations were only made on MpH1 fraction-treated
