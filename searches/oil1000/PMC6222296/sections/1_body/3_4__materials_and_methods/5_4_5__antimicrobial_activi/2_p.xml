After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with stirring at 150 rpm serial dilutions (1:100, 1:1000) of all samples were prepared and then plated on LB-agar in Petri dishes that were finally incubated at 37 °C overnight. The following day, the surviving percent of bacterial cells was estimated by counting the number of colonies [
