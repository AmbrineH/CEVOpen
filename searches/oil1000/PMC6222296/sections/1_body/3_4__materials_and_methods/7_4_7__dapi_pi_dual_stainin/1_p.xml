<p class="p">For dual staining, 100μL of the bacterial culture of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> (bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase) was incubated in the dark for 2 h at 37 °C in agitation in the presence or absence of oils (MpH1, MpH2, MpH3, MaH1, MaH2 and MaH3), a concentration of 1%. After the incubation, 10 μL of bacterial culture was mixed with DAPI solution (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy) (1 μg/mL DAPI final concentration) and PI (propidium iodide; Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 20 μg/mL. Samples were observed using an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using a DAPI filter (excitation/emission: 358/461 nm). Standard acquisition times were 1000 ms for DAPI/PI dual staining. Images were captured using an Olympus DP70 digital camera [
