<p class="p">Analytical gas chromatography was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Sigma 115 gas chromatograph fitted with a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm), 0.25 μm film thickness. Analysis was also run by using a fused silica HP Innowax polyethylenglycol capillary column (50 m × 0.20 mm), 0.20 μm thick film. Gas chromatography analysis has been performed as described in detail previously [
