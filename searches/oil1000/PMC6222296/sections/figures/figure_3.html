 <p> Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from M. piperita at different concentrations (0.005-0.01-0.2-1% v/ v) valuated by colony count assay, after 2 h of incubation, against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus strains. The % of bacterial survival is represented on the y axis. The assays were performed in three independent experiments. </p>
