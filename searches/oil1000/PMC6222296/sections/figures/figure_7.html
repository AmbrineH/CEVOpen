 <p> The figure shows TEM micrographs of untreated control ( a, b) and Mph1 fraction-treated ( c, d) B. cereus samples. Untreated control samples. ( a) A longitudinal section of an untreated control bacterium with a quite electron dense protoplasm surrounded by an electron dense cell wall. ( b) Cross and longitudinal sections of control bacteria where the dense texture of the cell walls is shown. Mph1 fraction-treated samples. ( c) The micrograph shows both control-like (arrows) and changed bacteria (asterisks), the latter with very electron clear protoplasm surrounded by well visible cell walls. ( d) A detail of a bacterial cell with a control-like appearance. Scale bars: 1 Âµm ( a, c), 500 nm ( b, d). </p>
