Ketone bodies can be the most efficient energy source in almost every tissue and have more adenosine triphosphate production per mole of energy substrate than pyruvate. Persisting for a long time and recurrent hypoglycemia regulate multiple metabolic pathways, and also hypoglycemia which is induced by fasting or prolonged physical exercise increases uptake of alternate respiratory substrates such as ketone bodies (
