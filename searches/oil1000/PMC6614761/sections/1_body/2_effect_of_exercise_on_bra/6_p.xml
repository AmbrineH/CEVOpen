<p class="p">This paper also emphasis on the β-HB production which is induced by β-oxidation of free fatty acids versus carbohydrate oxidation during prolonged exercise. This kind of exercise connected with the enhanced spatial learning and memory function as well as hippocampal neurogenesis. Hippocampal neurogenesis is also well connected mechanisms with the exercise-induced neuronal synaptic plasticity. However, strength exercise is mainly anaerobic exercise that uses glycolysis, this anaerobic exercise decreased these benefits (
