<p class="p">Frequent consumption of polyphenols and n-3 PUFAs can modify gastrointestinal environment by increasing beneficial microorganisms. Gastrointestinal microbiome might influence cognitive function in addition to traditionally suggested etiological pathways. Based on the present our studies, it can be suggested that prolonged physical exercise, such as open skill sports, causes β-oxidation of free fatty acids, and then stimulates BDNF production. β-HB production induced by carbohydrate depletion, hypoglycemia or fasting also stimulates BDNF production. Enhanced BDNF production improves cognitive function through facilitation of brain metabolism. BDNF also acts as primary regulator of synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the many areas of central nervous system.</p>
