<p class="p">BDNF stimulation was also revealed by neurotrophic myokine such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels after the regular physical exercise or several kinds of exercise training. However, we even do not know the exact neuronal mechanisms about the nutrients, Î²-HB and myokine impacts on BDNF activation. Therefore, this review focuses on recent evidence that explains how nutrients and prolonged exercise can affect nervous system pathways that are associated with improving brain function.</p>
