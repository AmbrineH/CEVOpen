 <xref rid="b28-jer-15-3-341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ounnas et al. (2017)</xref> showed that intake of higher amounts of dietary polyphenols are associated with increasing EPA and DHA levels through stimulation of their synthesis in the liver, which is a major place of EPA and DHA production, suggesting that polyphenols may increase EPA and DHA levels. In addition, it has been suggested that since polyphenols and DHA have prebiotic-like effect, they can modify gut microbiota composition. Intakes of polyphenols can increase beneficial strains as

 <xref rid="b6-jer-15-3-341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Claesson et al., 2012</xref>) is gaining recognition for its potential role not only in gastrointestinal disorders, but also in diseases of the central nervous system. Thus, frequent consumption of polyphenols and n-3 PUFAs could modify gastrointestinal environment with beneficial microorganisms. It may suggest a new hypothesis that gastrointestinal microbiome could influence cognitive function and the traditional etiological pathway as well.
