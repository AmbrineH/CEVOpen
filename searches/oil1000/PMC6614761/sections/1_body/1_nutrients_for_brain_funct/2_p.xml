<p class="p">N-3 PUFAs are normal components of cell membranes of brain, neuronal tissue and retina and are essential for normal brain function (
 <xref rid="b26-jer-15-3-341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Neuringer et al., 1988</xref>). PUFAs could be associated with maintaining optimal brain function and preventing against dementia by their antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions in addition to their specific effect on nervous functions (

As n-3 PUFAs, DHA is a key component of neuronal membranes, and sufficient n-3 PUFA status may support maintaining optimal neuronal integrity and function. There have been known some of the mechanisms by which DHA influences neuronal plasticity and cognition. For example, dietary DHA supplementation has been found to increase levels of hippocampal BDNF and promote cognitive function in rodent models of brain trauma (

DHA might enhance cognitive capacities by expediting synaptic plasticity and modifying synaptic membrane fluidity. DHA may be directly associated with enhancing brain health in the aging central nervous system through a number of potential mechanisms. Moreover, DHA may moderate the expression of genes that regulate a variety of biological functions potentially important for learning/memory health (
