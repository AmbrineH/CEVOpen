<p class="p">Accumulating studies have suggested that dietary ingredients influence mechanisms that maintain brain function (

 <xref rid="b34-jer-15-3-341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Solfrizzi et al., 2008</xref>). Since highly chemical reactions occur in the brain, oxidative stress commonly occurs in its nervous system (
 <xref rid="b3-jer-15-3-341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caracciolo et al., 2014</xref>). The brain is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress damage because of its metabolic load and its abundance of oxidizable materials, such as the PUFAs being consisted of the plasma membranes of neural cells. Several ‘antioxidant diets’ have become popular for their publicized positive effects on neural function (
