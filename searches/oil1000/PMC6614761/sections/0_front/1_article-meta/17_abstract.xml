 <p class="p">Epidemiological evidence suggests that health-oriented eating habits are associated with maintaining optimal cognitive ability. Nutrients are functional bioactive molecules promoting human health and essential components as well. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), one of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is synthesized through elongation pathway from linolenic acid (81:3n-3) which is recognized as important source of brain function. Endurance physical exercise and energy restriction was also recognized of cardiovascular stress adjustment by enhancing brainstem cholinergic activity as well as brain function. However, we even do not know the exact neuronal mechanisms about the nutrients, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) and myokine impacts on brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) activation. Therefore, this review focuses on recent evidence that explains how nutrients and prolonged exercise can affect nervous system pathways that are associated with improving brain function. The results revealed that frequent consumption of polyphenols and n-3 PUFAs could modify gastrointestinal environment with beneficial microorganisms. It may suggest a new hypothesis that gastrointestinal microbiome could influence cognitive function in addition to the traditional etiological pathway. And moreover, prolonged physical exercise includes open skill sports which is induced by β-oxidation of free fatty acids stimulate BDNF. And also β-HB production which is induced by carbohydrate depletion, hypoglycemia, or fasting stimulate BDNF production that acts an significantly important roles in cognitive function and acting on brain function with brain metabolism.</p>
