<p class="p">The inflammatory phase of wound healing normally leads to the release of biologically active mediators and oxygen-free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl anion, and an excess of these agents is well known to cause tissue damage and hamper tissue repair (

The overproduction of NO has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and unhealed wounds. Activated macrophages release into the extracellular medium several reactive oxygen species, including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, among others. VOB has been shown to be highly effective in inhibiting the production of these radicals, especially NO and superoxide anion, and inflammatory cytokines, proving to be a good alternative as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent (
