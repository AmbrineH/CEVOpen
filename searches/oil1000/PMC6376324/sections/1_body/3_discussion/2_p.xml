<p class="p">Unique characteristics of vegetable oil blends are important when considering their use for topical skin care. Different ratios of essential fatty acids are major determinants of the repair benefits of natural oils. Oils with a higher linoleic acid to oleic acid ratio have better barrier repair potential (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). The fatty acid profile of VOB exhibited predominantly the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (63.39%), and the polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (4.79%) and linolenic acid (5.09%). Thus, the fatty acid composition reinforces the potential therapeutic applicability for improving the natural skin-barrier function.
