<p class="p">The compound sodium nitroprusside is known to spontaneously generate nitric oxide, which interacts with oxygen to produce nitrite ions that can be estimated using the Griess reagent (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Briefly, the reaction mixture containing sodium nitroprusside in phosphate-buffered saline with or without the VOB was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then, 150 μL of incubated solution was mixed with 150 µL of Griess reagent and the absorbance of chromophore formed was measured at 540 nm in an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMAX 190, Molecular Devices, USA). The results are reported as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (µgmL). Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
