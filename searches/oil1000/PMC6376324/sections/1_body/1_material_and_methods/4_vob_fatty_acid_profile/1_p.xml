<p class="p">VOB fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared by methylation with boron trifluoride (BF3) in methanol according to Joseph and Ackman (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). The FAME composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan), coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID). Fatty acids were identified by comparing the retention time using authentic standards of FAME (GLC85 reference standard, Nu-Chek-Prep, USA). The internal standard used was methyl tricosanoate (C23:0 reference standard, Nu-Chek-Prep). FAME were separated on a capillary column DB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 μm) (Agilent Technologies, USA). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at 0.6 mL/min. The chromatographic conditions were injector 250°C, split 1:50, injection volume 1 µL; oven: 100°C for 0.5 min, followed by an increment of 3°C/min to 260°C; FID was maintained at 280°C.
