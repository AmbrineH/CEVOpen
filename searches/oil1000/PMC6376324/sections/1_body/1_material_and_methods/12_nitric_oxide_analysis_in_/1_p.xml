<p class="p">NO production was determined by measuring the amount of nitrite in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages supernatant according to the Griess reaction (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>) with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/mL) with or without VOB (10–200 µg/mL) for 24 h. Next, the culture supernatant was mixed with Griess reagent (1:1) and incubated for 10 min. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured in an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMax 190; Molecular Devices) and the inhibitory rates were calculated using a standard calibration curve prepared with sodium nitrite compared to LPS-stimulated control group.
