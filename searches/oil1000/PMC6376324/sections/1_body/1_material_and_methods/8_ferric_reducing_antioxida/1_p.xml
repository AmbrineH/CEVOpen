<p class="p">Antioxidant capability of VOB was estimated as described by Pulido et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>) with modifications by Benevides et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). FRAP reagent was mixed with VOB or ethanol (for the reagent blank), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then the absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices). The results are reported as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (Âµg/mL). Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
