<p class="p">The determination of intracellular superoxide anion production was evaluated in LPS-activated murine macrophages RAW 264.7 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 2×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cell/mL in 96-well plates and cultured in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in air for 24 h. Then, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (10–200 µg/mL) of VOB for 24 h. After incubation, the supernatant was removed and 100 µL nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (1 mg/mL) was added to each well. The cells were washed with methanol and dried for 20 min at 37°C. After incubation of 2 h, the formazan crystals formed were dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Absorbance was measured at 620 nm, using a microplate reader (Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, FilterMax F5, Molecular Devices). The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
