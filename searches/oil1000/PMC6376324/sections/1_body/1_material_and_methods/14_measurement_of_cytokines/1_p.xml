<p class="p">Quantification of TNF-Î± and IL-6 production in the supernatant of LPS-activated murine macrophages RAW 264.7 after VOB exposure was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific antibodies (purified and biotinylated) and cytokine standards, according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience, USA). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, FilterMax F5, Molecular Devices). Cytokine levels are reported in pg and sensitivities were &gt;10 pg/mL.</p>
