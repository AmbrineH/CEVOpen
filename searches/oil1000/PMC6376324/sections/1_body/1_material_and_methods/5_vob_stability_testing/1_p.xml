<p class="p">To estimate the stability of the VOB and the expiration date, accelerated stability testing was performed according to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). The VOB sample was stored in a transparent, neutral glass bottle with a cover that guaranteed a proper seal avoiding loss of gases and evaporation to the medium. Then, the freshly prepared VOB was submitted to heating in an oven at 45±2°C, alternating with cooling in the refrigerator at 5±2°C, with cycles of 24 h each over 4 weeks. Organoleptic characteristics (color, odor, and appearance) and FAME profile were evaluated before and after the accelerated stability.
