<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> scratch wound assay was carried out as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>) with modifications (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). Briefly, fibroblasts were cultured to nearly confluent cell monolayers and then an artificial linear wound was made. Then, the monolayers were treated for 16 h with different concentrations of VOB (1–200 µg/mL). VOB was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and thereafter diluted in growth medium at the desired concentration. DMSO concentration in the wells was kept under 0.5% concentration. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was used as positive control. After incubation, cells were fixed and stained with 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) and the cellular migration into the wounded area was quantified using CellC
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> software (Finland). Results are reported as percentage of cells that migrated and/or proliferated into the injured area compared to the untreated control group.
