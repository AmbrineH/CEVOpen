<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was determined according to Re et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). In 96-well microplates, 270 µL of ABTS radical cation was mixed with 30 µL of VOB (1–2000 µg/mL) (ethanol for blank) and allowed to react in the dark during 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 734 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices). The results are reported as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (µg/mL). Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
