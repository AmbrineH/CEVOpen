<p class="p">Characterizations in the freshly prepared VOB and after the stability testing are reported as the percentage of total methyl esters and were analyzed by GC-FID. The VOB FAME composition is presented in 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> showing the presence of monounsaturated fatty acid (66.14%) with oleic acid (C18:1n-9; 63.39%) as the major lipid followed by the linoleic acid (C18:2n-6; 4.79%) and linolenic acid (C18:3n-3; 5.09%) as the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (10.72%). The fatty acid profile of the sample did not significantly change after accelerated stability testing, and the characteristics of the polyunsaturated fatty acids were preserved. Moreover, no changes in color, appearance, odor, or viscosity were observed after the accelerated stability test. The results indicated that organoleptic characteristics of the VOB were markedly stable during the test period.
