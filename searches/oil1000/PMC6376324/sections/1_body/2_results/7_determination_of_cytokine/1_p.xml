<p class="p">Concerning cytokines production, the effects of VOB on LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 macrophages were evaluated by measuring the production of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines. As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, stimulation with LPS for 24 h significantly induced the release of cytokines pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-6) indicating that an inflammatory response was induced in the macrophages. Interestingly, VOB significantly reduced the production of IL-6 and TNF-α production at 100 and 200 µg/mL.
