<p class="p">To evaluate 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> cell migration/proliferation, the scratch assay was performed using fibroblasts. After 16 h in culture with VOB at different concentrations, the results showed a positive dose-dependent enhancement in fibroblast migration/proliferation in the artificial gap, especially at 100 and 200 µg/mL VOB concentration reaching values of 49.2±5.1% and 57.5±3.7%, respectively, when compared to control cells (6.2±2.0%; P&lt;0.05). The significant stimulatory effects of VOB were comparable to PDGF (59.4±6.8%) used as positive control (
