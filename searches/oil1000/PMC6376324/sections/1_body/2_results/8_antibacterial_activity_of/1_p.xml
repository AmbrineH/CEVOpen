<p class="p">Wound bacterial colonization presents a continuous challenge in the treatment of skin injuries and wound healing. Therefore, antibacterial activity of VOB was preliminarily assayed against the common Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria and the Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria frequently hosted in cutaneous wounds (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). VOB exhibited only slight activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with a MIC value of 2000 µg/mL and did not exert any antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> up to 2000 µg/mL.
