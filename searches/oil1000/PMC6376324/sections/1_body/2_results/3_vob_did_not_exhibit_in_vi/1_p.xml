<p class="p">Next, the colorimetric MTT assay was performed to determine the appropriate concentration of the blend, which would not affect cellular viability. VOB was tested in non-cancerous L929 fibroblasts and murine macrophages RAW 267.7 cells. VOB did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect against fibroblasts and macrophages compared to basal control (only cell culture medium, considered as 100% viability), showing 112 and 108% viability at the highest concentration tested of 1000 Âµg/mL, respectively (
