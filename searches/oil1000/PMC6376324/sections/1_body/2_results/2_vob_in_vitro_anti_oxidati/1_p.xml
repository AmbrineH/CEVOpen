<p class="p">Natural antioxidants play an important role in providing stability to vegetable oils hampering their oxidation. Antioxidant activity should not be concluded based on a single antioxidant test model, therefore, antioxidant activity of VOB was evaluated using four different chemical assays and the results are presented in
