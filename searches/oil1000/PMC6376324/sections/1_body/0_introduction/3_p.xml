<p class="p">Wound healing is a natural process in which the body responds to an injury to protect itself from the outer environment while skin repair occurs simultaneously (
 <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Wound healing runs in three basic phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and maturation (
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). After skin injury, the wound healing process begins immediately with clotting formation at the wound site by platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. The pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±) are released to activate inflammatory cells (

 <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts are infiltrated to the wound site. Then, nitric oxide, oxygen free radicals, and matrix metalloproteinase are generated to prepare for the proliferation phase (

The proliferation phase involves epithelialization and angiogenesis in which transforming growth factors and epidermal growth factor are important factors for stimulating proliferation, migration, and differentiation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, forming extracellular matrix and collagen, and finally, tissue remodeling (
