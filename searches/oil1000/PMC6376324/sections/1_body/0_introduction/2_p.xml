<p class="p">Vegetable oils are composed primarily by triacylglycerols and a sparse amount of diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols. They also contain phospholipids, free sterols, tocopherols, and tocotrienols, triterpene alcohols, hydrocarbons, and fat-soluble vitamins in small amounts. Fatty acids composition of vegetable oils is classified according to the presence or absence of double bonds as saturated fatty acids (without double bonds), monounsaturated fatty acids (with one double bond), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (with more than two double bonds). The chain length and degree of unsaturation may have great influence on the chemical biological properties of these compounds. In addition, genetic and environmental factors can determine the proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids present in vegetable oils (
