  <title class="title">Vegetable oil blend (VOB) increased migration of fibroblasts in the scratch assay. Cells were treated with 1 to 200 µg/mL of VOB, 2 ng/mL of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), or only with medium as control. 
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>, Representative images were taken immediately after creating the wound (0 h) and after 16 h of incubation (100× magnification; bar 10 μm). 
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>, Percentage of cells after 16 h in the injured area compared to the scratch area at time zero (0 h). Data are reported as the mean±SE of two independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05 compared to control group;
