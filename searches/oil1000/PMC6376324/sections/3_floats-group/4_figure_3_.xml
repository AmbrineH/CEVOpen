  <title class="title">Inhibitory effects of vegetable oil blend (VOB) on nitrite production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 cells. LPS (1 µg/mL) with or without VOB (10 to 200 µg/mL) was added to cells and nitrite concentration was measured by Griess reaction assay. Data are reported as means±SE of triplicate experiments. *P&lt;0.05 compared with the LPS-treated group.
