<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity (MIC and MBC) of the total EO, α-pinene, and myrcene was determined against all tested strains. Only the MBC values are reported, because the MIC values were difficult to interpret due to turbidity (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The MBC of the whole EO and of myrcene were ≥ 2048 μg/mL, whereas those of α-pinene ranged from 1024 to &gt; 2048 μg/mL, suggesting that both components contribute to the bactericidal activity of the extract against the
