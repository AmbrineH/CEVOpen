<p class="p">The ability of a sublethal concentration of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO to attenuate 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> virulence was tested 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> using the 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> model. Larvae were infected with 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains grown with and without (control) 256 Î¼g/mL of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO. Larvae were considered dead when they turned black and did not respond to touch. On day 6 after infection with listeriae, larval mortality was about 50% in the group infected with the strains grown without the EO whereas, remarkably, survival rates greater than 90% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0009) were seen in the group infected with the strains grown with the EO (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7A,B</xref>). PBS (negative control) did not result in larval mortality (data not shown).
