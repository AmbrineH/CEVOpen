 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> motility was first evaluated by measuring colony diameter and by the “umbrella motility test” after growth on soft agar containing a sublethal concentration (256 μg/mL) of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A,B</xref>). A significant, concentration-dependent, reduction in colony diameter (from 50.0 to 79.8 %) was observed in all strains (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>). Moreover, strains grown in presence of 256 μg/mL of the extract did not show the typical umbrella-like growth (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>). LM examination after flagella staining showed that, unlike control strains, the listeriae incubated with 256 μg/mL of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO formed aggregates with the flagella trapped inside the cluster (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>). SEM observation confirmed these findings and demonstrated that there were fewer flagella in the extract-incubated strains (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>).
