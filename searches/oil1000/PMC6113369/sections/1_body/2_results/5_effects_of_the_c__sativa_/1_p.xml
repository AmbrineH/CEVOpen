<p class="p">All 11 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains were found to be biofilm producers: 4 strains (#66785, #02470, #09707, and #82468) were strong producers, 6 (#56053, #31829, #77660, #97885, #75227, and #80466) were moderate producers, and one (#60551) was a weak producer. To evaluate the ability of the EO to interfere with biofilm formation, all strains were tested for biofilm production in presence of sublethal (256, 128, and 64 μg/mL) EO concentrations. A reduction in biofilm production was induced by all concentrations in all strains. The 256 μg/mL concentration reduced biofilm production by 25–69%; a similar reduction was observed with 128 μg/mL (from 32 to 73%) and 64 μg/mL (from 15 to 65%) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Except #60551 (weak producer), all the moderate/strong biofilm producers became weak producers at all EO concentrations.
