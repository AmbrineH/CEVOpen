<p class="p">Preliminary Caco-2 infection experiments were conducted to ascertain the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains to enter Caco-2 cells in the gentamicin survival test. Three strains were excluded from further experiments due to low invasion efficiency; the other 8 strains, which showed an invasion efficiency up to 4.1% of the initial inoculum, were used in infection inhibition experiments. Remarkably, the invasion efficiency of Caco-2 cells by 7/8 strains was strongly reduced (from 25.9 to 97%) when bacteria were grown in presence of 256 Î¼g/mL of the
