<p class="p">The viability of infected Caco-2 cells was assessed with trypan blue, which stains dead cells but is actively excluded from viable eukaryotic cells. The test demonstrated a dramatic CPE reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains grown in presence of 256 Î¼g/mL of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>), in particular, the monolayers infected with the extract-exposed strains were actually indistinguishable from the uninfected monolayers, whereas the CPE of control monolayers, i.e., those infected with strains grown without the EO, took the form of large, almost contiguous, stained areas.
