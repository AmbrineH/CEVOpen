 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> L. (Cannabaceae), an annual species that has spread from its native range in central Asia to Europe and Africa, is one of the earliest domestic plants in the history of mankind and has been grown and selected for thousands of years for a multiplicity of purposes, like a source of food, fuel, paper, and building material, as a textile fiber, and as a remedy in folk medicine (Andre et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The plant is a source of several bioactive compounds including psychoactive substances such as cannabinoids (the most important being Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, Δ9-THC), terpenoids, flavonoids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the late 1930s, the psychotropic effects due to Δ9-THC led to a ban on its cultivation worldwide. In recent years, selection of some genotypes containing low Δ9-THC concentrations (≤0.2% w/v) has led to a lifting of the ban; the plant can now be grown legally (Holler et al.,
