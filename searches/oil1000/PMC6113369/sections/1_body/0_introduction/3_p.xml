 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, a Gram-positive, facultative intracellular pathogen with a wide environmental distribution, is the causative agent of human and animal listeriosis (Freitag et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The disease is the most lethal zoonosis in the EU (fatality rate, 20%), affecting particularly immunocompromised and elderly individuals (EFSA and ECDC, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Infection of the human host is commonly via the oral route, through ingestion of contaminated food, although transplacental transmission during gestation also occurs. Severe 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> infection include septicaemia, meningitis, endocarditis, and spontaneous abortion (McDougal and Sauer, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Infection requires bacterial internalization into host cells, intracellular survival, and spread into neighboring cells, which enable bacterial diffusion from the primary site of infection, usually the bowel, to the liver, the spleen, and on to peripheral blood and eventually the brain. A limited subset of serotypes (i.e., 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) is responsible for the bulk of clinical cases worldwide (Kathariou, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>); the serotype most frequently associated with listeriosis outbreaks, particularly in Europe and North America, is 1/2a (Lomonaco et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> is intrinsically resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics (Krawczyk-Balska and Markiewicz, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and shows acquired resistance to other drugs. Treatment with aminopenicillin or benzylpenicillin, alone or combined with an aminoglycoside, is currently the gold standard antibiotic therapy for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> infections (Th√∏nnings et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, listeriae are difficult to eradicate, due to their intracellular location and the poor intracellular penetration of these drugs. Their ability to persist within biofilms and to develop resistance to sanitizers is the cause of significant problems in food processing plants and of steep costs for the food industry (Colagiorgi et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Boqvist et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>).
