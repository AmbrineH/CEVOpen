<p class="p">Flagellum-based motility and biofilm formation have also been implicated in virulence (Josenhans and Suerbaum, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Duan et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The biosynthesis of flagella is temperature-dependent, since most 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains produce flagella and are motile only at temperatures of 30Â°C and less (Peel et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>). Flagellum-mediated motility is critical both for initial surface attachment and subsequent biofilm formation (Lemon et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>).
