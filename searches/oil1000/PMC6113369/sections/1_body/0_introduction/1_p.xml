<p class="p">In recent years, the use of plant products as alternative/adjunct antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic microorganisms has been attracting mounting interest. Anti-virulence strategies are being explored as a novel approach to combat bacterial pathogens; such approaches include inhibition of surface adhesion, tissue invasion, toxin production, and/or interference with the gene regulation of other virulence traits (Rasko and Sperandio, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). A major group of plant antimicrobial compounds is represented by essential oils (EO), complex mixtures of volatile secondary metabolites belonging to different chemical families including terpenes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, and phenols (Cannas, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of EO and their components has been known for millennia. More recently, synergy between EO components and antibiotics has been demonstrated against antibiotic-resistant pathogens (Langeveld et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In contrast, the knowledge of the effects of EO on bacterial virulence is still very limited (Nazzaro et al.,

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
