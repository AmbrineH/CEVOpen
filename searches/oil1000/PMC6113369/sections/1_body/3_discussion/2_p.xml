<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of freshly extracted EO from industrial 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> varieties has been assessed by Nissen et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mostly food-borne pathogens. In this study, GC-MS analysis of the EO obtained by distillation of the inflorescences and leaves of the variety Futura 75 disclosed a chemical composition similar to the one reported by Nissen et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) for this variety. Susceptibility experiments, carried out by the microdilution method, demonstrated that the EO and its two main components, Î±-pinene and myrcene, showed moderate bactericidal activity against clinical strains of
