<p class="p">Targeting microbial virulence rather than survival is an exciting novel strategy with the potential to reduce the evolutionary pressure for the development of resistance. Food contamination by 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> remains a major concern for the food processing industry, particularly the plants making ready-to-eat and processed food. The present work provides a baseline in the study of the anti-virulence properties of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. Further studies are needed to understand if it could be used as an alternative agent for the control of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in food processing plants.
