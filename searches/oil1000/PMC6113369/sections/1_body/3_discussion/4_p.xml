<p class="p">Since flagella and flagellum-mediated motility are important virulence traits of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> for initial surface attachment and subsequent biofilm formation (Lemon et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) as well as for cell invasion (Dons et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that a reduction of motility by sublethal concentrations of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO would affect biofilm-forming and cell invasion ability. The hypothesis was successfully demonstrated. Remarkably, the number of intracellular listeriae (gentamicin survival test) was almost zero when Caco-2 cells were infected with listeriae exposed to the EO and their viability was unaffected (trypan blue test). The present results therefore clearly demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO can affect the virulence of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes in vitro</italic>.
