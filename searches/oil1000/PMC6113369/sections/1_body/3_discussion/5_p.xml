 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic> experiments using 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> larvae as a model (Rakic Martinez et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) were performed to establish whether incubation of listeriae with sublethal concentrations of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO would prevent larval infection. The test has recently emerged as a promising model to assess the virulence of numerous human pathogens, including 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. In our study, larvae infected with 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> grown in presence of sublethal EO concentrations showed a significantly higher survival compared with larvae infected with untreated listeriae. Thus, the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> experiments confirmed the protective activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> infection.
