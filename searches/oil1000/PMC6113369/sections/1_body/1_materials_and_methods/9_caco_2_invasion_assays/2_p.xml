<p class="p">Invasion experiments were performed using 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strains grown in presence of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO. Briefly, after overnight growth in BHI broth supplemented with EO, listeriae were resuspended in PBS to OD
 <sub class="sub">550</sub> 0.6 ± 0.02. Then, 1 mL of the suspension, suitably diluted in MEM, was added to each well to obtain a multiplicity of infection of about 30 bacteria/cell. Penetration was allowed to occur for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Then monolayers were washed 3 times and covered with 2 mL MEM containing a bactericidal concentration of gentamicin (10 μg/mL), to kill extracellular bacteria. After 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> air, cells were washed 3 times and lysed in 1 mL Triton X-100 (0.1% in cold sterile water). The CFU of viable bacteria were counted by plating suitable dilutions of the lysates on BHI agar and incubating them for 36-48 h at 37°C. Data are expressed as a percentage of initial inoculum of viable bacteria. Experiments were carried out in triplicate.
