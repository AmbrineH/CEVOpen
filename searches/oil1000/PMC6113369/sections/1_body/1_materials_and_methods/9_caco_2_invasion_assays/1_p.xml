<p class="p">The human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cell line (ATCC HTB37) (Rousset, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1986</xref>) was used in cell invasion experiments. Cells were routinely cultured in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM; Gibco, New York, NY, USA) supplemented with 1% (v/v) L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (both from Gibco) in 50 mL (25 cm
