 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> cells grown on BAB agar at 30°C with and without the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO were fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4°C and washed with the same buffer supplemented with 7% sucrose. Samples were left to adhere on glass slides covered with 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy), postfixed in 1% OsO

Samples were mounted on aluminum stubs by graphite glue (Sigma Aldrich) and coated with a thin (20 Å) gold film using an EMITECH K550 (Ashford, England) sputtering device. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were performed with a Zeiss Supra 40 apparatus.
