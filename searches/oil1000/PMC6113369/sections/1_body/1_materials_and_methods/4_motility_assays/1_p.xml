<p class="p">Motility of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in presence of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO was assessed by the “umbrella test” in semi-solid agar stabbed with the strains and incubated overnight at 30°C. Detection of an umbrella-like growth about 0.5 cm below the agar surface indicated a positive test. Motility was also assessed by measuring the diameter of the growth zone with respect to control bacteria on 0.3% soft agar plates inoculated with 10 μL of a broth culture and incubated overnight at 30°C.
