<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), i.e., the lowest EO concentration inhibiting visible bacterial growth after incubation, was determined in blood-supplemented CAMHB by the microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), i.e., the lowest EO concentration killing 99.9% of the inoculum, was determined by plating 10 μL of each microdilution on blood-supplemented MHA followed by overnight incubation at 37°C. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
