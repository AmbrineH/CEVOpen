<p class="p">The effect of the EO on the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> virulence genes was investigated using real time RT-PCR. Strains were grown in presence of EO at 30Â°C in TSB, and total RNA was extracted using GenElute total RNA Purification kit (Sigma Aldrich). cDNA synthesis was performed using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and synthesized cDNA was used as the RT-qPCR template. The amplification product was detected using SYBR Green reagents (SYBR Green JumpStar Taq ReadyMix, Sigma Aldrich) by Rotor-Gene (Qiagen). The primers for each gene are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Data were normalized to the endogenous control (16S rRNA) and the level of candidate gene expression between treated and untreated samples was compared to study relative gene expression and the effect of EO on each gene.
