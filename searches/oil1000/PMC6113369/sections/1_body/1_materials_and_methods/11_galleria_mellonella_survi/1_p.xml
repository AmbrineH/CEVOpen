<p class="p">Final instar larvae (~300 mg) of the greater wax moth 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> were purchased from a local vendor, stored in the dark at 15°C, and used within 7 days. Larvae were rinsed with 70% EtOH before injection using a standard protocol (Mukherjee et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Ten larvae were randomly allocated to different treatment groups: positive control (larvae inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>); test group (larvae injected with 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> grown in presence of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO); negative control (larvae that were not injected); PBS control (larvae injected with PBS). Before infection, bacteria were washed and resuspended in PBS at the appropriate cell density (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/mL); then, 50 μL of the inoculum was injected into the larval haemocoel via the left proleg using a microsyringe (Mukherjee et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). After injection, larvae were incubated at 30°C in sterile Petri plates. The number of dead larvae was scored at 24 h intervals for 6 days. Larvae were considered dead when they turned black and failed to react to touch. Three separate experiments were conducted. 
 <italic class="italic">G. mellonella</italic> survival data were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method.
