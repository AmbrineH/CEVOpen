<p class="p">The ability of listeriae to cause cytopathogenic effects (CPE) in Caco-2 monolayers was evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion assay (Gibco), which measures cell viability (Facinelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>). Briefly, Caco-2 monolayers grown in slide flasks (Corning Costar) were infected with bacterial strains grown with and without the 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> EO, as described above. Control monolayers received MEM without bacteria. At the end of the infection period (1 h), the supernatant was removed and monolayers were washed and covered with MEM supplemented with gentamicin (10 μg/mL). After overnight incubation at 37°C in 5% CO

Finally, the culture medium with the dye was removed and monolayers were examined with a Leica DMRB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using a 10 × objective.
