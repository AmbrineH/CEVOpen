 <p> Caco-2 cell invasion by L. monocytogenes strains grown in presence of the C. sativa EO. Data are expressed as percentage (compared with the initial inoculum) of viable bacteria recovered after 2 h incubation with gentamicin (gentamicin survival test). Each column is the mean of three experiments. Asterisks indicate significant values ( p â‰¤ 0.05) compared with control ( L. monocytogenes strains grown in the absence of EO). </p>
