 <p> Biofilm production by L. monocytogenes in presence of the C. sativa EO. Exposure to the three EO concentrations resulted in a shift to a lower producer type in all but one (#60551) of the 11 strains. Values are mean OD 690 ± SD of three experiments. Asterisks indicate significant values ( p ≤ 0.05) compared with control ( L. monocytogenes strain grown in the absence of EO). </p>
