 <p> Expression of motility genes of L. monocytogenes strain #80466 grown in presence of the C. sativa EO. Gene expression was normalized to the expression of the 16S rRNA gene in the same conditions compared to the control and is presented as x-fold: (A) prfA; (B) flaA; (C) motA and motB. Mean values and standard deviations of three experiments. Asterisks indicate significant values compared with control ( p â‰¤ 0.05). CTR, control ( L. monocytogenes strain grown in the absence of EO). </p>
