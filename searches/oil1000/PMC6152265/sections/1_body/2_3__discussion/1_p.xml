<p class="p">Cancer cells survive by multiple molecular signaling pathways. Therefore chemopreventive agents must effectively influence different signaling pathways as compared to targeting just one pathway. Cancer chemoprevention needs the cooperation of multidisciplinary groups to find target specific and less toxic agents to block, retard, or reverse the carcinogenic process. Since citrus EOs are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-01391" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], they have been widely used as natural food additives and accepted by the consumers all over the world. Commercial orange EOs are mainly prepared by the cold pressing method. They consist of volatile components such as terpenes along with some nonvolatile waxy materials, carotenoids, and flavonoids. A hydrodistillation method to prepare orange EO was used in the laboratory on a small scale. Molecular distillation is very useful to separate thermally sensitive EOs and is extensively used in the flavor and fragrance industry. In our study, molecular distillation was used to remove undesired pigments and waxes from the cold pressed EO to provide EO fractions which are potentially beneficial for use as chemotherapy agents. If we change the parameters of molecular distillation, different EO fractions will be obtained. In the future, we will test more EO fractions to find ones with even better anticancer activity. This method can also be applied to other essential oils.
