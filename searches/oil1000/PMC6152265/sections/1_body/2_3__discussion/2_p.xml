<p class="p">Essential oils are among of the most valuable plant products used in medicine and complementary treatment strategies [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-01391" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, the beneficial role of NOEO and its constituents in cancer treatment is not clear yet. In order to identify the possible anticancer components of navel orange oil, seven major components were tested. They were observed to have good anticancer activity, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values ranging from 141 to 22 μg/mL. The seven components were 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, which is a representative monoterpene in many citrus species, linalool, 3-carene, α-terpineol, decanal, citral and α-pinene. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of these seven compounds were all higher than that of NOEO, suggesting that other non-tested constituents in the essential oil might be responsible for the activity of the oil. NOEO prepared by molecular distillation could be considered a potential source of new active anticancer agents. In order to appraise the practical value of this possible therapeutic application, further evaluation should be carried out to clarify the mechanism of action of the seven bioactive components.
