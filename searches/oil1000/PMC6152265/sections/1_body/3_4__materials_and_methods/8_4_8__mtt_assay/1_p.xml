<p class="p">The NOEO and single constituents of essential oil were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The tested cells (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per well) were treated with orange oil at different concentrations (6.25–200 μg/mL) in a 96-well culture plate for 24, 48, 72 h. The cells were incubated with 20 μL of MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL) at 37 °C for 4 h, and then washed three times with 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS). DMSO (150 μL) was added and the absorbance of each sample was recorded at 570 nm. The experiments were repeated three times and each experiment had three replicate wells.
