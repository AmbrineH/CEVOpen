<p class="p">The free radical-scavenging activity of NOEO was measured using the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The analysis was performed in microplates by adding different concentrations of essential oil (1 mL) to a methanolic DPPH solution (3 mL, 0.1 mmol/L). The absorbance at 517 nm was read in an ultravioletâ€“visible spectrophotometer (UH-5300, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The absorbance of DPPH without NOEO (control sample) was used as the baseline measurement.</p>
