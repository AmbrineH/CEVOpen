<p class="p">The scavenging activity was expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>), which was defined as the sample concentration (μg/mL) necessary to inhibit DPPH radical activity by 50% after a 1-h incubation. These experiments were performed in triplicate (three independent experiments and three technical replicates for each experiment), and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
