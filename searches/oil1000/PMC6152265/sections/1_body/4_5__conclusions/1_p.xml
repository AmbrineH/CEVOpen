<p class="p">In this study, an essential oil (NOEO) was obtained by molecular distillation of cold-pressed navel orange essential oil. NOEO displayed good anti-oxidation and anti-cancer activity. We described a novel method to prepare essential oil distillation fractions that can be used as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of lung cancer and prostate cancer.</p>
