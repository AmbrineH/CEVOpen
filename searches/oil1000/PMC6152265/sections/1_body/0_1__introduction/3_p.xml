<p class="p">The current method used in most countries for manufacturing cold-pressed orange oil is simultaneous extraction of a juice and oil emulsion from the whole fruit. Cold-Pressed orange oil contains waxes, pesticide residues and carotenoids, which may interfere with our anticancer activity research. To avoid this problem, we used a molecular distillation method to remove them. The separation principle of molecular distillation is based on the difference of molecular mean free path [

Although chemical components of most orange essential oils have been identified, their anticancer activities have not been investigated systematically. In this study, we prepared an essential oil sample (Navel Orange Essential Oil, NOEO) by molecular distillation of cold-pressed navel orange oil. Its constituents were identified by GC-MS. An MTT assay was used to evaluate the effects of this orange oil sample and its seven single constituents on the proliferation of a human lung cancer cell line A549 and prostate cancer cell line 22RV-1. We expect this work will provide information for developing chemopreventive agents for cancer treatment.
