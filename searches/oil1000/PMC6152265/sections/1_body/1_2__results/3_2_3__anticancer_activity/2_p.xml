<p class="p">The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent, and the higher the concentration of NOEO, the better the inhibition. To further explore the inhibition effect of NOEO on proliferation of A549 cells, a cell apoptosis experiment was investigated. A549 cells were treated with 100 Âµg/mL of NOEO for 24 h and apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin-V FITC/PI assay.</p>
