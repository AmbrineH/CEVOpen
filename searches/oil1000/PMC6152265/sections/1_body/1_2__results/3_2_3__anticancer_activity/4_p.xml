<p class="p">In an effort to explore other possible anticancer activity of the essential oil, seven of its major components were tested for their anticancer activity. NOEO is composed of terpene hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters. Among them, terpene hydrocarbons, especially monoterpenes, are the predominant ingredients of NOEO. We chose three monoterpenes: limonene, which is the most predominant ingredient, α-pinene and 3-carene, which are typical ingredients of orange EO. We also chose two alcohols: linalool and α-terpineol and two aldehydes: citral and decanal to do anticancer tests because they are also important ingredients of orange EO and commercially available. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01391-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, inhibition of proliferation of A549 cells were in a decreasing order as follows: linalool, 3-carene, α-terpineol, decanal, citral, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and α-pinene. Their inhibitory activities were concentration dependent (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of the NOEO in the MTT assays was 17.53 ± 0.50 μg/mL, while those of the compounds linalool, 3-carene, α-terpineol, decanal, citral, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and α-pinene were much higher at 141.76 ± 14.59, 70.80 ± 8.24, 51.37 ± 4.92, 37.10 ± 2.96, 35.15 ± 2.38, 22.10 ± 1.94 and 22.01 ± 1.75 μg/mL, respectively. These data indicate that the capacity of the essential oil to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells was higher than that of the seven constituents tested. Since NOEO had higher activity than any one of the seven constituents individually, it is possible that other active compounds are present or that the active components were interacting synergistically to inhibit proliferation.
