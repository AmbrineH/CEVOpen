 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01391" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This evidence suggested that NOEO might have good anticancer activity as well. In our study, the MTT assay was used to evaluate the effect of NOEO on the cell viability of A549 (a human lung cancer) cells and 22RV1 (a human prostate cancer) cells as an assessment of anticancer activity. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of NOEO on A549 cells at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were 17.53 ± 0.95, 10.70 ± 0.53, and 7.86 ± 0.38, respectively. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of NOEO on 22RV-1 cells at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were 45.74 ± 1.68, 42.83 ± 1.64, and 39.79 ± 1.60, respectively. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01391-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) showed that NOEO had good inhibition of proliferation of both cell lines at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 200 µg/mL.
