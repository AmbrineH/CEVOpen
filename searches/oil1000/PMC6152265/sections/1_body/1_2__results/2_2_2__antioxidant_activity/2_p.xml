<p class="p">The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays are the classic methods to detect the antioxidant activity of chemical compounds. The antioxidant activity of the NOEO was therefore measured according to the DPPH assay and ABTS assay, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 2.19 ± 0.20 mg/mL and 2.00 ± 0.19 mg/mL, respectively. Our results showed that NOEO had better antioxidant activity than cold-pressed orange oil in the DPPH assay (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.01 ± 0.20 mg/mL) and in the ABTS assay (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 23.25 ± 0.84 mg/mL) [

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 40 mg/mL) and better activity than distilled grapefruit oil in the ABTS assay (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 27.5 mg/mL) [
