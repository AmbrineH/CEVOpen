 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b) after 7 and 28 days, respectively, with an enhancement of 27.39% and 25.51% as compared to sample S35NC0 which contains SF only. The cement resistance to tension declined when 4% of NC is added, since the system overloaded with the nanoparticle, and hence, an irregular microstructure is expected to be developed. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows that sample S35NC4 tensile strengths at low-temperature conditions are 5.56 and 5.80 MPa after 7 and 28 days, respectively, at high-temperature conditions the tensile strengths of sample S35NC4 decreased by 25.10% and 15.30% compared to sample S35NC0 after 7 and 28 days respectively.
