<p class="p">The base sample (S0NC0) has a permeability of 0.0055 and 0.0057 mD after 7 and 28 days, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. This figure also shows that the addition of 35% SF into the cement formulation (sample S35NC0) was able to decrease the cement permeability by 47.27% after 7 days (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b) compared with sample S0NC0. The cement permeability could be decreased more by incorporating NC particles as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b, the addition of 2% NC (sample S35NC2) decreased the cement permeability by 20.69% and 19.23% compared to sample S35NC0, which had SF only. When 3% of NC particles were added, the cement permeability slightly increased (compared to the sample with 2% NC) by 0.0002 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b) after 7 and 28 days, respectively, the reason for this slight increase will be explained in the next section.
