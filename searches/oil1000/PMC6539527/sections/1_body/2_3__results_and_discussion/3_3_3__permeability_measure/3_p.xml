<p class="p">Increasing the NC concentration beyond 3% (i.e., 4% of nanoclay for sample S35NC4), as in the case of sample S35NC4, lead to a huge increase in the permeability which increased to 0.0052 and 0.0055 mD after 7 and 28 days, respectively, compared with 0.0025 and 0.0024 mD for sample S35NC3. This huge increase in the permeability is caused by the agglomeration of the nanoparticles. The use of a higher concentration of nanoparticles could lead to particles agglomeration as reported earlier by Shebl et al. [

 <xref rid="B39-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] which results in an irregular microstructure, and hence, high permeability. Then when sample S35NC4 exposed to high-temperature, induced microcracks caused by the irregular microstructure could be easily formed. The evaporated water from the cement matrix and the loss of the water absorbed by nanoclays at high temperature is also responsible about this increase in the permeability as will be explained in the next section.
