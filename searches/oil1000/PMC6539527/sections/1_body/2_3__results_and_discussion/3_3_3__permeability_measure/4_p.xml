 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> compares between two permeability values for each cement sample at every curing period. For every curing time (i.e., 7 and 28 days) one sample was cured at 38 째C using the water bath for the whole period while another sample removed and curing at 300 째C during the last three days of curing to represent a condition similar to one cycle of steam injection. 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> shows that sample S0NC0 which has no SF or NC experienced a considerable increase in its permeability when exposed to 300 째C during the last three days of curing compared with the same sample cured at low-temperature of 38 째C for the whole curing period. Sample S0NC0 permeability increased by 71.88% and 96.55% after 7 and 28 days, respectively.
