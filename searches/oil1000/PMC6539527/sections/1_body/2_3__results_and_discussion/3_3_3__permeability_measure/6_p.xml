<p class="p">It’s noticed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> that the permeability values for all NC based samples increased when exposed to high-temperature conditions compared with the permeability of the same samples when cured at the low-temperature conditions. This increase is very small for the samples with NC of not more than 3%, for example, sample S35NC3 permeability increased by 0.0013 and 0.0014 mD after 7 and 28 days, respectively, after exposure to 300 °C compared with when sample S35NC3 is cured at low temperature only. Although of this increase all the samples with NC concentrations of not more than 3% still have permeabilities less than the sample S35NC0 which has no NC particles, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Sample S35NC4 with 4% NC experienced a considerable increase in the permeability by 92.56% and 120% after 7 and 28 days, respectively, when subjected to 300 °C.
