<p class="p">Addition of NC particles up to 3% BWOC to the slurry containing 35% BWOC of SF enhanced the cement strength no matter the temperature used. At low temperature (38 Â°C), 3% of the NC were able to increase the strength of the cement by 26.10%, after 7 days and by 22.36% after 28 days over that obtained by using 35% of SF only (sample S35NC0), this could be explained as a result of the quick reaction of the NC particles which are characterized by the extremely large surface area and its amorphous state (small particle size) with the free lime during the hydration process, and hence, more secondary C-S-H gel will be produced which will effectively fill the cement matrix capillary pores [
