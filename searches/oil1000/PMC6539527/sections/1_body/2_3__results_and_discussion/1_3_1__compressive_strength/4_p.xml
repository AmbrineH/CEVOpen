<p class="p">At high temperature (300 Â°C), adding 1, 2, or 3% BWOC of the NC particles which are stable at a temperature conditions to the slurry with 35%BWOC of SF was able to enhance the strength retrogression resistance compared to the sample S35NC0 which has only SF particles after both 7 and 28 days of curing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The strength increased to 53.0 MPa after 7 days when 3% NC is added compared to 43.3 MPa for sample S35NC0, and after 28 days the strengths of 57.1 and 43.5 MPa were observed for S35NC3 and S35NC0, respectively.
