<p class="p">When 35% BWOC of the SF only is added to the cement slurry (sample S35NC0), a considerable increase in the cement resistance to the strength retrogression at a temperature of 300 °C was observed after 7 and 28 days, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The strength of the sample S35NC0 exposed to 300 °C after 7 days is 41.6 MPa compared to 8.4 Mpa for the base sample (S0NC0), and after 28 days the strength was 43.5 Mpa when the sample subjected to one steam injection cycle condition (
