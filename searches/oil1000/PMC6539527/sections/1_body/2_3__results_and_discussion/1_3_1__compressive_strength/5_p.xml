<p class="p">In both cases of low and high temperatures, addition of 4% BWOC of NC (sample S35NC4) lead to deterioration of the cement strength. The compressive strength of sample S35NC4 after 7 days in the case of high-temperature scenario becomes 28.9 MPa which is less than that of the sample with zero nanoclay (41.6 MPa), and after 28 days it becomes 32.0 MPa, which is again less than that of the sample with zero nanoclay (43.5 MPa). This result is attributed to the fact that the use of high concentration of nanoparticles (i.e., more than 3%) will lead to nanoparticle agglomeration in the mixes. Formation of weak zones will occur because of these aggregations, which in turn prevents homogenous hydrate formations to form, as a result, the strength of the cement will deteriorate at low-temperature conditions and the strength retrogression resistance will drastically decrease when the cement matrix exposed to high-temperature conditions [
