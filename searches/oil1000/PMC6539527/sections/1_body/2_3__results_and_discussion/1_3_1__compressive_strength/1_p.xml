<p class="p">In this section, the effect of temperature on the strength retrogression for the different slurries under consideration is evaluated; since the cement strength retrogression is expected to occur when the well temperature exceeds 110 °C [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> compares the change in the strength for all the cement formulations with and without subjecting the cement samples to 300 °C. The base sample (S0NC0) which has zero SF and NC content lost 81.12% and 79.46% of its original strength after 7 and 28 days of curing, respectively, when exposed to 300 °C condition. The strength of the sample S0NC0 after 7 days decreased from 44.5 to 8.4 MPa and after 28 days decreased from 48.2 to 9.9 MPa when undergoes a condition similar to one cycle of steam injection.
