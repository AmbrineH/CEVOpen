 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> that the 10-s and 10-min GS increased as a function of the NC concentration in the cement slurry to reach 16.0 and 43.2 lb
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>/100 ft
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively. The GS is an important parameter needed while designing the cement slurry since it indicates the ability of the cement to keep the solids particles suspended in the solution when pumping is stopped for any reason, as well as it indicates the energy needed to resume slurry pumping again. Including NC particles into the cement slurry increased its GS, which means prevention of solids segregation and settlement of fine particles when cement circulation is stopped for any reasons, but on the other hand, this may affect the pumpability of the cement especially if the cement circulation is stopped for long time.
