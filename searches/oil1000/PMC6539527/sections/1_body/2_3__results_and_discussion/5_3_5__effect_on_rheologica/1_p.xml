<p class="p">The effect of the NC particles on the rheological characteristics of cement slurry was evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, sample S35NC0 which contain 35% of the SF and no NC particles had PV and YP of 281 cP and 44.6 lb
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>/100 ft
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively. Incorporating NC into the cement slurries increased both the PV and YP of the slurry. Addition of 1% BWOC of NC to the cement slurry (sample S35NC1) increased the PV and YP of the cement by 7.5% and 3.6%, respectively, compared to sample S35NC0. Both PV and YP of the cement slurries increased with the increase in the NC concentration to reach 416 cP and 60.9 lb
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>/100 ft
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively, for sample S35NC4 containing 4% BWOC of NC. It is very important to address the change in the PV and YP of the cement slurry; since PV is the main factor controlling the pumpability of the cement slurry from the surface down into the wellbore through the tubing and then up through the annulus between the well casing and the drilled formations, while the increase in the YP of the slurry is required to improve the carrying capacity of the cement slurry. Compared with the base cement slurry, the cement slurries containing NC required high energy to be pumped into the well as indicated by the increase in the PV for the samples containing NC. Addition of the NC particles into the cement slurry also increased its YP, which means prevention of solids segregation and settlement of fine particles while cement is injected to fill the annular space between the drilled formations and the well casing.
