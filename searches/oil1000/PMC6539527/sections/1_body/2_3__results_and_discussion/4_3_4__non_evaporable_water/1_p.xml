These samples exposed to the high-temperature condition after being aged for 4 and 25 days at low-temperature conditions of 38 째C, so the total aging times are 7 and 28 days (the same second scenario in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> show that the sample with no SF and NC particles lost minor non-evaporable water of 1.21% and 1.10% after 7 and 28 days, respectively. This result confirms that the huge increase in the permeabilities of sample S0NC0 (
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>) when exposed to a high-temperature condition is related to the matrix damage and not water evaporation, the optical microscope image in
