<p class="p">Although sample S35NC4 non-evaporable water content is the highest (6.10% and 6.23% after 7 and 28 days, respectively), this does not confirm that the enhancement in the permeability of this sample when subjected to 300 °C compared with when treated at 38 °C as shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> is mainly related to the non-evaporable water when compared with the non-evaporable water content and permeability increase for sample S35NC3, since both samples have high non-evaporable water concentration but the permeability enhancement for the sample S35NC4 is very high compared to sample S35NC3

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> confirms that sample S35NC4 is dominated by microporous which is a result of a non-uniform microstructure of this sample caused by the agglomeration of the NC particles.
