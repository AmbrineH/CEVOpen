<p class="p">Incorporating NC into the cement matrix increased the concentration of the non-evaporable water remains after the samples were dried at 105 °C, which confirms that the increase in the samples S35NC1, S35NC2, and S35NC3 permeabilities after heating the samples at 300 °C compared to the samples cured at 38 °C (
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>) is related mainly to the evaporation of the water absorbed by the NC particles, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01452-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows that these samples have fewer void spaces compared with the samples with no NC, which confirm that the increase in the permeability of these samples is not due to cement matrix damage.
