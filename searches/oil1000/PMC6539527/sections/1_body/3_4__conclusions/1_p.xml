<p class="p">In this study, the effect of incorporating nanoclay particles into the cement matrix compressive and tensile strengths, permeability, and non-evaporable water content at low (38 째C) and high (300 째C) temperature conditions was evaluated. Adding nanoclay particles with concentrations not more than 3% BWOC improved the cement resistance to failure under compression and tension at low and high-temperature conditions as a result of accelerating the cement hydration reaction. It also showed a decrease in the permeability at both low and high temperatures compared to the base cement samples with and without silica flour. When the nanoclays are added with concentrations greater than 3% BWOC, agglomeration of the nanoparticles adversely affected the compressive and tensile strengths at 38 째C and 300 째C; the permeability of the samples was also increased considerably at low temperature due to the microstructure irregularity caused by nanoparticles agglomeration and at high temperature due to samples damage and loss of non-evaporable water. The microscope images confirmed that including NC particles (&lt;3%) improved the pores filling of the cement matrix, while adding more NC (&gt;3%) affected the pore structure of the cement matrix negatively by increasing concentration of the pore space of the cement. Incorporation of NC particles increased all of the cement slurry rheological properties.</p>
