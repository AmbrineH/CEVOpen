<p class="p">After preparation, some of the slurries were poured into 50.8 mm edge metallic cubical molds for compressive strength testing and the remaining poured into cylindrical molds of 38.1 mm in diameter and 22.9 mm in length for tensile strength testing, permeability measurements, and water loss testing. The molds were then submerged in a water bath at 38 °C for a specific time. All the formulations in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> were evaluated in two different scenarios. The low temperature of which (38 °C) was used as a reference, and the high temperature of 300 °C which was used to represent the average temperature for wells to undergo cyclic steam injection for EOR. In the case of the low temperature, the samples were submerged into the water bath for 7 and 28 days before testing for the compressive and tensile strengths, and permeability. On the other hand, other samples were kept into the water bath at the low temperature of 38 °C for 4 and 25 days and then subjected to the high temperature of 300 °C and 20.68 MPa for more three days to represent one cycle of steam injection condition, after that these samples were tested for the same properties evaluated in the case of the low-temperature scenario.
