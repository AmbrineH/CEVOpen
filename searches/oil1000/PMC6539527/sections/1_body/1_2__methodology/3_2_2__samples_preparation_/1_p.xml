<p class="p">Cement slurries with a density of around 1.97 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (16.44 ppg) were prepared and tested following the American Petroleum Institute procedure [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Six slurries with the composition in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> were prepared. The first slurry (S0NC0) was prepared without adding SF or NC particles to be considered as the base case. In the second formulation (S35NC0), 35% BWOC of SF was added, since the 35% is considered as the optimum silica content for applications of 300 Â°C temperature [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], so this formulation (S35NC0) will be compared with the next formulations which contain the same silica content (i.e., 35%BWOC) and different concentrations of NC particles. S35NC1, S35NC2, S35NC3 and S35NC4 samples in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> denote the cement slurries incorporating 1, 2, 3, and 4% BWOC of the NC, respectively.
