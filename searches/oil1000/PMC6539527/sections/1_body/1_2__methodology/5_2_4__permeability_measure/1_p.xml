<p class="p">Gas permeability of the different cement matrix compositions considered in this study was measured on cylindrical samples of 38.1 mm in diameter and 22.9 mm in length, the samples permeability was calculated using Hagen-Poiseuille law which is a commonly used law to calculate the permeability for a laminar flow under steady-state conditions of a compressible fluid through a porous material composed of a network of small capillary pores, the permeability was measured according the procedures explained earlier by Sanjuán and Muñoz-Martialay [
