<p class="p">Compressive strength of the samples was evaluated based on the API procedure [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. For each temperature condition (scenarios in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), and for all compositions under study (
 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) after 7 and 28 days, three cubical samples with 50.8 mm edge were used to evaluate the cement matrix compressive strength. The compressive strength of every specific composition at a specific temperature condition was calculated based on the average strength of the three tested samples.
