<p class="p">Cubical samples with 50.8 mm edge were prepared for the purpose of imaging. After samples curing at 38 °C for 7 days they were cured at 300 °C for three more days, then a small cubical slice with the dimensions of 5 × 5 × 20 mm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> was cut exactly from the center of each cement cube for the purpose of imaging through optical microscope to study the change in the pore structure of the cement matrix as a function of the SF and NC concentrations. The cement slices were polished prior to the microscope imaging.
