<p class="p">The samples mass loss due to exposure to a high temperature was investigated, cylindrical samples of 38.1 mm in diameter and 22.9 mm in length were aged for 4 and 25 days at 38 °C, then they were firstly oven dried at 105 °C for 2 h, after this time there was no more water evaporation at 105 °C, the samples were then weighted before and after being subjected to the high temperature of 300 °C for 3 days. The loss in the weight after exposing the samples to (300 °C) is related to the loss in the amount of the water absorbed by NC particles.</p>
