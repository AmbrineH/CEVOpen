 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Alteration of rheological characteristics for all cement slurries considered in this study was evaluated to address the effect of the NC particles on the cement rheology. The 10-s and 10-min gel strengths (GS), yield point (YP), and plastic viscosity (PV) were evaluated for all of the cement slurries under study.
