<p class="p">One of the most essential parameters to be considered during the design of the cement slurry is the temperature to which the cement sheath will be subjected. The effect of the temperature on both the liquid phase when the slurry is pumped through the casing/wellbore annular space, and on the solid phase (hydrate cement) when the cement matrix is required to meet the physical and chemical properties considered when the cement program is designed, was earlier addressed by different studies [
