The conditions of elevated temperature are expected in deep wells, geothermal wells, and wells subjected to steam injection for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, since the injected steam is able to decrease the oil viscosity, and hence, increase its mobility and finally enhance the oil production [

Currently, thermal oil recovery is a widely used technique around the world to produce heavy oil in many projects, examples are: (a) Kern Field in California, USA; (b) the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada; (c) Mene Grande in Venezuela; (d) Northeast Region in Brazil; and (e) the Surplacul de Barcau Field in Romania, [
