 <xref rid="materials-12-01452-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the reaction velocities of the silicate (pozzolan) cement hydration and the reaction of CH with the slow pozzolans. This table shows that the reaction of the slow pozzolans such as nanoclay (NC) with CH is a slow reaction compared to the other reactions happen during the cement hydration process.
