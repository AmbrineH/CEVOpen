<p class="p">The NC particles are currently used in the cement industry to enhance the strength of the cement matrix because of their ability to fill the capillary microporous of the matrix due to their considerably small size, the property which will increase the density of the solidified cement. Sanjuán et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that the decrease in the particle size of the pozzolanic materials (such materials like NC and silica fume) considerably improved the cement strength. Wang [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] studied the effect of replacing the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with 0.1 to 0.5% of the NC particles on the concrete strength at a variable temperature from 25 to 1000 °C. As a result, Wang [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-01452" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] reported that the NC particles are able to enhance the concrete compressive strength with the increase of the temperature up to 300 °C; a significant decrease in the concrete compressive strength was noticed when the temperature is between 440 to 580 °C, and the compressive strength of the concrete reduced to about 10% of the original strength when the temperature reached 1000 °C.
