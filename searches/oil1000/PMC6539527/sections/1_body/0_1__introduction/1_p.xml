<p class="p">The main functions of the primary cementing in oil wells is to provide the desired mechanical stability, prevent any communication between the drilled formations by preventing the cement/formation annulus being present, protect the casing from being contacted by the formation of corrosive fluids so no microcracks should be present in the cement sheath, and prevent the fluids from flowing up toward the surface through the cement/formation annulus, microcracks in the cement sheath, and/or casing/cement annulus. In these kinds of operation, the wellbore/casing annular space is filled by one or more cement slurries which must form strong enough and durable cement matrix to meet the needed isolation efficiency throughout the well life without the need for any minimal corrective interventions. To achieve these goals, the cementing project must be well evaluated, discussed, planned and executed [
