<p class="p">Oil–water separation is of great importance for industrial water purification and oil spill collection. Both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials have proven to be highly efficient for this purpose.

 </sup> After the development of recent years, the research of oil–water separation has entered the liquid–liquid separation stage.

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91" class="xref">91</xref>
 </sup> achieved tiny water-in-oil droplet separation into pure water and oil droplets via a “go-in-opposite-ways” mechanism on curved bioinspired peristome-mimetic surfaces without energy input (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>a). The separations of tiny water-in-oil droplets, emulsions, and liquid/air will continue to be the focus of the future research.

 </sup> Superhydrophilic materials show dramatic antifogging behavior, where the water droplets will instantaneously spread to form a thin liquid film. It is interesting that, inspired by mosquito compound eyes (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>b), superhydrophobic materials also display great antifogging behaviors, which can rapidly expel condensed droplets from their surfaces.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96" class="xref">96</xref>
 </sup> Densely packed micro-ommatidia structures covered by hexagonal nanonipples resulted in this ability of mosquito eyes.

 </sup> The synergistic effect of wettability and surface topography can regulate the surface bioadhesion ability by cytophilic interactions and a size-matching mechanism (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>c).

 </sup> The surfaces with great bioadhesion ability are applicable for cancer detection. Superhydrophilic nanowire arrays can selectively capture circulating tumor cells while inhibiting the adhesion of normal blood cells.

 </sup> Bioinspired superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to deliver analytes to Raman-sensitive sites in highly diluted fluids (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>d). The essential reason is that the solution becomes increasingly concentrated during the no-pinning evaporation process.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99" class="xref">99</xref>
 </sup> Improving biocompatibility of superwetting sensors and extending the range of usable fluids will be the major concerns. Another well-known commercial application of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials is self-cleaning (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>e). Superhydrophobic materials are mainly aimed at solid pollutants.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup> However, superhydrophilic materials are mainly aimed at liquid pollutants.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100" class="xref">100</xref>
 </sup> Combining advantages of the two together to make omnipotent self-cleaning superwetting materials is significant. As mentioned in earlier sections, bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials display a unique water collection property (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>f). How to improve water collection efficiency under a low-humidity environment and how to prevent water evaporation are open questions. The novel green printing based on superoleophilic nanomaterials on superhydrophilic plate substrates has solved high-cost and environmental pollution problems (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>g). Regulating the morphology and wettability of printed materials can achieve the contact line of the aqueous protecting liquid. Then, the printed ink microdroplet pinned on the nonprinted and printed regions results in high-quality images with fine resolution.

 </sup> Liquid unidirectional transport on a solid surface with special wettability is a very unique and intriguing phenomenon (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>
 </xref>h). The driving mechanism of liquid unidirectional transport can be divided into four parts: Laplace pressure, gradient wettability, ratchet mechanism, and capillary rise.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102" class="xref">102</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103" class="xref">103</xref>
 </sup> In general, asymmetric surface morphology and/or surface energy make the force or resistance at the three-phase contact line of a liquid uneven in different directions, thus driving the liquid in a particular direction. However, a further application based on the liquid unidirectional transport is insufficient. How to develop its value behind the phenomenon in a smart microfluidic system, laboratory-on-a-chip devices, and advanced biochemistry microreactor is the prime concern of many scientists.
