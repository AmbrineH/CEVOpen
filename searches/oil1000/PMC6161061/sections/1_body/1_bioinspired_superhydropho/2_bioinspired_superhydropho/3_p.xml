<p class="p">The adhesion force of superhydrophobic surfaces is also of great interest to scientists. In the following year, a superhydrophobic rose petal (

 </xref>g) with high adhesion force

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup> was reported. A water droplet can stand on the surface of the petal with spherical shape, but it cannot roll off even when the petal is turned upside down. This phenomenon is also called the “petal effect”. Another unique superhydrophobic plant is discovered in 2010, called 
 <italic class="italic">Salvinia</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">Salvinia</italic> leaf (

 </sup> offers a novel mechanism for long-term air retention. Miraculously, the terminal hair lacks the wax crystals and forms hydrophilic patches. Authors demonstrate that these hydrophilic patches can stabilize the air layer by pinning the air–water interface, which is also called the “
 <italic class="italic">Salvinia</italic> effect”. The discovery of these characteristic creature surfaces mentioned above has promoted a deep understanding of superhydrophobicity. The revelation of an intrinsic mechanism has also enriched the theory and guided the bioinspired designs of artificial superhydrophobic materials.
