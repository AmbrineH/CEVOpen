<p class="p">The bioinspired superhydrophilic concept has not been popularized for a long time. The essential reason is the lack of practical applications. Long before, scientists found that tears can spread, forming a film to protect human eyes (

 </sup> Fish scales display good superoleophobicity under water, which originates from the water-phase hierarchical micro-/nanostructures structures. The oil drop shows low adhesion on the surface, so that fish can keep clean under water. This work makes underwater self-cleaning become one of the most important applications of superhydrophilicity. In the past decade, intriguing wetting phenomena on the superhydrophilic creature surfaces have been discovered continuously. Zheng and co-workers
