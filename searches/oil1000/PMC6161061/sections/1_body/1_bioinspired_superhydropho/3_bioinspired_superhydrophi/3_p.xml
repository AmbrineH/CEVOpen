 </sup> Three main reasons, gradient of the Laplace pressure, surface-free energy, and multifunction integration, endow the cactus with an efficient fog collection ability. Tree-frog toe secretion (

 </sup> and then adhere to the surfaces. The high-adhesion wetting state of a tree-frog toe profits from its microstructure and superhydrophilicity. In 2015, scientists found that special skin adaptations enable the Texas horned lizard

 </xref>q) to access water sources such as moist sand and dew. Their skin is capable of directionally transporting water without external energy input. Another classical creature surface with a continuous directional water transport ability found more recently is the peristome surface of

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>
 </xref>r). The multiscale structure of the peristome surface optimizes and enhances capillary rise in the transport direction, and prevents water backflow in the reverse direction. This discovery can be used to design bioinspired fluid-transport superhydrophilic systems for practical applications. In general, according to all this research, development of bioinspired superhydrophilic processes has entered a new historical stage.
