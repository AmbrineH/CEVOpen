<p class="p">With the rapid development of nanotechnology at the beginning of the 21st century, basic scientific research started moving toward practical applications. Therefore, the research of superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic materials also enters a new period of rapid growth. By searching in the ISI (Institute for Scientific Information) Web of Science using the topic of “superhydrophobic” or “superhydrophilic”, we can observe an accelerating increase for the number of papers in 2004 (

 </xref>b). Under amazing development momentum, some fundamental problems still hide. As for superhydrophobic materials, weak mechanical stability is the true crux of this topic.

 </sup> Scientists have taken notes of this point, and some research has also been carried out. So far, however, no practical solutions have been proposed. More seriously, no authoritative, standard, or effective evaluation system is established in this field. The challenges in superhydrophilic materials are more obvious. The ability of artificial superhydrophilic materials to imitate nature is limited.

 </sup> In addition, insufficient application development of superhydrophilic materials is another bottleneck. How to overcome these difficulties in the future is the main focus of this Outlook.
