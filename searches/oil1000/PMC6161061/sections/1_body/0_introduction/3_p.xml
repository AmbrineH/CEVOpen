<p class="p">When a water drop is placed on a solid surface, it tends to spread toward a lower energy state. Then, there is a water contact angle (WCA) measured at the edge (solid–liquid–air three-phase contact line) of each droplet. Different WCAs can reflect the wettability of the solid surface. In 1805, Thomas Young,

 </sup> a pioneer scientist, proposed the concept of the contact angle of a liquid and established Young’s equation to define the notion of surface wettability. Some surfaces with extreme wettability have attracted much of the attention of later scientists,

 </sup> which are the above-mentioned superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces, defined with a WCA larger than 150° or smaller than 10°, respectively.

 </sup> The water drop can stand on the superhydrophobic surface like a ball but spread completely forming a water film on the superhydrophilic surface. A surface’s morphology (surface roughness) and intrinsic material properties (surface energy) cooperatively decide its wettability.
