<p class="p">In this Outlook, we first briefly introduce the processes of the development of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials, mainly focused on research during the past two decades. On the basis of this understanding, in the following sections, the designs of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials have been summarized. Their respective challenges are pointed out, and the potential solutions are also put forward. In
