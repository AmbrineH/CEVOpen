<p class="p">After being proposed, the concept of superhydrophilicity has not been widely dispersed and studied. This is because the potential applications have not been discovered for a long time. The mystical nature gives us answers again, which brings a new revolution for bioinspired superhydrophilic materials research. In 2009, Liu et al. found that fish scales showed natural superhydrophilicity.

 </sup> Superhydrophilic fish scales displayed a unique underwater superoleophobicity. The reason is that the water layer can be trapped within the micro-/nanostructures of fish scale surfaces. By virtue of this property, fish can keep clean under water showing a great antifouling property. Bioinspired superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic materials are also achieved in this work. Superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic artificial polyacrylamide film with fish-scale structures and silicon surface with microstructure or micro-/nanostructure (

 </xref>c) has been fabricated successfully. These studies extended superwettability research to oil/water/solid triphasic systems. Thus, the underwater antifouling property of the superhydrophilic surface has drawn increasing attention. On the basis of this understanding, researchers further explore the oil/water separation property of superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic materials. Xue et al.
