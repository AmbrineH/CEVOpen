<p class="p">As for chemical methods, it is more beneficial to obtain complex precise structures in micro-/nanoscale. The chemical method can also create hydrophobic functional groups on the surface through external field stimulation, such as UV illumination. TiO

 </sup> reported a simple three-step treatment method to generate superamphiphilic silicon wafer surfaces with contact angles near 0° for both water and typical organic liquids. Taking advantage of lateral force mode (LFM) atomic force microscopy images, the alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanodomains can be detected. The mechanism has also been revealed to explain its superamphilicity. Liquids infiltrate the hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) nanodomains giving rise to a 2D capillary effect (

 </xref>b), which pulls liquids across the nanodomains continuously. By making use of these superamphiphilic silicon wafer surfaces, uniform organic thin films were generated in both water and organic solvent. Most recently, Zheng and co-workers

 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> 2D plane but seldom permeates through the Xuan papers. This is because of the multilayered spreading mechanism resulting from the layered anisotropic micro-/nanofibrous structures.
