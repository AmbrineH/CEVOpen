 </sup> created a novel surface pattern that transformed regular silicon to being superhydrophilic using high-intensity femtosecond laser pulses. Because of the superhydrophilicity, water can spread vertically uphill against gravity. The driving force of water motion is the supercapillary effect benefited from the surface structures.
