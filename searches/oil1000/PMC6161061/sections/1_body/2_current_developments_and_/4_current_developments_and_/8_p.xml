<p class="p">The research of bioinspired designs of superhydrophilic materials has good momentum of development. However, the problems beneath the prosperous surface are pretty obvious. The performance of artificial superhydrophilic materials cannot reach natural superhydrophilic materials. For example, the water collection test of artificial 1D superhydrophilic materials is under high-humidity atmosphere. This condition can hardly exist in nature. Moreover, it is hard to simulate the fine structure on the creature surface of artificial superhydrophilic materials. Advanced 3D printing technology could resolve, to a certain extent, this challenge.

 </sup> However, the scale of printed structures is always much larger than the scale of the creature surface structure. Therefore, where is the future of bioinspired superhydrophilic materials? At first, scientists should make an earnest effort to find out new materials or methods to reach the properties of natural creatures. Developing high-precision 3D printer and laser writing technology is another good solution. Second, we must never cease to work for new applications of superhydrophilic materials from a static to dynamic fluid and from 1D to 3D. Combining superhydrophilicity and other material properties, such as humidity-response, is a good approach.

 </sup> Finally, the reversible rapid wettability transition between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity is a promising research field.
