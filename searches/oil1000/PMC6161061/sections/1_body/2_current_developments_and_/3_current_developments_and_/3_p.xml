 </sup> After chemical modification, various regular micro–nano dual-scale superhydrophobic materials can be obtained. In addition, irregular micro–nano dual-scale superhydrophobic materials can be prepared by chemical methods including electrodeposition, sol–gel process, hydrothermal method, and so on.

 </sup> As to micro-/nanowires or micro-/nanofibers, the electrospinning technique is one of the best choices.
