<p class="p">Scientists have detected microscale papillae (

 </xref>a) on the lotus leaf as early as 1997

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup> and deduced that this structure plays an important role in superhydrophobicity. In 2002, the micro-/nanostructure (

 </xref>b) on lotus leaves was uncovered further.

 </sup> The synergistic action of the micro-/nanostructure makes the water droplet tend to stand on the surface in the Cassie–Baxter state (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>
 </xref>c). The water drop cannot penetrate into small cavities between rough dual-scale structures. The air is trapped in these cavities,

 </sup> resulting in a solid–air–liquid heterogeneous interface. Academics believe that the main contribution of the microscale structure is to enhance the mechanical stability of the superhydrophobic surface, and the aim of the nanoscale structure is to retain the Cassie–Baxter state on the superhydrophobic surface.
