<p class="p">The tremendous application potential of bioinspired superhydrophobic materials in areas such as water repellence, self-cleaning, anti-icing, drag reduction, and corrosion resistance

 </sup> bioinspired superhydrophobic materials were never as widespread in fact as we expected. It is because two core issues have not been addressed yet, which are chemical stability and, especially, mechanical durability.

 </sup> Micro-/nanostructures on the superhydrophobic surface are highly susceptible to mechanical wear, while surface compositions may also be altered by UV or acid–base conditions.

 </sup> Both processes can lead to the loss of superhydrophobicity. Lots of scientists have committed to resolve this problem. From the structural stability aspect, the micro–nano dual-scale pyramid (

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62" class="xref">62</xref>−
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup> The pyramid structure has a large contact area with the substrate to resist a greater degree of wear, while the acuminate top can reduce contact area with liquid to increase the WCA. However, it is not realistic to promote superhydrophobic materials with micro–nano dual-scale pyramids in extensive areas because of the complex preparation and high cost. Thus, the most mainstream approaches are a self-healing superhydrophobic material
