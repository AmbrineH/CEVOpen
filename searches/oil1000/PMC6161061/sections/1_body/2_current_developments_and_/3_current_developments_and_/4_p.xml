<p class="p">We have summarized some typical works around the development of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials. In 2004, Jiang et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup> reported one kind of lotus-leaf-like superhydrophobic polystyrene film with a novel composite structure consisting of porous microspheres and nanofibers by the versatile electro-hydrodynamic method. Later scientists also tried to construct a lotus-leaf-like artificial surface to obtain a similar superhydrophobicity.

 </sup> One work made new progress recently by Lee et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup> They prepared artificial rice leaf surfaces in which nanoporous multilayers were of a wavy microstructure. An increase in nanostructure roughness led to a transition in the dynamic water droplet anisotropic wetting states. Research about water strider legs is mostly about the mechanism. Bioinspired designs of water striders can achieve microrobots who can walk on the water surface.

 </sup> Herein, Tan and co-workers
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup> presented a versatile route via selective surface functionalization and subsequent electroless deposition to duplicate the intact 3D organic butterfly wing scales on metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel, and so on. Malvadkar et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup> reported an array of poly(
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-xylylene) nanorod film with anisotropic wetting behavior by means of a pin-release droplet ratchet mechanism. The nanofilm achieves directional transport of microliter droplets on a smooth surface. In 2010, lotus/petal effect surfaces were successfully fabricated. With the control of UV irradiation and heating profiles of the photochromic compound, surface wettability can be controlled.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51" class="xref">51</xref>
 </sup> As for the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvinia</italic> leaf with a fine eggbeater shape, it is very difficult to construct this unique structure through common physical or chemical methods. However, with the aid of advanced 3D printing technology, Yang et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup> have reported a superhydrophobic eggbeater structure with controllable surface morphology. Through the research on superoleophobicity creature surfaces, scientists revealed that only one certain type of structure with reentrant geometries is appropriate for constructing superoleophobic surfaces (

 </xref>f). Tuteja et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup> first came up with the T-shaped reentrant structure, which will not only strengthen the stability of the superamphiphobic surface but also facilitate the choice of corresponding oleophilic materials for preparing superamphiphobicity. Furthermore, Kim et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54" class="xref">54</xref>
 </sup> designed one kind of mushroom-shaped doubly reentrant structure. This surface with doubly reentrant structure can repel completely wettable liquid, where even perfluorohexane can bounce off this surface. Most recently, using two-photon polymerization 3D printing technology, Gu et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup> fabricated triply reentrant arrays with super-repellence from water to various organic liquids successfully. Even after treatment by oxygen plasma, the superamphiphobicity of the triply reentrant array surface can be kept well. This work proposed an advanced method to construct a complex bioinspired reentrant structure. Further, except for superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity, in different media, 64 unique wetting states are achieved totally through different combinations of water, oil, and air.
