<p class="p">Although great progress has been made, there are still some difficult challenges to overcome. How can further impulses in the development in this field be created? It is a tough question. Advanced 3D printing technology could be a good solution. Three-dimensional printing technology can rapidly, precisely prepare a bioinspired surface structure and morphology similar to that of creature surfaces.

 </sup> Compared with traditional chemical or physical methods, 3D printing technology displays great controllability, integration, and repeatability with low cost. More importantly, 3D printing technology brings light to efficiently construct superamphiphobic surfaces/substrates with specific delicate structures with reentrant geometries, which display high theoretical research and practical application values.

 </sup> Although it is still in its infancy, there are still some limitations, such as the size of products or the choice of raw materials, but predictably it will give play to enormous value in this field in the future.
