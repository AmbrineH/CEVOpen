<p class="p">In this Outlook, we have concluded the development of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic progress. The renaissance in this field, to a large extent, has been brought about by recent advances in nanotechnology. The designs of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials have also been summarized. The challenges, opportunities, and solutions are mentioned in this section. It is also worth it for us to pay attention to emerging applications of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials. As we have highlighted in this outlook, superwetting materials with unprecedented properties and functionalities can be generated and integrated into devices for emerging applications.</p>
