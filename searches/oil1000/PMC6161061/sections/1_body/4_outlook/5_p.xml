<p class="p">In terms of fundamental research, scientists should try to reveal the deeper essence of nature. Direct imaging and recording have attracted broad scientific attention for both theoretical research and practical applications. Nano-X-ray CT, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and the ultra-high-speed camera are pretty useful for the future research. Moreover, tremendous effort should be concentrated on developing the highly integrated 3D imaging approaches with high resolution.

 </sup> New theories and concepts should be explored from microscale to nanoscale or molecular scale to understand delicate wetting phenomena. Setting up a perfect theoretical system can provide guidance for us to design required bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials. Finally, there are still a great deal of secrets to find out from nature. With the joint efforts of researchers, the research of bioinspired designs of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials will open a new page tomorrow.
