 </sup> Because liquids in nature tend to have a certain velocity, the hydrodynamic properties or behavior of liquid have gradually become a major concern in the design of superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic materials, for example, the rapid, continuous, spontaneous flow or transport of a large amount of liquid on the surface or bulk phase of bioinspired superhydrophilic materials. The wetting/dewetting/impact process of fluids on the edge of the superhydrophobic surface is another hydrodynamic research topic in the future. The rapid transition between superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic by regulating liquid is also a new research hot-spot. Research on these problems is at an early stage, and it is possible to greatly expand the application of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials.
