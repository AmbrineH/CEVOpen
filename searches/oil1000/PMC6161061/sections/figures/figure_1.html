 <p> (a) Intrinsic wetting threshold ( θ I W T) of water, which is regarded as the limit between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. When the intrinsic WCA (θ) on a flat solid surface is larger than θ I W T, superhydrophobic surfaces can be obtained by increasing the surface roughness. Conversely, when the intrinsic WCA (θ) on a flat solid surface is smaller than θ I W T, superhydrophilic surfaces can be obtained. (b) Rapid increase of research interest (number of papers) on the topic of “superhydrophobic” and “superhydrophilic” materials. </p>
