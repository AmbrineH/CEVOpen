<p class="p">Vegetable oils have been used by humans since ancient times. The main components of the vegetable oil are triglycerides (about 95%) (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thomas, Matth√§us &amp; Fiebig, 2015</xref>). They are composed of three fatty acids (FAs) attached to glycerol by ester bonds. FA profile is an important characteristic of the vegetable oil (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The analysis of FA content is one of the topical issues in plant metabolomics given the importance of deciphering lipid biosynthesis pathways in plants. Oilseed crops are one of the most important sources of vegetable oils for food and industry. Sunflower and rapeseed take the positions four and three in the global production of vegetable oil after palm and soybean (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rauf et al., 2017</xref>). In oilseed crops, the identification of FAs appears to be of special importance since nutritional and technical properties of the oil extracted from these crops are primarily determined by its FAs composition. For instance, unsaturated fatty acids contribute to decreasing cholesterol levels in blood thus reducing the risk of heart diseases (
