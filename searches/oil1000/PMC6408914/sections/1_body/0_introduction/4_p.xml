<p class="p">The oilseed crop market constantly sets new trends in rapeseed and sunflower breeding, which stimulates plant breeders to develop new varieties with optimized FA content (

Towards this end, it appears necessary to elaborate efficient protocols for precise and high-throughput FA profiling. Presently commonly used techniques to measure FAs in plants are gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS) or gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) methods (
