<p class="p">For the analysis of FAs, the extracts obtained at the previous step were hydrolyzed using the protocol adopted from Bromke (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bromke et al., 2015</xref>). Lipid extracts were resuspended in 200 µl of the mixture of methanol and 6% KOH (4: 1 v: v). The tubes were incubated for 2 h at 60 °C with continuous shaking (1,800 rpm). After cooling to room temperature, 100 µl of saturated NaCl solution was added. The reaction mixture was acidified by the addition of 50 µl of 29% HCl. Tubes were thoroughly vortexed and spun for 30 s at full speed using a table centrifuge. FAs were extracted with 200 µl of chloroform/heptane mixture (1: 4 v: v). After mixing by vortexing and 15 s centrifugation, the organic phase was collected. Extraction with chloroform /heptane mixture was repeated the second time and the collected FA-containing organic phases were combined. The extract was washed by the addition of 200 µl of water followed by short vortexing and 15 s centrifugation at 12,700 rpm, which resulted in the separation of two phases. Finally, the organic upper phase was collected, dried under vacuum conditions in Concentrator plus (Eppendorf) (30 min, 30 °C) and stored at −80 °C before FA measurement.
