<p class="p">For lipid extraction, 10 mg (for each line) of 
 <italic class="italic">sunflower</italic> (1 sample - 1 seed) and 
 <italic class="italic">rapeseed</italic> (1 sample - several seeds) seeds were homogenized using six 2.8 mm zirconium oxide beads (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) in the Precellys Evolution homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) coupled with Cryolis filled with dry ice at the temperature not exceeding 10 °C. Homogenization parameters were as follows: 6,800 rpm, 3* 20 s, pause 30 s. 400 µL of methanol/methyl tert-butyl ether mixture (1: 3 v: v) was added prior to homogenization. After homogenization, another 400 µl of methanol/methyl tert-butyl ether mixture was added, and the sample was mixed by vortexing. After sonication for 10 min in the ice-cooled ultrasonic bath and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with shaking, the sample was transferred into the new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and 560 ml of water/methanol mixture (3: 1 v: v) was added. After the addition of water/methanol the sample was mixed by vortexing for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,700 rpm. This leads to the separation of two phases: the lipophilic phase and the polar phase. The upper, lipophilic, phase was collected and vacuum dried in Concentrator plus (Eppendorf) for 1.5 h at 30 °C and the pellet was stored at −80 °C before FA measurement. This protocol is based on the protocol described by

 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Giavalisco et al., 2011</xref>). For FA quantification, three isotopically labeled internal FA standards were added to the extraction mixture (3 µg of each FA per sample).
