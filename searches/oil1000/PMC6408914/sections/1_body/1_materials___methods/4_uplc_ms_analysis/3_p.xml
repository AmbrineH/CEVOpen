<p class="p">To prepare samples for the injection into the UPLC-MS system, the dried extracts were first resuspended in acetonitrile/isopropanol mixture (70: 30), vortexed for 10 s, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with shaking, followed by sonication for 10 min on ice and centrifugation for 7 min at 4 °C at the speed 12,700 rpm. After the completion of these procedures, final dilutions with acetonitrile/isopropanol (70: 30) were prepared in MS vials.</p>
