   <sub class="sub">4</sub>Ac solution and 0.1% formic acid), with an injection volume of 3 µl. The following gradient profile was applied: 55% B, 1 min; linear gradient from 55% B to 80% B, 3 min; linear gradient from 80% B to 85% B, 8 min; linear gradient from 85% B to 100% B, 3 min. After washing the column for 4 min 50 s with 100% B, the proportion of buffer B in the mixture was set back to 55%, and the column was re-equilibrated for 4 min 10 s (24.5 min total run time), with the mobile phase flow rate of 400 µl/min.
