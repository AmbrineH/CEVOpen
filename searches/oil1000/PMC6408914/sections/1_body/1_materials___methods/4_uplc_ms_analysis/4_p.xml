<p class="p">Samples were processed using mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) coupled with reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (ACQUITY UPLC System; Waters, USA) on Q-TOF (Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight) Maxis Impact II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Wien, Austria). Parameters for analysis were set according to the negative ion mode with the spectra acquired over a mass range from m/z 50 to 1,200. The optimum values of the ESI-MS parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, + 4.0 kV; drying gas temperature, 200 °C; drying gas flow, 6.0 l/min; nebulizing gas pressure, 2 bar.</p>
