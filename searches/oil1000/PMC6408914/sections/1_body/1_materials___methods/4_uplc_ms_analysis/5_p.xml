<p class="p">UPLC separation was carried out using the C8 Acquity Beh column (2.1 mm ×  100 mm, 1.7- µm particle size; Waters) and the Acquity BEH C8 1.7 µm Vanguard precolumn (Waters) at 60 °C. For UPLC gradient the mobile phases consisted of two solvents. Two different solvent systems and gradients were tested.</p>
