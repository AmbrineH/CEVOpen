<p class="p">Validation procedure included the evaluation of linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, and calculation of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ). Linearity was evaluated by building seven-point calibration curves (six replicates) in pure solvents. Solvent (acetonitrile/isopropanol, 70/30) was spiked with a standard mixture of isotopically labeled fatty acids (Oleic acid-13C18, Palmitic acid-13C16, and Stearic acid-13C18) in order to obtain all standards in the concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 2,500 ng/ml. The mean correlation coefficients (
