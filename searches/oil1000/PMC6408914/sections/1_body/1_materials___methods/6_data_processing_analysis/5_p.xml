<p class="p">For the sunflower LC-5 FA18:3 two peaks with the ten-second difference between their retention times were obtained. Since the intensities of both these peaks exhibited high Pearson correlation with the FA18:3 intensity in LC-400 data the sum of these peaks was used in the analysis. Intensities of all detected FAs were at least three orders of magnitude higher in plant samples than in blank samples. To obtain FA mass fractions, the intensities of all FAs were divided by the sum of intensities of FAs identified using all three methods (GC-FID, UPLC-5, and UPLC-400) and multiplied by 100.</p>
