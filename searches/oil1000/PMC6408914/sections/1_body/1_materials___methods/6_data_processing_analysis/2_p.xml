<p class="p">Xcms package (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) was used for UPLC-MS data processing. Optimal parameters were chosen with the aid of the IPO package (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Libiseller et al., 2015</xref>). Peak intensities were obtained using the peakTable function implemented in the xcms package with method=‘maxint’. As a result, set of peaks characterized by the retention time, mass divided by charge, and intensity for each sample was obtained. Isotopically labeled internal FA standards were used for retention time correction and alignment.
