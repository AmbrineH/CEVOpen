<p class="p">In rapeseed oil, the most abundant FAs were C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, and C20:1 which together made for 98.6% of all FAs. In sunflower seed oil, the most abundant FAs were C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C22:0, which constituted 98.9% of all FAs. In both species, two FAs (18:2 and 18:1) constitute more than 80% of the total FA content. However, in rapeseed, 18:1 is three times more abundant than 18:2, while in sunflower it is 18:2 which dominates (
