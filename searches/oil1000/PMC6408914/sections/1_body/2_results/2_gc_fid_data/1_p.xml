The lists of FAs which were detected in the two crops differed by minor FAs, while C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, C20:0, C20:1, C22:0, and C24:0, were common for both of them. FA C20:2, C22:1, and C24:1 were detected in rapeseed only, while C14:1 FAs we found in sunflower but were absent in rapeseed (
