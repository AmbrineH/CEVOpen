<p class="p">In the present work, we compared the application of GC-FID coupled with hexane extraction and two UPLC-MS based approaches: 1:5 dilution in the buffer system with formic acid (UPLC-5) and 1:400 dilution in the buffer system with acetic acid (UPLC-400) for FA profiling in sunflower and rapeseed, both using MTBE extraction.</p>
