<p class="p">Results of UPLC-MS were compared with the results obtained using GC-FID. All 11 FAs detected in sunflower and 13 FAs detected in rapeseed were also identified using UPLC-MS. In the case of both plants, UPLC-MS proved to be more sensitive and detected about 2.5 times higher number of FAs than GC-FID (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Figs. 1C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">2C</xref>). The majority of the minor FAs (mass fraction below 0.5%) are missed by GC-FID. The longest FA detected by GC-FID was the FA with 24-carbon chain, whereas UPLC-MS provided insight into the changes in longer FAs with the chains containing up to 28 carbon atoms.
