<p class="p">For UPLC-MS fatty acids profiling we used two different buffer systems: the UPLC buffer with formic acid and the buffer with acetic acid. The former buffer is the most common buffer used in UPLC-MS experiments. In the latter buffer, ionization is known to be more effective since acetic acid is a weaker acid, so lower sample amount, and, therefore, higher sample dilution is required. For this reason for the system with acetic acid we used higher dilution (1:400), and for the system with formic acid we used lower sample dilution (1:500).</p>
