<p class="p">At low dilution (UPLC-5), we are able to detect 29 FAs for sunflower and 35 FAs for rapeseed. At high dilution (UPLC-400), 25 and 31 FAs were detected for sunflower and rapeseed, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). Hence, the use of lower dilution rates proved to be a more efficient approach which allowed to reveal the highest number of FAs. However, in this case it becomes impossible to perform the relative quantification of major FAs: 18:1 and 18:2, because they cause detector saturation (
