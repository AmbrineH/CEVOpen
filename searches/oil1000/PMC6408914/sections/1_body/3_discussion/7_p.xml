<p class="p">Therefore, the analysis of minor FA content in oil may be important to make a complete assessment of the functional and nutritional properties of the oil. Our results suggest that UPLC-MS has great potential as a precise tool for evaluation of the full FA profile in oilseed crops. It can be essential for the creation of vegetable oils with increased nutrition value and/or new technical characteristics and provide additional markers for agronomically important traits in plants.</p>
