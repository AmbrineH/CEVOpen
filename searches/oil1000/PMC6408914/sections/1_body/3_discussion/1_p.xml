<p class="p">FA composition of seed oil from 50 sunflower and 50 rapeseed lines was analyzed by GC-FID, which is traditionally used to measure FAs in plant oils, and two UPLC-MS-based approaches (1:5 dilution in the buffer system with formic acid (UPLC-5) and 1:400 dilution in the buffer system with acetic acid (UPLC-400)). GC-FID technique allowed to detect 11 and 13 FAs in sunflower and rapeseed, respectively, all of them representing even-chain FAs.</p>
