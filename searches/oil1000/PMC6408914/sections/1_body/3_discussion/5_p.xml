<p class="p">We have demonstrated in our study that UPLC-MS method is appropriate for detection of long FAs both in sunflower and rapeseed. The longest FA detected by GC-FID method was the FA with 24-carbon chain, whereas UPLC-MS revealed FAs with the tails up to 28 carbon atoms long. Generally, about half of the FAs identified by UPLC-MS belong to Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA, fatty acids with the chain length of at least 20 carbon atoms). According to the previous investigations, VLCFAs are mainly located in the cuticular wax layer deposited at the surface of plant aerial organs; they form part of triacylglycerides of seed oil and sphingolipids and are essential for many aspects of plant development and apparently play role as signal molecules governing both biotic and abiotic stress (
