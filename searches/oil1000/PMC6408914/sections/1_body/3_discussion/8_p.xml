<p class="p">Considering the advantages of UPLC-MS and its applicability for FA profiling in oilseed crops, we may observe that the overall result can be represented as a net-like pattern on the retention time M/z-RT plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Figs. 4A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">5A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">5B</xref>). This makes the process of results interpretation and annotation easier compared to GC-FID results.
