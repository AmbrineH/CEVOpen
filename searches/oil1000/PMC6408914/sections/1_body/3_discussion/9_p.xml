<p class="p">Another advantage of UPLC-MS is the possibility of analyzing thousands of samples per month and small amount of plant material needed for the analysis. This technique requires only 5â€“10 mg of plant material per extraction, while GC-FID requires high amounts of material. For plants with big seeds like sunflowers it is possible to take only a small part of the seed for the FA profiling analysis and germinate the rest of the seed and plant it, which allows exact assignment of phenotype to genotype in breeding programs.</p>
