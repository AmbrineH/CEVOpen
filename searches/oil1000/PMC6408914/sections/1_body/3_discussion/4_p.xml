<p class="p">In total, about 29 and 35 FAs were detected in sunflower and rapeseed samples, respectively, by UPLC-MS. It is worth noting that utilizing the UPLC-5 approach we were able to identify significantly more FAs in both crops compared with the UPLC-400 approach. However with the 1:5 dilution implemented in this approach it was impossible to perform the relative quantification of the two most abundant FAs, 18:1 and 18:2, due to detector saturation. In view of this, we suggest that the UPLC-400 approach is more suitable for FA profiling of oil crop samples.</p>
