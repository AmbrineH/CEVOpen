<p class="p">It is important to highlight that certain differences between the results obtained by GC and UPLC-MS may be connected with the lipid extraction procedure. We used MTBE extraction which extract both TAGs and phospholipids, which means that some detected FAs may come from phospholipids, compared to GS where extraction was performed with hexane which normally extracts mostly TAGs.</p>
