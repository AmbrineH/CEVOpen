<p class="p">Apart from even-chain FAs, odd-chain fatty acids were also detected by UPLC-MS. The latter are present in the oil extracted from the analyzed plants only in minor quantities and selection for these FAs is not currently included in breeding programs. However, beneficial effects of these compounds on human health have been recently demonstrated. For example, pentadecenoic and heptadecenoic acids contribute to reduced risks of developing multiple sclerosis and act as anti-inflammatory and edema-inhibiting agents (
