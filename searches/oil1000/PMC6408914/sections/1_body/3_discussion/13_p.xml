<p class="p">Currently, gas chromatography with mass spectrometric or flame ionization detection is the gold standard for quantitative assessment of FA composition of vegetable oils. Based on our results, UPLC-MS has great potential to be used in evaluation of FA composition of oil crops as highly sensitive, scalable, and suitable for the individual seed analysis technique. In our study, it has been shown that GS-MS/GS-FID could be substituted by UPLC-MS in a number of cases. However, additional comparative studies are required for UPLC-MS method to become a standard technique for evaluation of oil FA composition both in breeding programs and for industrial purposes.</p>
