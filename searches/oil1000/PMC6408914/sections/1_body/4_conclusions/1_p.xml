<p class="p">In this work we compared the performance of hexane lipid extraction with GC-FID and MTBE lipid extraction with UPLC-MS when measuring FA profiles in 50 sunflower and 50 rapeseed samples. Based on the obtained results, we may conclude that UPLC-MS with MTBE extraction has great potential for the study of FA composition of oilseed crops, which may be used both to evaluate the oil properties for nutritional and industrial needs, to perform high-throughput analysis to assist oilcrop breeding, as well as to search for new potential valuable traits. The main advantages of this technique as it was demonstrated in this study is high-sensitivity, it which detects 2.5 times more FA species both in sunflower and rapeseed than the conventional GC-FID technique, including the minor fatty acids and odd-chain fatty acids, which are usually omitted. Additionally, the UPLC-MS technique is able to detect FAs with long carbon chains, including those with 28-carbon tails. The UPLC-MS technique doesnâ€™t require FA derivatization which also adds to its high-sensitivity. It is worth mentioning, that by using this technique it appears possible to use small of starting material which makes it very useful in breeding programs since it appears possible to use only a small part of the seed for analysis and to germinate the remaining part to use it in breeding programs, for example for subsequent phenotyping. Taken together our findings suggest that UPLC-MS provides a deep insight into the oil FA content and may be applied for precise identification of FA profiles of oilseed crops, although further comparative studies using larger samplings with further improvements and optimization are required.</p>
