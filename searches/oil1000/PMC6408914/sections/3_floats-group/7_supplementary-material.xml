  <p class="p">(A) UPLC-MS data for sunflower and rapeseed. For each sample in the table the information about species, method of analysis (UPLC-5 and UPLC-400), mass spectrometry id number and the intensity of each FA are presented. (B): sunflower UPLC-5 statistics. For each FA mean value, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and coefficient of variation are presented. (C): sunflower UPLC-400 statistics. For each FA mean value, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and coefficient of variation are presented. (D): rapeseed UPLC-5 statistics. For each FA mean value, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and coefficient of variation are presented. (E): rapeseed UPLC-400. For each FA mean value, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and coefficient of variation are presented. (F): repeatability control: technical quality control samples (tQC). For each tQC the intensity of each FA are presented. For each FA mean value, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and coefficient of variation are presented calculated from tQC samples.</p>
