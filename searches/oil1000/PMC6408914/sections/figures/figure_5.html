 <p> Comparison of different techniques for FA quantification in rapeseed. (A, B) Retention time ( x-axis, RT)â€“m/z ( y-axis) scatter plots for UPLC-5 (A) and UPLC-400 (B). Each dot corresponds to the individual FA, mean log-intensity is indicated by the dot size. Red color text indicates chain length and number of double bounds. (C) Dependency between the mass fractions estimated using different methods, UPLC-5 vs UPLC-400. Each dot corresponds to the individual sample. </p>
