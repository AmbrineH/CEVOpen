  <p class="p">(A, B) Retention time (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis, RT)â€“m/z (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis) scatter plots for UPLC-5 (A) and UPLC-400 (B). Each dot corresponds to the individual FA, mean log-intensity is indicated by the dot size. Red color text indicates chain length and number of double bounds. (C) Dependency between the mole fractions estimated using different methods, UPLC-5 vs UPLC-400. Pearson correlation was calculated between logs of mole fraction.
