  <title class="title">Dependency between the mass fractions of FAs in rapeseed (calculated for 11 FAs detected by GC-FID) estimated using different methods.</title>
  <p class="p">GC-FID vs UPLC-5 and GC-FID vs UPLC-400 are shown in (A) and (B) respectively. Each dot corresponds to a given FA (shown by color) in a given sample (C) Mean mass fractions (relative to the total intensity of 11 FAs detected by GC-FID) for all FAs determined using the three techniques. FAs which were not detected by the indicated method are shown by white rectangles. FAs are ordered according to their intensities as obtained by UPLC-5.</p>
