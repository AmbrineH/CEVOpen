  <p class="p">Different parts of the walnut tree and fruit, as illustrated in the schematic image. Fruit, branch, leaf, shoot, and bark are considered as the main parts of the tree which have been comprehensively investigated. Walnut fruit is the most crucial portion of the plant because it contains the kernel. Walnut fruit is composed of five main parts: the outer green husk, the middle part as the shell and, finally, the kernel covered with a brown leathery layer as skin. Inside the nut, the seeds of walnut are separated from each other by a brown woody layer, namely, the pellicle (not shown here).</p>
