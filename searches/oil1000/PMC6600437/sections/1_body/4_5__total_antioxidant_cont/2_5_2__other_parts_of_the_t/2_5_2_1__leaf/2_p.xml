<p class="p">As has been shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the content of total phenolics of the walnut leaf was reported in different units. Accordingly, all the summarized data for the TPC and TFC of walnut leaf in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> were converted to mg/g (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), and it was seen that the leaf part in the dried form has considerable amounts of TPC ranging from 34 to 194 mg/g. Besides, the extracts derived from walnut leaf show higher amounts of phenolics. For the TFC of the walnut leaf, a high amount of flavonoids in both DW and the investigated extracts (20 and 20.17â€“149 mg/g, respectively) was found. As has been shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the content of phenols and flavonoids have not been reported for the fresh walnut leaf.
