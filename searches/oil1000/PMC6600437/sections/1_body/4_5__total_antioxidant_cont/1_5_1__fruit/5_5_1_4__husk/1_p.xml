<p class="p">The TPC of walnut husk was obtained in numerous studies; however; the values were reported in different units, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. For this reason, all of them were converted to the unit of mg/g for getting the exact amounts of total phenolics in the walnut husk (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The TPC of walnut is estimated to be 6.27–36.10 for the DW, while the TPC was in the range of 50.18–166.44 mg/g for the considered extracts. Additionally, the values obtained for the content of total flavonoids in walnut green husk were considered as mg/g, and it was determined to be 0.7–12.22 and 22.91–65.2 mg/g on the DW and the prepared extracts, respectively. The fresh walnut husk has not been studied for its TPC and TFC determination.
