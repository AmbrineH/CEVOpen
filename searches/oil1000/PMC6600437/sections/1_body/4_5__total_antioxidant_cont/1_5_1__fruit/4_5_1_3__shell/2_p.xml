<p class="p">The reported data related to TPC and TFC of the shell portion of walnut fruit summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> are also expressed as mg/g. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, it can be observed that the TPC for the shell was 18.4 and 68.34–200 mg/g in the DW and the prepared extract, respectively. The content of total flavonoid values for the walnut shell was also changed to mg/g, and it was found that it contains 4.86 and 80.40–162.5 mg/g of DW and the extract, respectively. Both TPC and TFC have not been determined in the fresh walnut shell. These reported values indicated that the obtained extracts derived from walnut shell have a higher content of phenolic and flavonoid constituents.
