<p class="p">In an investigation, the antioxidant activities and xanthine oxidase inhibition effects of husk, shell and defatted kernel of walnut fruit, as well as the stem and leaf, were studied. Surprisingly, 14.81 g GAEs/100 g dry extract (DE) as the highest TPC were recorded for the obtained extract from the shell portion followed by leaf extract, stem extract, defatted kernel extract, and green husk extract [

 <xref rid="B141-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>], among different examined solvents (water, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), the highest TPC (200.40 mg GAEs/g extract) and TFC (80.40 mg QEs/g extract) were achieved with ethyl acetate. Additionally, they investigated the inhibitory effect of extracts on the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and found that the methanol extract had the highest inhibitory activity under the concentration of 500 Î¼g/mL.
