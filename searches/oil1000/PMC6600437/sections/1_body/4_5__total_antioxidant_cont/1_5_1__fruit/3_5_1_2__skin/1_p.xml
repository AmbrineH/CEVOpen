<p class="p">According to the performed studies, the skin or seed coat surrounding the kernel contains high amounts of antioxidant compounds. For example, twelve genotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L., six with red skin and another six with light yellow skin were selected for investigating some nutritional and functional components of the kernel and skin [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Significantly higher levels of TPC and TFC in yellow skins than in red skins were found, while no significant differences between the two groups of genotypes were reported in kernels. Authors indicated that walnuts could be considered as a good source of dietary antioxidants, and most of them are concentrated in the seed coat. It has been documented that despite the beneficial effects of walnut, its phenolics may adversely influence the protein solubility [
