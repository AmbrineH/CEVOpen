<p class="p">Different TPC values obtained in studies related to the skin of the walnut kernel are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. For better interpretation, all of them were also changed to mg/g in order to obtain a concentration range for the TPC and to compare the values. As has been presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, for both DW and the studied extracts, the skin portion of walnut fruit contains a high amount of TPC (52.05–279.3 and 490 mg/g, respectively). In the case of TFC, only total flavonoid for the dry skin of the walnut fruit has been reported (0.5–10.96 mg/g). The most crucial point is that the content of flavonoids in both kernel and skin, particularly in the skin, is reported to be low, demonstrating that walnut kernel with its seed coat contains phenolics mostly of the non-flavonoid type, which belong to the phenolic acids and hydrolyzable tannins.
