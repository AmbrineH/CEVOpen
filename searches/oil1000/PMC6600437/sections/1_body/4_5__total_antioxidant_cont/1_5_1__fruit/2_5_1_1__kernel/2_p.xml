<p class="p">The content of antioxidants may fluctuate among different genotypes and cultivars. The proximate and mineral composition, total polyphenol, fatty acid profile, serotonin and melatonin contents were assessed in four walnut cultivars (cv. Serr, Hartley, Chandler, and Howard) and the highest TPC was registered for Howard cultivar [

 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] studied the TPC and TFC of different parts of fruits among six genotypes of walnuts grown in Iran. The methanolic extracts of walnut genotypes were analyzed for their RP, DPPH, superoxide anion, and nitric oxide radical scavenging capacity. Remarkable differences in TPC and radical scavenging potential in different portions of fruits and among various considered genotypes were found.
