<p class="p">The results of different studies indicate that walnut seed contains higher antioxidant content. Among different considered dry fruits, the methanolic extract of walnut showed a higher value of the antioxidant activity. A higher TPC was reported in walnuts followed by almonds, cashew nut, chironji, and least phenolic content was found in raisins [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The antioxidant content (TPC and TFC) and antiproliferative activities of nine different types of tree nuts and peanuts which are consumed in the United States were comprehensively evaluated [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and walnuts exhibited the highest TPC, TFC, and TAA. Additionally, walnuts and pecans exhibited the highest antiproliferative activity against the proliferation of HepG2 and Caco-2 cells. The chemical analysis and the identification of the bioactive compounds of peanut, nut and pistachio varieties showed that walnut had the highest TPC (1404 ± 23 mg GAEs/100 g) and antioxidant capacity (191 ± 4.2 μmol TEs/g) [

The LC-LTQ-Orbitrap technique was applied for the identification of walnut polyphenols, and 120 various compounds belonging to the groups of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were reported [
 <xref rid="B200-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>]. The authors obtained high TPC for walnut seed extract. Abe, et al. [
 <xref rid="B176-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>] registered the highest TPCs and DPPH radical scavenging capacities among eleven different types of nuts, including cashew nut, pistachio, pinhao seed, hazelnut, peanuts, chestnut, walnut, pecan, Brazil nut, macadamia, and almond.
