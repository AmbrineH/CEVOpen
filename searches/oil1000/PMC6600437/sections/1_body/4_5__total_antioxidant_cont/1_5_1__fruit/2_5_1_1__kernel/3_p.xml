<p class="p">As discussed, there are numerous investigations suggesting that walnuts possess potent antioxidant activity in comparison to the other nuts [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B210-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>,
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>] and this observation is probably related to the presence of phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], particularly hydrolysable tannins [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], tocopherols [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and also melatonin, an indoleamine that shows high antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Most of these investigations have dealt directly with extracts from the non-defatted raw material, even though several of them have considered the antioxidant capacity of lipophilic compounds of walnut or walnut oil [
 <xref rid="B212-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. However, the influence of the two main fractions of walnut (defatted material and oil) on its full antioxidant capacity is not well recognized. In a comprehensive investigation, Arranz, et al. [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>] assessed the antioxidant capacity of oil, defatted material, and whole walnut. High TPC and antioxidant capacity for aqueous–organic extracts of the whole walnut were observed by the authors (2016 ± 178 mg GAEs/100 g of dry matter (DM) and 165.18 ± 19.3 µmol Trolox equivalents (TEs)/g of DM by 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, respectively). The obtained values confirmed the TPC obtained by Kornsteiner, et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], who measured that the extractable TPC was in the range of 1020–2052 mg GAEs/100 g of DM after the extraction of the whole walnut using a solution of 75% acetone and 25% of 526 µmol/L sodium metabisulphite. An antioxidant capacity of 119.91 µmol TEs/g of DM by ABTS assay for walnut extracts was also reported [
 <xref rid="B210-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>]. They measured the TPC in the aqueous–organic extracts of the defatted matter of walnut. After the defatting sample by petroleum ether, the TPC in the extracts, and the antioxidant capacity were 1071 ± 35 mg GAEs/100 g of DM, and 211.85 ± 9.51 µmol TEs/g of DM by ABTS assay, respectively. The authors concluded that the high-fat content of walnut (66%) affected the values of antioxidant capacity and the TPC of the extracts, an important point that has not been reported in the literature dealing with nuts. Moreover, in extraction residue, the high-fat content formed an emulsion preventing further quantification of hydrolyzable tannins and their antioxidant capacity. Their results indicated that the defatted material of walnut presented the significant antioxidant capacity (estimated about 332 µmol TEs/g of DM) of this nut; a significant part resulted from insoluble tannins. The influence of walnut oil on the complete antioxidant activity of walnut (FRAP and ABTS assays) was reported to be less than 5%. Also, it was detected that oil could affect the measurement of the antioxidant activities of whole walnut, a fact that could influence the information described in the works. Finally, the authors concluded that it is necessary to determine the antioxidant capacity of oil and defatted material separately.
