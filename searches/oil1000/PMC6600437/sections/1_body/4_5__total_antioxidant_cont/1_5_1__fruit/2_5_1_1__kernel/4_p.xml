<p class="p">The kernel and husk portions of walnut fruit have been received increasing attention by different research groups (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) and, thus, there are many reports on the antioxidant content, especially TPC and TFC. For better interpretation, all the obtained values in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for the TPC of the walnut kernel were converted to mg/g based on DW, fresh weight (FW) and extract. As has been summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the TPC of the walnut kernel is in the range of 1.45–18.61 mg/g of DW, while it contains 7.35–86.67 mg/g of FW. Besides, the content of total phenolic in the prepared walnut kernel extract is 25.06–166 mg/g. For a better comparison of the TFC values measured for the walnut kernel, the data were also converted to mg/g (For further details, refer to 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The TFC of the walnut kernel is 0.9–7.44 mg/g of DW. There is no information regarding the content of flavonoids in the fresh walnut kernel. However, 10–20 mg/g for the TFC has been reported for the obtained extract derived from the walnut kernel. It is clear that the TPC and TFC of the extract are higher than that of the values reported for the dried or fresh walnut kernel. It seems that the execution extraction procedure using certain solvents enables the detection of the higher concentration of antioxidant content for walnut kernel extract compared to its DW or FW.
