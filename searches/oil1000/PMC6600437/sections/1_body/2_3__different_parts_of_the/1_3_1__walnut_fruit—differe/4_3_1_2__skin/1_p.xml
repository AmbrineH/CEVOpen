<p class="p">The flesh of walnut seed is surrounded by a brown leathery coating, called the skin or the seed coat, which protects walnut kernel from oxidation and microbial contamination. Walnut phenolics are measured in the highest concentration in the skin, and they are reported to have favorable effects on human health owing to their apparent anti-atherogenic and antioxidant properties. It has been well evidenced that the removal of the seed coat reduces the total antioxidant activity of hazelnuts, walnuts, and pistachios by approximately 36, 90, and 55%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. It has been reported that the mean of the total phenolic content (TPC) of seed coat was 12.7-fold higher than that of the kernel, but the antioxidant activity (AA) is 12.9-fold higher [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Thus, most of the antioxidants are concentrated in the skin portion of the walnut fruit. There is a handful study that analyzed the potency of walnut seed skin as an antioxidant [

Even though it has already been demonstrated that individual walnut components have antioxidant potential and the scientific information on the antioxidant properties of walnut skin bioactive compounds is still rather scarce. Therefore, the evaluation of such properties remains a valuable task, especially for discovering and developing new sources of nutraceuticals, functional foods, and natural antioxidants.
