<p class="p">Undoubtedly, walnut fruit is the most crucial part of the plant for human because it contains the edible kernel. As has been shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02133-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, walnut fruit includes five individual parts which are known as kernel, skin, pellicle, shell, and husk. The inner part of the fruit contains the valuable kernel, and it is usually consumed in human nutrition. The kernel is enclosed by a leathery light brown thin layer which is known as skin or seed coat. The high concentration of antioxidants in this part of the fruit protects the kernel from different hazardous effects such as viral, fungal or microbial contaminations and also ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The shell is the middle portion of walnut fruit that is considered as a hard lignocellulosic material. The kernel is surrounded by the shell which is known as a nut, and it must be mechanically cracked to release the kernel. Inside the nut, the kernel is divided into some parts by the pellicle. The outer part of the walnut fruit is its green husk, which cracks when the fruit on the tree is ready to be harvested and, thus, it can be easily removed [
