<p class="p">Water, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, chloroform, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol, benzene, and cyclohexane are the common solvents which have been used for the preparation of extracts from different parts of the walnut fruit and tree (for more details, see 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Among them, water, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, and acetone are the most used extraction solvents. There is some research in the literature explaining the appropriateness of the considered solvents mentioned above and their selection in most investigations worked on walnut. For example, the phenolic content and antioxidant activities of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts derived from the seed, husk, and leaf parts of the walnut were investigated [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. The highest levels of phenolic content and correspondingly antiradical activities were seen in seeds, leaves and green husk methanolic extracts, respectively. In contrast, petroleum ether (a mixture of some alkanes, e.g., hexane, heptane, and pentane) has no or less potential for antioxidant activity. The results of some other studies demonstrated that in most cases, the obtained extracts from different parts of walnut using alcohols, water or a mixture of them presented a higher phenolic content than the extracts of other nonpolar solvents such as petroleum ether, chloroform, n-butanol, benzene, and cyclohexane. It is believed that polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, water, acetone, and ethyl acetate are the best solvents for phenolic extraction.
