<p class="p">It has been indicated that the extracted phenolics from the walnut shell can be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants for application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the research on the extraction and analysis of the walnut shell chemical composition are not fully considered, and the research is limited to several studies. In a recent study, the extraction of phenolic compounds from the walnut shell using the ultrasonic bath, ultrasonic probe, and standard shaking method was reported. For all three extraction methods, a mixture of 50% ethanol/water was used as a solvent. The achieved extraction yield by an ultrasonic probe was 51.2 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight (GAEs/g DW), 2-fold higher than both shaking and ultrasonic bath methods which were 20.6 and 25.8 mg GAEs/g DW, respectively. By a size reduction of the walnut shell, the extraction of phenolic compounds was more improved. When the particle size was between 45â€“100 mesh, the best extraction yield of 52.8 mg GAEs/g DW was attained. The authors found that the ultrasonic probe treatment is the best method for the extraction of phenolics from the walnut shell. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated that during the ultrasonic probe treatment, the solid structure of the cells was better ruptured increasing the penetration of solvents and, thus, enhancing the extraction yield [

In another study, Soxhlet extraction (SE) followed by pretreatment with microwave irradiation (MWI) and ultra-sonication using two different solvents (methanol and acetone) was optimized by a three-factor three-stage response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD) [

They observed that pretreatment enhanced the total extract yield compared to conventional SE. The authors reported that pretreatment with MWI was more effective than ultra-sonication. Besides, as a solvent, the performance of acetone was better than methanol in the bio-components recovery. In comparison to the conventional SE, MWI pretreatment enhanced separation for methanol and acetone by 4.06- and 5.25-fold, respectively. The highest yield (46 mg/g) was obtained when the sample was pretreated with MWI at 180 W for 4 min using acetone as the solvent. The extraction yields, total flavonoids content (TFC) and antioxidant properties of the walnut shell using different solvents (water, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) were analyzed, and authors achieved the highest extraction yield with n-butanol (4.54%) [
