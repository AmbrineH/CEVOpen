<p class="p">In some research studies, water was directly used as the extraction solvent. The green husks of five different walnut cultivars including Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise, and Parisienne were considered for the obtainment of aqueous extracts, and their TPC, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were studied. Walnut green husk was extracted with boiling water [

 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. green husk extract was prepared using boiling water for 30 min and, then, it was successfully used as the stabilizer and reducing agents for the biosynthesis of NPs. They claimed that when using walnut husk extract as a natural plant resource, NPs with the preferred size could be obtained.
