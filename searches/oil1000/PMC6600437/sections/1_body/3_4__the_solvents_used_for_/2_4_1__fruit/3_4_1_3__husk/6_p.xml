<p class="p">In the study of Boncler, et al. [
 <xref rid="B201-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>], the authors used a mixture of acetone and water for the preparation of phenolic extracts from walnut green husk and the spent hops (
 <italic class="italic">H. lupulus</italic> L.). In this investigation, the prepared extracts were used to assess the anti-proliferative effects of plant extracts on human endothelial cells and compare the PrestoBlue and MTT assays in cellular viability. The cytotoxic and anti-platelet activities of polyphenolic extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">A. montana</italic> flowers and 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. husks have been compared and for the preparation of both plant extracts, authors used the acetoneâ€“water solution as the extraction solvent system [
