<p class="p">Among the employed solvents, methanol is the best solvent considered as the first choice by some authors in the preparation of walnut husk extracts. The antioxidant activity of the endocarp and exocarp of walnut were evaluated using different solvents such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. The highest antioxidant activity was achieved for the methanol extract of walnut exocarp [

 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], the phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant content, and antiradical activity of six different genotypes of walnut fruits grown in Iran were studied. Different parts of the collected fruit samples, including kernel, skin, shell, and husk were extracted with methanol using Soxhlet apparatus. In another similar study, the husk and kernel of seven different walnut genotypes from Iran including KZ7, KZ9, KZ15, OR126, Sebin, Pedro and Chandler were extracted using methanol in Soxhlet apparatus [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] investigated the antioxidant activity of some dry fruits (almonds, walnut, cashew nut, raisins, chironji) through methanolic extracts. To assess the influence of environmental factors on antioxidant activity, the phenol and flavonoids content of walnut husk from 11 regions of Iran with different geographical and climatic conditions, a methanolic extract was prepared and used [
