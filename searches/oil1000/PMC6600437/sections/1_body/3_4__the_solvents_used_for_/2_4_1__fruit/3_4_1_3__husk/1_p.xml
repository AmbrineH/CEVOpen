<p class="p">Water, methanol, and ethanol were recognized as the most suitable solvents for the preparation of an extract from the walnut husk (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> for more details). A study on the effects of different extraction solvents such as hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and water on the content of phytochemicals showed that the extraction solvents significantly affected the phytochemical content and antioxidant activities of the extracts obtained from walnut green husk. It has been reported that acetone, ethanol, and methanol extracts had higher contents of phytochemicals, and exhibited stronger antioxidant activities, followed by the ethyl acetate and water extracts, and the lowest for the hexane extract [
