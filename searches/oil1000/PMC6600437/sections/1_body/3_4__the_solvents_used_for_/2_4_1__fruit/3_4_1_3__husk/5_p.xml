<p class="p">The results of some studies revealed that the selection of an appropriate ratio of different solvents and water could increase the content of phenolics in the prepared extracts derived from walnut green husk. Most research studies used a mixture of ethanol, methanol, or acetone as an effective extraction system. For example, Fernández-Agulló, et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] tried to analyze the effect of different solvents (water, methanol, ethanol and 50% aqueous solutions of methanol and ethanol) on extraction yields and extract bioactive properties of walnut green husk. They obtained the highest extraction yield with water (44.11%), and high bioactive potential has been achieved by the samples extracted with water/ethanol (1:1) (84.46 mg GAEs/g extract; EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.95 mg/mL for reducing power (RP) and EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.33 mg/mL for DPPH assay). In another investigation, a comparison between the conventional and ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) of natural antioxidants from walnut green husk has been reported in studies reported by Tabaraki and Rastgoo [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. They applied ultrasonic technology for the extraction of antioxidants from walnut green husk, and ethanol was used as a food-grade solvent. A mixture of 60% ethanol–water mixture as a solvent, a temperature of 60 °C, and an extraction time of 30 min were reported as the optimal conditions. Authors compared UAE and conventional extraction and showed that TPC, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH and the extraction yield obtained by UAE during 30 min were significantly higher than by the conventional extraction during 16 h. Different extracts were prepared from green fruits of ‘Sibisel 44’ walnut cultivar and, then, their TPC and TFC, antioxidant activity, individual phenolics content, and color component were investigated [
