<p class="p">It has been shown that a mixture of different solvents and water can be used as an effective extraction system for the evaluation of antioxidant and antiradical activity of walnut seed. As a result, a mixture of methanol and water with a different ratio has been reported. For example, high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and electrospray ionization ion-trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-TOF-MS) methods were combined and established for preparative isolation of complex mixtures of compounds from polar extracts of walnut. In this study, the authors used methanol 80% for the preparation of walnut kernel crude extract [

 <xref rid="B181-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>] to assess their kernels from the viewpoint of glutathione and TPC, as well as their antioxidant capacities. In this work, the authors used methanol:water (70:30) solution for the preparation of extracts. A mixture of methanol and water with the same ratio was also reported by Rosales-Martínez, et al. [
 <xref rid="B178-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] when they compared the antioxidant activities of phenolic extracts from Mexican peanuts, peanuts’ skins, nuts, and pistachios. The methanolic extracts with the same ratio were also used for the evaluation of eleven different kinds of nuts, including cashew nut (
