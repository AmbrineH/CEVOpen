<p class="p">The high safety of water makes it a suitable solvent which was used in some investigations as the extraction solvent for the preparation of extract from the walnut kernel and the evaluation of its antioxidant properties. In an investigation carried out by Pereira, et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], the chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity of six walnut cultivars (Franquette, Lara, Marbot, Mayette, Mellanaise, and Parisienne) cultivated in Portugal were considered. In this work, boiling water was used for the preparation of extracts. Moreover, the artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression were used for the prediction of the antimicrobial activity of the walnut kernel and the extracts were prepared using water as the extraction solvent [
