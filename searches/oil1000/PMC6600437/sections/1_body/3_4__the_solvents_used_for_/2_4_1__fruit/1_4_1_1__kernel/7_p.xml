<p class="p">In most studies dealing with the antioxidant content and radical scavenging activity of walnut seed, diluted acetone with water was also used as an extraction solvent. Christopoulos and Tsantili [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>] investigated the effects of cultivar and some storage conditions such as time, temperature, and oxygen availability on the content of total phenolics, the total antioxidant capacity and the color of walnut kernels from three different cultivars including Chandler, Hartley, and Ioli. The authors used 80% acetone as the extraction solvent for obtaining phenolic extracts. Anderson, et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] prepared walnut kernel extract using 75% acetone and reported that the oxidation of human plasma and LDL is inhibited in vitro by walnut polyphenols. Using the acetone extract of walnut kernel demonstrated that polyphenol extract attenuated the immunotoxicity induced by 4-pentylphenol and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol in Murine splenic lymphocyte [

A mixture of acetone and water was also reported in the scientific reports for the comprehensive identification of walnut polyphenols by the liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization hybrid linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap (LCâ€“LTQ-Orbitrap) mass spectrometry. One hundred and twenty different compounds, belonging to the class of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were identified in this investigation [

By using 80% acetone, the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, and walnuts as commonly available tree nuts and peanuts in the United States were evaluated [
