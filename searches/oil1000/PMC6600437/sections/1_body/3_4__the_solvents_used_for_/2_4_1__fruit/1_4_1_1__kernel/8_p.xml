<p class="p">The use of other solvents for the preparation of walnut kernel extract is limited to n-butanol or ethyl acetate. In an investigation by Zhang, et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], the authors used an activity-directed fractionation and purification process in order to isolate DPPH radical scavenging components from walnut kernels. In their study, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions represent higher DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to those fractions of petroleum ether and water. Glansrins A, B, and C as three hydrolyzable tannins along with adenosine, adenine, and 13 other tannins were characterized in the n-butanol extract of walnut seeds [
