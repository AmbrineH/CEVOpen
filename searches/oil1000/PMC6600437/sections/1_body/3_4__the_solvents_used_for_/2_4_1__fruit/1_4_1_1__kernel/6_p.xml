<p class="p">A mixture of ethanol and water was examined in some research as an effective extraction solvent system. Authors used a different ratio of ethanol and water for enhancing extraction efficiency. Gómez-Caravaca, et al. [
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>] aimed to develop a capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method for the identification and quantification of phenolic and other related polar compounds in the walnut kernel. Using rapid analytical techniques, Verardo, et al. [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>] analyzed the lipid fraction and characterized phenolic compounds in Italian walnuts (Chandler cv.) grown in the same experimental orchard under different agronomical conditions. In both types of research, phenolic extracts were prepared using a mixture of ethanol and water. Additionally, it has been observed that pancreatic lipase activity was inhibited by 50% ethanolic extract of walnut seed in vitro, and it showed the hypolipidemic effect on high fat diet-induced obese Mice [

 <xref rid="B154-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>] extracted the phenolic fraction from the skin and walnut flour and examined their antioxidant capacity. In this investigation, two different solvent systems (a mixture of ethanol and methanol with water) were employed, and minor differences were observed among the solvent systems used concerning TPC and antioxidant activity.
