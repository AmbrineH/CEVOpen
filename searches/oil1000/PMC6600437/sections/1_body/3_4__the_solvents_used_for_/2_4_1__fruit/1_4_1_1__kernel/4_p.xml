<p class="p">It has been reported that the prepared extract using acetone had higher antioxidant activity than when using water and even methanol. In this investigation, the effect of processing techniques (microwaving and soaking) on walnut antioxidant and antiproliferative activities was evaluated [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. The extracts were obtained by using different solvents (acetone, methanol, and water) and compared to the methanol and water extracts; acetone extract showed considerably higher antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity was increased after soaking treatment and, thus, the authors claimed that the soaking process could be utilized for promoting the health benefits of walnuts in industrial applications.
