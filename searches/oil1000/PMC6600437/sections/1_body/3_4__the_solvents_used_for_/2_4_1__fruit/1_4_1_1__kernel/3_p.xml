<p class="p">In the case of ethanol as the employed extraction solvent, the aqueous and ethanolic extract of walnut seed were used to assess antioxidant content and radical scavenging activities. The ethanolic extract showed significantly higher antioxidant activity in comparison to the aqueous extract [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] found that the ethanolic extracts of walnut kernel contained lower amounts of phenolic compounds than the aqueous extracts obtained before ethanol extraction. They considered the antioxidant activity and phenolic content of fresh and dry hazelnuts, walnuts and pistachios with or without the seed coat and observed some variation in phenolic content and antioxidant activity for hydrophilic and ethanolic fractions obtained by successive extraction of the walnut kernel.
