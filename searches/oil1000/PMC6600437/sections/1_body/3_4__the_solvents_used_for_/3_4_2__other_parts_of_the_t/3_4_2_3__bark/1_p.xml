<p class="p">Walnut bark is also considered as another rich source of phenolic antioxidants. For this reason, different solvents for the effective extraction of phenolic compounds from walnut bark have been examined. Hasan, et al. [
 <xref rid="B196-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>] prepared organic extracts using methanol, chloroform and n-hexane as solvents from walnut root bark and evaluated their effect on cell proliferation, and the molecular mechanism of cell death induction by studying the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspases, Tp53, Mdm-2 and TNF-Î± in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. It has been proved that the hydroalcoholic extract of the stem bark of 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. had a good effect against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</italic> and the authors recommended that the obtained extract can be used as a commercial disinfectant in the form of spray or solution in hospitals and public places [
 <xref rid="B174-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>]. Additionally, water, methanol, ethyl acetate, and diluted acetone extracts of natural and colored 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> bark were screened for in vitro activity against vaginal 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Authors reported that among four 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. extracts for natural and colored bark, the methanolic extract of natural bark had the best antifungal activity against all vaginal 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> bark were prepared. Then, the effects were evaluated on four different oral bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. In this investigation, the authors concluded that the ethanolic extract of walnut bark had a significant antibacterial effect against all the tested bacteria. It has been shown that the aqueous extract of walnut bark had a significantly inhibited the growth of oral microbial flora compared to the acetone extract [
