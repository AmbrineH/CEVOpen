<p class="p">The antibacterial, anticandidal, and antioxidant activities of walnut bark extract were studied with a mixture of acetone:water (80:20;

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), ethyl acetate and methanol [
 <xref rid="B195-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>]. This investigation showed that the ethyl acetate extract of walnut bark was more effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and diluted acetone extracts from the fresh and dry stem of 
 <italic class="italic">S. persica</italic> and walnut bark were tested for their potent antifungal activities against some 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species. It has been shown that among the prepared extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. persica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L., the ethyl acetate extract of walnut bark had the potent antifungal activity against all the studied of
