<p class="p">As has been shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02133-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, methanol as a suitable solvent was also used for the preparation of walnut shoot phenolic extracts. In the first report, in order to identify the potential involvement of phenolics in the constitutive chemical resistance of the shoots against walnut bacterial blight (
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv.

 <xref rid="B80-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. During the growing season, authors measured the content of eight phenolic compounds in the prepared methanolic extracts from rejuvenated annual shoots of walnut cultivars Elit, Franquette, Hartley, and Sampion by HPLC with the photodiode array (PDA) detector. In the second study, Cheniany, et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] considered the content of different groups of phenolic compounds present in the micro shoots of 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. cultivars and studied their antioxidant activity using 80% methanol as the extraction solvent. Finally, the same percentage of this solvent was used for the preparation of extracts from micro shoots of
