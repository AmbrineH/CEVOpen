<p class="p">Methanol is also reported as a suitable solvent for the preparation of walnut leaf phenolic extract. The antifungal activity of four prepared extract fractions from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. including methanolic, ethyl acetate, alkaloid and hydrolyzed methanolic were evaluated against pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> strains. The methanolic extract of the walnut leaf was reported as having the highest anticandidal activity followed by the alkaloid, ethyl acetate, and hydrolyzed methanolic extracts [
 <xref rid="B192-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">192</xref>]. A full investigation was performed on the chemical analysis of Tunisian 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. stem and leaf fractions, their antibacterial potential, and dyeing properties. Both water and pure methanol were employed as a solvent for the extract preparation from the stem and leaves of walnut to assess the effect of the solvent on the extraction yield. The obtained extraction yields were 21.45 and 19.37%, respectively, for stem and leaves using methanol as the solvent. However, the values of the extraction yields in the case of water were 12.75 and 15.22%, respectively, for the stem and leaves. From the registered results, the authors reported that methanol is a suitable solvent, and it is kept back for further assays [

 <xref rid="B194-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>] that the obtained crude methanolic extract of walnut leaf possessed high anti-pseudomonal activity. Nour, et al. [
 <xref rid="B188-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">188</xref>] reported the determination of phenolic acids, juglone, and flavonoids in the prepared methanolic extracts of walnut leaves by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Santos, et al. [
 <xref rid="B189-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>] investigated the leaves and decoction of 
 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. and reported that the methanol extract had higher antioxidant and antitumor potential than a decoction. The antioxidant activity of methanolic and water extracts obtained from nine different fruit tree leaves including avocado, walnut, mulberry, fig, carob, lemon, pomegranate, grape, and loquat collected from the Mediterranean region of Turkey was investigated and it has been found that the methanolic extract had higher antioxidant content and radical scavenging activity compared to aqueous extract [
