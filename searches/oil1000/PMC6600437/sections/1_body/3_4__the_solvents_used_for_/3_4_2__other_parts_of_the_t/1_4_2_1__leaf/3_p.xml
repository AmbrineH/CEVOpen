<p class="p">Ethanol is another solvent used in some investigations for the preparation of walnut leaf extracts. According to the study of Einali, et al. [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>], they evaluated the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of ethanol and water extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aphylla</italic>, Persian walnut, and oleander leaves. The ethanol extracts with the highest amount of total phenolics and flavonoids in all assays showed the highest antioxidant and antimicrobial activities compared to water extracts. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was also designed by Hosseini, et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] to study the effects of the prepared ethanolic extract obtained from

 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] tried to establish the optimum conditions for extracting phenolic compounds using the UAE and RSM from walnut leaves. It has been indicated that the liquid-to-solid ratio and ethanol concentration were proved to be the primary factors affecting extraction efficiency. The ethanolic extract of walnut leaves was also examined for antibacterial activities on
