<p class="p">In the case of walnut leaves, a mixture of various organic solvents and water as a useful extraction system for obtaining and analyzing the antioxidant content of the prepared extracts has been considered. In this way, different ratios of water and other solvents were employed by different authors. For example, the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was compared with three others for the extraction and determination of TPC and TFC in walnut leaves. It was found that TPC and TFC for the prepared extracts of walnut leaves in MAE method was 4 min, higher than that when using maceration extraction (ME), UAE, and SE for 24 h, 15 min, and 6 h, respectively. Compared with other extraction methods, MAE reduced the extraction time. It was found that blanching had no significant effect on the TPC of walnut leaves. Different methanol concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, 99.8%
