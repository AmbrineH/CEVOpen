<p class="p">Distilled, acidified or boiling water was also selected as another solvent for the extraction of antioxidant phenolic compounds from the leaves of walnut. In a first human trial conducted by Hosseini, et al. [

 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>] evaluated the effect of acid pre-treatment on the dyeing performance of walnut leaves on wool fibers. They prepared the extract with distilled water using a Soxhlet type apparatus at its boiling point. In another investigation by Amaral, et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>], to assess the effects of cultivar, geographical location, and crop season influence on the phenolic profile of walnut leaves, acidified water was used for the preparation of extracts. Recently, the extraction of phenolic compounds from walnut leaves using heat-assisted extraction (HAE) and deep eutectic solvents based on carboxylic acids and choline chloride has been established [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. The authors performed a preliminary solvent screening using a selected group of carboxylic acids as hydrogen bond donors. The extract of phenolic compounds with the highest yield was obtained using choline chloride mixtures with butyric or phenyl propionic acid at a mole ratio of 1:2, with 20% of water.
