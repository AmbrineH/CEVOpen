<p class="p">Leaf and bark are the main parts of the walnut tree examined for DPPH radical scavenging capacity. For example, an ethanol:water (4:6) extract from walnut leaves was investigated for its putative in vitro scavenging properties on ROS including hydroxyl, superoxide, peroxyl, and hydrogen peroxide radicals and RNS including nitric oxide and peroxynitrite anion [

Moreover, among various investigated solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and benzene), the prepared methanolic extract from walnut leaves exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity followed by the water extract (0.199 ± 0.023 and 2.991 ± 0.740, respectively) [
