<p class="p">DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> has been investigated since the 1950s for its use as an organic colorimetric reagent [
 <xref rid="B214-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. In the last two decades, the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> test has emerged as a method for analyzing phenols in plants and food products derived from plants [
 <xref rid="B215-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>]. Braude, et al. [
 <xref rid="B216-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>] observed that DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> behaves as an antioxidant in the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. A concentration-dependent antioxidant potential was reported in reducing power and DPPH assays, with EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values lower than 1 mg/mL for all the tested aqueous extracts of walnut green husks among five different cultivars (

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. The highest ability to scavenge DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were registered for ethyl acetate extract (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 81.03 μg/mL), methanol extract (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 131.35 μg/mL) and chloroform extract (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 176.35 μg/mL), respectively. In this research, various solvents such as water, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol have been tested for analyzing the extraction yields, total flavonoids content and antioxidant properties of the walnut shell [
