<p class="p">As an ancient herb, various parts of walnut have therapeutic potential or preventive properties. The results of most investigations strongly show that walnut is an excellent source of active chemo-preventive constituents and natural antioxidants. Today, it has received increasing attention because of the highest antioxidant content of walnut among different commonly consumed nuts. The flesh of walnut fruit is placed inside three layers, called the seed coat or skin, the inner shell, and outer green shell cover or husk. Shell and husk are agricultural by-products that are considered as valuable sources of different phenolics or other beneficial compounds produced in large quantities upon the processing of the fruit. Such agricultural by-products are generally used as fuel. The skin, shell, and husk constitute over 70% of the total weight of the walnut fruit and are a readily available source of beneficial compounds.</p>
