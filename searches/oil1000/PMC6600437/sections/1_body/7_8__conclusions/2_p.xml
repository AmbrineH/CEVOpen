<p class="p">Walnut green husks can be an excellent source of valuable compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial activity, and health protection potential. For the effective use of shell and also branch, a waste product from the cultivation of the walnut tree, pyroligneous acids can be prepared and collected by pyrolyzing at higher temperature conditions. The obtained pyroligneous acids from the shell and tree branch have high potential to be industrialized as natural antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal reagents in the fields of medicine, food industry, and agriculture. The highest levels of phenolic compounds are found to be concentrated in the skin. The results of some research on walnut skin clearly showed the importance of seed coat in the higher antioxidant activity of walnut kernel compared to other nuts. The total antioxidant activity reduced considerably on the removal of the seed coat. Although the skin contributes less than 5% to the walnut fruit weight, its TPC is at least 93â€“97% higher than that of the entire kernel, showing that skins are a good source of phenolic compounds than whole kernels. The papers discussed here established the antimicrobial potential of walnut bark, thus supporting its application as a preventive remedy in the oral cavity for various microbial diseases (periodontal and caries disease). Walnut leaves could be considered as another good source for the obtainment of polyphenol extracts. In this regard, extracts with a high content of phenolics as dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional food ingredients were prepared using the UAE method.</p>
