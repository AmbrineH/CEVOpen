<p class="p">It has been reported that the health benefits of walnuts are generally related to their chemical profile [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to the studies by Halvorsen, et al. [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], and Mishra, et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], walnuts rank as one of the highest content of antioxidants among all the studied seeds and nuts. Arcan and Yemenicioğlu [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] indicated that walnuts exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by pistachios and hazelnuts. Walnuts are considered a good source of tocopherols and essential fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Linoleic acid is the primary fatty acid, followed by linolenic, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been revealed to decrease the risk of CVDs by reducing the concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and enhancing the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] argued that ellagic acid and flavonoids in walnut have potential serum cholesterol-modulating effects, and one group of flavonoids has cardioprotective effects. It has been reported that catechin inhibits LDL oxidation and protects lymphoid cells against the cytotoxic effects of oxidized LDL [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Anderson, et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] demonstrated that walnut extract containing gallic acid, ellagic acid, and flavonoids suppresses the oxidation of human LDL in vitro. Moreover, walnuts possess other compounds that can be beneficial for promoting human health including polyphenols, tannins, folate [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], dietary fiber, protein, melatonin [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], and sterols [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. It has been reported that oil, tocopherols, and fatty acid concentration can fluctuate considerably among various walnut varieties and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Additionally, it has been shown that walnuts have a high concentration of α-tocopherol, a vitamin E family compound, which exhibits antioxidant properties, principally in the inhibition of lipid oxidation processes [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Recently, juglone compound or 5-hydroxyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, belonging to the class of naphthoquinones, has received much attention because it shows various biological activities, including excellent antitumoral effects on different human cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In this way, pyrogallol is another phenolic compound present in different parts of the walnut and their different properties, such as the interaction with serum albumin has been comprehensively investigated [
