<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of different parts of walnut fruit was evaluated by some spectroscopic-based methods such as total antioxidant activity (TAA), reducing power (RP), FRAP, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and lipid peroxidation inhibition in different investigations (

In this study, the authors evaluated the antioxidant activities and xanthine oxidase inhibition properties of different parts of fruit (husk, shell, and defatted kernel) and the stem and leaf portions of walnut. It was shown that the antioxidant capacities of all extracts evaluated by FRAP and ORAC assays were in agreement with the content of total phenolic except for defatted kernel extract.
