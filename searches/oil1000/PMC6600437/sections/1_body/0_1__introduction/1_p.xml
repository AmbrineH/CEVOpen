 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. They belong to a large and heterogeneous group of biologically active molecules, and their generation depends on different enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The metabolism of these compounds is integrated into the biochemical and morphological regulatory patterns of plants [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Phenolic compounds are involved in the physiological mechanisms of fruit and tree development and growth, and they affect various characteristics of fruit pre- and post-harvest periods [
