 <italic class="italic">J. regia</italic> L. is recognized as a rich source of different valuable chemicals because the kernel, fresh green fruit, husk, shell, skin, bark, leaves, and root are comprehensively studied to use in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In this respect, all parts of walnut tree can be used as an excellent source of various compounds expressing antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, as well as antinociceptive, antihistaminic, antiulcer, antiasthmatic, antidiabetics, immunomodulator, antifertility, hepatoprotective, central nervous system stimulant, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, lipolytic, larvicidal, insecticidal and many others properties positively affecting human health [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Walnut is categorized as a strategic species for human nutrition because the food and agriculture organization (FAO) included it in the group of priority plants [

Not only are walnuts used in human nutrition but also the young green walnuts are much appreciated in the traditional folk medicine of some countries and the preparation of jams and a wholesome alcoholic drink named walnut liqueur which contains high levels of phenolic compounds and vitamins. The fruit is left to steep in food-grade ethanol. This liqueur is made out of fresh walnuts with green husks just before the hardening of the endocarp [
