 <p class="p">With the increase of neglected diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, there was a need for the search for new therapeutic alternatives that reduce the harm caused by medicine available for treatment. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the antiparasitic activity of the essential oil from the fruits of 
  <italic class="italic">Piper tuberculatum</italic> Jacq, against lines of 
  <italic class="italic">Leishmania braziliensis</italic> (MHOM/CO/88/UA301), 
  <italic class="italic">Leishmania infantum</italic> (MHOM/ES/92/BCN83) and 
  <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (LC-B5 clone). Before running protocols, an analysis of the chemical composition of essential oil was conducted, which presented monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. As major constituents, β-pinene and α-pinene were identified. Regarding to antiparasitic activity, the essential oil had an EC
  <sub class="sub">50 </sub>values of 133.97 µg/mL and 143.59 µg/mL against variations promastigotes of 
  <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L. braziliensis</italic>, respectively. As for trypanocidal activity, the oil showed EC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 140.31 µg/mL against epimastigote form of 
  <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>. Moreover, it showed moderate cytotoxicity in fibroblasts with LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 204.71 µg/mL. The observed effect may be related to the presence of terpenes contained in the essential oil, since it has its antiparasitic activity proven in the literature.
