<p class="p">Cultures of promastigotes forms of 
 <italic class="italic">L. braziliensis </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> L. infantum</italic> were grown to a concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL and then transferred to the test. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO to the concentrations to be tested, and transferred to the microplates. Each assay was triplicate performed. The activity of the compounds was assessed after 72 h by direct counting of the cells after serial dilutions and compared to an untreated control.
