Drought and heat have been the most important stresses studied until now on the expression of the chemical compounds in fruit trees, including almond. The climatic conditions of the year, mainly temperature, affect the concentration of the different tocopherol homologues in several nut crops [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], indicating that these components depend on the temperature and the occurrence of drought during fruit or nut growth.
