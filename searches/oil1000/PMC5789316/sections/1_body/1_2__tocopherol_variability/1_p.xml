<p class="p">Almost all studies carried out on vitamin content in almond are limited to those having an antioxidant effect, mainly tocopherols. The main tocopherol homologues detected in almond in decreasing importance are α-, γ-, δ-, and β-tocopherol. The main biochemical function of tocopherols is considered to be the protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids against peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. They also have protective roles in human health since recent data indicate that they have hypo-cholesterolemic, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties [

Tocopherol concentrations have been determined in many vegetable oils, having been correlated with their antioxidant activity, since this activity may depend on the ratio of % total tocopherols/% polyunsaturated fatty acids [
