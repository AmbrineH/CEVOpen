<p class="p">On the other hand, the MIC of solidago EO ranged between 1000 and 1600 µg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> during an incubation period starting from 4 days until 7 days. These results also showed that solidago EO can remain efficient in contact with serious post-harvest phytopathogens even at a low concentration (1 µg/µL) and can achieve promising antifungal activity during at a maximum period of 7 days at room temperature.
