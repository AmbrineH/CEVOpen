<p class="p">The EO isolated from the dry mass of 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> generally yielded in the range of 0.21–0.34% [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], while in comparison with the EO yield from different plant parts, a higher amount was found in inflorescence (0.35–1.47%) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] than in other aerial parts (0.11–0.16%) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Composition of EO depends on ecological and climatic conditions, the ontogenesis phase, as well as from the processing within the harvest and method of isolation, and generally the yield of EO increase with plant maturation [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Similarly with our identification, the germacrene D was also considered as a dominant compound within the range 19.8–39.2% [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. On the other hand, β-cubebene (26.9%) was identified as the main compound of 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> by Kasali et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In all cases, the main compound was followed by α-pinene (2.9–28.1%), limonene (5–11.5%), β-pinene (2.1–9.3%), and bornyl acetate (3.2–9.2%).
