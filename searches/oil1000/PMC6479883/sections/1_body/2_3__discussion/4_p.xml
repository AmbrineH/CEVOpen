<p class="p">In particular, the obtained results of antifungal activity and CMP assays are in agreement with Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] who studied the effect of solidago EO on the hyphal morphology and cell ultrastructure of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> by using the method described by Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The hyphae of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> became more shrunken and thinner after treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> EO and its cell wall structure was damaged, hence the exosmosis increased as it was scanned by electron and transmission electron microscope [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This mechanism is highly related to our hypothesis of the biological mode of action of 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> EO, which is due to cell wall damage of the fungus and increasing the CMP, ending with complete fungal death.
