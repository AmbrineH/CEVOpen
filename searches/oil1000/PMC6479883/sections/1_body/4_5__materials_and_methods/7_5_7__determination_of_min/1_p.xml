<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been carried out against the most inhibited pathogenic fungi using 
 <italic class="italic">96-well</italic> microplates (Nunc MaxiSorp®, Vedbaek, Denmark) by a micro-dilution method, as reported by Elshafie et al. [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. A 4 mL liquid suspension from fresh fungal cultures (96 h) was prepared at 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> spore/mL. The tested EO was dissolved in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 µL/mL according to the obtained results from the initial antifungal screening assay. Two hundred µL/well from each prepared concentration of EO and 100 µL/well of the prepared fungal suspension were added in the microplate and then incubated at 24 ± 2 °C. The absorbance was measured at λ = 450 nm using an Elisa microplate reader instrument (DAS s.r.l., Rome, Italy) after 48, 120, and 168 h. The whole experiment was repeated in triplicate.
