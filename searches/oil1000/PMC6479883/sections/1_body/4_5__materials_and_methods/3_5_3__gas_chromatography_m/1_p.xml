<p class="p">The GC-MS analyses were carried out on a Varian 450-GC connected with a Varian 220-MS. Separation was achieved using a Bruker capillary column: Br 5ms (30 m× 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). Injector type 1177 was heated to a temperature of 220 °C. Injection mode was splitless (1 μL of a 1:1000 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane solution). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant column flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Column temperature was programmed—initial temperature was 50 °C for 10 min, then increased to 100 °C at 3 °C/min, was maintained as isothermal for 5 min, and then increased to 150 °C at 10 °C/min. The total time for analysis was 87.67 min. Analyses were also run with the same operating conditions by using an apolar DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thicknesses). In both cases, helium was used as the carrier gas (1.2 mL/min). The mass spectrometer trap was heated to 200 °C, manifold 50 °C, and transfer line 270 °C. Mass spectra were scanned every 1 s in the range 40–650 m/z.
