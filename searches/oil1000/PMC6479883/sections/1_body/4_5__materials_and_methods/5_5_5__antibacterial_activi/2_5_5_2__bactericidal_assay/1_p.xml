<p class="p">The antibacterial test of the studied EO was carried out using disc diffusion method of Bhunia et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] with some modifications, as reported by Elshafie et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], using king B (KB) and nutrient agar (NA) media [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. A bacterial suspension of each tested bacteria was prepared in sterile distilled water adjusted at 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> colony forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL) (OD ≈ 0.2 nm). Then, an aliquot of soft agar (0.7%) and bacterial suspension (9:1; 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) was prepared and 4 mL was added over each plate (90 mm, diameter), containing 10 mL of a nutrient medium. Blank Discs (6 mm)-OXOID were placed after that over KB-plate surfaces and about 15 µL of the tested EO (20%) diluted in distilled water and 0.2% Tween-20 was carefully applied over blank discs. The antibacterial activity was estimated by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone (mm) formed around each treated point compared to tetracycline (1600 µg/mL), according to the international limit of microbicide standards.
