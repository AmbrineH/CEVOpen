<p class="p">The possible fungicidal activity of the studied solidago EO was evaluated following the method of Soylu et al. [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] at two different concentrations (1000 and 500 µg/mL), diluted in 0.2% Tween-20 and then incorporated into potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 45 °C. Fungal disk (0.5 cm) from 96 h fresh culture was inoculated in the center of each Petri dish. All plates were incubated at 22 °C for 96 h in darkness conditions and the diameter of the fungal mycelium was measured in mm. The PDA plates without any treatment were inoculated with fungal disks as control. The fungitoxicity was expressed as percentage of growth inhibition (PGI) and calculated according to the formula of Zygadlo et al. [
