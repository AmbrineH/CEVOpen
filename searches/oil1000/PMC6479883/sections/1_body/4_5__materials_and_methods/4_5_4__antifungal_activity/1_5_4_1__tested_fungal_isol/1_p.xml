 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> (G.Winter) Honey (P1605 from plum), 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> Pers. (S1132 from strawberry), 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> van Tieghem (G1008 from grape), and 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> Link (A333 from apple), previously identified based on their microscopic morphological features and molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons obtained were directly sequenced and compared with those available in GenBank nucleotide archive using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software (BLAST-USA) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. They were stored at 4 °C as pure cultures in the mycotheca of the School of Agricultural, Forestry, Food, and Environmental Sciences of Basilicata University, Potenza, Italy. The fungal species were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 24 ± 2 °C.
