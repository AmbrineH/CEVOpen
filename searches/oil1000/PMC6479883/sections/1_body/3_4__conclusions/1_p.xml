<p class="p">Under the strict EU legislation, there is an annual increase of the prohibited substances used in crop protection in agriculture. At the same time, there is a big challenge to develop new products that are both organic and safe for the health of living organisms. The current research evaluated possible antimicrobial activity of EO hydrodistilled from the invasive plant species 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> and investigate its mechanism of action. One of the ways how to deal with the invasive species is to investigate their possible agricultural or ecological application instead of weeding them out. Based on the results, significant microbicidal effect against some phytopathogens (bacteria and fungi) was observed. Natural-based products are usually simple to prepare, are not financially demanding, and because of their natural origin they are environmentally acceptable which could be related to the investigated EO from
