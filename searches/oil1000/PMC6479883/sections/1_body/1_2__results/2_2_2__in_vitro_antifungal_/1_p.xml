 <italic class="italic">Solidago canadensis</italic> EO showed promising significant antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> in a dose dependent manner for both tested concentrations (1000 and 500 µg/mL). In particular, the tested concentration 1000 µg/mL was significantly higher than Azoxystrobin against 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic>. On the other hand, both tested concentrations were slightly lower than Azoxystrobin against 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>, whereas, a moderate activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> only at 1000 µg/mL and was significantly lower than Azoxystrobin. No activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> for both tested concentrations was noted (
