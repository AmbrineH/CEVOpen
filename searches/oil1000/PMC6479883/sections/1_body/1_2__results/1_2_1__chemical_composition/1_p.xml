<p class="p">The average yield of 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> EO of three replicated samples was 0.27 ± 0.05% on dry mass. Thirty-two identified components in 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> EO presented 97.7% of the total compounds in EO. The dominant compound was identified as germacrene D (34.9%), followed by limonene (12.5%), α-pinene (11.6%), β-elemen (7.1%), and bornyl acetate (6.3%). The amounts of the other nine components were in the range of 1–3.9%. The order of compounds from the lowest to the highest quantity is camphene &lt; α-caryophyllene &lt; sesquisabinene A &lt; γ-cadinene &lt; epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene &lt; β-cadinene &lt; β-caryophyllene &lt; β-pinene &lt; β-sabinene (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01206-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The remaining 18 identified components were in amounts of less than 1%. Mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated in 
 <italic class="italic">S. canadensis</italic> EO. The percentage of hydrocarbon monoterpenes was 32.9% and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes was 55.5%. The third group presented oxygenated monoterpenes in an amount of 9.1%.
