 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01206-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>-II), results showed that the EC values of the broth culture (control) were stable until 90 min of incubation and then slightly decreased and ranged between 27.3 and 25.3 S cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. On the other hand, the increase of EO concentration led to increasing the CMP of the tested fungi in a direct proportional relation, except for 1000 µg/mL, where there was a dramatic increase of the EC after 90 min of incubation. In general, the highest significant EC value was observed in case of the concentration 2000 µg/mL during all incubation period. The IP of EC value ranged between 147% and 304% after 30 min of incubation and between 299% and 478% after 150 min of incubation for the four tested concentrations that ranged between 250 and 2000 µg/mL, respectively.
