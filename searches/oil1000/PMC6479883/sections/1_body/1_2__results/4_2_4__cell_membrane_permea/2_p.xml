<p class="p">Results showed that EC values for 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> were raised over time with increased EO concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01206-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>-I), whereas the EC values of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> broth culture (control) were almost stable and ranged between 21.3 and 23.6 S cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The EC values of treated cultures with 500 and 1000 µg/mL were much closer to each other and both were slightly higher than the treated culture with 250 µg/mL, whereas the treated culture with 2000 µg/mL showed the highest significant EC value, especially after 90 min of incubation, and this result explained why the initial screening assay with 500 and 1000 µg/mL did not give positive results in plates. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> has a sort of resistance, especially in Agar-nutrient media, in contrast with the initial phase of hyphal formation in broth culture (PDB), where it was delicate and easily damaged. In general, the increasing percentage (IP) of EC value ranged between 204% and 346% after 30 min of incubation and between 334% and 572% after 150 min of incubation for all tested concentrations.
