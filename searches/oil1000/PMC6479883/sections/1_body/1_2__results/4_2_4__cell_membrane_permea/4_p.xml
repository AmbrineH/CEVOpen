<p class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>, the studied EO led to increasing the CMP of the tested fungi for all tested concentrations in a direct proportional relation for all four tested concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01206-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>-III). The results illustrated that the CMP of 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> also suddenly increased after 60 min for all tested concentrations and then the values tended to be stable until 150 min of incubation. On the other hand, EC values of the broth culture (control) were almost stable along the incubation period, slightly increasing after 60 min of incubation and ranging between 11.5 and 20 S cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Low significant differences were observed between the two EO concentrations of 250 and 500 µg/mL after 90 min of incubation. The IP of EC value ranged between 133% and 483% after 30 min of incubation and between 568% and 711% after 150 min of incubation for all tested concentrations that ranged between 250 and 2000 µg/mL, respectively.
