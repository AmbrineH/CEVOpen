<p class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>, the EO concentration of 2000 µg/mL demonstrated the highest significant EC value compared to all other treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01206-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>-IV). The results also explained that there was a sharp increase of the CMP of 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> after 90 min. On the other hand, EC values of the broth culture (control) were stable along the incubation period and ranged between 15.3 and 20 S cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Low significant differences were observed between the two EO concentrations of 500 and 1000 µg/mL. The IP of EC value ranged between 126% and 392% after 30 min of incubation and between 300% and 660% after 150 min of incubation for all tested concentrations that ranged between 250 and 2000 µg/mL, respectively.
