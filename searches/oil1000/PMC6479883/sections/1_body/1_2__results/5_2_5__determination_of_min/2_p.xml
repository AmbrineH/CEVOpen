<p class="p">In this regard, results demonstrated that all tested concentrations except 800 µg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> after 7 days of incubation at 24 ± 2 °C. In particular, the tested concentration at 1600 µg/mL showed the highest significant inhibition after 4 days with absorbance of 0.21 ± 0.01 (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01206-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In the case of 1400 µg/mL, the highest significant inhibition was observed after 6 days of incubation with absorbance of 0.25 ± 0.05 (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01206-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The two tested concentrations (1000 and 1200 µg/mL) achieved complete fungal growth inhibition after 7 days of incubation and their absorbances were measured as 0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.03, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01206-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, the lowest tested concentration (800 µg/mL) did not show any growth inhibition, even after 7 days of incubation (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01206-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The MIC of the tested concentration (800 µg/mL) may reach the complete inhibition of the fungal growth after more than 6 days of incubation, because after that period the fungus still grew normally.
