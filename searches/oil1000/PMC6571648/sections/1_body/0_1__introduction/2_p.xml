In particular, natural polysaccharides have become a promising and valuable source of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer recently. More and more reports have pointed out that natural polysaccharides had significant anti-proliferation activities against various tumor cell lines of human origin such as HepG2, SiHa, MDA-MB-231, A549, KB, BXCP-3, SGC-7901, Hela, MCF-7 cells [
