<p class="p">Small molecules, such as derivatives of podophyllotoxin and essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus</italic> species had been reported to show significant cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The polysaccharide JC-PS1 firstly reported in this study revealed the antitumor potential of the polysaccharides from the plants of this genus. JC-PS1 was characterized by the backbone of →5)-α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→ and →3,5)-α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→ and three branches linked to the O-3 position of →3,5)-α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→ in the molar ratio of 2:1:1, including β-Gal
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>A-(1→3)-β-Gal
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-(1→, α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→3)-α-Rha
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-(1→ and α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→3)-β-Gal
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-(1→. In the antitumor activity test, JC-PS1 exhibited the broad spectrum of significant antitumor cell proliferation activities against human carcinoma cells and no toxicity on normal cells, indicating that JC-PS1 is potentially a safe and effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer. In addition, the underlying mechanisms and structure-activity relationship remain to be further studied and discussed.
