 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) at 100 °C three times (2 h for each time). Then the supernatant was combined and concentrated into one-fifth of the original volume, followed by precipitation by adding four-fold volume of ethanol and standing at 4 °C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (3500 rpm, 20 min), dissolved in distilled water and deprotionized with the trichloroacetic acid method. Briefly, one portion of the dissolved extract and one portion of 20% trichloroacetic acid (
