<p class="p">JCP (80 g) were dissolved in distilled water and then applied to a DEAE-52 Cellulose column (12 cm × 100 cm) which was equilibrated with ultrapure water and eluted by water and 0.1 M NaCl solution sequentially at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. The fraction which was eluted by 0.1 M NaCl solution was collected, dialyzed, and freeze-dried to obtain the JC-0.1 M (16.06 g). In addition, the JC-0.1 M (2 g) was then further purified by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (2.5 cm × 80 cm), eluted with ultrapure water at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min to obtain a polysaccharide named JC-PS1 (500 mg).</p>
