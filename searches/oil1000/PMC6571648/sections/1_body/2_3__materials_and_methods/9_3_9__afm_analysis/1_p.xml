<p class="p">An AFM (Multimode NanoscopeIIIa, Bruker Corporation, Germany) was used to identify the surface topography of JC-PS1. In brief, JC-PS1 was diluted in distilled water to the final concentration of 10 μg/mL. 200 μL of the sample was dropped onto the freshly cleaved mica and dried under the infrared lamp before imaging. In addition, the AFM image was conducted by the Nanoscope software.</p>
