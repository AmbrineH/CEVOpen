<p class="p">Monosaccharide composition of JC-PS1 was analyzed on LC-MS by the method of 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) pre-column derivatization [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Briefly, JC-PS1 (2 mg) was completely hydrolyzed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). In addition, the hydrolysate was further dissolved in ammonium hydroxide and reacted with 0.5 M PMP-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH solution (0.5 mL) at 70 °C for 100 min to be labeled with PMP. In addition, then the reaction products were extracted with chloroform (

Finally, the sample (10 μL) was applied to LC-MS (Dionex Ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co Ltd., USA) equipped with YMC-Triart C18 (150 mm × 21 mm) column, and eluted with the mixture of 0.02 M ammonium carbonate solution and acetonitrile (17:83, pH = 6.8) at 30 °C with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The same procedure was applied to the monosaccharide standards.
