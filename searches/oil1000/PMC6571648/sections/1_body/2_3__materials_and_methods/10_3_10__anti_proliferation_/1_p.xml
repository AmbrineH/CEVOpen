<p class="p">The anti-proliferation assay of JC-PS1 was conducted by the MTT method [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Five tumor cell lines, including PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells, U118MG glioma carcinoma cells and H1975 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well on the microplate with 96 wells. The 96-well microplate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to obtain cell attachment. In addition, then 100 μL of pure fresh medium was added and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h as the blank control group with fresh medium containing JC-PS1 (0.16–2.5 mg/mL) and doxorubicin (DOX, 0.1 mg/mL) as experiment group and positive control group, respectively. The medium was removed and 50 μL of methylene blue was added to each well. In addition, finally absorbance at 570 nm was measured by a microplate. Each sample was measured in triplicate. The cell viability was calculated by OD 570 nm
