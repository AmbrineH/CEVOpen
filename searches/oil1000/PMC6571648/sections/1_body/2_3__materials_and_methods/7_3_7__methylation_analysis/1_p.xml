<p class="p">JC-PS1 was dissolved with distilled water and treated with CMC for 3 h. In addition, then the uronic acid in JC-PS1 was reduced by NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. The reduced JC-PS1 was methylated based on the reported method [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] with some modification. First of all, the sodium metacylsulfonyl methyl (SMSM) was prepared by continuously adding NaH (5 g), which had been washed previously with petroleum ether, in DMSO (50 mL) at 50–60 °C with magnetic stirring for 4 h. Then JC-PS1 (15 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (15 mL) and the SMSM (5 mL) was dripped slowly under ultrasonic treatment. The reaction products were treated with ultrasonic for another 15 min, followed by slowly adding methyl iodide in ice bath. The methylated polysaccharide was extracted from chloroform after dialysis for 24 h, and was then treated with the same procedure another two times until the 3200–3700 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> O-H band in IR spectrum disappeared. Finally, the methylated polysaccharide was hydrolyzed completely by being reacted with 2 M TFA at 100 °C for 6 h. and the hydrolysates were reduced with NaBD
