<p class="p">JC-PS1 was obtained from the crude polysaccharides extracted from the twigs and leaves of J. convallium by using anion-exchange chromatography DEAE-52 and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column. The homogeneity of JC-PS1 was identified by HPGPC equipped with evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). The HPGPC-ELSD chromatogram exhibited a single and symmetrical peak at 6.953 min in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01850-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, suggesting that JC-PS1 was a homogenous polysaccharide. The relative molecular weight of JC-PS1 was also determined by HPGPC-ELSD with the standard curve method with a series of dextran with different molecular weights as standards. According to the retention time of JC-PS1and the standard curve, the relative molecular weight of JC-PS1 was calculated as 280 kDa.
