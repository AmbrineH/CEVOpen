<p class="p">After the assignment of the NMR signals and the identification of anomeric carbon configuration, the linkage sequences of glycoside residues were further elucidated by HMBC. The HMBC spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01850-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>) showed the cross peaks between A H1 and A C5, A H1 and C C5,C H1 and C C5 and C H1 and A C5, indicating that self-connection and interconnection were present between residue A and C through 1→5 glycosidic bonds. Considering the molar ratio of the residues in methylation analysis, the backbone of JC-PS1 was indicated to be →5)-α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→ (A) and →3,5)-α-Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-(1→ (C), and the branches were attached to the O-3 position of residue C. Then, the cross peaks between F H1 and D C3, D H1 and C C3 indicated that the terminal residue F was linked to residue D (F→D, R1), and were then attached together to the O-3 position of residue C as a branch. Similarly, the cross peaks between B H1 and E C3, E H1 and C C3 indicated that B→E (R2) was linked to O-3 position of residue C as a branch. In addition, the cross peaks between B H1 and D C3, D H1 and C C3 indicated that B→D (R3) was also a branch.
