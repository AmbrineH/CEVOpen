<p class="p">The signal at 102 ppm was assigned to the C1 of 1-β-Gal
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>A (residue F) and the signal at 4.42 ppm was attributed to H1 of residue F. The characteristic carbon signal at 175.04 ppm was due to –COOH (C6) of residue F. The signals at δ 68.55, 70.73, 71.46 and 74.43 ppm were assigned to C2-C5 of residue F, and the signals at δ 3.29, 3.49, 3.63 and 3.48 ppm were assigned to H2-H5 of residue F.
