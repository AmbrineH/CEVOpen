<p class="p">The signal at 98.00 ppm was assigned to the C1 of 1,3-α-Rha (residue E) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In addition, the signal at 5.02 ppm was attributed to the corresponding H1 of residue E according to HSQC. The characteristic carbon signal at 15.96 ppm belonged to -CH3 (C6) of residue E and the chemical shift of the corresponding H6 was assigned at 1.18 ppm. The signals at δ 80.37, 81.21, 66.10 and 66.05 ppm were assigned to C2-C5 of residue E, and the signals at δ 4.21, 3.82, 3.73 and 3.70 ppm were assigned to H2-H5 of residue E.
