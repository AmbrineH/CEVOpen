<p class="p">To further elucidate the structure of the JC-PS1, NMR spectroscopy, an efficient and convenient technique, was used to provide more straightforward and detailed information on the structure of JC-PS1, including anomeric configurations, linkage patterns and linkage sequences of the repeating units. Based on methylation analysis, monosaccharide composition analysis and NMR analysis, their chemical shifts were assigned as listed in
