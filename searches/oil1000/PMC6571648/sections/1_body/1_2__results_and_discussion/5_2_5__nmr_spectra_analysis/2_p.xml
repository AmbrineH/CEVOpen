<p class="p">In the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01850-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A), anomeric carbon signals were presented at around δ 98–107 ppm. In addition, the downfield chemical shifts at δ 106.93, 106.51, 106.05 ppm were the characteristic signals of arabinosyl present in furanose form [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], which were designated to be the C-1 of residue A-C. Comparing the integrated peak areas of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C spectrum and the molar ratio of the Ara residues in the methylation analysis, the residues A-C were identified as 1,5-linked Ara

 <italic class="italic">f</italic> and 1,3,5-linked Ara
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>. In addition, the corresponding anomeric proton signals were presented at δ 5.02 ppm (A H1), 5.10 ppm (B H1), 5.17 ppm (C H1) according to HSQC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01850-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), which suggested that they belonged to α-anomeric configuration with low-field signals (&gt;5.0 ppm) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For residue A, according to 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H COSY spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01850" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>), we correlated A H1 (5.02 ppm) and A H2 (4.06 ppm), A H2 (4.06 ppm) and A H3 (3.93 ppm), A H3 (3.93 ppm) and A H4 (4.14 ppm), A H4 (4.14 ppm) and A H5 (3.73 ppm). In addition, the corresponding carbon signals were assigned as A C1-C5 (δ 106.93, 80.47, 76.21, 3.93, 4.14, 3.73 ppm) by HSQC spectrum. Similarly, the proton and carbon signals of residue B and C were assigned.
