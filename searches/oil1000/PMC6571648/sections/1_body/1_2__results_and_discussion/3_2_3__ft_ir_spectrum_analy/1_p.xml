<p class="p">FT-IR spectrum of carbohydrates could provide information on the structural features. The FT-IR spectrum of JC-PS1 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01850" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>. The absorption bands at 3400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 2930 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1641 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1040 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were characteristic absorption peaks of carbohydrates. The broad absorption peaks at 3400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 2930 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to the O-H stretching vibrations and C-H stretching vibrations, respectively [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The bands at 1641 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1425 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were due to the asymmetric and symmetric COO- stretching vibrations and assigned to the existence of uronic acid in JC-PS1 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], which was in accordance with the results of the monosaccharide composition analysis. The absorption bands at 1140 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1072 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicated the existence of a pyranose configuration in JC-PS1 [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01850" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The absorption at 890 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicated a β-configuration in JC-PS1 [
