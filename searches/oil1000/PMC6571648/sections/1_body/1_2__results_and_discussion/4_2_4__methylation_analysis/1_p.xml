<p class="p">Methylation analysis is an indispensable method in the structure characterization of carbohydrates, from which the linkage types in carbohydrates can be further identified. After the reduction of the galacturonic acid in JC-PS1, the reduced JC-PS1 was then methylated three times and the fully methylated JC-PS1 was hydrolyzed and derived into the corresponding alditol acetate derivatives, which were further analyzed by GC-MS. Compared to the MS data in the CCRC database (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01850-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The Ara residues existed in the form of furanose, including 1-linked, 1,5-linked and 1,3,5-linked Araf residues. The Rha residues existed in the form of pyranose, 1,3-linked Rhap residues. Because the corresponding alditol acetate derivative of the reduced GalA was the same with that of Gal, the linkage types of the GalA and Gal residues couldnâ€™t be concluded directly. However, we found that the molar ratios of 1-linked Galp residues (10%) and 1,3-linked Galp (15%) were roughly equal to that of the GalA (11.2%) and Gal (17.8%) in the analysis of monosaccharide composition, respectively, so we speculated that the GalA residues might existed in 1-linked GalpA, and the Gal residues in 1,3-linked Galp.
