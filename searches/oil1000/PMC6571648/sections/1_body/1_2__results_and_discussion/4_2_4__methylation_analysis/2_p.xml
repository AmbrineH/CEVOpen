<p class="p">To sum up, there were six linkage types in JC-PS1, 1,5-linked Araf, 1-linked Araf, 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Glap, 1,3-linked Rhap and 1-linked GalpA. In addition, the molar ratio was 3.9:1.0:2.1:1.5:0.5:1.0, which approximately agreed with the results of monosaccharide composition and indicated that 1,5-linked Araf might be the backbone of JC-PS1. However, it is necessary to confirm the detailed information by the NMR spectra analysis.</p>
