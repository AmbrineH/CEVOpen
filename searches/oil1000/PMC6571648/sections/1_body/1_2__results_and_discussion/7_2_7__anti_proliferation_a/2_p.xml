<p class="p">In addition, we also isolated and purified a polysaccharide (JC-PS2) from the water fraction of DEAE 52 Cellulose column. However, JC-PS2 showed no anti-proliferation activities. Comparing the difference between JC-PS1 and JC-PS2 in structure, we found that JC-PS1 was characterized by a backbone of →5)-α-Ara
