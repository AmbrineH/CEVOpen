<p class="p">Five carcinoma cell lines were chosen to test the anti-proliferation activities of JC-PS1, including PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells, U118MG glioma carcinoma cells and H1975 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01850-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, JC-PS1 exhibited significant anti-proliferation activities, and a dose-dependent behavior was observed for proliferation inhibition for A431, MDA-MB-231, U118MG and H1975 cells while it was not observed for PANC-1 cells. When the concentration of JC-PS1 was as low as 0.16 mg/mL, the cell viability decreased significantly (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for H 1975 cells, indicating that JC-PS1 was more sensitive to PANC-1, A431, U118MG and MDA-MB-231 cells than to H 1975 cells. When JC-PS1 was at the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (8.928 nM), the inhibitory effects reached to maximum and the cell viability of PANC-1, A431, MDA-MB-231, U118MG and H1975 cells was 35.95%, 6.75%, 27.31%, 18.65% and 10.96% while the cell viability was 26.54%, 8.71%, 10.67%, 75.16% and 7.91% for the positive control (DOX) at 0.1 mg/mL (172.41 nM). This suggested that, compared with DOX, JC-PS1 was a potential antitumor agent and had better inhibitory effects on U118 MG cells. In addition, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of JC-PS1 for PANC-1, A431, MDA-MB-231, U118MG and H1975 cells were 296.8, 477.9, 657.4, 686.7, 862.1 Î¼g/mL, respectively. Additionally, JC-PS1 showed no toxicity on normal cells (RAW264.7 cells) in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01850" class="xref">Figure S3</xref>, indicating that JC-PS1 was potentially a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tumors.
