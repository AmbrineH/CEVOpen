<p class="p">The chemical composition of JC-PS1 was firstly analyzed in order to clearly illuminate the structure. The total carbohydrate content of JC-PS1 was 98.5%. The content of uronic acid and proteins of JC-PS1 was 12.1% and 1.2%, respectively. In addition, then the 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) pre-column derivatization was conducted to analyze the composition and content of monosaccharide in JC-PS1. The results (
