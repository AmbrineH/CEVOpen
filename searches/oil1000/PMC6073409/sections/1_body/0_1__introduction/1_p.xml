 <xref rid="B1-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The origin of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is still controversial; however, it is believed to have originated from Southeast Asia [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is grown widely all over the world for its numerous health benefits. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits are consumed as a fresh fruit desert or used for making juice and jam. They are an excellent source of vitamins, especially vitamin C. Processing 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits results in a significant amount of waste (peels, seeds, and pulps), which accounts for 50% of the fruit [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> waste is a valuable source of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>-limonene, flavonoids, carotenoids, dietary fibers, soluble sugars, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, polyphenols, ascorbic acid, methane, and essential oils [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Interestingly, the essential oil (EO) is the most vital by-product of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> processing. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs are broadly used as natural food additives in several food and beverage products [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] because they have been classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs are used as natural preservatives due to their broad spectrum of biological activities including antimicrobial and antioxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The presence of terpenes, flavonoids, carotenes, and coumarins is thought to be responsible for the strong anti-oxidative and antimicrobial activities [
