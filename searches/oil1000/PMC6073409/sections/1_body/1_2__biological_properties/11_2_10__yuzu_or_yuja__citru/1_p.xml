<p class="p">Yuzu EO inhibited the formation of the carcinogen 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in vegetables (by 22–59%) and saliva (by 24–62%) [
 <xref rid="B149-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. Yuzu EO is useful in treating bronchial asthma due to its anti-inflammatory activities. It inhibits the production of cytokines and ROS, and reduces eosinophil migration [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. Yuzu odor was reported to decrease maternal anxiety for a sick child receiving an infusion at a pediatric clinic [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. A 10 min inhalation of the yuzu odor significantly decreased the heart rate and increased the high frequency power of heart rate variability reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity, regardless of menstrual phase. Inhalation of the yuzu oil decreased total mood disturbance, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, and fatigue, which are common premenstrual symptoms [

 <xref rid="B152-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. It is also used to suppress the odor of Niboshi soup stock [
 <xref rid="B154-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Yuzu peel ethanol extract is useful in preventing colitis and colorectal cancer through reducing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression [
 <xref rid="B155-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. This extract also showed hypocholesterolemic effect both in vitro and in vivo by reducing the weight gain, lipid accumulation, liver fat content, liver weight, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B156-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. Yuzu extract was reported to exert anti-diabetic activity through increasing glucose uptake in C
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>C1
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> myotubes by modulating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling pathways. It improved insulin resistance (IR) in mice that were fed a high-fat diet [
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Moreover, yuzu peel extract showed anti-obesity effects in a zebrafish model via activating hepatic PPAR-α and adipocyte PPAR-γ pathways [
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. The methanol extract of yuzu could be beneficial for individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease because it inhibits platelet aggregation [
 <xref rid="B159-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>]. Yuzu extract could be useful in treating heart failure as it prevents myocardial infarction (MI)-induced ventricular dysfunction and structural remodeling of myocardium [
