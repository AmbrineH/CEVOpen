<p class="p">Linalyl acetate has narcotic effects [
 <xref rid="B177-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. It is non-toxic, and is very minimally skin reactive [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. When tested at 5–20%, no skin reaction was observed [
 <xref rid="B186-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Similar to linalool, linalyl acetate does not cause photo-irritation or photo-allergy because it does not absorb UV light in the range of 290–400 nm [
 <xref rid="B182-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>]. It has no carcinogenic activity [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01966" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The acute dermal LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was higher than 5 g/kg in rabbits, while the acute oral LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 14.5 g/kg in rats and 13.5 g/kg in mice [
