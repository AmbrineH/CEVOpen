 <p> Binding free energy decomposition for each residue that interact with (A) thymol and (B) thymol acetate. The bars represent the energy contribution values: van der Waals contributions (blank bars), electrostatic contributions (striped bars) and total energy contribution for each residue (black bars). Residues highlighted in red are from catalytic site, blue are from anionic subsite and green are from oxyanion hole. </p>
