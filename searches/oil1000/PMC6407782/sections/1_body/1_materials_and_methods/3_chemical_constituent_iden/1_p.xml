<p class="p">The chemical composition was determined according to the approach described by Da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], where the qualitative analyses of essential oils was carried using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Thermo Focus DSQ-II system under the following the operating conditions: DB-5MS silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness), temperature program: 60–250°C with a gradient of 3°C/min); injector temperature: 240°C, helium carrier gas (linear velocity of 32 cm/s, measured at 100°C), injection type: split less (0.1 μL of a 2:1000 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane solution),and ion-source temperature and other parts: 200°C. The ionization was achieved by electron impact at 70 eV. Quantitative sample data were obtained using a GC with a flame ionization detector in a Focus GC-FID, which was operated under the same conditions as the GC-MS, except for the carrier gas, which was nitrogen. The identification of volatile components was based on the linear retention index (IR), which was calculated in relation to the retention times of a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes and the fragmentation pattern observed in the mass spectra by comparison with authentic samples from the libraries of the data system and the literature [
