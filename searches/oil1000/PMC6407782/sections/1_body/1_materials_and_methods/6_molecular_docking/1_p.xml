<p class="p">To analyze the interactions between the ligands (thymol and thymol acetate) and AChE, molecular docking simulations were carried out using the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 5.5 program [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The crystallographic structure of AChE was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (

 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Both the structures of the enzyme and the ligands were prepared using the MVD module. Before the docking simulation, for each complex, hydrogen atoms and partial atomic charges were added. The active site of AChE was positioned in a spherical grid of 10-Å diameter, and all residues of AChE binding site were included using the following spatial coordinates of the central cavity: 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 26.40, 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> = 79.03, and 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> = 20.20. A grid resolution equal to 0.3 Å was used. Molecular docking was performed using the standard MolDock algorithm in MVD.
