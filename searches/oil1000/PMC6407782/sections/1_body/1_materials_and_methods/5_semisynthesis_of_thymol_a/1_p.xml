<p class="p">To obtain thymol acetate, thymol (Sigma–Aldrich), acetic anhydride, and pyridine, which acts as a catalyst, were used. Thymol (4g) was acetylated with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine for 24 h at 25°C. The excess acetic anhydride was removed by storage of the sample in a desiccator for 12 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned with dichloromethane and water for the removal of acetic acid. The semi synthesis and identification of the pure compound was monitored by GC and GC-MS analysis.</p>
