 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic> fresh leaves were applied to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates to obtain spots with concentrations from 0.01 to 1000 ng/spot. Physostigmine was used as a positive control. The plates were sprayed with the AChE solution (3.33 U/mL), dried, and incubated at 37Â°C for 20 min. The enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution of 0.25% of 1-naphtyl acetate in ethanol and a 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt (20 mL). Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple background.
