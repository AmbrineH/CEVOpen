<p class="p">Thymol acetate (Δ
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>
 <sub class="sub">bind</sub> = -26.88 kcal/mol) has a better binding energy than that ofthymol (Δ
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>
 <sub class="sub">bind</sub> = -18.49 kcal/mol); that is, the binding energy of thymol acetate is greater than that of thymol, and both the van der Waals and electrostatic energies are important for ligand binding in AChE cavity.
