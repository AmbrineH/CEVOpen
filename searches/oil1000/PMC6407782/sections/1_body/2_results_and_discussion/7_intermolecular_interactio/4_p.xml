<p class="p">Thymol formed intermolecular interactions with different residues of the AChE binding pocket, in particular, with residue His447, which belongs to the catalytic triad (His 447, Tyr337, and Trp86) located on the anionic subsite. Residues His447 and Gly122 belong to the oxyanion hole. In contrast, thymol acetate formed different intermolecular interactions with AChE binding pocket and the electrostatic and van der Waals energy contributions were found to be significant in the interactions with residues Ser203 and His447 (catalytic triad), thus stabilizing ligand binding. Thymol acetate also formed important interactions with residues from two other sites, Trp86 and Tyr133 (anionic subsite) and Gly121 (oxyanion hole).</p>
