<p class="p">The essential oil of the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic> (thymol: 66.33%) showed a detection limit (DL) at a concentration of 0.1 ng/spot, about ten times less active than physostigmine (DL = 0.01 ng/spot). Because thymol and thymol acetate presented a DL values of 0.01 ng/spot, equivalent to that of physostigmine, the alkaloid was used as a positive control. The higher detection concentration of thymol and thymol acetate in the oil may be because these components have a lower total content in the sample mixture compared to the isolate. Thus, the anticholinesterase action of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic> may be tied to these two components. These results are in agreement with data from the literature, which indicates that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum ehrenbergii</italic> (thymol: 19.6%) shows strong inhibitory activity against AChE, having a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of 0.3 ± 0.02 μg/mL when physostigmine was used as positive control and exhibited an IC
