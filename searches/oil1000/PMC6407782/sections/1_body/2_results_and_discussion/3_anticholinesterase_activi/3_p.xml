 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic> described in this work can be a natural source with potential for the development of new phytotherapics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or even be included in the diet of people with Alzheimer's. It is important to emphasize that in our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] it was shown that this specimen presents thymol as the majority constituent of essential oil throughout its seasonal cycle, which reinforces its viability as a source of obtaining this component.
