<p class="p">Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]reported that the essential oil from the leaves of a specimen of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic>contains sesquiterpeneβ-caryophyllene (17.22–26.27%) as the main component, followed by borneol (4.45–7.36%), camphor (3.22–8.61%), camphene (2.64–5.66%), and germacrene-D (4.72–6.18%). This chemical profile is different from described in the present study. This is possible related to biotic and abiotic factors of the collection site of these two specimens; according to Ribeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], these factors qualitatively and quantitatively affect the yield and composition of secondary metabolites.
