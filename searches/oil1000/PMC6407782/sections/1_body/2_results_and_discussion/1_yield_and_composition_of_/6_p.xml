<p class="p">The essential oils from the roots were characterized, and hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid was found to be the main component (38.02% DR; 40.92% FR), followed by (9Z)-octadecenoic (oleic) acid (27.4% DR; 28.21% FR), thymol (19.34% FR; 22.18% DR), (9Z,12Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic (linoleic) acid (4.49% FR), and (11Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid (2.73% DR; 3.67% FR). It is important to note that hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid was also present in the oils obtained from the branches (2.77% DB; 6.11% FB) and flowers (0.06% DFL; 0.16% FFL), and(9Z)-octadecenoic (oleic) acid was also identified in the oils of the branches (1.58% DB; 6.26% FB).
