<p class="p">The structural dynamics of AChE complexed with the ligands thymol and thymol acetate during MD simulations were analyzed using the root mean square deviation (RMSD). The RMSD plots of the AChE structure were analyzed based on the CÎ± backbone, whereas the ligand structure was analyzed using the heavy atoms alone.</p>
