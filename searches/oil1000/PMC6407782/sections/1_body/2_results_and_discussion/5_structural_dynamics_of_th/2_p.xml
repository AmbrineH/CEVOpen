<p class="p">The RMSD plot of AChE complexed to thymol and thymol acetate reaches a plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213393.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), indicating that AChE structure is stable, showing few conformational changes over the 100-ns MD simulation. The ligands showed high stability at the AChE binding site. Over the 100-ns MD run, the ligands remained bound to AChE and did not undergo drastic conformational changes that altered their interactions with the catalytic residues.
