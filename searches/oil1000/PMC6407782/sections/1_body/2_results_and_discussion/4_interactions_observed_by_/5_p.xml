<p class="p">Considering the catalytic mechanism of AChE, residues Ser203 and His447 are directly involved in covalent bond formation and breakage. Residue Ser203 is a nucleophilic site, whereas the His447 imidazole group acts as a catalytic base, accepting a proton transferred from Ser203 [

 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Thus, because molecular docking calculations have shown that thymol and thymol acetate interact with the same catalytic site residues of the enzyme, these inhibitors may show similar anti-AChE activity.
