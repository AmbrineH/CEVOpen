<p class="p">Alzheimer's disease is considered one of the major public health problems worldwide and one of the main complications of this pathology is the activity deficit of cholinergic neurons. This fact can be reversed and/or attenuated by elevating the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the neuronal synaptic area. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors is an effective therapeutic approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The inhibitors increase the availability of neurotransmitters by inhibiting their main catalytic enzymes, acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase, thus diminishing the cholinergic deficit and relieving the symptoms of Alzheimer's patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0213393.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The oldest inhibitor of these enzymes is physostigmine, an alkaloid of the shrub

Synthetic and semisynthetic inhibitors, such as galantamine, donepezil, tacrine, and rivastigmine, can also be used, but these drugs have disadvantages such as short half-lives and adverse side effects including hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal irritation [
