<p class="p">The objective of this study was to obtain and analyze the chemical composition of the essential oils from different parts of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic> and to evaluate the anticholinesterase potential of the oil of the fresh leaves and its main constituents(thymol and thymol acetate), as well as to evaluate the interactions of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with thymol and thymol acetate by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations using the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method.
