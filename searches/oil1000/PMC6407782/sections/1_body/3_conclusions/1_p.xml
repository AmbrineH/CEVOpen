<p class="p">Thymol is the main constituent in the essential oil from the flowers (37.86% DFL; 48.04% FFL), leaves (58.9% DLE; 66.33% FLE), and branches (63.59% FB; 66.2% DB) of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">thymoides</italic>, and the essential oil of the fresh leaves had the highest content of this oxygenated monoterpene. In the roots, hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) was the main constituent (38.02% DR; 40.92% DF) of the oil. The essential oil of the fresh leaves (DL = 0.1 ng/spot) and two of its mains components, thymol (DL = 0.01 ng/spot) and thymol acetate (DL = 0.01 ng/spot), showed inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase on TLC layers.
