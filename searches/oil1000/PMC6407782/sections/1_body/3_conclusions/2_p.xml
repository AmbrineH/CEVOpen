<p class="p">The MolDock scores obtained for thymol and thymol acetate were favorable. The poses obtained from molecular docking simulations showed that the ligands forms H-bond interactions with the Ser203 residue, which belongs to the catalytic triad. The RMSD values obtained over 100 ns of MD simulation showed that the ligands are stable in the AChE binding pocket. The binding free energies for thymol (Δ

 <sub class="sub">bind</sub> -26.88 kcal/mol) indicate the ligands are stable and bind with affinity to AChE. The per-residue binding free energy decomposition revealed that the ligands form interactions with residues that are important for catalytic activity. Some residues belonging to the catalytic triad (Ser203 and His447), anionic subsite (Trp86, Tyr333, and Tyr337), and oxyanion hole (Gly121 and Gly122) form intermolecular interactions that stabilize ligand binding.
