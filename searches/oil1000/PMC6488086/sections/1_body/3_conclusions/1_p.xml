<p class="p">The presented microfluidic cultivation system for photoautotrophic cultivation of microalgae, with single-cell resolution under precisely controlled conditions regarding illumination, medium supply and temperature, was tested with the green algae 
 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> under different light conditions. We were able to show how the system allows to investigate the influence of light on growth, division behaviour and cell death. The system facilitates future studies imitating light dark cycles as they can be found in nature or more complex dynamic light conditions found in macroscopic photo bio reactors, helping to verify computational models [

 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. As the system is coupled to an inverted microscope, other studies could make use of fluorescent bio markers to investigate population heterogeneity. The excellent medium control could help screen for optimal nutrient conditions. It also showed promise for the analysis of mixed cultures, in this case specifically parasite-algae interactions. The presented systems allows to gain a deeper understanding of algae bioprocesses at lab- and large-scale, via cultivation and observation with well-defined illumination and medium composition.
