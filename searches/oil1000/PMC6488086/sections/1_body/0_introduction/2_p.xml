 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The culture is often further characterised by taking suspension aliquots and measuring in these samples, for example, chemical composition, dry weight and pigment content. These are mean parameters which typically represent several millilitres of the suspension with millions of algal cells contributing to the average.
