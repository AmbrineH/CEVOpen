<p class="p">An insight into culture heterogeneity that goes beyond suspension averages may be obtained by microscopic examination or by single-cell analysis devices such as flow cytometers, which may reveal multiple algal species or even heterotrophic bacteria or other pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. A unique opportunity to study algae in further detail offer microfluidic approaches that allow cells to grow and mutually interact under well-defined conditions while being simultaneously observed and analysed by microscopy in situ and in real time [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In such a microfluidic photobioreactor, individual algal cells can be observed in isolation or in small aggregates that may include separately identifiable species. As in any other photobioreactor, algal cells require medium which contains nutrients and dissolved CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or bicarbonate to support photosynthesis. Depending on the design and material either diffusion through the chip material or transport by the continuously perfused medium serves to supply CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and remove the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> produced by photosynthetic water splitting. For their photoautotrophic growth, the cells also require photosynthetically active radiation in the range from 400 nm to 700 nm and a controlled temperature with an optimum often between 20 and 40Â°C.
