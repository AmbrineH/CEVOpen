<p class="p">Several microfluidic devices for algae cultivation have been reported so far: Au et al. have developed a digital microfluidics (DMF) system to cultivate 
 <italic class="italic">Cyclotella cryptica</italic> inside aqueous microdroplets of 70 μL [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. DMF is a lab-on-a-chip platform technology which enables the electrical manipulation of microdroplets between insulated electrodes. Au et al. applied online absorption measurements to their droplets and determined a growth rate comparable to that when cultivating 
 <italic class="italic">C. cryptica</italic> in mL scale systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Shih et al. have also applied a DMF system cultivating 
 <italic class="italic">C. cryptica</italic> inside 12 μL sized droplets with an illumination of up to 250 μmol/(m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> s) and have been able to demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">C. cryptica</italic> produced more energy-rich lipids when illuminated at 580 nm, while a combination with 450 nm was favourable for growth and lipid production [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Aqueous droplets suspended in an oil phase have been applied for the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella vulgaris</italic> by Dewan et al. studying growth kinetics. During cultivation the droplets have been stored in a static array of droplet traps. With this device long-term cultivations up to one month have been achieved keeping a constant droplet size of 10 nL [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Lim et al. have developed a 3-step system for the cultivation, the induction and the sub sequential purification of lipids produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. The algae have been cultivated inside a single chamber with 15 μL culture volume and a light intensity of 50 μmol/(m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> s). The lipid production has been induced simply by a medium change and for the final lipid extraction aqueous alcohols have been injected [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Kim et al. have designed a microfluidic cultivation system, where they have captured colonies of 
 <italic class="italic">Botryococcus braunii</italic> in 64 trapping sites. They have implemented dynamic light changes and different intensities in each cultivation chamber to identify the best light dark cycle for 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> oil production by incorporating two additional dye layers, one for the intensity (up to 132 μmol/(m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> s)) and the second for the light-dark cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Luke et al. have been able to develop a microfluidic long term cultivation system for a photoautotrophic cultivation of multiple organisms such as 
 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> using a light source emitting up to 100 μmol/(m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> s) [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. For 
 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> a growth rate of 0.073/h has been obtained in the chip, compared to 0.056/h in shaking flasks. Apart from the one by Luke et al., all systems have tolerated cell growth on more than one layer, which complicates subsequent image analysis. Furthermore, self-shading effects within the colonies have impeded defined and homogeneous irradiation. Often not much technical information about the illumination method has been revealed although homogeneous and reproducible irradiation is central in algal cultivation. Recently microfluidic devices for algae cultivation have been reviewed comprehensively by Kim et al. [
