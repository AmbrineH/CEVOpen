<p class="p">In this article we present a microfluidic single-cell cultivation and analysis approach for algae and other photoautotrophic organisms particularly addressing monolayer cell growth and optimised irradiation. Therefore, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic cultivation chip was designed enabling single-cell analysis with spatio-temporal resolution and accurate control over irradiation, growth medium and temperature. A single device incorporates several hundred monolayer growth chambers ideally suited for algae cultivation. To facilitate photoautotrophic cultivation, we developed an innovative LED illumination unit, the size of a typical objective, which can be simply mounted into the motorised objective revolver of an inverted microscope. This setting facilitates fast and automated changes between algal illumination and time-lapse microscopy using a standard live-cell imaging microscope configuration. We successfully validated the performance of our approach with the photoautotrophic growth of
