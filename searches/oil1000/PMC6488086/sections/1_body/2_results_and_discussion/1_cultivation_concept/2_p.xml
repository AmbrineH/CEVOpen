<p class="p">To meet the requirements for unbiased algae growth, the dimensions of the cultivations chambers by Grünberger et al., which have originally been developed to accommodate smaller organisms, for example 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, were modified [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The limited chamber height of now 4.5 μm confines all microalgae to grow within a single-cell monolayer. This configuration is ideal for microscopy and subsequent image analysis to derive data with spatial and temporal resolution, and furthermore eliminates cellular self-shading. The chip (2.2 cm × 1.7 cm) contains 4 × 8 × 50 cultivation chambers, each of them 4.5 μm high and 80 μm × 90 μm big, between supply channels of 15 μm height and of 100 μm width (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216093.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Each of the four main channels has an independent media inlet and supply outlet to permit parallel experiments with regard to media composition. With the chosen flow rate of 200 nL/min the average flow velocity within the supply channels is 0.44 mm/s. This means the volume flowing by the chamber within a second is approximately 100 times the chamber volume, therefore granting excellent control of medium conditions within the chambers since new nutrients are supplied and any metabolic products are carried away. The flow also replaces the medium in the chip completely within less than 1 min, enabling fast changes in medium conditions if required. We were able to inoculate a portion of the chambers with a single cell each and the resulting colonies remained spatially separated over the whole course of the experiment. Observation of over five generations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> (over 600 cells) was possible before cell loss due to wash out occurred.
