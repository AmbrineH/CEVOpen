<p class="p">The illumination system is crucial for the success and reproducibility of photoautotrophic cultivations. Earlier experiments using our microfluidic cultivation system, applying either the integrated bright field microscope lamp or an external LED placed above the PDMS-chip, could not meet required standards. The microscope illumination is typically not well suited for simultaneous high contrast microscopy imaging and algae irradiation. When the external LED was used, it was placed between the PDMS chip and the condenser lens and interfered with microscopic illumination. Furthermore, variations in the PDMS thickness differences led to light intensity variations. Therefore, we developed a innovative LED illumination unit, the size of a typical objective, which can be simply mounted into the motorised objective revolver of an inverted microscope. This setting facilitates fast and automated changes between independent algal illumination and time-lapse microscopy using a standard inverted live-cell imaging microscope illumination as shown in
