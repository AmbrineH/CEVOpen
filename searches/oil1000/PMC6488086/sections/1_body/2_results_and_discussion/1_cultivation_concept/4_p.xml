<p class="p">The LED performance was validated by measuring the illumination levels at the glass bottom below the chip. The minimum level was 19 μmol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the maximum level was 1941 μmol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). While the current controlling the light intensity emitted by the LED can be modulated freely, we found in our experiments a minimum step width of approximately 20 μmol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) easily attainable for a precise control of the illumination level. The undesired heat emitted by the LED was sufficiently dispersed by the aluminium cooling unit, so that the temperature in close proximity to the cultivation chambers did not exceed (31.8 ± 0.5)°C for the highest intensity, and for 19 μmol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and 110 μmol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) (30.1 ± 0.1)°C and (30.3 ± 0.2)°C respectively (5 measurements each). At the same time the acrylic connector minimised heat conduction towards the microscope as it has a poor thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the LED position below the cultivation chip enabled reproducible irradiation within technical replicates since the glass cover of the cultivation chip did not vary significantly. We measured the intensity in the centre and at the four corners of the cultivation area of approximately 4.3 mm × 6.9 mm and found lower intensities at the corners than in the centre, but not lower than 93% of the centre value. This shows the good spacial homogeneity of the implemented illumination solution. The thread of the LED-unit can be modified easily to be compatible with different microscopy standards, therefore supporting most use cases.
