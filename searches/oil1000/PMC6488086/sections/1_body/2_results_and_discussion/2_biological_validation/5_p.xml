<p class="p">The presented cultivation system also showed great scientific potential for the investigation of cell consortia, including for example bacteria and algae. During some of our cultivations an unexpected but interesting contamination occurred. We were able to observe the cellular interaction between the micro algae 
 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> and a vital parasitic bacterium over the course of several hours (see

As the growth medium was sterile filtered before use, we expect the contamination to stem from a contaminated preculture and to have entered the chip during the seeding procedure. The contamination could be observed in all chambers of a contaminated lane on the chip. A possible countermeasure would be the application of pH-shocks [
