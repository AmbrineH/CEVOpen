<p class="p">Monolayer cultivations in isolated chambers support accurate identification and tracking of single cells and clusters with spatio-temporal resolution, enabling systematic analyses of the cellular division process, morphology etc. At low light intensities the mother cells typically divided into four new cells, at medium intensity into eight cells and the highest possible illumination the algae mainly formed 16 new daughter cells (see
