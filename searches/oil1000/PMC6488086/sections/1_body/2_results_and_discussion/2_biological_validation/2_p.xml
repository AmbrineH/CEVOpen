 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)) a growth rate of (0.109 ± 0.031)/h over 30 h of cultivation time for 7 microcolonies. The cultivation time differs because the chambers filled faster with cells for the high light intensities, and as soon as cells started to leave the chambers the growth rate determination had to be stopped. Sorokin has applied a lab-scale cultivation system and has reported a growth rate of 0.17/h for the cultivation of

It should also be noted that we determine the growth rate from colony areas and not from cell dry weight or optical density. The method based on area works best for big cultures with homogeneous cell size distributions and less well for single cells. Our results show that the presented microfluidic device is very suitable for algae cultivation with comparable growth rates as they have been reported for conventional scales of cultivation in free suspension, although there is no height restriction to growth like in the microfluidic chamber. Using a microfluidic cultivation approach, only Luke et al. have cultivated cells of

 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In agreement with our findings, they have reported a similar growth rate of 0.073/h for cultivation in BG11 medium.
