<p class="p">During experiments with the maximum irradiation (1941 Î¼mol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)) a severe impact of light could be observed for some cells. Instead of faster growth, some cells did not grow any further and typically lysed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216093.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A, 4B and 4C</xref>). This phenomenon may have been caused by photoinhibition of Photosystem II reaction centres which occurs under high light conditions when the D1-protein damage exceeds repair capacity [
