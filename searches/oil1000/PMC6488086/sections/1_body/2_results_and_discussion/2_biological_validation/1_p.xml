 <italic class="italic">C. sorokiniana</italic> was chosen as a model organism to validate our cultivation and illumination system. The present strain was selected due to its good growth at high temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and potential for industrial applications [
 <xref rid="pone.0216093.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We tested the functionality of the system via the photoautotrophic cultivation at different irradiation levels. For this purpose, three different intensities were chosen (19, 110 and 1941 Î¼mol/(s m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)). The three intensities are the lowest possible intensity the LED could emit, an intensity close to the magnitudes common in microfluidic algae cultivations, and the maximum intensity of the used LED. During our experiments we determined and analysed the growth rates, the splitting pattern and the interaction of the algae with a parasitic contamination. We have not investigated specifically the viability of cells trapped and cultivated in the device. However, most of the observed cells grew over the whole time of the experiment, so that we expect no major influence of the cultivation device on viability.
