<p class="p">Computer aided image analysis was performed to quantify cell growth. Therefore, the projected surface area occupied by the algae colonies was automatically determined with the “Auto Threshold” plugin in ImageJ (Version 2.0.0) by first thresholding an 8-bit image and then filling the areas between the cells with the “Binary plugin”. The process was written as jython-script for ImageJ (see

The area over time was used from the start of the experiment until the chamber was filled with cells and excess cells were lost due to convective flow in the supply channel. This covered time spans depending on the light intensity. The corresponding growth rate was then calculated by applying an exponential fit to the determined cell area plotted over time using Origin (ORIGIN 9.1, OriginLab Corporation, USA).
