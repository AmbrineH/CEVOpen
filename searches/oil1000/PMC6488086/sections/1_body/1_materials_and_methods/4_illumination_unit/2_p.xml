<p class="p">To determine the irradiation intensity a LI-190R Quantum Sensor connected to an LI-250A measurement device (LI-COR, USA) was applied. This device measures the power within the PAR wavelength band between 400 nm and 700 nm, thereby the irradiation provided for photoautotrophic organism can be determined independently of the light source and is typically given in μmol/(m
