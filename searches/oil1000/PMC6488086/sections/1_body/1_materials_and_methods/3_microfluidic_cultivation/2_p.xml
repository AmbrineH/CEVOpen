<p class="p">Experiments were conducted with an inverted time-lapse microscope (Eclipse Ti-E, Nikon, Japan). For all cultivations, a 40x air objective was used (Plan Apo 40X/0.95 DIC, Nikon, Japan). The microscope was heated using an incubation chamber at 30Â°C (Temp-Controller 2000-2, Pecon, Germany), cultivation took place under ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Images were taken with a CCD colour camera (DS-Fi, Nikon, Japan) using the Nikon software NIS Elements AR 4.40.02. Cell growth was recorded by sequential time-lapse imaging of up to 80 chambers every 30 min. For growth studies only the chambers containing a single starting cell were chosen for further analysis.
