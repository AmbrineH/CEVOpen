<p class="p">Algae cells were randomly inoculated into the cultivation chambers by infusing the cell suspension so that cells got slightly stuck inside the shallow cultivation chambers whose height matches the diameter of an average cell. Under cultivation conditions a homogeneous medium flow with equal flow rates leads to cultivation chambers with predominantly diffusive mass transport. However, the primary inoculation procedure requires unequal volume flows in the medium supply channels adjacent to the chambers resulting in convection through the cultivation chambers. Therefore, flow conditions can be temporarily distorted by an air bubble entrapped inside the microfluidic channels as has been described in detail by Probst et al. [

After the chip was loaded with cells the tubing of the medium containing syringes was connected to the inlets of the chip and the outlets were connected to waste containers. Cultivation medium was pumped with a flow rate of 200 nL/min per syringe through the supply channels by a syringe pump (neMESYS, Cetoni, Korbussen, Germany).
