<p class="p">PDMS chips were fabricated by preparing 60 g of a 10:1 mixture of the polymer base and cross linker (Silicone Elastomer Kit #184, Dow Corning, Midland), which was carefully mixed and degassed in a desiccator (Duran, Germany) at 200 mbar for 30 min. When the mixture was transparent and without any air bubbles it was poured onto the SU-8 mould in a petri dish and crosslinked at 80°C for 1 h on a levelled plate inside a laboratory oven (UN 200, Memmert, Germany). The height of the hardened PDMS layer was typically between 3 mm 4 mm. After baking, the PDMS was removed from the mould, cut into single chips and inlets and outlets were punched using a punching tool (Uni-Core, D = 1 mm, Fisher Scientific, Germany). To remove particles the chips were rinsed with isopropanol and dried under nitrogen gas flow. Remaining particles were removed by reversibly applying duct tape to the PDMS surface. All working steps were performed under a crossflow clean bench to reduce contamination with dust particles. The chip was subsequently placed in a plasma generator together a glass slide of 170 μm thickness serving as the glass bottom, and both parts were oxygen plasma treated for 25 s (Femto Plasma Cleaner, Diener Electronics, Germany) at 0.8 mbar with a gas flow of 15 sccm. Immediately afterwards the PDMS chip was placed carefully on the glass slide to initiate bonding. At last, the PDMS-glass chip was baked at 80°C for 2 min to strengthen the bonding.</p>
