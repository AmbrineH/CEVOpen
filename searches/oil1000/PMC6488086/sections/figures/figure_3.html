 <p> Examples of growth for different light intensities. Scale bar is always 5 μm. (A) For a light intensity of 19 μmol/(s m 2) the average observed growth rate was 0.041/h, (B) at an intensity of 110 μmol/(s m 2) it was 0.084/h, and (C) for light intensity of 1941 μmol/(s m 2) it was 0.109/h. For the purpose of illustration the figure contrast was enhanced. </p>
