<p id="Par25" class="p">Since the implementation of Reform and Opening Up four decades ago, people have witnessed the rapid advancement of the Chinese economy. With strong support from the state and multilevel governments, the platform for natural product chemistry research in China has been substantially improved. Thanks to the efforts made by researchers, Chinese natural product chemistry research has transformed from the status of “following” as seen 40 years ago to a “neck and neck” position, even leading the way in particular fields. The abundance of plants and other natural product resources, in addition to the 2000-year history of the application of traditional Chinese medicine, is an inexhaustible gold mine for in-depth exploration. With continued clarification of our research directions and objectives, collaboration with other rapidly developing disciplines, consideration of national development needs and persistent research, I believe that we can make greater contributions and bring Chinese natural product chemistry research to a new golden era dominated by more fields. Based on the previous prospective results, I hope that our research group will broaden the horizons and keep pace with the development of modern natural product chemistry to supplement our achievements and finally contribute to the realization of the “new age” in our country.</p>
