<p id="Par16" class="p">Schisandraceae is a family of important medicinal plant with two known genera, 
 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Kadsura</italic>. Our country possesses the most abundant sources of Schisandraceae species, and 21 of them can be used for medicinal purposes. For example, the dried mature fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to enhance mental and physical working capacities and have been included in various editions of the Chinese pharmacopoeia. More than 50 years of prior studies on Schisandraceae species have revealed that their major secondary metabolites are dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans and lanostane- and cycloartane-type triterpenoids. Additionally, bifendate and bicyclol, two new anti-hepatitis drugs developed by Chinese scholars with independent intellectual property rights, have provided great economic and social benefits. However, owing to the previously insufficient research conditions, further investigations should be made about the chemical constituents of such group of important medicinal plants, the chemical basis underlying their medicinal uses, and the rational and sustainable exploitation and utilization of these abundant plant resources. Sun and colleagues have implemented systematic and in-depth research on the triterpenoids from 24 Schisandraceae species ever since early 1990s.

    <italic class="italic">Pioneering research on schinortriterpenoids (SNTs)</italic> The most significant achievement was the discovery of highly oxygenated schinortriterpenoids of the 
    <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> species, characterized by polycyclic-fused scaffolds containing numerous contiguous stereogenic centers (Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). These compounds have provided new clue for future development of pharmaceutical agents derived from the well-known traditional drug 
    <italic class="italic">Schisandra chinensis</italic> and added important new dimensions to our understanding of triterpenoid chemistry.

    <italic class="italic">The total synthesis of schinortriterpenoids</italic> the novel and complex structures of the schinortriterpenoids has aroused great interest among organic chemists at home and abroad. So far, 13 SNTs, including schindilactone A and lancifodilactone G, have been synthesized by 12 research groups in five countries, leading to the publication of over 30 papers in highly influential journals, including
