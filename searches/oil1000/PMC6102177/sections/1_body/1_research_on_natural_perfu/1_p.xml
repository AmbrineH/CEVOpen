<p id="Par2" class="p">Han-Dong Sun was assigned to the essential oil group of a phytochemistry laboratory upon his arrival at Kunming Institute of Botany in October 1962. He purified and elucidated the chemical constituents contained in the essential oils of the plants in the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Litsea</italic> under the guidance of Mr. Xian-Yuan Cai. His first research article in collaboration with Ren-Dao Lu, et al. titled “ The Volatile Composition of the Root of 
 <italic class="italic">Stelmatocryptin khasianum</italic> (Kurz) H. Baill”, was published in “
 <italic class="italic">Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica</italic>” in 1963. From 1967 to 1972, he participated in a “523” Project, a civilian-military cooperation project for “Resisting America and Supporting Vietnam”, with his colleagues Jin-Kai Ding, Run-Bao Qin, Jin-Tian Yao, Cai Yu, Wen-Fen Chen, et al. Primarily run by the Institute of Military Medical Sciences, Kunming Military Region, the project was aimed at discovering mosquito-repelling constituents contained in plants. After over 5 years of military-civilian collaboration and exploration throughout many of the prefectures in Yunnan Province, they ultimately screened and discovered a new monoterpene called 8-acetoxy carvotanacetone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) from plant No. 1247, 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha haplocalyx</italic>. The compound was successfully synthesized from 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene and possessed strong mosquito- and insect-repelling activities with no obvious side effects [

In the mid-1970s, in conjunction with Kunming Institute of Light Industry, they purified and synthesized nardostachnol acetate, a sesquiterpene with a persistent and intense aroma of sandalwood which is regarded an ideal raw material for rose- and fougere-type perfumes. The research provided a new sesquiterpene-based perfume for China, winning the First Prize of the Science and Technology Award of Kunming City and the Third Prize of the Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Yunnan Province in 1978 with the title “A New Perfume, Nardostachnol Acetate”. Moreover, their study of 
 <italic class="italic">Chinese angelica</italic> resulted in the widespread application of 
 <italic class="italic">Chinese angelica</italic> in medicine and perfume, creating a market for the angelica and its inferior product in Yunnan. The discovery was awarded the Third Prize of the Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Yunnan Province in 1985.
