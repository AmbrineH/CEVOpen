<p id="Par3" class="p">From 1982 to 1992, Sun’s group systematically probed into the aromatic and chemical constituents of 22 lichen species. They successfully developed two new lichen perfumery products, namely Chinese oakmoss No. 1 (with ethyl divaricatinate as the main aromatic component) and Chinese odour No. 2 (with ethyl haematommate and ethyl everninate as the main aromatic components) [

The perfumery project belonged to the National Ministry of Light Industry and Chinese Academy of Sciences during the period of the “Sixth Five-Year Plan”. Moreover, the project promoted the pioneering research and development of perfume in China. These products were praised both at home and abroad as original Chinese oakmoss products, successively winning the Second Prize of the Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Yunnan Province, “Sixth Five-Year Plan” Key Issue Recognition award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Outstanding Product Award of Ministry of Light Industry in 1985 for its contribution to the perfume industry in China. In 1993, the project titled “Study on the Chemical Constituents and Application of Domestic Lichen Plants” was awarded the Third Prize of the Natural Science Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
