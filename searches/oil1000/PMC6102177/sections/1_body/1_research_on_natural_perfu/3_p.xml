<p id="Par4" class="p">Since the late 1980s, Han-Dong Sun and his colleagues, Jin-Kai Ding, Xue-Jian Yu, Yu Wu, Yuan-Fen Yi, et al., under concerted efforts with colleagues Bi-Qian Chen, Xin-Xiang Ma, Yong Xu, et al., implemented a systemic study on essential oil contents, physicochemical constants, chemical constituents and primary aromatic components by means of GC/MS. Additionally, over the past decade, they reported the development and application of approximately 400 types of Chinese perfume plants, especially those found in tropical and subtropical climates, such as Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna. The research provided a solid scientific basis for the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of perfume plant resources as well as their exploitation and utilization in Yunnan Province and throughout China. The results of the study were published in two monographs, which were “The Resources and Aromatic Components of Plants of Genus 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> in China” and “Perfume Plants and Their Utilization in Yunnan Province”, in 1997 and 2001 by Yunnan Science and Technology Press, respectively. These two monographs obtained high praise from perfume industry peers at home and abroad.
