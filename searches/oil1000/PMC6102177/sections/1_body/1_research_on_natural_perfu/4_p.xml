<p id="Par5" class="p">From the late 1970s to the 1990s, Han-Dong Sun wrote a number of reviews about the international progress of natural perfumes studies and the research progress and strategic discussion of perfume plants in both Yunnan Province and China. For example, “Progress in Analytical Research of Natural Aromatic Compounds” [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>], “Natural Perfume Plant Resources” and “Chinese Perfume Plant Resources” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] have been published and well-received in both domestic and foreign publications. These publications boosted the research and development of natural perfumes in China and contributed greatly to the development of the natural perfume industry in China. It is noteworthy that “Study on Resource Exploration and Strategic Development in Southwest China” (containing the subproject “Natural Perfume Plant Resources” that was completed by Han-Dong Sun), sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Natural Resources Comprehensive Investigation Commission of the State Planning Commission, won the Science and Technology Progress Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993 and the Second Prize of the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award in 1995.
