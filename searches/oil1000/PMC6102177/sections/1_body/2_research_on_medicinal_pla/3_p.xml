 <italic class="italic">Erigeron breviscapus</italic>, which is a well-known folk medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Yunnan Province. In combination with biological screening, the previously reported compound, scutellarin, as well a variety of novel caffeoylquinic acid esters containing significant bioactivities were found, such as 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and erigoster B (Fig.

Sun’s group also developed a Dengzhanxixin phenol drug (for injection), designated State Category II New Drug, which received clinical approval from the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in December 2003, and completed its Phase III clinical studies in June 2007. The drug has been undergoing the new-drug certification process. Dengzhanxixin phenol drug (for injection) is a new preparation with clear effective components, controllable quality and a definite curative effect. Its unique effects for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases make this new drug a potential pillar of the biomedical industry of Yunnan Province, and one that possesses independent intellectual property rights in China.
