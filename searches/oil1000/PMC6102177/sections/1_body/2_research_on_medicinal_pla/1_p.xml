<p id="Par6" class="p">Since the US national Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Taxol as a drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer in 1992, it has been a subject of great interest for natural product chemists and pharmacists worldwide. Currently, 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus brevifolia</italic> is not widely available in China, but an abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Taxaceae</italic>, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus yunnanensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus chinensis,</italic> could be found in Yunnan Province. Sun’s group emphatically studied the aforementioned two plants obtained from different habitats jointly with Japanese researchers. Dr. Hong-Jie Zhang discovered a Taxol analog named taxuyunnanine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) in the root of 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus yunnanensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. The analog exhibited cytotoxicity against KB cells with the same order of magnitude as that of Taxol. Dr. Bo Li derived the taxchinins, a series of novel diterpenoids, from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus chinensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. These systematic and in-depth investigations on 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus yunnanensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus chinensis</italic> provided a solid scientific basis for the rational development, utilization and protection of 
 <italic class="italic">Taxaceae</italic> species in Yunnan Province.
