<p id="Par7" class="p">Starting from 1974, Sun and his colleagues centered on the chemical constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Angelica apaensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Heracleum rapula</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Heracleum scabridum</italic>, which are three plants of the 
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> family. The results were released in “
 <italic class="italic">Acta Botanica Yunnanica</italic>”, “
 <italic class="italic">Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs</italic>”, and “
 <italic class="italic">Bulletin of Botany</italic>”, respectively from 1975 to 1978 [

 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> species in southwest China. More than 300 compounds were purified and elucidated, among which more than 20 were reported for the first time, including apaensin, turgeniifolin A, and rubricauloside (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), resulting in the publication of over 40 papers. These results not only increased the number of known chemical constituents and natural coumarins found in the 
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> family but also clarified the association between their pharmacology and their chemical constituents. The research provided a scientific basis for the rational development and utilization of the 
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> species. Of note, the project titled “Studies on Chemical Constituents of 13 
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic> Species” won the Third Prize of the Natural Science Award of Yunnan Province in 1992.
