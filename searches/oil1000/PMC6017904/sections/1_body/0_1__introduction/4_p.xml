<p class="p">Considering these assumptions, the interest in the development of new approaches for the prevention of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has increased. The development of anti-biofilm strategies is therefore of major interest and currently constitutes an important field of investigation in which non-biocidal molecules are highly valuable to avoid the rapid appearance of escape mutants [
