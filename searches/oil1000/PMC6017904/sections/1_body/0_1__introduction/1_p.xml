<p class="p">The great ability of bacteria to colonize new environments is undoubtedly related to biofilm formation. Biofilm lifestyle is associated with a high tolerance to exogenous stress: consequently, the treatment of biofilms with antibiotics or other biocides is usually ineffective at eradicating them. Biofilm formation is inevitably a major problem in many fields, ranging from food industry to medicine. In medical settings, biofilms are the cause of persistent infections implicated in 80% or more of all microbial cases, releasing harmful toxins and even obstructing indwelling catheters [
