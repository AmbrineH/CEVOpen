<p class="p">This study reports chemical composition, antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> of 89 different EOs obtained from 3 different plants harvested in different seasons and conditions: 
 <italic class="italic">Calamintha nepeta</italic> (L.) Savi subsp.

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Miller (FV) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">Ridolfia segetum</italic> Moris (RS). Furthermore, quantitative activityâ€“composition relationships (QCAR) were developed through machine learning classification approaches with objective of discovery the chemical components mainly responsible for the anti-biofilm activity.
