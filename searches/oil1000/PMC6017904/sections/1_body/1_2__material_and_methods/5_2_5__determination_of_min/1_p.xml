<p class="p">MIC was performed according to the guidelines of Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Each EO was added directly from mother stock and solutions were prepared by two-fold serial dilutions. Mother stock solutions were obtained by solubilizing each EO in DMSO at a final concentration of 1 g/mL. A total of 10 concentrations were used within the 25â€“0.045 mg/mL range. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration at which the observable bacterial growth was inhibited. No inhibition of the bacterial growth was highlighted at tested concentrations.</p>
