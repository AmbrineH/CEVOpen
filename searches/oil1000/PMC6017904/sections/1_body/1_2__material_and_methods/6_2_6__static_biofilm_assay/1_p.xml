 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Briefly, the wells of a sterile 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene plate were filled with 100 µL of the appropriate medium. A measure of 1/100 dilution of overnight bacterial cultures was added into each well (about 0.5 OD 600 nm). As a control, the first row contained bacteria grown in 100 μL of BHI (untreated bacteria). Furthermore, BHI broth was added to remaining wells starting from the third row. In the second row, we added BHI supplemented with each EO at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Starting from this lane, samples were serially diluted (1:2 dilutions). The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 h at 37 °C.
