 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and RS were collected in a wild area about 15 km from Tarquinia city (Province of Viterbo, Italy), in the archaeological zone near the Etruscan temple Ara della Regina (42°15′31.8″ N, 11°48′08.7″ E). The material was collected in summer and early autumn periods of the year 2015 and monitored for four (CG) and three (FV) months, from July to October, thus covering pre-, during-, and post-flowering periods. Regarding RS, this is a summer annual plant, completing its life cycle within June/July. Hence, this species has been monitored just in terms of different extraction times, not periods of harvesting. CG oils were obtained directly from fresh plant material, while FV and RS were air-dried in a shady place for 20 days. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the Department of Drug Chemistry and Technology at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. Taxonomic identification of the chosen species was conducted according to the official European flora and the National Italian one.
