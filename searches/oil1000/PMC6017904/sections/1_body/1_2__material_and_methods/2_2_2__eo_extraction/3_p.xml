<p class="p">In addition, to simulate parallel continuous EO extraction for 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h (and 30 h), mixtures were prepared by adding different amounts of diethyl ether to each oil fraction, up to 10 mL in total (e.g., 7 mL of diethyl ether to 3 mL of the oil). Combining 1 mL of each etherâ€“oil solution and then letting ether to evaporate, the desired oily mixes were obtained.</p>
