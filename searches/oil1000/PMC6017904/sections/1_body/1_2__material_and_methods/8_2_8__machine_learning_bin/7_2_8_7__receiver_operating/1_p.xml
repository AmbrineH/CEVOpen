<p class="p">The ROC curve [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] shows the ability of a binary classifier model to discriminate between positive and negative classes as its discrimination threshold is varied from high to low values. To obtain the curve, the true positive rate (TPR) is plotted against the false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds. An area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of 1.0 represents a model that made all predictions correctly. An AUC of 0.5 represents a model that is as good as a random classification.
