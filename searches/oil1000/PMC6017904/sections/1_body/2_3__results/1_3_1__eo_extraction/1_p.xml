<p class="p">Fractioned extraction process applied to three different plant species, two of them being also monitored in terms of different harvesting periods, showing great differences in EO yields. Detailed overview of those results has been reported just recently [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In the case of CG, usually the largest parts of EOs were extracted in the first 3 or 6 h [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Great impact of harvesting period is particularly obvious in the case of FVEOs, and a great increase, of up to five times, in EO amount was noticed in October when the plant was fruiting [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Annual RS gave a very unusual yield curve with the first maximum after the first hour of extraction, and the second one between the third and sixth hour of the extraction process. Relative yield percentages of EOs (calculated per weight of fresh/dried plant material) and total yields over time are given in
