<p class="p">Obtained CGEOs, FVEOs, and RSEOs were analyzed in terms of chemical composition [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The extraction method applied gave fractions that differ greatly in their chemical composition characterized by 89 samples with a total of 54 chemical constituents differently distributed (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00482" class="xref">Supplemental Materials Tables S4 and S5</xref>). For each EO, the main characterizing compounds are usually present in every fraction, variations in their amount are particularly abundant in the first three fractions (up to 3 h of extraction process) with very low percentage, or even absent, in the last three (after 12 h or 24 h). Furthermore, some compounds appear only with the development of the extraction process, being significantly present only in the last fractions. Concerning the harvesting period, EOs chemical profiles were found to be heavily influenced by this factor. Details for CG and FV have been already reported [
