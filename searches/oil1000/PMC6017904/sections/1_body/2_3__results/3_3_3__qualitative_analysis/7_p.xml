<p class="p">Regarding the results obtained with extracts derived from RS, all of them inhibited biofilm. In most cases, the reduction is proportional to the concentration of EO used (R1, R3, R6, R24, R30, RM2, RM3, and RM4). Conversely, EOs named R2, R12, RM5, and RM6 did not show an anti-biofilm effect correlated to the concentration used. Only in the case of RM1, there is an opposite relationship between the concentration used and the anti-biofilm effect (
