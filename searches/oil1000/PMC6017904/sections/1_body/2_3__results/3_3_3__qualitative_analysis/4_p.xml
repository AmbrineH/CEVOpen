<p class="p">Arbitrarily, three levels of biofilm inhibition were considered to qualitatively cluster the EOs potencies: strong biofilm inhibition in the range 0–40% of residual biofilm, mild inhibition in the range 40–80% and no biofilm inhibition over 80% of residual biofilm, respectively. In some cases, an increase of biofilm formation was highlighted after the treatment. As reported in
