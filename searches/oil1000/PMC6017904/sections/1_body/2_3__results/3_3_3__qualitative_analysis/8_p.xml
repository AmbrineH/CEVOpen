 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00482" class="xref">Supplementary Materials Table S6</xref> are summarized results on anti-biofilm activity of EO grouped in four different classes corresponding to their capability to impair biofilm formation. This classification was based on results reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00482-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> obtained with higher concentration of EOs (3.125 mg/mL). In particular, we considered strong reduction if the residual biofilm was in the range 0–40%, medium reduction if the residual biofilm was in the range 40–80%, and no reduction for residual biofilm higher than 80%. In such cases, an enhancer effect on biofilm formation was evidenced after the treatment with EOs. This latter was observable only for such EOs obtained from CG.
