 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00482-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B, the effects of EOs from CG on PaO1 biofilm formation are reported. Differently from FV data, several CGEOs samples showed to increase biofilm production in a way directly proportional to the concentration used. Among all assayed EOs, some of them, such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, produced an inhibitory effect on the biofilm at higher concentration and an increase of it at lower concentration. Instead, other EOs are able to strongly inhibit biofilm formation already at very low concentrations (reduction of biofilm higher than 50%).
