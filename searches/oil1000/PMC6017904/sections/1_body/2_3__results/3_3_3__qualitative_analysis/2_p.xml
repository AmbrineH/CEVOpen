<p class="p">The anti-biofilm effects of EOs from different plants above described were examined on 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. Firstly, we selected some representative EOs samples (two for RS, three for CG and FV) to evaluate the anti-biofilm efficacy at different concentrations starting from 25 mg/mL using scalar dilutions (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00482-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The obtained preliminary data, were analyzed in terms of biofilm reduction and reproducibility that led to the selection of two concentrations as the most representatives (3.125 mg/mL and 0.0488 mg/mL). The first concentration was in the range of milligrams while the second one was in the range of micrograms. The percentages of residual biofilm after treatment at these two concentrations (3.125 mg/mL and 0.0488 mg/mL) for all 89 Eos are reported in
