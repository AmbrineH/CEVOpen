<p class="p">In order to exclude if selected EOs contained molecules affecting bacterial viability, the 89 EOs were analyzed also for antimicrobial activity. In vitro EOs bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were evaluated on 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> by broth microdilution methods. An appropriate dilution (10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cfu/mL were used as reported by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards NCCLS, 2004) of bacterial culture of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> in exponential phase was used. No antimicrobial activity on 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> strains was highlighted for all tested EOs (maximal concentration tested 25 mg/mL).
