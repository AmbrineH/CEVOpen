<p class="p">Initial application of linear models by the PCA formalism revealed the lack of linear dependence between biofilm production inhibition and chemical composition as no acceptable classification model was obtained using biofilm production percentages observed at either 0.0488 or 3.125 mg/mL. Indeed, graphical inspection of scores plot of the first two principal components (PCs), accounting for more than 75% of data variance, revealed the presence of at least three clusters (
