<p class="p">Among used algorithm (data not shown), GB led to the most robust binary classification model. To this aim, at first the optimal biofilm production percentage for the binary classification was investigated by systematically increasing it from a starting 40 to 80% and monitoring the accuracy by leave-one-out cross-validation. The best GB classification model was obtained at 50% and 46% for the 48.8 Âµg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL concentrations, respectively (
