<p class="p">In such cases, in particular in presence of EOs obtained by CG, an enhancer effect on biofilm formation was observed. This second is an interesting result and support the theory that plants produce molecules that regulate biofilm formation in different environments: an interesting example of inter-kingdom regulation. The regulatory pathways of sessile phenotype could be related to competition dynamics of habitats. The identification of the molecules responsible for these mechanisms could be interesting and also open new perspectives for the control of bacterial biofilm formation. It is worth to note that ‘row’ EOs that we used represent a complex pool of chemical cues that could be characterized by different capabilities to either impair or promote biofilm formation.</p>
