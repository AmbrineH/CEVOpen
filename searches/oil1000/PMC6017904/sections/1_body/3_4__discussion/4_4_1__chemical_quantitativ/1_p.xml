<p class="p">Significant to moderate biofilm reducing activity was observed for several CGEO samples against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PaO1 strain. Analyzing data showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00482-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the duration of extraction process seems to influence the activity on this strain, since in every month (except October) last fractions (12 h and 24 h) were found to be more effective. Observed efficacy of these last fractions could be potentially associated with the increase of chrysanthenone.
