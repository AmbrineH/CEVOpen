<p class="p">Some FVEO samples from August harvest demonstrated very high biofilm inhibition of this strain, in some samples even more than 80%. With few exceptions, September samples did not show any significant reduction, while several FVEOs obtained from fruiting material (FOM1 and FOM4) showed significant ability to impair biofilm formation, even in the quite low concentration.</p>
