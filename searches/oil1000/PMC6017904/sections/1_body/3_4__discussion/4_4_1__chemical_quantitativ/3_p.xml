 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00482-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) suggests the potential influence of different chemical profile on oil’s efficacy. Namely, October samples differ from the ones obtained during the pre-fruiting phenological stage, having estragole as the major constituent. The presence of this phenylpropene in these samples may be the main reason for biofilm inhibition. On the other side, the higher susceptibility of
