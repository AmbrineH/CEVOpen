<p class="p">From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00482-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, considering a threshold of 5%, six compounds—namely estragole, methol and phellandral, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, pulegone, and chrysanthenone—can be considered as those most influencing biofilm production, being estragole and phellandral the most significant. To ascertain whether components correlate positively or negatively with biofilm inhibition, the partial dependence plot were investigated for all compounds (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00482" class="xref">Supplementary Materials Figure S4</xref>). The partial dependent plots for the above six compounds (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00482" class="xref">Supplementary Materials Figure S5</xref>) directly indicate estragole and phellandral as those most important for biofilm inhibition. Whereas 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, pulegone, and chrysanthenone were found to be inversely associated to biofilm inhibition and likely responsible for biofilm production enhancement observed. A different scenario can be interpreted for menthol, at a low percentage it correlates with a negative effect on biofilm inhibition that disappears as it is increases above 16%.
