<p class="p">Results from the present study aforementioned confirmed some disparity in the microbial counts. The variations in the range of microbial populations are an indication of several reasons such as nutrient, minerals, temperature, oxygen level, acidity, volume of wastewater (

The presence and growth of viable bacteria and fungi in POME may possibly be associated with the fact that POME is rich in carbohydrates, proteins, nitrogenous compounds, lipids, minerals, cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin (
