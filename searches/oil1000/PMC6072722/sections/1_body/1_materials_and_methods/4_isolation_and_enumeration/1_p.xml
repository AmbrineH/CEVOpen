<p class="p">The standard procedures for serial dilution aforementioned for bacterial isolation were followed for fungal isolation. Thereafter, using a sterile pipette, 0.1mL aliquots of the dilutions were aseptically removed with a sterile pipette and separately spread plated with flamed-sterilised glass spreader (bent glass rod) on well-dried Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), oil agar (POA) MSM for fungi and Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) agar plates for fungi in triplicates for the enumeration of viable heterotrophic fungi, palm oil utilising and cellulose utilising fungi respectively. The plates were inoculated on the surface using the standard spread plate technique (
