<p class="p">The culture plates were incubated at 28°C for 5–7 days (
 <xref rid="b5-tlsr-29-2-131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">APHA 2005</xref>). Three uninoculated plates were used as control. After incubation, viable numbers of colonies on each plate were enumerated and expressed or recorded as colony forming unit per milliliter (cfu/mL). Colonies were purified by repeatedly sub culturing aseptically on to fresh PDA, oil agar and CMC agar and incubated at 28°C for 5–7 days to obtain discrete pure colonies. Pure colonies were then stored on PDA, oil agar and CMC agar slants at 8°C to maintain viability for subsequent analysis and identification. Staining was also performed for all the isolates using lacto phenol cotton blue solution. The medium was incorporated with Altacef antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth.
