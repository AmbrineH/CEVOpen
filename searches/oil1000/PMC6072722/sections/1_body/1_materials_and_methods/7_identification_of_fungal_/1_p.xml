<p class="p">Initial identification of individual fungal isolates was based on microscopic staining of fungi using lactophenol blue solution (Lactophenol cotton blue solution) and macroscopic appearance which comprise pigmentation/colour, identified on the basis of cultural (colour and colonial appearance of fungal colony) and morphological characteristics in lacto-phenol blue solution wet mount by compound microscope. Genetic identification of fungal isolates was performed by determining nucleotide sequences of 18S rRNA genes using commonly used primers (
