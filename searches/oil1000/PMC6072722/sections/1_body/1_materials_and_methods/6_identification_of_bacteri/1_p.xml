<p class="p">Initial identification of individual bacterial isolates was achieved by standard tests (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 1994
 </xref>). Such identification included the shape of cells, Gram’s reaction and colony morphology on solid nutrient media. Genetic identification of bacterial isolates was performed by determining nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA genes using commonly used primers (
 <xref rid="t1-tlsr-29-2-131" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) for amplifying the DNA between positions 27 and 1492 of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Genetic identification of the pure cultures of bacterial isolated from POME were sent to Centre for Chemical Biology (CCB), Universiti Sains Malaysia for sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Inoculum preparation was carried out by inoculating bacteria strains in nutrient broth, fungi in potato dextrose broth, incubated for 24 h (bacteria), 2–3 days (fungi) at 37°C and 28°C respectively.
