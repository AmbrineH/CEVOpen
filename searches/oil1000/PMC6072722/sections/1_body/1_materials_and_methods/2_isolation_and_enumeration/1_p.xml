The POME was well shaken to homogenised suspension and thereafter, ten-fold (10-fold) serial dilution was made by aseptically transferring one milliliter (1 mL) of the homogenised suspension into a sterile test tubes containing nine milliliter (9 mL) of sterile, distilled water. Then, using a sterile pipette, 0.1 mL aliquots of the dilutions were aseptically removed with a sterile pipette and separately spread plated with flamed-sterilised glass spreader (bent glass rod) on well-dried Nutrient Agar (NA), oil agar (Palm Oil Agar [POA]) Mineral Salts Medium (MSM) for bacteria and Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) agar plates for bacteria in triplicates for the enumeration of viable heterotrophic bacteria, palm oil utilising and cellulose utilising bacteria respectively. The plates were inoculated using spread plate technique (

After incubation, plates that contained 30–300 colony forming units (cfu) were selected and counted with the aid of a colony counter. Viable numbers of colonies on each plate were enumerated and expressed or recorded as colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL) of the sample. Colonies were purified by repeatedly subcultured aseptically on to fresh NA, oil agar and CMC agar and incubated at 37°C for 48 h to obtain discrete pure colonies. Pure colonies were then stored on NA, oil agar and CMC agar slants at 8°C to maintain viability for subsequent analysis and identification. Gram staining was performed for all the isolates. The medium was incorporated with Ketoconazole antifungal (known as funginox) to inhibit fungal growth.
