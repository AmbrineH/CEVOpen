The medium was prepared by the addition of 1% (v/v) palm oil as sole source of carbon and energy, sterilized with 0.45 μm pore size Millipore filter paper to sterile MSM, which has been cooled to 45°C under aseptic condition. 200 mg ketoconazole antifungal (known as funginox) was added to prevent fungal growth. The MSM and palm oil were then mixed thoroughly and dispensed into sterile Petri dishes to solidify.
