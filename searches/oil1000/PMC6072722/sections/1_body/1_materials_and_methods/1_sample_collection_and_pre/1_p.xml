<p class="p">Raw POME was collected aseptically from MALPOM Sdn. Bhd., Pulau Pinang, palm oil mill industry in a sterile microbiological container (20 L) and brought back to the laboratory. In collecting raw POME sample from the POME holding tank, the mouth of the tap connected to the holding tank was swabbed with cotton wool soaked in ethanol. This was done in order to disinfect the mouth of the tap. The tap was allowed to run for few minutes and the container was used to collect the POME sample and quickly corked. Prior to sample collection, the POME sample inside the container was inverted a few times in ordered to rinse the inside wall of the container. The sample was later poured out into the surrounding. This step was done three times and the container was finally placed to collect the POME sample. The POME sample was kept in an ice box while transporting to School of Industrial Technology laboratory, Universiti Sains Malaysia and preserved at 4Â°C until further experiment in order to stop the wastewater from undergoing biodegradation due to microbial action (
