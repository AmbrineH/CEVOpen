 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, 1.25 g; NaNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 0.42 g; agar, 20 g; distilled water, 1 L and pH of 7.2. The medium was used for isolation, enumeration and identification of palm oil-utilising fungi (oil degraders). The medium was prepared by the addition of 1% (v/v) palm oil as sole source of carbon and energy, sterilised with 0.45 μm pore size Millipore filter paper to sterile MSM, which has been cooled to 45°C under aseptic condition. 250 mg Altacef antibiotic, was added to prevent bacterial growth. The MSM and palm oil were then mixed thoroughly and dispensed into sterile Petri dishes to solidify.
