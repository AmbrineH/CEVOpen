<p class="p">The physicochemical properties of POME are well documented. Conversely, the microbiological aspect is overlooked; as such there seem to be dearth of information on the microbiota been documented proving that a well-developed understanding of these is needed. Therefore, this study represents one of the few studies in Malaysia. The diverse microbiota communities are known to participate effectively in the biodegradation and bioremediation of POME. Consequently, the study on the microbiological characteristics of POME lays a basis to promote better understanding of the types and nature of microorganisms domicile in POME. This will provide evidence of the microbiota characteristics of POME. Their involvement in biodegradation and biotreatment of POME may possibly abet in achieving higher reduction of organic load present in POME. This study was designed to explore the microorganisms associated with palm oil mill wastewater and to establish the microbial load from MALPOM Sdn. Bhd. in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.</p>
