<p class="p">Raw POME is a warm, acidic (pH between 4 and 5), brownish colloidal suspension having lofty concentrations of organic matter, elevated amounts of total solids (40,500 mg/L), oil and grease (4,000 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (50,000 mg/L) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (25,000 mg/L) (

Chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand of palm oil mill wastewater are very high and COD values greater than 60,000 mg/L are often reported (

Consequently, the challenge of converting POME into an environmental friendly waste necessitates a well-organised treatment and effectual removal method.
