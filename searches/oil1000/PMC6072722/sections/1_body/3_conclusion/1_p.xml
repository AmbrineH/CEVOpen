<p class="p">Results from the current study revealed the presence of diverse types of microorganisms domiciled in palm oil mill wastewater. This conclusion suggests that microorganisms thrive well in palm oil mill wastewater. The investigation provides insight on the exploitation of microbial strains in biotreatment of industrial agricultural based wastewaters such as palm oil mill wastewater. The diversity of microbial strains isolated from palm oil mill wastewater provides a basis to promote better understanding of the types and nature of microorganisms domicile in palm oil mill wastewater. This will provide evidence on the microbiota characteristics of palm oil mill wastewater. Conversely, this signifies the optimism for identification of native microbes from palm oil mill wastewater for biodegradation and bioremediation of industrial wastewaters. Study on metagenomic and transcriptomics characterisation is required for further identification of microbial strains diversity using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).</p>
