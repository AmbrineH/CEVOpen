<p class="p">Free radical scavenging activity of methanolic extract was measured using DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. The extract was dissolved in methanol to prepare a stock solution with the concentration of 10 mg/10 mL. Serial dilutions (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.625, 0.313, and 0.156 mg/mL) were made to reduce the concentrations. Two mL of diluted solution was mixed with 2 mL of 0.08 mg/mL DPPH solution and was allowed to stay for 30 min for any reaction. The ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorbance was set at 517 nm by Thermo Fisher spectrophotometer (Walthman, MA, USA). The reduction percentage was recorded against the extract concentration to compute RC50 values (the concentration of extract that provides 50% loss of DPPH activity). Quercetin was used as the positive control and the experiment was performed in triplicate [
