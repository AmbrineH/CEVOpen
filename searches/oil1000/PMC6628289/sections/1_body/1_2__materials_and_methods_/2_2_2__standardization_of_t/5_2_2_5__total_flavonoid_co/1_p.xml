<p class="p">Total flavonoids were determined using the AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> method. Eighty percent methanol was used as the test solution. With this end in view, 133 mg crystalline AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and 400 mg crystalline NaCOOCH3 were dissolved in 100 mL of 80% methanol and used as an AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> reagent. To estimate the flavonoid content of extract, 2 mL of extract solution, 400 ÂµL of water, and 1 mL of AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> reagent were mixed and the absorbance was set at 430 nm using Thermo Fisher spectrophotometer. The blank solution containing no AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> reagent and different concentrations of quercetin were used as the standard. The number of flavonoids was estimated based on the calibration curve of quercetin. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
