<p class="p">Total antioxidant activity was determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) following the method of Benzie and Strain with some modifications. This method is based on the reduction of Fe (III)-TPTZ (ferric 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s triazine complex) by antioxidants to Fe (II)-TPTZ (ferrous form). Light blue reagent clarifies the presence of Fe (III)–TPTZ, and changing it to dark blue after interaction with antioxidants illustrates the presence of Fe (II)–TPTZ in the reagent. To this end, FRAP stock solution was prepared freshly by mixing TPTZ (10 mM), HCl (40 mM), and FeCl3 (20 mM) in an acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6). Next, 900 µL of FRAP reagent was allowed to react with 30 µL of plant extract for 30 min in a test tube. The tube was vortexed and placed in bain-marie to reach 37 °C. The standard calibration curve was obtained by using different concentrations of FeSO
