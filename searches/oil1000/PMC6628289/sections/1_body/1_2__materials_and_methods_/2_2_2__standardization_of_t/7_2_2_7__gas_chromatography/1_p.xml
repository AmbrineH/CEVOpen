<p class="p">Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC–FID) analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-MSQP-5050A and GC-17A equipped with a DB-1 fused silica column (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness), with an oven temperature of 50 °C rising to 260 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The total running time for a sample was about 82 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and 1 µL was injected into the column. Split ratio, ionization energy, scan time, and acquisition mass range were 1:33, 70 eV, 1 s, and 30–600 amu, respectively.
