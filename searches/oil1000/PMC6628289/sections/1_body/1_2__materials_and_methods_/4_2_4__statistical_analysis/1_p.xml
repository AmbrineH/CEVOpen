<p class="p">Normality of all quantitative variables for each of the groups was confirmed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive statistics, including the frequency and percentage, and measures of central tendency and dispersion, including the mean and standard deviation (SD), were also used to describe the study variable. Moreover, the results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey test for baseline quantitative variables. The paired t-test was also applied for comparison of quantitative data before and after the trial within the 3 groups, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for between-group analysis after intervention adjusted for baseline values.
