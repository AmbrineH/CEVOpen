<p class="p">Serum MDA levels were measured by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test with ±0.01 µMol/L sensitivity. Concentration of plasma MDA was determined with a spectrophotometric detector at 532 nm. A 1,1′,3,3′-tetramethoxypropane was used to construct the calibration curve as the standard [

In addition, serum SOD levels were measured by colorimetric method using an ELISA kit (RANDOX, Antrim, North Ireland UK) according to the manufacturers’ instruction. Sensitivity of the assay was ± 0.01 IU/mL (Cat. No. (SD) = 124; reference value: 164–240 IU/mL). Moreover, serum GPx levels were measured by UV method using the ELISA kit (RANDOX). Sensitivity of this assay was ± 1.15 IU/mL (Cat. No. RS 2318; reference value: 4171–10881 IU/mL). Furthermore, serum CAT levels were measured by immunoturbimetric assay using an ELISA commercial kit according to the manufacturers’ protocol (CUSABIO Kit, WUHAN HUAMEI BIOTECH Co., Ltd. Wuhan, China). Sensitivity of the assays was ± 3.9 pg/mL (Cat. No. CSB-E13635h; reference value: 19.8–66.4 pg/mL).
