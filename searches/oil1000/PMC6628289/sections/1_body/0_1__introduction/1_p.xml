<p class="p">Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as a leading cause of infertility with the incidence of 6â€“26% among women at child bearing age [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of PCOS as a heterogeneous endocrine disorder are anovulation, hyperandrogenism, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and dyslipidemia [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with oxidative stress (OS) and metabolic factors, for instance insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Oxidative stress can affect female fertility by influencing ovulation, fertilization, embryo development, and implantation [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as examples of OS play physiological roles in cellular signaling pathways at low concentrations, they may damage cellular functions in excess levels [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species are derived from molecular oxygen, and include oxygen ions, free radicals (chemical species with unpaired electrons), and peroxides [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Oxidative stress is dramatically increased in PCOS patients, when oxidant/antioxidant status is measured by circulating serum markers, including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, OS is also correlated with insulin resistance by impairing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that an excess level of OS results in impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, antioxidant treatment may ameliorate insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant patients [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. But whether high levels of OS in PCOS patients derive from PCOS or other potential complications still remains undetermined [
