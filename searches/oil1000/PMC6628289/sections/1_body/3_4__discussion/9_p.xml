<p class="p">The results of the present study pointed out the fact that herbal mixture could increase the serum levels of CAT, GPx, SOD, and reduce the MDA level. Likewise, CC along with herbal mixture could exert such effects. This result may contribute to the point that although CC could not alter serum level of the antioxidant, it did not interfere in the activity of herbal supplement. Although the FBS level did not reduce in the groups administered with CC and herbal mixture solely, their combination could decrease the FBS; this result might be ascribed to the synergistic effects of their combination. Further studies are needed to prove these findings.</p>
