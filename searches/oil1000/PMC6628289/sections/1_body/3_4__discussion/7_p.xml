<p class="p">In this study, regular menstrual cycle, ovulation, and pregnancy occurred in all three groups. The main cause of this syndrome is the reduction in the sensitivity of pre-antral follicles to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and enhancement of follicular activity to luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to the inhibition of follicle maturation [
