 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In several studies, the authors proved that cinnamon contained proanthocyanidins and phenolic compounds with antioxidant activities that not only neutralized free radicals, but also reduced blood glucose and insulin [

 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Moselhy et al. indicated a strong hepatoprotective effect of cinnamon ethanolic extract against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress by increasing the SOD and CAT levels and decreasing the MDA level, the possible mechanism of which could be attributed to the free radical scavenging activity of polyphenol compounds [
 <xref rid="B54-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. In a study examining the effect of ginger and onion (
 <italic class="italic">Allium cepa</italic>) on the levels of sexual hormones and OS, the reduction of MDA serum level was significant in the within-ginger group, but was not significant in comparison to the control group; this result was in line with ours [

A use of the combination of ginger and cinnamon in diabetic male rats in the study of Khaki et al. particularly illustrated an increase in the SOD, CAT, and GPx levels, while the MDA level more significantly decreased compared to other groups using only one herb [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In an animal study, Al-Amin et al. demonstrated that ginger could decrease the FBS level by the mechanism of serotonin receptors which activate pancreatic Î² cells to release insulin [
 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Additionally, Bayani et al. showed that phenolic phytochemicals of spearmint possessed hypoglycemic, and antioxidant attributes [
 <xref rid="B57-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Deep et al. also revealed that methanolic extract of spearmint was a more potent antioxidant than ascorbic acid, which is recognized as the standard antioxidant. Furthermore, the levels of SOD, GPx, and CAT were duplicated, while MDA level fell by half [
