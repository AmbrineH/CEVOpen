 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00215-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> showed the presence of zingiberene (13.58%), α-curcumene (10.77%), β-sesquiphellandrene (9.86%), α-farnesene (5.30%), and β-bisabolene (5.93%) with sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in ginger; cinnamic aldehyde (13.06%) with the organic compounds of aldehyde in cinnamon, and finally, pulegone (5.61%) with monoterpenes extracted from spearmint. A review of the literature indicated that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and monoterpenes could be effective in various biological activities such as antioxidant effects [

 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Zhan et al. extracted α-zingiberene (22.29%), β-sesquiphellandrene (8.58%), α-farnesene (3.93%), β-bisabolene (3.87%), α-curcumene (2.63%) with sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from ginger volatile oil, which had antioxidant potency [
 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In addition, it was shown in another study that the antioxidant effects of essential oils of cinnamon barks and ginger rhizomes could be ascribed to the presence of antioxidant constituents such as cinnamaldehyde, sesquiphellandrene, and zingiberene [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Using the GC–MS analysis, Telci et al. determined the main composition of spearmint as oxygenated monoterpenes including pulegone (26.71–29.56%) and piperitone (22.17–28.16%) as the major terpenoid group [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-09-00215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Significant difference in the percentage of oil compositions in comparison to that of our study might depend on variation in environmental factors as well as difference in ecologies.
