Furthermore, in previous studies, the effects of all aforementioned herbs were investigated separately, while we evaluated the effects of CC and herbal mixture as a new combination, which might have synergistic effects. Nonetheless, the relatively small sample size, short-term follow-up, single-blind design, and using a fixed dose of herbal mixture in the clinical study were the limitations of this study.</p>
