<p class="p">Our results also showed that after intervention, in groups 1, 2, and 3, 35%, 22.2%, and 35% had oligomenorrhea versus 65% (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.014), and 100% (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.46), and 25% in group 3 had amenorrhea versus 65% at the baseline (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005). However, after intervention, in group 2, 16.7% had amenorrhea versus 33.3% at the baseline; though the difference between the groups was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.083). Meanwhile, no side effects were reported in all three study groups during the 12 weeks of intervention.
