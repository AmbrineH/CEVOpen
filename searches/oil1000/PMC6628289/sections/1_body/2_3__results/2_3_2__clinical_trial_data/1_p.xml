<p class="p">In the present study, the initial sample consisted of 90 women with PCOS, from whom 11 were excluded because they did not meet the Rotterdam criteria, and 4 womenâ€™s husbands suffered from azoospermia. Then, 75 participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups including group 1: CC (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 25); and group 3: CC with herbal mixture (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 25). Twenty-two women out of 25 in group 1, 23 out of 25 in group 2, and 24 out of 25 in group 3 received allocated interventions. However, 3, 2, and 1 of them in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, did not feel comfortable enough to participate. During the follow-up stage, 2 participants in group 1 were lost to be followed up with because of consuming other medication along with treatment, 3 of them in group 2 discontinued intervention on account of deciding to get treated with intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), and 2 of them in group 3 did not take an initial blood test, while 2 of them wanted to be treated with IUI or IVF. Finally, 60 participants (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20 in each group) finalized the intervention and their blood samples were analyzed at the end of three months (
