<p class="p">Before intervention, there were no significant differences between groups in terms of serum levels of insulin (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.135) and HOMA-IR (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.188) except for FBS (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003). After intervention, however, with adjusting baseline values, significant differences were observed in terms of FBS (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003), insulin (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.029), and HOMA-IR (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.017) levels. In the binary comparison, a significant decrease was seen in serum levels of FBS (aMD = −8.7; CI 95%= −14.7 to 2.7, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002) in group 3, insulin (aMD = −5.6; CI 95% = −10.8 to −0.4, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.029) in group 2, and HOMA-IR (aMD = −1.3; CI 95% = −2.4 to −0.2, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013) in group 2 in comparison with group 1. Moreover, the binary comparison indicated no significant difference in the FBS level (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.212) in group 2, the insulin level (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.842) in group 3, and the HOMA-IR level (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.403) in group 3 compared to group 1. Furthermore, based on our results from the binary comparison between groups 2 and 3 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05), there was no significant difference in the FBS, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels.
