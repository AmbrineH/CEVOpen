The GC–MS and GC–FID analysis of the herbal powder essential oil indicated that the phytochemicals of the essential oil, including sesquiterpenes and derivatives (55.49%), aldehydes (19.38%), and monoterpenes (15.45%) were the main groups of oil components. Moreover, it was shown that zingiberene (13.58%), α-curcumene (10.77%), β-sesquiphellandrene (9.86%), α-farnesene (5.30%), and β-bisabolene (5.93%), isolated from ginger with sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, were the most abundant components in essential oil of herbal mixture powder. In the same way, cinnamic aldehyde (13.06%) was separated from cinnamon with the organic compounds of aldehyde, and pulegone (5.61%) was extracted from spearmint with monoterpene structure. No substance was extracted that could be related to
