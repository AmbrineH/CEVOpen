<p class="p">Herbal mixture showed potent antioxidant activity (RC50: 0.018 ± 0.0007 mg/mL) in comparison to quercetin (RC50: 0.004 ± 0.0001 mg/mL) as the positive control; this activity could be attributed to the presence of phenolic structures in the extract. The methanolic extract of herbal mixture had the ability to decrease TPRZ-Fe (III) to TPTZ-Fe (II), and FRAP values for methanolic extract of herbal mixture was 720 ± 35 µmol Fe (II)/g, which was lower than that of quercetin (2880 ± 41 µmol Fe (II)/g) as the standard antioxidant. In addition, the assessment of TPC and TFC contents proved the presence of 24.062 ± 0.2 mg gallic acid/100 mg and 8.93 ± 0.09 mg quercetin/100 mg in herbal mixture (
