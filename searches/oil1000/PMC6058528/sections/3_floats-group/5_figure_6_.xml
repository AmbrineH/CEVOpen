   <italic class="italic">*p ＜</italic> .05 indicated significant differences between the sample group and the control group, $P &lt; .05 indicated significant differences between the sample group and Blank EFEN group, &amp; P ＜.05 indicated significant differences between the sample group and EA; (e) stimulation; and (f) hemolytic evaluations of EFEN. Normal saline solution was used as the negative control in stimulation and hemolytic tests.
