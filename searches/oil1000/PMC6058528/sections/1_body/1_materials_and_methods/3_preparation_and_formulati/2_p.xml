<p class="p">EFEN was prepared using a water titration method at ambient temperature (Yehia etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The complex oil consisted of fructus bruceae oil and ethyl oleate (1:2, w:w). The oily phase (castor oil polyoxyethylene (35) ether (CPE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400) was titrated dropwise with distilled water under gentle magnetic stirring. The compositions of three phases at every transition point between clear and cloudy interfaces were recorded to construct ternary phase diagrams (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1(a)</xref>) by changing the mass ratios of CPE and PEG (1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1) and the mass ratios of the mixture of CPE and PEG to oily phase (from 9:1 to 1:9, gradually). The shaded area represents the fractional composition that is able to form emulsive nanosystems. The effects of principal components on size and solubility were investigated using the simplex lattice design method and the results were depicted using Origin Pro. 7.5 software (Origin Lab. Corp., Wellesley, MA).
