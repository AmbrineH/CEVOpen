<p class="p">Tumor cells were treated with free EA, Blank-NE, EEN, FEN, or EFEN for 24â€‰h. For cell-cycle arrest determination, cells were then harvested using trypsin, fixed with 75% ethanol, and stained using a solution of PI, RNase A, and Triton X-100. For apoptosis determination, cells were stained with a solution of PI and Annexin V-FITC. After treatment, cells were analyzed by a FACSCaliber flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular calcium ion levels were measured by staining with JC-1 and Fluo-3, respectively.</p>
