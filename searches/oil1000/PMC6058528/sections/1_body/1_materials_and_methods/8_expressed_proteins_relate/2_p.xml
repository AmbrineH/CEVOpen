<p class="p">The cyclin B, cell division cycle (CDC) 2, cyclin A, CDC 1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and Bax protein levels were determined by Western blotting. The tumor cells were treated with free EA, Blank-NE, EEN, FEN, or EFEN for 24 h. The proteins were analyzed using primary and secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-cyclin B, anti-cyclin A, anti-CDC2, and anti-CDC1; mouse anti-CDC2 and anti-CDC1; rabbit anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-9 and anti-Bcl-2; mouse anti-caspase-8, mouse anti-Bax, anti-rabbit HRP-IgG, and anti-mouse HRP-IgG, in 3% BSA) (Fang et al.,
