<p class="p">To investigate the cytotoxicity of free EA, Blank-NE, EEN, FEN, and EFEN in A549 cells, MTT assays were performed as described previously (Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). A549 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per well in 96-well plates. After incubation overnight for adherence, the previous medium was replaced with medium containing various concentrations of free EVO, BNE, or ENE. After 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h of incubation, the medium was removed and 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well. Cells were further incubated for 4 h, and the medium was replaced with 150 μL DMSO to solubilize the converted formazan. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a Sunrise microplate photometer (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). The treated cells were observed using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
