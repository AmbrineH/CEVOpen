<p class="p">The male rats were orally given EFEN or EA at the same 100 mg/kg dose. Venous blood samples were collected and separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min and analyzed by HPLC (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The relative bioavailability of EFEN was obtained by dividing the EFEN area under concentration-time (

 <sup class="sup">7</sup>) were injected subcutaneously into the left axilla of the nude mice. After 14 d, NFEN was injected subcutaneously into the area near the visible tumor and observed under a Maestro™ EX-RRO (CRI corp., USA).
