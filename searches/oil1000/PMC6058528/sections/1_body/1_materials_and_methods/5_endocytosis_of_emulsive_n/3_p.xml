<p class="p">Quantitative cellular uptake studies were performed at 37 °C and 4 °C. A549 cells in 6-well plates were treated with 15.7 μM NFEN, incubated at 37 °C or 4 °C for 4 h, and analyzed with a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Testing the effects of inhibitors on cellular uptake was performed as follows: 15.7 μM NFEN were added to A549 cells that were pretreated with 31.45 μM chlorpromazine or 200 μM genistein for 1 h. Cells were incubated for another 4 h, after which their fluorescence intensities were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
