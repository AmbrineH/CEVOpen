<p class="p">The uptake of emulsive nanosystems by A549 cells was investigated visually using a CLSM microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg Gmbh, Germany). The tumor cells were incubated in 24-well plates with sterile glass slides. Once the cells reached 80% confluency, medium containing different concentrations of Nile red-loaded emulsive nanosystems (NFEN) or Nile red-PBS solution (negative control) were added. At predetermined time points, the tumor cell nuclei were stained with 1.62 μM Hoechst 33342 and observed.</p>
