<p class="p">The EFEN was sphere-like in shape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1(d)</xref>). The size was uniform and determined to be 31.21 ± 0.91 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.20 ± 0.03 using a Zetasizer (Zeta, London, UK). The small droplet size and the spherical shape of nanocarriers suggested large oil/water interfaces, which have been reported to be essential for the interaction of droplets with cell membranes and likely result in efficient cellular trafficking of drugs (Sahay et al.,
