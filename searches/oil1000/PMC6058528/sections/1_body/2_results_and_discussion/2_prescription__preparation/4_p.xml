<p class="p">Most antitumor ingredients found in nature are poorly soluble. These active components include alkaloids, such as EA, capsaicin and quinine; terpenes, such as paclitaxel, tanshinone IIA and ginsenoside Rb1; acids, such as salvianolic acid B; and coumarins, such as dicoumarol (Fong etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). These poorly soluble substances are usually expected to have much better absorption and higher bioavailability. It is essential to develop delivery systems to effectively carry these poorly soluble drugs to targeted areas. In this paper, we report a novel woody oil-based emulsive nanosystem to effectively carry the alkaloid EA to tumor cells. This kind of nanosystem may also be useful to carry other poorly soluble natural drugs.
