<p class="p">Specific vegetable oils have also been used to formulate different kinds of carriers to deliver various antitumor drugs. For example, coix seed oil was used to form microemulsions to deliver etoposide and ginsenoside Rh2 for drug-resistant breast cancer treatment via oral administration (Qu etÂ al.,

In this study, fructus bruceae oil was used to form emulsive nanosystems to carry EA for more effective tumor cell uptake and enhanced bioavailability. Fructus bruceae oil played three roles: the first was as an oil phase, the second was as an antioxidant (also called a stabilizer, since this oil mainly contained polyunsaturated fatty acid), and the third was as an antitumor drug. The oil had two excipient-like properties to contribute to the formulation and one drug-like property that exerted synergistic antitumor effects.
