<p class="p">Compared with solid nanosystems, emulsive nanosystems have better fluidity, which makes it much easier to carry poorly soluble drugs to the targeted area. Compared to normal emulsive nanosystems, some specific vegetable oil-based emulsive nanosystems had an additional component: a woody oil such as fructus bruceae oil (Nie et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) or a gramineous seed oil such as coix seed oil. These specific vegetable oils can also serve as antitumor drugs and their function can be improved by advanced drug formulations. For example, fructus bruceae oil can be delivered via spongosome to treat A549 lung cancer cells (Zou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-ovarian cancer activity of fructus bruceae oil was enhanced by being loaded into luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor-targeted liposomes (Ye et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, coix seed oil can be carried by octanoyl galactose ester-modified intragastrical microemulsion for enhanced tumor targeting and hepatoma therapy (Qu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Fructus bruceae oil and coix seed oil loaded in an intravenous emulsion could be administered simultaneously for synergic antitumor application (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
