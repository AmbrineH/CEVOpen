<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, Nile red-loaded emulsive nanosystems (NFEN) entered tumor cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner within 12 h. Red fluorescence in the cytoplasm intensified with increase in incubation duration or in concentration. NFEN moved swiftly and randomly in the cytoplasm and tended to accumulate near the cell nuclei. The cellular uptake of Nile red-PBS solution (negative control) by tumor cells was too low to be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" class="xref">Figure 3(a)</xref>, the fluorescence intensity of NFEN at 37 °C significantly intensified over 4 h and was much higher than the intensity at 4 °C at the corresponding time point. Compared with the control, the fluorescence intensities of cells treated with genistein and chlorpromazine decreased to similar extents (22% versus 20%) (
