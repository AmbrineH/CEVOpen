<p class="p">The cellular uptake of EFEN by tumor cells was a dose-dependent and time-dependent process over 12 h. Furthermore, it was an energy-dependent process since much more EFEN was taken into cells at body temperature than at lower temperature. Pinocytosis refers to a process in which liquid droplets are ingested by living cells. Since it is in the fluid state, EFEN might be taken into tumor cells via pinocytosis. Chlorpromazine is a clathrin-mediated pathway inhibitor, while genistein is both caveolae-dependent and clathrin-independent pathway inhibitor. Chlorpromazine and genistein were separately applied to investigate the transport proteins involved in the endocytosis procedure. The decreased uptaken amount of tumor cells after adding two inhibitors suggested that NFEN was trafficked through three pinocytosis pathways: clathrin-mediated, caveolae-dependent, and clathrin-independent pathways. This is consistent with previous reports that microbubbles induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fluid-phase uptake through distinct mechanisms (Fekri et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, octanoyl galactose ester-modified microemulsion systems containing coix seed components were reported to improve accumulation in tumors through asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis (Qu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
