<p class="p">Cellular trafficking (or endocytosis) of nanomedicines was closely related not only to its components, shape, structure and physico-chemical characteristics but also to the cell types (Sahay et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this paper, A549 cells were selected as a model cell line to study the endocytosis of EFEN for multiple reasons. First, EA had no biological activity in A549 cells in our preliminary experiments (data not show), and application of this effective, systemic and specific (seemingly only cytotoxic to cancer cells) anti-tumor agent on A549 cells was an attempt to finally offer evidence for its clinical utilization in the treatment of NSCLC, a leading devastating life-killer (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Second, A549 cells, a human alveolar epithelial cell line, can be used to mimic the adsorption of lung cancer drug delivery nanosystems 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, which is an appealing area of study for nanomedicine (Ikari et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, understanding endocytosis in nanomedicine delivery is essential for the development of lung cancer drug delivery nanosystems that target transport proteins.
