<p class="p">Both qualitative and quantitative cellular uptake studies proved that incorporating EA into emulsive nanosystems improved its cellular uptake. The analyses showed that EFEN (∼337 μg/mL) had a higher solubility than EA (∼3 μg/mL), which made it more likely to enter the cells. EFEN also had a small diameter (∼30 nm), which made it more likely to attach to and enter the cells (Edelman et al.,

In addition, EFEN had a lower negative zeta potential (∼−1 mV), which caused it to experience less repulsion force from the negatively charged cell membrane. It has been reported that nanosystems are sometimes designed as cationic formulations in order to decrease repulsion (Liu et al.,
