<p class="p">The anti-tumor activity of EFEN was mediated by the inhibition of cell viability, the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the protein level. EFEN might induce apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent pathways. Our findings suggested that EFEN treatment up-regulated CDC2/cyclin B levels and further induced G2/M arrest and that EFEN induced apoptosis by up-regulating Bcl-2/Bax ration and activating caspase-3, -8 and -9. Thus, EFEN induced apoptosis through diverse caspase-dependent pathways (Park etÂ al.,

For example, pan-caspase inhibitors can be employed to block the caspase-dependent pathway, or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor into nucleus can be studied for a direct investigation of caspase-independent pathways.
