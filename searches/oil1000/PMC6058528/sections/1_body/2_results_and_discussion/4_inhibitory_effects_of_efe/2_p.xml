<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004" class="xref">Figure 4(a,b)</xref>, EFEN exhibited inhibitory effects in a time-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of EFEN were 6.79 μM, 1.95 μM, and 1.55 μM for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. Moreover, EFEN also exhibited inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner. The rates of suppression of tumor cells treated with EFEN for 24 h increased from 33% to 63% when EA concentrations increased from 2.5 μM to 20 μM.
