<p class="p">The molecular basis for anti-tumor activities exerted by EA in A549 cells was explored. A G2/M phase blockage and apoptosis induction occurred in tumor cells treated with EFEN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005" class="xref">Figure 5(a,b)</xref>). After 24 h incubation with 2 μM EFEN, the proportion of cells arrested in G2/M was 30.87 ± 1.96% compared with 10.23 ± 2.84% after treatment with free EA. The apoptosis rate was 17.97 ± 2.35% compared with 8.81 ± 1.16% by free EA. Compared with free EA treatment, EFEN resulted in lower mitochondrial membrane potential and higher intracellular calcium ion concentration. The morphologies of tumor cells treated with 2 μM EFEN were observed by AO/EB double staining (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). After treatment with EFEN, tumor cells in early apoptosis showed concentrated green, which indicated chromatin condensation; cells in late apoptosis showed discrete orange, which indicated the presence of apoptosis bodies; and cells undergoing necrosis showed concentrated orange dye. After treatment with EFEN, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increased, and this was followed by a decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential of tumor cells (
