<p class="p">Most bioactive ingredients from nature have low-solubility. To achieve better absorption and higher bioavailability, we first formulated the woody oil-based emulsive nanosystem using fructus bruceae oil to deliver the antitumor agent evodiamine (EFEN). In addition to the role of synergistic antitumor drug, fructus bruceae oil played two additional roles as the oily phase and emulsion stabilizer in EFEN. EFEN exhibited superior anti-tumor activities in NSCLC A549 cells when compared with free EA, a blank nanoemulsion, an EA-loaded emulsive nanosystem, and a fructus bruceae oil-loaded emulsive nanosystem. These effects were mediated by the inhibition of cell viability, the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the protein level. The increased sensitivity of EFEN may be related to the enhanced cellular uptake of EFEN via multiple pathways, as well as the favorable increases in bioavailability and drug persistence in the tumor area. For the first time, increased sensitivity of lung cancer cells to poorly soluble natural alkaloids was able to be achieved by delivering drugs with woody oil-based emulsive nanosystems. EFEN has potential as an effective anti-tumor treatment. Woody oil-based emulsive nanosystems may deliver poorly soluble natural alkaloids efficiently.</p>
