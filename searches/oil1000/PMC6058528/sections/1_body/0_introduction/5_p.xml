<p class="p">In recent years, emulsive nanosystems have been utilized to enhance the bioactivities of pharmaceuticals, supplements, and nutraceuticals (Aboalnaja et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In particular, specific vegetable oil-based emulsive nanosystems have played wide roles in antimicrobial therapy (Franklyne et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and occasionally been used to enhance cytotoxicity in tumor cells (Desai et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). These specific vegetable oils, such as pine-nut oil (a woody plant seed oil) and tea tree oil (a woody plant leaf oil, also an essential oil), were used not only as an oil phase but also for their antioxidant activity, which increases the stability of the formulation since they have high concentrations of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition to serving as an oil phase and stabilizing agent, woody oils such as fructus bruceae oil (a woody plant seed oil) have a third function: supplying synergistic anti-tumor effects. Based on effectiveness and safety assessments of the addition of traditional Chinese medicines to chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments for cancers, some specific vegetable oils are promising for clinical applications (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
