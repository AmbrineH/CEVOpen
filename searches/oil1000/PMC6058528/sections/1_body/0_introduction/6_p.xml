<p class="p">In this study, an woody oil emulsive nanosystem carrying a poorly soluble natural alkaloid (EA carried by fructus bruceae oil-based emulsive nanosystems, or EFEN) was fabricated and evaluated. The properties of EFEN were compared with free EA, a blank nanoemulsion (BNE), an EA-loaded emulsive nanosystem (EEN), and a fructus bruceae oil-loaded emulsive nanosystem (FEN). Our study showed that EFEN exhibited anti-tumor activities in NSCLC A549 cells while free EA did not. Moreover, the anti-tumor activity of EA was mediated by the inhibition of cell viability, the induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, among other effects. The increase in sensitivity may be related to enhanced uptake of EFEN by tumor cells. The pharmacokinetic behavior of EFEN was also different. For the first time, this suggested that increases in the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to poorly soluble natural alkaloids can be achieved by using woody oil-based emulsive nanosystems to delivering drugs. EFEN has the potential to be an effective, systemic anti-tumor treatment. This study shows that essential oil-based emulsive nanosystems can deliver natural alkaloids efficiently.</p>
