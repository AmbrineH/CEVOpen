<p class="p">Each alkaloid has a certain anticancer spectrum. To date, most efforts have focused on improving the known anticancer activities of alkaloids, and little research has attempted to broaden the anticancer spectrum of any alkaloid. Our team presented the first report that EA exhibits obvious cytotoxic effects on small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells (Fang etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, EA showed low toxicity towards normal human peripheral blood cells but was cytotoxic to cancer cells, and it had no effect on body weight, in contrast to the serious weight loss caused by the clinically drug cisplatin (Tan &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
