<p class="p">Among all cancers, lung cancer not only has the highest death rate but also has a low 5-year survival rate (＜15%). Standard chemotherapy treatment produces a clinical response but is far from satisfactory. Extensive research has focused on either improving the efficiency of current anti-cancer agents or discovering new chemical entities in nature. Considering that over 85% of lung cancers belong to the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) family, the effects of EA on NSCLC cells were further investigated. However, our preliminary study indicated that A549 cells were not sensitive to 20 μM EA over 72 h (EA was prepared as a suspension due to its very low solubility) (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). In light of recent reports that nanotechnology can increase the antitumor efficiency of drugs on chemo-resistant cells (which might be regarded as insensitive cells to some extent) (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), we speculated that nanotechnology may improve the sensitivity of lung NSCLC A549 cells to EA carried by suitable nanocarriers.
