<p class="p">The IR absorption bands of the P-EO sample are shown in the IR spectrum from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c. The peak at 3082 is attributed to aromatic C-H bonds. According to N. Kasiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], the peaks at 3000–2850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are the result of C-H stretching. The band at 2970 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is due to asymmetric CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> stretching, while the band at 2926 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is allocated to asymmetric CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> stretching [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The wavenumbers from 1057, 1108, and 1243 cm

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are caused by vibrations of the C-H bonds in the peppermint structure [

Finally, it should be noted that the absorption bands at 917, 1283, 2430, 3320, 3487, 3561, and 3581 that distinguish the formation of octacalcium phosphate are not observed in the HAp and HAp-P spectra, and certify the HAp stoichiometry (Ca/P ratio = 1.67). In conformity with previous studies presented by J. Allene et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] and T. Heinze [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], compounds with high flexion due to the (Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+)</sup> group can interact with the (-OH) of the polymers chains. Therefore, compounds such as hydroxyapatite can interact with the (-OH) from the essential oil structure.
