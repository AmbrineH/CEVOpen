<p class="p">The influence of the P-EO and HAp-P on the microbial membrane of the tested microorganism was investigated by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). DiBAC4(3) is a green fluorescent dye and also a potential membrane reporter due to the fact that accumulates inside depolarized microbial cells cause an increase of green fluorescence. The flow cytometry studies determined the percentage of depolarized microbial cells, and the results of the flow cytometric tests presented in
