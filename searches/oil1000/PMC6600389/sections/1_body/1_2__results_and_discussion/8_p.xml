<p class="p">The results of the qualitative antimicrobial properties of P-EO and HAp-P are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02169-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The results of the antimicrobial qualitative assays revealed that the peppermint had a significant inhibition effect on the microbial growth of the tested microorganisms, with zone inhibition diameters ranging from 6 to 22 mm. The solvent, DMSO, did not affect the growth on solid media of any of the tested microbial strains. Moreover, HAp had no inhibitory effect on the growth of the tested microorganisms. The most pronounced inhibitory effect was observed in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> tested strains (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> C5). The diameter of the inhibition growth zone were 22 and 20 mm in the case of P-EO samples. The HAp-P samples produced a smaller inhibition zone on the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains, 8 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 7 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> C5. A notable inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> bacterial strains has also been observed. The inhibition zone of the HAp-P sample for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 was 10 mm, while for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 was 7 mm.
