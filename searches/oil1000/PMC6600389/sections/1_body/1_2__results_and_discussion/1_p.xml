<p class="p">The P-EOs obtained from dried 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> plants were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by GC–MS. The results represented 97.37% of the essential oil, and the primarily chemical compounds that were identified were menthol (35.21%), menthone (21.56%), menthyl acetate (6.90%), piperitone (5.60%), limonene (5.40%), and 1,8-cineole (5.30%). The results also highlighted the presence of germacrene-D (3.10%), myrcene (2.80%), neo-menthol (2%), menthofuran (1.50%), and β-pinene (1.050%). Other compounds specific to P-EOs such as 3-octanol, linalool, α-thujene, α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, α-terpinene, α-terpinolene, mentholacetate, pulegone, iso-pulegol, neosiomenthol, terpinene-4-ol, α-terpinoel, cis-β-ocimene, cis-sabinene-hydrate, and p-cymene were also identified in concentrations lower than 1%. These results are in good agreement with the results obtained by Iscan et al. [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and Mahboubi and Kazempour [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], who also reported menthol and menthone being the principal constituents in the P-EOs investigated in their studies. The data obtained by GC studies emphasized that the most abundant chemical constituents of the P-EOs investigated in our study were monoterpenes. The chemical composition of essential oils is always important, and has a high involvement in the antimicrobial properties of EOs.
