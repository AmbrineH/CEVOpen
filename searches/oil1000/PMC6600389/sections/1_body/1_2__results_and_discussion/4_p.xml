<p class="p">The morphology of the samples were investigated by SEM. The granular structure of the HAp and HAp-P samples is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. It can be observed that the HAp nanoparticle agglomerates having ellipsoidal shapes. The SEM image of the HAp-P sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b) indicates that the morphology of the HAp nanoparticles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a) did not exhibit any significant changes, and their nanometric size and ellipsoidal shape were maintained after the adsorption of the P-EO on the HAp nanoparticles. Furthermore, a size distribution was obtained for the HAp (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02169-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d) samples. The size distribution was done using particles from four areas of 2.5 × 2.5 µm in each SEM image. The results of the particle size distributions revealed that the size of the HAp nanoparticles were approximately 19.56 ± 3 nm and the size of the HAp-P approximately 21.10 ± 5 nm. The SEM studies emphasized that the adsorption of P-EO on the surface of HAp had a small effect on the size of the particles, and had no effect on their ellipsoidal shape.
