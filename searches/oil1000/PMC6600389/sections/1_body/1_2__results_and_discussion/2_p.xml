<p class="p">Morphological and structural studies were carried out by SEM, XRD, and FTIR, the HAp and HAp-P powders were obtained by centrifuging the solutions. The resulting precipitation after centrifugation was dried at 30 °C in an oven. Phase identification of the HAp powders was conducted by XRD analysis.
