<p class="p">Essential oil extracted from peppermint contains effective active constituents that are responsible for eliminating bacterial pathogens. P-EO and HAp-P showed significant antimicrobial activity because compounds such as the menthol and menthone present in these samples acted on the cell membrane, causing substantial morphological damage and leading to destabilization of the microbial membrane [

Deans and Baratta [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], in previous studies on the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of some essential oils, reported similar results regarding the biological activity of P-EO against pathogenic bacteria. Valsaraj et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] showed that essential oil extracted from peppermint leaves shows antibacterial activity only in ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, colloform, menthol, and aqueous extracts. On the other hand, antibacterial activity is dependent both on the dose and on the part of the plant (root, stem, leaves) from which the essential oil [
