<p class="p">The investigation of the antimicrobial properties of P-EO and HAp-P was carried out using 96 well plates with two-fold dilutions. The values for the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) an minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) obtained for DMSO, HAp, P-EO, and HAp-P are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02169-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The MIC values of the P-EO obtained against the tested microorganisms ranged from 15.62 to 62.5 µL/mL. The most sensitive microorganism to the tested samples was 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019 (MIC value 15.62 µL/mL). The results obtained from the measurements of MIC and MBC indicated that HAp-P exhibited a good antibacterial activity against tested bacteria, and the tenderness was as follows: 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecium</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> &gt; MRSA. The data suggest that the DMSO solvent did not affect bacterial growth.
