<p class="p">Our research presented in this study focused on materials in the form of solutions that could be used in various medical applications. In the process of covering some implants, solutions might be more effective. On the other hand, solutions could offer a wider range of applicability in the pharmaceutical, medical, chemical, and even food industries. Moreover, these solutions may, in combination with other solutions, help to reduce the spread of diseases and, implicitly, improve the health of populations in all types of scenarios.</p>
