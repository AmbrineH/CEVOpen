 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], we have analyzed the changes induced by the adsorption of lavender and basil essential oils on the physico-chemical and morphological properties of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. These studies indicated a better adsorption of the lavender essential oil on the surface of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, and antibacterial tests proved their better antibacterial activity against
