 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species are the most widely used medicinal herbs due to their chemical constituents, menthol and menthone. Usually, peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>) essential oils are used as remedies in coughs, colds, mouth sinuses, pain relief, and headaches, as well as being used for skin problems, digestive affections, and as a muscle relaxant, and so on [

According to previous studies, P-EOs are mainly composed of menthol in the range of 29%–48%, with menthone in concentrations varying from 20% to 31%, menthofuran with concentrations around 6.8%, and menthyl acetate in concentrations from 3% to 10% [

Even though there are several papers reporting the chemical composition of P-EOs, the chemistry of essential oils is very complex and varies significantly. The relative concentrations of chemical constituents vary depending on the climate, geographic location, time of the harvesting, drying conditions, extraction method, and so on [
