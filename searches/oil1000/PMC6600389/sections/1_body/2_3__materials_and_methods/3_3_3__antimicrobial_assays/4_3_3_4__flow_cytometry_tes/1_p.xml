<p class="p">Studies regarding the effect of the P-EO and HAp-P samples against the microbial membrane were conducted by flow cytometry using a sensitive fluorescent dye, DiBAC4(3). The microbial strains were cultivated in the presence of the tested samples for 24 h at 37 °C. After 24 h, 0.5 μg/mL of DiBAC4(3) (Invitrogen/Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to stain the microbial strains. The positive control was represented by an untreated microbial cell suspension. After 30 min of incubation with the DiBAC4(3), the intensity of fluorescence (IF) was measured using an Accuri C6 plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Biosciences, (San Jose, CA, USA)) in channel of fluorescence fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (filters 530/30 nm).</p>
