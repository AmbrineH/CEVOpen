<p class="p">The antimicrobial properties of P-EO and HAp-P were investigated using the broth micro-dilution assay. Serial two-fold dilutions of the samples solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were done in 96 well plates in MHB (Muller Hinton Broth). Furthermore, microbial suspensions with a density of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were also prepared from 24 h solid cultures. The microbial suspensions were then inoculated on each microtiter well containing the two-fold dilutions of P-EO and HAp-P. A sterility control was added with 100 μL of MHB and the antimicrobial properties of the DMSO were also tested. The experiments were done in triplicate. The wells were incubated for 18–24 h in aerobic conditions, at 37 °C. After incubation, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined using the conventional plating method.
