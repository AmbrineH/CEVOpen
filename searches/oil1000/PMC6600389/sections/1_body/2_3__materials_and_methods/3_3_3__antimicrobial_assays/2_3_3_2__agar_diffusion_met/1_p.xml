Microbial suspension corresponding to 0.5 McFarland, obtained from 18–24 h cultures of the tested microorganism, were inoculated on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates. Furthermore, the P-EO and HAp-P were deposited on the agar surface and incubated at 37 °C in aerobic conditions for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the diameters of the inhibition growth zones were measured.
