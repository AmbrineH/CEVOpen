<p class="p">Analysis of the molecular spectral features of P-EO, Hap, and HAp-P samples was performed by FTIR measurements using a PerkinElmer spectrometer (Waltham, MS, USA) SP-100 with a 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> resolution. The transmission IR spectra were acquired using an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory and were converted into absorption spectra using SPECTRUM software (Version 6.4.1 PerkinElmer, Waltham, MS, USA) following the A = log (1/T) formula. The spectra were then normalized from 0 to 1 [
