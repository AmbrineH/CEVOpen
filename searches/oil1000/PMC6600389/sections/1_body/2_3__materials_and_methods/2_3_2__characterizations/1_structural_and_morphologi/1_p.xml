<p class="p">The chemical composition of the P-EO samples was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a Perkin Elmer gas chromatographer (PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA, USA). The working conditions were as previously described in Predoi et al. [
