<p class="p">The surface morphology of the HAp, and HAp-P samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a HITACHI S4500 microscope. The HAp and HAp-P nanoparticles were carefully placed on the holder using a conductive carbon tape with double adhesion. The SEM images of the samples were acquired with a 5 kV electron acceleration voltage and an Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD).</p>
