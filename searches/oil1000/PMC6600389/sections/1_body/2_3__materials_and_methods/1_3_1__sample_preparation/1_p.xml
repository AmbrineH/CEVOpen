<p class="p">The essential oil (EO) used in this study was P-EO. The peppermint plants (
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>) were harvested just before their full bloom, during summer (second week of July 2017), from an independent farm situated in southeast Romania. After being harvested, the peppermint plants were dried at room temperature, packed in paper bags, and stored in a cool and dry place. The P-EO was obtained by hydrodistillation from dried plants.
