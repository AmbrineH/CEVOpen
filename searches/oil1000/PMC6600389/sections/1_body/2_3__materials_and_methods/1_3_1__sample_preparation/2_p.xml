 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-02169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The P-EO was added to the final HAp solution and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The final product, HAp-P, was analyzed by different techniques. An antimicrobial activity evaluation of the solutions was also conducted.
