<p class="p">This is the first study developed on hydroxyapatite coated with peppermint essential oil. The GS-MS studies revealed that the main chemical constituents of the P-EOs were menthol and menthone. The molecular spectral features and morphology of the P-EO, HAp and HAp-P, were investigated. Moreover, this study presents for the first time the physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of HAp-P. FTIR studies have highlighted a high degree of absorption of P-EO in the HAp structure that were revealed by measured values of the P-EO IR absorption bands in the HAp-P spectrum. Furthermore, morphological studies have shown that HAp-P nanoparticles conserve the form of HAp nanoparticles. The results obtained from the MIC and MBC measurements showed that P-EO possessed a good antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, MIC and MBC measurements indicated that the antimicrobial activity of HAp-P increased significantly from that of HAp following the adsorption of P-EO at the surface of HAp nanoparticles. The results of the present study are valuable for further investigations aimed at finding alternative solutions that could lead to a decrease in postoperative infections following implants.</p>
