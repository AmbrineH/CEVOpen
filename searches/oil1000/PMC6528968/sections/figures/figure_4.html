 <p> Three-dimensional reconstruction of lipids, proteins and their simultaneous distribution in adipocytes fixed at days 5 of the differentiation process. a) three-dimensional Z stack (13 frames, 1 Î¼m/step) reconstruction of SRS images at 2,845 cm-1; b) three-dimensional reconstruction of SRS images at 2,940 cm-1; c) three-dimensional reconstruction of simultaneous lipids and proteins distribution. All the images are acquired with a 2.5x optical zoom. </p>
