  <p class="p">a) Representative confocal microscopy images of 3T3-L1 cells Undifferentiated or differentiated with cultured adipogenic media, fixed at day 5, day 10 and day 15 of the differentiation process, fixed and labeled with LipidTox Red (red), Oil Red O (red) or BODIPY 493/503 (green) fluorescent dyes. Cell nuclei were labelled with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 10 μm. b) Quantification of LDs size (as area ranges, μm

   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216811.s006" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). c) Western blotting with anti-PPARγ and anti-FABP4 antibodies (as indicated) of total cell lysate (20 μg/lane) from 3T3-L1 cells treated as in (a). Actin is shown for the internal protein levels. Molecular weight standards (kDa) are indicated on the right of each panel. Of note, PPARγ is separated on 10% SDS-PAGE while FABP4 is separated on 15% SDS-PAGE (
