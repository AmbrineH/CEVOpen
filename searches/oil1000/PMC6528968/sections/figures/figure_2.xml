  <p class="p">a) Representative transmission microscopy images (first column) and SRS microscopy images acquired at 2,845 cm
   <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (second column) of adipocyte cells, fixed at day 5, day 10 and day 15 of the differentiation process. Merged images are reported in the last. All scale bars are 5 μm. b) Quantification of LDs size (as area ranges, μm
