 <p> Subcellular localization of lipid droplets in adipocyte cells by SRS imaging. a) Representative transmission microscopy images (first column) and SRS microscopy images acquired at 2,845 cm -1 (second column) of adipocyte cells, fixed at day 5, day 10 and day 15 of the differentiation process. Merged images are reported in the last. All scale bars are 5 μm. b) Quantification of LDs size (as area ranges, μm 2) in adipocytes at day 5, day 10 and day 15 of the differentiation process (as indicated); experimental data are reported in S2 File. c) Quantification of major and minor axis (μm) of the fitted ellipsis in which LDs are arranged in adypocytes fixed at day 5, day 10 and day 15 of the differentiation process (as indicated); experimental data are reported in S3 File. </p>
