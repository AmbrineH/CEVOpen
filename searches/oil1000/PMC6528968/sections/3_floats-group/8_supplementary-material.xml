Dotted lines are obtained considering an initially unchirped (transform-limited) Gaussian pulse with a pulses duration of 140 fs and 200 fs. After propagating through dispersive materials, pulses are chirped giving a broadenig of the spectral bandwidth. Continuous lines are obtained considering the Ti:Sa and OPO cross correlation reported in
