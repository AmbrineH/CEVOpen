  <p class="p">SRS unprocessed images of 3T3-L1 cell at day 5 of the differentiation process acquired at (a) 2,850, and (b) 2,940 cm 
   <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The intensity profiles along the dashed lines are shown for each SRS image. Intensity profiles across the same (c) horizontal and (d) vertical dashed lines in both 2,845 cm 
   <sup class="sup">-1</sup> acquired images reported in (a) and the same lines plotted in the retrieved proteins signal showed in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref> and obtained by subtracting the CH 
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the CH 
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> image. Note the good complementarity in profiles of the two components in correspondence of LDs and their border and in the cytoplasm, thus protein and lipid are clearly distinguished with this linear combination calculation.
