<p class="p">3T3-L1 cells (American Type Cell Culture, ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in 8% CO

Differentiation to adipocytes was induced 2 days post 80% confluence by incubating the cells in the growth medium supplemented with 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma), 1 μM Dexamethasone (Sigma) and 1 μg/mL insulin (Sigma) for 60 h, and then maintained in the same medium without IBMX and dexamethasone [

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. This medium was replaced every 2 days. Cells were used at different time points (0, 5, 10, 15 days) during the differentiation process from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. At each time point the cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (supplemented with 50 mM NH
