<p class="p">Lipid droplets were stained with 10 μg/mL of BODIPY 493/503 or with HCS LipidTox Deep Red neutral lipid stain (1:125 dilution) or with Oil Red-O (1% Oil Red-O stock solution diluted 3:2 with water) for 30 min at room temperature. Following neutral lipid staining, cells were extensively washed with PBS and the stained lipid droplets were visualized and acquired using a Zeiss LSM700 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 63× oil-immersion objective (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258.</p>
