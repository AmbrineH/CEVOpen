<p class="p">Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate PPARγ and FABP4 protein expression levels in undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Briefly, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded onto six-well plates and induced to differentiate into adipocytes at the indicate time points. The cells were then collected and resuspended in lysis buffer [25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 10 mM NaF, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol] supplemented with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (30 min, 4°C, shaking). The lysates were centrifuged (13,000× g, 10 min, 4°C), with the supernatants assayed for protein concentration (Bradford assay) and immediately used. Thirty micrograms of proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS-T [0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5] followed by incubation with primary antibodies against PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology: sc7196, 1:500) and FABP4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology: sc271529, 1:1,000) and then with secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively). β-actin is used as internal protein levels.
