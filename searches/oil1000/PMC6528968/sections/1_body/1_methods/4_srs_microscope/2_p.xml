<p class="p">In our microscope system, two-dimensional (2D) imaging is realized through beam scanning with 2D galvo mirrors by a sequential collection of pixels, which are acquired and quantized in intensity by a data acquisition chain. A 2D image is obtained through the synchronization of the whole system (i.e. the forward detection unit with the microscope scanning unit). The synchronization is achieved by managing: (i) the PCI card (NI PCIe 6363) through an in-house LabVIEW program; (ii) the electrical signal detected by LIA; and, (iii) the digital signals provided by the microscope scanning unit controller. All images were analysed with ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and three dimensional images were realized by the plugin “3D Volume Viewer”.</p>
