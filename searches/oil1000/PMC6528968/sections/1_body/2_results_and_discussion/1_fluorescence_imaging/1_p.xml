<p class="p">Adipocytes are readily identified by the accumulation of LDs through the differentiation processes. The differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cellular system is commonly used in studies on adipogenesis and on LDs biogenesis. The most frequently used pro-differentiative agents are insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) at concentrations of 10 μg/mL, 1 μM, and 0.5 mM, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Approximately 5 days after addition of these agents to 3T3-L1 cells in culture, these started accumulating lipids into LDs that grew in size over cultivation time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). We first visualised this differentiation process by immunofluorescence under confocal microscopy, using fluorescent lipophilic dyes, which partition into the nonpolar LDs core and are widely used as markers for the detection of LDs [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Here, we tested the most commonly used lipophilic dyes LipidTox Red, Oil Red O and BODIPY 493/503 to image the LDs at 5, 10 and 15 days of the differentiation process and, for comparison, we observed also the undifferentiating control cells (

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Even though the three fluorescent dyes employed have been widely developed to visualize the intracellular lipid stores by confocal microscopy, each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, LipidTox Red gives a good fluorescent signal of LD membranes and, although it bleaches faster, has a better staining efficiency than Oil Red O. By contrast, the green fluorescence of BODIPY 493/503 is moderately specific for LDs and the fluorescent signal generally appears less intense than that of Oil Red O [
