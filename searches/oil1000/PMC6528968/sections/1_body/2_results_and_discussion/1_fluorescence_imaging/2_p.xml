<p class="p">In order to correlate the adipogenic differentiation to the immunofluorescence imaging, we examined the protein expression profile of two master regulators of the differentiation processes and metabolism: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). Both PPARγ and FABP4 expression levels increased from day 5 to day 15 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>), and this correlated with the temporal formation and maturation of LDs in cells with culture adipogenic media, as detected by confocal microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). Of note, the expression levels of PPARγ and FABP4 were almost undetectable in undifferentiated conditions (
