<p class="p">Moreover, when fs pulses are used, since the loss in spectral selectivity of SRS signal is not prejudicial in lipids imaging in the broad spectral range of CH bond vibrations [

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> can be mainly attributed to the lipids. On the contrary, the chemical specificity of SRS images at 2,940 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is not particularly efficient. Indeed, since both lipids and proteins have significant Raman signals and their Raman bands are partially overlapped, SRS images acquired at 2,940 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> contain both lipids and proteins signals. To distinguish lipids and proteins content, since for these biological samples the calibration of individual components is not available, we subtract the CH
