<p class="p">Currently, our implemented SRS microscope allows to probe a single Raman band at a time. Different Raman bands, corresponding to different chemical components of the sample, can be imaged by tuning the frequency either of the pump or the Stokes beams in sequential scans, allowing the detection of one chemical contrast for each scanning. Thus, CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (2,845 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (2,940 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) stretching signals can be collected at one Raman shift at a time, leading in principle to map the distributions of the lipid and protein contents on the same field of the sample. We note that in our experimental set up, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Ti:Sa and OPO cross correlation, measured by an auto/cross correlator (pulseCheck A.P.E.) before the microscope, was of 253 fs (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216811.s009" class="xref">S4</xref> File). This corresponds to an experimental spectral bandwidth, given by the FWHM of cross correlation in the frequency domain [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], of 61 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. As a consequence, when we tune the lasers beams to excite the 2,845 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> band, actually we excite the range (FWHM) 2,818â€“2,879 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; similarly, when we tune the lasers beams to 2,940 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, we are exciting from 2,908 to 2,970 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (FWHM) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216811.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, due to the propagation inside the scan head and microscope objective, a significant further chirping of laser pulses and, as a consequence, an improvement of spectral resolution are both expected at the sample. Definitely being our experimental spectral resolution (about 60 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) less than the linewidth of the Raman band of lipids and proteins (100 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), we can conclude that our experimental set up can be suitable for imaging applications that probe for molecular specificity such as lipids, proteins in C-H region.
