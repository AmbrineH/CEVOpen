<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>, a high number of small LDs (&lt;5μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and only few medium (5–15μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) LDs were detected in the day 5 sample, while in day 10 and day 15 samples, a decrease in the number of small (&lt;5μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) LDs and a parallel increase in the number of medium (5–15μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and large (&gt;15μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) LDs were measured. Results obtained are in agreement with the growing trend found by standard fluorescence analysis reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216811.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>. Moreover, since results obtained with BODIPY 493/503 fluorescent dye are those that best match the corresponding statistical analysis performed on SRS images in a label free approach, we can conclude that BODIPY 493/503 seems to have a lower influence on the maturation of LDs. This is not a surprise, indeed several reports showed and discussed the artifactual effects on LD morphology upon fixation and staining with Oil Red O dye [
