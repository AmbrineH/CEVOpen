<p class="p">To overcome the above mentioned limitations of fluorescence imaging, we applied a non-invasive, non-destructive and label-free microscopy platform which could determine intermediate cell states by utilising chemically-specific vibration imaging based on SRS. In SRS, the sample is excited by two collinear laser beams (pump and Raman signal) at different frequencies. If the difference in frequencies is identical to a molecular vibration of the sample, a coherent excitation of molecular bond vibration modes occurs and a significant increase of the Raman signal is obtained. In this case, Raman signal, differently from linear Raman scattering, is a coherent radiation characterized by nonlinear dependence on the incoming light fields, that allows vibrational contrast mechanism for fast imaging with high spectral and spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio [
