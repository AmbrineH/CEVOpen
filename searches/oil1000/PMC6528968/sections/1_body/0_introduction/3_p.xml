 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], which are, however, only applicable to fixed samples and subject to variability depending on the experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, these fluorescent dyes are often nonspecific and interfere with the lipid-mediated biological processes introducing imaging artifacts in cell recordings (e.g., may cause changes in LDs fusion behaviour) [

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Moreover, fixation methods can dramatically impact on LDs morphology and on the detection of some LD-associated proteins after cell permeabilization. For long-term imaging, photobleaching events reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and consequently the quality of the images and quantitative data analysis. Indeed, more appropriate controls are required to discriminate false positive fluorescence signals. Thus, optical label-free imaging techniques need to be developed to overcome the limitation of the current methods for imaging of lipids, lipid-protein complexes and lipids cellular mobilization [
