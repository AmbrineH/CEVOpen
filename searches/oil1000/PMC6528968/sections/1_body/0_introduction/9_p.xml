<p class="p">In this study, we applied SRS microscopy to image the distributions of LDs in 3T3-L1 cells at different stages of adipocyte differentiation, in absence of exogenous labels. An increase in the number of large (&gt;15Î¼m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) lipid droplets and, assuming an elliptical arrangement of LDs around the cell nucleus, an increase of their major and minor axes lengths are demonstrated in human adipocyte cells during differentiation process. In addition, exploiting the laser pulses chirping due to their propagation and interaction with the optical elements of our set up (see SRS imaging paragraphs), the simultaneous visualization and spatial mapping of protein and lipid contents in a multicomponent system are confirmed by the separation of the measured CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> stretching signals. We note that being the chirping not controlled, the spectral resolution is not optimised, but as significant advantage we have that no further optical elements have to be introduced in our experimental set up. Finally, the three-dimensional sectioning capability of the SRS technique, performed by collecting SRS images at different focal plane along the z axis, is proved by a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of lipids, proteins and their simultaneous spatial distributions inside cells. Our findings confirm that stimulated Raman imaging provides an advanced label-free approach to image and follow changes in LDs potentially under pathophysiological conditions. This SRS application will provide a useful tool for diagnosis, analysis and follow-up after treatment for lipid-associated pathologies.
