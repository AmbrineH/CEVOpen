<p class="p">SRS microscopy with ps laser pulses is equally successful at imaging in carbon-hydrogen (CH) stretching region (2800–3100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) where the molecular specificity is assumed to be low because lipids and proteins have a large Raman spectral shape (about 100 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and the difference between the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peaks is 95 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In addition, we note that while ps coherent Raman scattering guarantees the best spectral resolution, the optimal ratio of image contrast and signal intensity is reached when the spectral resolution matches the width of the Raman lines under consideration (5–100 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) [

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), the question is raised, as to whether broader bandwidth femtosecond (fs) pulses might also be well suited to optimal excitation of CH stretching vibrations (lipid and proteins linewidth ∼100 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) [
