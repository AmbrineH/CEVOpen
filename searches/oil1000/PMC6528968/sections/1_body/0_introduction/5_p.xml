<p class="p">Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) was one of the first nonlinear optical phenomena to be discovered [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]; however, it was adapted to microscopy only in the last decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Some years ago, it has been demonstrated that SRS signal can be further improved by one order of magnitude when femtoseconds (fs) pulses are used instead of picoseconds (ps) [

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, the use of SRS microscopy could overcome the current limitations and artefacts associated with fluorescence lipid staining [
