<p class="p">In this framework, vibrational microscopy has emerged in the last decade as a powerful alternative approach based on chemically label-free selective contrast generated by the intrinsic molecule vibrations. Among the vibrational techniques, spontaneous Raman is a widely-used label-free approach that detects specific chemical bond vibrations of molecules by inelastic light scattering. Thus, a typical Raman spectrum gives information on the molecular contents and chemical structure of the sample, offering an intrinsic chemical selectivity [

Unfortunately, spontaneous Raman microscopy is limited by weak signals requiring very long acquisition times, that limit severely its application to the study of living systems. To overcome this limit, label-free microscopy techniques based on nonlinear optics are rapidly gaining interest and are widely applied [
