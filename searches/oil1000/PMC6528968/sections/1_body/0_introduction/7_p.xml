<p class="p">In order to enhance spectral resolution in SRS microscopy based on FTL fs laser pulses, a number of methods have been developed, which relies on optical phase control. A feasible option is to impose a quadratic spectral phase variation; in other words, a linear variation of the frequencies within the pulse, called ‘chirp’. Laser pulses can be stretched temporally by a stretching factor

By equally chirping pump and Stokes beams, it is possible to adjust the instantaneous frequency difference and its bandwidth to certain Raman linewidths and, in the limiting case, even mimic the picoseconds SRS scheme. This approach is referred to as spectral focusing (SF) [

However, the vast number of parameters that need to be considered when selecting and aligning the optics required for chirp-matching can be discouraging. Furthermore, due to fluctuations in the pump and Stokes wavelengths and dispersion in the microscope, perfect chirp-matching can be difficult to maintain. Thus, SF-SRS setups often have poorer spectral resolution than theoretically predicted [
