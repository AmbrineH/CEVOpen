<p class="p">Lipids play key role in cellular physiology as structural components of biological membranes, biosynthetic precursors, signal transducers and energy storage [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Mammalian cells store excess of lipids molecules into specialized intracellular organelles, called lipid droplets (LDs). LDs, also known as adiposomes, are ubiquitously conserved from yeast to mammals and are involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis through lipid synthesis, metabolism, and transportation. Based on the control on these important cellular functions, LDs are closely associated with human disease such as dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy (Familial partial lipodystrophy: FGL), diabetes, obesity, fatty liver diseases (e.g. liver steatosis and cirrhosis, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), atherosclerosis, heart diseases (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or even heart failure) and cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) [

 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This is the reason why in the last decade great attention has been reserved to LD biology. LDs consist of a triacylglycerol and sterol ester neutral lipid core surrounded by a single phospholipid monolayer decorated by embedded proteins that regulate lipid accumulation and mobilization. Proteomic analyses of isolated LDs identified more than one hundred of LD-associated proteins including lipid metabolism enzymes, membrane trafficking and cell signaling proteins, as well as, structural proteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Of note, these identified proteins bind to LDs across species from yeast to mammals indicating that LD is a highly conserved organelle [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The accepted mechanisms by which LDs grow is based on the nucleation of LDs from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER); there diacylglycerol starts to accumulate and recruits perilipin family members as structural LD proteins to the ER sites where then LDs bud off [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Seipin and the fat storage-inducing transmembrane proteins FIT1 and FIT2 cooperate for the early assembly of LDs at the ER. After ER release, LDs undergo a maturation process that is controlled by changes in the composition of the coated proteins. Perilipin proteins coordinate the access of lipases to the lipid substrates dynamically mobilizing the lipid contents following the different cellular conditions/ requirements [
