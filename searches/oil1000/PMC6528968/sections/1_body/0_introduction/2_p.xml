<p class="p">The sizes of LDs vary from tens of nm to tens of μm in diameter [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In adipocytes, the so called “professional” fat storing cells, LDs can reach a diameter of 100 μm or even more. In these cells, LDs grow, in part, by fusion of smaller droplets and although this fusion mechanism is poorly understood, the fat-specific protein FSP27 has been shown to play a key role [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For a long time, LDs have been considered as passive cytoplasmic inclusions and only recently they have been recognized as dynamic organelles involved not only in lipid homeostasis and metabolism (as discussed above), but also in membrane trafficking, cell signalling, proliferation and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In this context, 3T3-L1 cells have been reported as a well-established model to study adipogenesis as they are converted into adipose-like cells under defined hormonal stimulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Adipocyte differentiation is characterized by sequential changes in the expression of specific genes, which determines the defined adipocyte cell phenotype [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. During growth, preadipose cells resemble fibroblasts; upon reaching confluence, proliferative preadipocytes become growth-arrested by contact inhibition. After hormonal induction, these cells re-enter the cell cycle, then they stop proliferating again, and finally undergo terminal adipocyte differentiation, with morphological conversion into cells with a spherical shape and increased LDs accumulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0216811.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The mechanism underlying the accumulation of neutral lipids into LDs is not yet well-defined and represents one of the major challenges in understanding the roles of lipids in biological and pathological processes.
