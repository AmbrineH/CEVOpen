<p class="p">Due to its nonlinear nature that confines the signal generation in the focal volume, SRS microscopy allows a three-dimensional sectioning similar to that of multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. In our study, we report the capability of SRS microscopy technique to develop the chemical decomposition of a single adipocyte cell into protein and lipid components, and to provide a two-colour three-dimensional imaging with high spatially resolved concentration maps of the two components.</p>
