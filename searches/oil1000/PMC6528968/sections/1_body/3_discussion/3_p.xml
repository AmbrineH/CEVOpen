Moreover, in several biological and biomedical applications, it is desirable to map simultaneously the different chemical species that compose a complex system such as a tissue. SRS is a powerful method to map in a label-free manner the distributions of individual species in a multicomponent system. This is due to the linear dependence on the individual specie concentrations of SRS signals and to the chemical selectivity provided by this technique [
