<p class="p">SRS imaging allows to achieve higher definition on lipid accumulation within adipocytes compared to traditional fluorescent dyes staining approaches, namely LipidTox Red, Oil Red O and BODIPY 493/503. We report the capability of SRS imaging to evaluate and determine, during the differentiation process, the changes in number and dimension of LDs and their intracellular redistribution from the nucleus to the cell periphery following a roughly elliptical crown. These results assess the ability of this nonlinear imaging technique to monitor the maturation of LDs during the adipocyte differentiation. Then, by further implementing a temporal multiplexing to sequentially acquire the two channels, corresponding to CH

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (protein; 2,940 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) stretching vibrational signals, we were able to collect the chemically specific spectral differentiation of SRS imaging, even if the two bands partially overlap. We should emphasize that SRS imaging of proteins in adipocytes is challenging, because of the lower protein density with respect to the lipids [
