<p class="p">One of the most common cellular model system to study adipogenesis is the 3T3-L1 cell line, which can be converted from its fibroblast phenotype into adipocytes following treatment with adipogenic agent. In the last five years this cellular system has been used to evaluate the effects of compounds or nutrients on adipogenesis and in the treatment of obesity, as well as to study the function of different genes of the inflammatory pathways, adipokine synthesis, and cellular secretion in adipogenesis [
