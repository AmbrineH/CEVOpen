<p class="p">With the present study we have demonstrated the useful application of SRS imaging to analyze and characterize adipocyte differentiation. We report the capabilities of SRS imaging technique to evaluate and determine, during the differentiation process, the changes in number and dimension of LDs. We also successfully demonstrate an increase in the number of large (&gt;15Î¼m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) lipid droplets; an increment in their major and minor axes lengths, assuming an elliptical arrangement of LDs around the cell nucleus; their intracellular redistribution from the nucleus to the cell periphery following a roughly elliptical crown; spatially-resolved maps of lipids and proteins inside cells; three dimensional reconstructions of lipids at the initial and final steps of adipocyte differentiation are reported, too. This successful use of SRS imaging technique establishes its future application in the real-time dynamics study of LDs in the cellular environment. The SRS will permit the elucidation of fundamental LD-associated biological processes such as LD formation, maturation, as well as, misregulation of their functions in pathophysiological conditions (e.g, obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, fatty liver diseases). In addition, SRS microscopy technique overcame the limitations of the fluorescent probes (such as; cell fixation and permeabilization, limited photostability, limited range of emission colors and Stokes shifts, signal background, cell toxicity) and will be applied in in-vivo studies to precisely imaging the localization, distribution and biophysical properties of LDs. This, in turn, will permit a long-term monitoring of LD-related biological processes associated with a spatio-temporal resolution.
