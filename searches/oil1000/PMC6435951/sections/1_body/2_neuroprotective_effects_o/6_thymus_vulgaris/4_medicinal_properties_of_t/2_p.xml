 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> (Thyme) is a subshrub native to the western Mediterranean region which is widely used as spice to add a distinctive flavour to food. In the traditional medicine, thyme is part of herbal teas and infusions.
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">69</sup>
 </xref> It has been documented that bioactive compounds of thyme such as thyme essential oil (TEO) constituents, flavonoids and phenolic acids, natural terpenoid thymol and phenol isomer carvacrol, possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitussive, antispasmodic, and expectorant effects.

 </xref> Researchers have reported that tocols and phenolic in thymus vulgaris oil (TO) can directly react with free radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation.
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref> It has been also reported that treatment with thymol results in improvement of antioxidant status in rat brain.

 </xref> In addition, the results of behavioural studies have demonstrated that the extract of thyme can induce anxiolytic effects in rat when it was orally administered for 1-week. In confirmation of this report extract of thyme enhances the percentage of both the entries and the time spent in the open arms of the maze.
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">74</sup>
 </xref> The results of animal studies also revealed that kaemfrol in thyme extract applies anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus maze (EPM) in mice.
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">75</sup>
 </xref> Carvacrol derived from this plant has also been indicated to have anxiolytic effects in the plus maze test.
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref> Bioactive monoterpenes in thyme extract such as linalool have been reported to be able to decrease the level of anxiety in animals.
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">77</sup>
 </xref> The essential oil of thyme has also been suggested to have a dose dependent protective effect against toxicity of alfatoxins.

 </xref> In addition, it has been documented that thymol acts centrally via mimicking or facilitating GABA action and modulates GABA

 </xref> Therefore, it can apply the significant anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic effects. Recently, neuroprotective and improvement effects of thymol, a bioactive monoterpene isolated from thymus vulgaris, on amyloid β or scopolamine-caused cognitive impairment in rats was documented.
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref> Researchers have suggested that neuroprotective effects of thymol can attribute to its potential effect on GABA-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission.
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">81</sup>
 </xref> Meanwhile, researchers reported that TO could modulate cholinergic function via enhancing synaptic acetylcholine (Ach) and nicotinic Ach receptor activity.
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">82</sup>
 </xref> Additionally, antidepressant effects of thymol were documented. Deng et al. reported that thymol administration significantly shortened the immobility time in tail suspension tests (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) and restored the reduction of the hippocampal levels of serotonin (5- HT) and norepinephrine (NE) in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)- induced depressive mice.
