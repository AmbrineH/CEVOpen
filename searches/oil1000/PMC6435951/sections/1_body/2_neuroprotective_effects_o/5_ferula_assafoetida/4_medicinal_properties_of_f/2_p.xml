 <italic class="italic">F. asafoetida</italic> (Apiaceae) is considered by researchers due to its medicinal and nutritional properties. Roots, young shoots and leaves of plant are eaten as vegetable. Leaves of Ferula asafoetida possess anthelmintic, carminative and diaphoretic properties and the root of plant is used as antipyretic.

 </xref> In a study, acute and sub-chronic toxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">F. asafoetida</italic> was evaluated and the results indicated that single oral administration (500 mg/kg) and repeated doses (250 mg/kg) for 28 days of this plant did not induce mortality and obvious toxicological signs in rats.

 </xref> It has also been documented that oleo gum resin of 
 <italic class="italic">F. asafoetida</italic> can enhance regeneration and re-myelination and decreases the rat of lymphocyte infiltration in the neuropathic tissue in mice; therefore it acts as a neuroprotective and nerve simulative agent in peripheral neuropathy.

 <italic class="italic">Ferula asafoetida</italic> has been reported to have acetylcholinestrase (AChE) inhibiting property 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assay and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> on snail nervous system. Researchers have proposed that memory increasing effect of

 </xref> In behavioural models, such as elevated plus maz, the extract of plant dose-dependently improved memory in rats. In another behavioural model, passive avoidance test, the lower dose of extract (200 mg) could not improve memory whereas in high dose (400 mg) it ameliorated memory.

 </xref> Additionally, it has been documented that the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">F. asafoetida</italic> applies a considerable anticonvulsant effect in Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and amygdala-kindled rats. Researchers investigated the effect of two doses of ferula asafoetida (50 and 100 mg/kg) on parameters of seizure and the results revealed that dose 100 mg/kg exerts the better anticonvulsant effect than 50 mg.
