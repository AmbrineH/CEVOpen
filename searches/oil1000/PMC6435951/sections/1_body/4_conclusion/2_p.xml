<p id="p0155" class="p">In this review we propose to focus on neurotoxicity in various studies (
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>) and investigated the effects of medicinal plants on neural system. The mentioned medicinal plants play their protective roles via increased SOD and catalase levels, restoration of GSH, decreased MDA levels and also protects of neurons against ROS as antioxidant activities. Some protective effects of these natural compounds may be due to reduction of Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and enhancement of K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> level or ‘anti-glutamatergic’ effect. The neuroprotective effects of the mentioned plants occur via reduction of inflammatory cytokines as well as enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity and decreased MDA levels in the neural system via modulating GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and also increasing amount of amino acids and serotonin (5-HT) in the neurotransmitters systems. Furthermore, the data of the basic and clinical evidence indicated that anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunoregulatory effects of some herbs on various disorders. This findings help to recommend the use of these herbs and main compound from natural resources for drug development and more investigation in the clinical studies for future were suggested.
