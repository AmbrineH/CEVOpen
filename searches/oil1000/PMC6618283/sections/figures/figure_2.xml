  <p class="p">Simulations of T
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxations for the CH
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> group (black), the central CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak (red), and the central n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak with the outer triplet n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak (blue). The simulated T
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxations were calculated with a concentration of n‐3 FA of 1:75 and with the following T
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times: CH
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 76 msec; CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 264 msec, mean values from several oils; and n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 478 msec measured in linseed oil. These T
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times from oils were obtained from Ref. 
   <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">10</xref>. According to the simulations, at TE = 1000 msec, there will be a negligible occurrence of the CH
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal with still more than 10% of the n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal intensity. Data were normalized to the central n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak intensity at TE = 0 msec.
