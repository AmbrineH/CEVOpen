 <p> Illustration of different spectral dispersions for n‐3 CH 3 and CH 3 spectra for three different magnetic field strengths (scaling of absolute frequency adapted to respective field strength) and CH 3 linewidths expected in in vivo experiments (spectral linewidth ~14 Hz) (A). Note the better separation of the n‐3 CH 3 left outer peak at 1.5 T and the better separation of the central peaks at 7 T. Two properties of MR play a role in the different separations of the n‐3 CH 3 and CH 3 signals: the J‐coupling constant, which retains the chemical shifts of the triplets constant; and the Larmor frequency, which better separates the triplets with an increase of B 0 (B). </p>
