  <p class="p">Excitation and refocusing bandwidth of Sinc and Hermite pulses measured in phantoms 
   <bold class="bold">(A,B)</bold> (500 Hz = 1.7 ppm at 7 T). Both excitation and refocusing pulses in the PRESS sequence used in this study could excite and refocus methylene and methyl protons in the n‐3 FAs (blue) and the non‐n‐3 FAs (red) 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold>. The spin system of the n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> used for simulation was demonstrated with a pulse acquire sequence (rectangular pulse with a duration of 2 msec) 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold>. The effects of standard Mao and Hermite pulses for one spin and for a VOI of 1 mL, respectively, were simulated for short and ultralong TEs 
   <bold class="bold">(E,F)</bold>. All simulations were apodized with a 2 Hz Lorentzian filter.
