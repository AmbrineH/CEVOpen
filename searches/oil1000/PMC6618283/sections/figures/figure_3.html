 <p> Excitation and refocusing bandwidth of Sinc and Hermite pulses measured in phantoms (A,B) (500 Hz = 1.7 ppm at 7 T). Both excitation and refocusing pulses in the PRESS sequence used in this study could excite and refocus methylene and methyl protons in the n‐3 FAs (blue) and the non‐n‐3 FAs (red) (C). The spin system of the n‐3 CH 3 used for simulation was demonstrated with a pulse acquire sequence (rectangular pulse with a duration of 2 msec) (D). The effects of standard Mao and Hermite pulses for one spin and for a VOI of 1 mL, respectively, were simulated for short and ultralong TEs (E,F). All simulations were apodized with a 2 Hz Lorentzian filter. </p>
