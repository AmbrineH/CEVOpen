 <p> T 2 relaxation behavior and T 2 relaxation times of the central CH 3 peak (A) and the central n‐3 CH 3 peak (B) from three oil samples with different n‐3 FA content. All signals were fitted with monoexponential functions (dashed lines). For comparison of T 2 relaxations, the measured CH 2 data from the corresponding oils are shown as a solid gray line. </p>
