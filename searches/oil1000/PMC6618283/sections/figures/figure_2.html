 <p> Simulations of T 2 relaxations for the CH 2 group (black), the central CH 3 peak (red), and the central n‐3 CH 3 peak with the outer triplet n‐3 CH 3 peak (blue). The simulated T 2 relaxations were calculated with a concentration of n‐3 FA of 1:75 and with the following T 2 relaxation times: CH 2, 76 msec; CH 3, 264 msec, mean values from several oils; and n‐3 CH 3, 478 msec measured in linseed oil. These T 2 relaxation times from oils were obtained from Ref. 10. According to the simulations, at TE = 1000 msec, there will be a negligible occurrence of the CH 2 signal with still more than 10% of the n‐3 CH 3 signal intensity. Data were normalized to the central n‐3 CH 3 peak intensity at TE = 0 msec. </p>
