 <p> The typical position of the voxel (yellow cube) on axial (A) and coronal images (B) in SAT in a female volunteer. The corresponding in vivo proton spectrum (FWHM CH3 = 9.6 Hz, SNR = 227) measured with an ultralong TE of 1000 msec and NA = 32, showed a disappearing CH 2 signal and a clear separation of the n‐3 CH 3 and the CH 3 signals (C). Peak fitting of methylene and both methyl signals with Gaussian line‐shapes resulted in minimal residual signals (D). An example of soybean oil spectra fitted with oil prior knowledge (two Gaussians, E) and the same spectrum with a line‐broadening filter fitted with in vivo prior knowledge (three Gaussians F). </p>
