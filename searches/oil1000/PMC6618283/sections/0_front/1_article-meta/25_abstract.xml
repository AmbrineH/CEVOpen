  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p class="p">Omega‐3 (n‐3) fatty acids (FA) play and important role in neural development and other metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The knowledge about the in vivo content and distribution of n‐3 FA in human body tissues is not well established and the standard quantification of FA is invasive and costly.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="jmri26605-sec-0002" class="sec">
  <title class="title">Purpose</title>
  <p class="p">To detect omega‐3 (n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>) and non‐omega‐3 (CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>) methyl group resonance lines with echo times up to 1200 msec, in oils, for the assessment of n‐3 FA content, and the n‐3 FA fraction in adipose tissue in vivo.

  <title class="title">Population</title>

  <title class="title">Field Strength/Sequence</title>
  <p class="p">Single‐voxel MR spectroscopy (SVS) with a point‐resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with an echo time (TE) of 1000 msec at 7 T.</p>

  <title class="title">Assessment</title>
  <p class="p">Knowledge about the J‐coupling evolution of both CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> resonances was used for the optimal detection of the n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> resonance line at a TE of 1000 msec. The accuracy of the method in oils and in vivo was validated from a biopsy sample with gas chromatography analysis.

  <title class="title">Statistical Tests</title>
  <p class="p">SVS data were compared to gas chromatography with the Pearson correlation coefficient.</p>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">T
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times in oils were assessed as follows: CH
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 65 ± 22 msec; CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 325 ± 7 msec; and n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 628 ± 34 msec. The n‐3 FA fractions from oil phantom experiments (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3) were in agreement with chromatography analysis and the comparison of in vivo obtained data with the results of chromatography analysis (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5) yielded a significant correlation (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029).

  <title class="title">Data Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p">PRESS with ultralong‐TE can detect and quantify the n‐3 CH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal in vivo at 7 T.
