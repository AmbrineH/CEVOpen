<p class="p">As signal‐to‐noise (SNR) increases with magnetic field strength (B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>), ultrahigh field (UHF) 7 Tesla (T) should provide higher SNR, which is beneficial for the detection of low‐concentration n‐3 FA. The nominal spectral resolution in Hz between CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increases with the application of higher B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>; however, the resolution of the methyl triplets remains constant. For a better understanding of this effect, the estimated spectral dispersion in vivo is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jmri26605-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> for three clinical field strengths of 1.5, 3, and 7 T.
