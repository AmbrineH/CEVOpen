<p class="p">At magnetic field strengths of 1.5 and 3 T, the peaks of the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> triplet overlap the central and right outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peaks; however, no signal overlaps the left outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak (1.08 ppm and 1.05 ppm, respectively) and can, in principle, be detected. The first detection of n‐3 FA in vivo in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) at a clinical field strength of 1.5 T with 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H MR spectroscopy (MRS) was carried out by Lundbom et al.,
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">10</xref> in which the left outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak was detected using a point‐resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">11</xref> with a long echo time (TE) of 540 msec. This in vivo n‐3 FA measurement was based on a long apparent transverse (T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) relaxation time of 478 msec for the central n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak of linseed oil measured in that study. A method for assessment of the relative levels of n‐3 FA content in oils, based on relative methyl peak linewidths with stimulated echo mode (STEAM) and PRESS sequences with TE = 160 msec at 3 T, was also presented.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">12</xref> J‐difference editing allowed for the detection of the left outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak in SAT at 1.05 ppm with a TE of 199.5 msec at 3 T.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">9</xref> However, at 7 T the left outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak resonates at 1.00 ppm, which is only 0.02 ppm away from the central n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak. To detect this peak with in vivo MRS in SAT using a whole‐body 7 T MRI system and the usual B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> homogeneity is currently very difficult.
