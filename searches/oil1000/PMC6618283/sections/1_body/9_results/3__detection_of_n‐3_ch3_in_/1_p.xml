<p class="p">The thighs of all subjects fit easily in the knee coil except for one case, when the MRS had to be performed in SAT in the calf due to an excessive amount fat in the thigh (BMI ~50 kg.m
 <sup class="sup">‐2</sup>). A typical localization of a voxel in the SAT is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jmri26605-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>A,B. The spectral quality for the detection of the n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal was sufficient in all volunteers; however, in two cases the very small amount of SAT in very lean and athletic males forced a doubling of the number of acquisitions. The n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> resonance, measured with ultralong TE and NA = 32, was clearly resolved in vivo with the advantage of the suppression of the strong CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal, as depicted in Fig.
