<p class="p">Based on the mean values of the FWHM
 <sub class="sub">CH3</sub> measured from in vivo spectra, a line‐broadening using a 12 Hz Gaussian filter was applied on oil spectra measured with a TE of 1000 msec. The mean FWHM
 <sub class="sub">CH3</sub> after the line‐broadening for CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was 13.4 ± 1.0 Hz, and for n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was 11.0 ± 0.1 Hz. The example of a soybean oil spectrum before and after line‐broadening, together with fitting with oil prior knowledge and in vivo prior knowledge, is depicted in Fig.
