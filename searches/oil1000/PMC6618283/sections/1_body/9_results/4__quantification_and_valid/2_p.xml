<p class="p">The n‐3 FA fractions in vivo from all volunteers ranged from 0.085–0.252 and the mean fraction was 0.149 ± 0.042. The mean n‐3 FA fraction in females (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14) was 0.140 ± 0.036, ranging from 0.085–0.228, and in males (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10) was 0.161 ± 0.046, ranging from 0.111–0.252. This difference was found to be not significant. No significant correlations were found between age, BMI, and n‐3 FA fraction (in a.u., without T
