<p class="p">The spectral triplet pattern of the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups was clearly visible in the observed region by the application of a properly adjusted long TE in all oil phantoms. Reference spectra showing CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals from all three oils measured with TE = 30 and 1000 msec are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jmri26605-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. The n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals in the measured spectra were in agreement with the simulations.
