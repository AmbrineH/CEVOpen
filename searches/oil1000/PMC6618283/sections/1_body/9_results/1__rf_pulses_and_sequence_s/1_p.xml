<p class="p">The experimentally measured FWHM of the Sinc pulse was 3.4 kHz and the Mao pulse was 1.1 kHz. The FWHMs of the excitation and refocusing Hermite pulses were 1.6 kHz and 1.1 kHz, respectively. The flat frequency range of both Hermite pulses was ~500 Hz (1.7 ppm at 7 T). The frequency profiles of all RF pulses are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jmri26605-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>A,B. Accounting for the center of the RF pulses (1.0 ppm), this range covered nearly all the relevant chemical shifts of methylene and methyl protons, which is depicted in Fig.
