<p class="p">The aim of this study was to detect and characterize the relaxation behavior of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals in oils, with an assessment of their apparent T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times and their n‐3 FA content, and to detect and quantify n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal in vivo in SAT with a long TE at 7 T. For this purpose, we aimed to modify the PRESS sequence for UHF and validated the MRS data by gas chromatography analysis.
