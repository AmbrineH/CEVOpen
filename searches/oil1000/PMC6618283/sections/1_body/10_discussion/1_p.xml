<p class="p">A single‐voxel PRESS sequence with TEs up to 1200 msec was used to detect n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in three oil samples with different n‐3 FA fractions, and in vivo. An ultralong TE of 1000 msec, high spectral resolution, and an SNR of 7 T magnetic field enabled the detection of the n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal in all three oil samples with different n‐3 FA content and in the SAT of all 24 healthy subjects as well. In the presented work, the T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation behavior of the non‐n‐3 and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups was investigated in oils, with an assessment of their apparent T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times. The calculated n‐3 FA content in oils and n‐3 FA fractions in vivo were validated by GC‐MS analysis.
