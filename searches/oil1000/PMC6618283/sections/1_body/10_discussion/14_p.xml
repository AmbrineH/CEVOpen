<p class="p">In conclusion, the differences in T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times between the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals enabled the identification of well‐resolved n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> resonances, making PRESS with ultralong TE a method suitable for the direct detection of n‐3 FA at 7 T. This work proposed a relatively simple approach for the reliable estimation of the n‐3 FA fraction, in vivo, in a sample of healthy volunteers.
