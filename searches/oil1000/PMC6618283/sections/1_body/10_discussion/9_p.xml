<p class="p">The resonance frequencies of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are adjacent, and therefore, their distinction is extremely sensitive to B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> field inhomogeneity. The in vivo signal measured closer to the skin experienced a slightly worse B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> field due to the difference in magnetic susceptibility in the air–tissue boundary. In general, the FWHM of the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal in magnitude mode during the B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> shimming had to be less than 40 Hz in order to successfully resolve both methyl signals. Measurements with a TE of 67 msec could be chosen for n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> detection as well, but this would require a quite homogeneous B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> with a small VOI (&lt;1 mL). The suppression of the strong CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal could also be an option; however, this would require sequence optimization similar to water suppression techniques,
