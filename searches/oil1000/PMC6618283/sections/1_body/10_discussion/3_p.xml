<p class="p">The PRESS sequence is sensitive to chemical shift displacement error, which increases with B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. The Δν between the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> group is 0.4 ppm and between the n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> group is 1.1 ppm, which makes the chemical shift displacement error relatively small. For the typical 8 mL cubical voxel, the displacement in one direction would be ~12% and ~33%, respectively. This relates to "four‐compartment" chemical shift artifacts, which could decrease the spectral quality.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">28</xref> This could explain the lower intensity of the outer n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals in antiphase, as expected, by a 1:2:1 ratio with the central signal of the triplet, which was shown in the simulations. The frequency offset of the RF pulses could also be adjusted on the methylene resonance at 1.3 ppm or even further, eg., in the frequency between n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (1.5 ppm), but, as the results of our prior experiments with oil phantoms have shown, this did not improve the spectral quality.
