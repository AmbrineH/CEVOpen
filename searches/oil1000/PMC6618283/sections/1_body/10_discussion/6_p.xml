<p class="p">The magnetic field of the whole‐body 7 T scanner allowed for sufficient spectral resolution of the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> triplets in the oils. Our results confirmed the relatively long and different T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times of both methyl groups and the short T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times of the methylene groups, which enabled their better resolution and quantification with the ultralong TE, especially for the low n‐3 FA‐concentration corn oil.
