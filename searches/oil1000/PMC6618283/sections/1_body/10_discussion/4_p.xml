<p class="p">A spectral editing approach in SAT with oMEGA‐PRESS was proposed by Škoch et al.,

 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">29</xref> at 3 T and 4 T. Nevertheless, these techniques depend on the J‐coupling, which we aimed to minimize, and they would also require an additional calibration for 7 T applications. Another localized method that uses the natural abundance of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C to detect FA in SAT at 7 T was proposed by Lindeboom and de Graaf.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">29</xref> This method enables the detection of several unique resonances for the assessment of FA saturation and the n‐6/n‐3 FA ratio, but requires a special double‐tuned 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H/
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C coil for the heteronuclear pulse sequence.
