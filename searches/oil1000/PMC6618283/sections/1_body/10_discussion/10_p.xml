<p class="p">The assessment of n‐3 FA is of great importance for understanding the metabolism of lipids. In the study by Ouldamer et al.,
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">35</xref> GC of FA from the SAT extracts from rats showed high correlation with 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H MRS analysis. The n‐3 FA fraction in the control group was 0.9%, and the n‐3 FA content changed with dietary supplements. The n‐3 FA fraction in SAT measured with in vivo MRS at 3 T has already been reported in several studies. Škoch et al.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">9</xref> reported a content of 1.6 ± 0.5% in the dorsal waist assessed with the J‐difference editing method with a TE = 199.5 msec. Lundbom et al.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">36</xref> reported the n‐3 FA fraction in the same body area measured with TE = 540 msec in a range from 0.09–0.2%, with a range from the GC analysis of 1.0–1.8%, which represented a significant agreement (
