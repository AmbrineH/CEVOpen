<p class="p">The line‐broadening of oil spectra caused the merging of the two methyl triplets into two partially overlapping peaks. These peaks contained signal from all the methyl protons. The quantification of the line‐broadened signals with in vivo prior knowledge showed a high correlation with GC‐MS analysis as well, and confirmed this approach for in vivo quantification.</p>
