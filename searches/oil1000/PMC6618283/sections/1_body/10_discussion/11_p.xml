<p class="p">Our GC‐MS results, ranging from 0.8–1.5%, were in agreement with previously published data. The reported SAT n‐3 FA fraction in this study should not be compared with the FA content because the signals were not corrected for T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation. A rough estimation of n‐3 FA content would be possible by using a linear regression analysis; however, this approach assumes constant T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times of methyl signals, which is questionable at this point. The proposed MRS method yielded a realistic validation of the aforementioned method and was in line with the literature.
