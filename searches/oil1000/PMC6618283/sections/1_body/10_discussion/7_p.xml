<p class="p">J‐modulations of the outer triplet peaks of the methyl groups influenced the measured T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> decay of their central peaks; however, this effect did not hamper the calculation of the T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times. Because the central peaks were not affected by imperfections caused by the RF pulses and localization sequences, quantification with oil prior knowledge by fitting only the central peaks was feasible. This was demonstrated by the high correlation of their n‐3 FA content with the GC‐MS analysis.
