<p class="p">Heavy T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐weighting of methyl signals in vivo is one important limitation of this study. Although the assessment of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times of methyl groups in vivo was not the aim of this pilot study, their knowledge is critical for future research into n‐3 FA using long TEs. The SAT in vivo can contain various FAs with different saturations

 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">39</xref> Oil phantoms are often successfully used as appropriate materials for proof‐of‐concept; however, for MRS measurements of subtle signals with ultralong TE, even small variations in FA content in vivo could result in different relaxation behavior. Assessment of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times with TEs &lt; 1000 msec will pose a problem for B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> homogeneity due to increasing overlap between CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals with shorter TE. There are several techniques for advanced B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> shimming,

 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">41</xref> which could improve the spectral resolution and allow detection of n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signal with shorter TE. In addition, the T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> times could be calculated using a monoexponential function when TEs are selected according to Eq.

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal could be theoretically suppressed enabling using short TE (TE &lt; 200 msec). The spectra were averaged online, which, in the case of movement of a subject, would be translated into broader linewidths. This effect can be resolved in frequency alignment and phase corrections for each transient in postprocessing in future studies. All our subjects had a sufficient layer of subcutaneous fat, but MRS in lean individuals with a small amount of fat would require very small voxels (&lt;1 mL) and manifold NA, which could prolong acquisition time significantly. The SAT biopsy and the sample analysis is an invasive and costly technique, and, for a larger sample size, would require more time and resources, which were limited for this study. As we did not perform any test–retest measurements and we analyzed only five samples with GC‐MS, further in vivo measurements of the SAT in different areas and biochemical validation from biopsy samples of a broader population are necessary.
