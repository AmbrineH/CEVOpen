<p class="p">The spectroscopic voxel was positioned according to T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>‐weighted scout images. The frequency was adjusted on the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal at 1.3 ppm and the homogeneity of the B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> field was first improved with automatic B
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> shimming calculated from gradient echo images, then manually adjusted in an interactive mode. The reference voltage for RF pulses was automatically calibrated by the scanner. A frequency offset of –0.3 ppm was used for all measurements.
