<p class="p">About 1–2 mg of oil or tissue was homogenized in a 500 μl methanol:chloroform 1:2 solution. Each sample was spiked with C19:0 FA as an internal standard and lipids were extracted according to Folch et al.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">22</xref> Lipid extracts were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Then the samples were derived in 2 ml methanol:toluene 4:1 with 200 μl acetyl chloride at 100°C by continuous stirring. After 60 minutes, the samples were cooled to 4°C and 5 ml of 6% potassium carbonate solution was added. After centrifugation, the toluene layer was collected and used for GC‐MS analysis.
