<p class="p">A 6890 N/59730 N GC‐MSD system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DB‐23 30 m‐column was used. Helium was used as a carrier gas with 1.0 ml/min flow in a solvent vent modus using a PTV‐injector with a 250°C injection temperature. The initial oven temperature of 50°C was held for 4 minutes, then increased to 180°C at a rate of 10°C/min and held for 5 minutes, which was subsequently increased to 240°C at a rate of 5°C/min and held for 2 minutes and finally increased to 250°C at a rate of 3°C/min.</p>
