<p class="p">The typical VOI was set to 8 mL and placed in the SAT in the lower part of the thigh. The voxel was positioned just above the knee (3â€“4 cm), so the knee was at the inferior edge of the coil and the axial scout image was in the center. The in vivo spectra were measured with ultralong TE = 1000 msec, TR = 5 sec, and NA = 32.</p>
