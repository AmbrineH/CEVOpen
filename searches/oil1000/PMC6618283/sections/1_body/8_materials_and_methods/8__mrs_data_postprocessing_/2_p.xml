<p class="p">In vivo, the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and central n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak were fitted with single Gaussian lines and the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak was fitted with two Gaussian lines (in vivo prior knowledge). Since the J‐modulation of the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> group was unknown, outer triplet CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peaks were approximately fitted with a second Gaussian line to minimize a possible influence on the quantification of the relatively small n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> peak.
