<p class="p">Quantification of FA with GC‐MS was performed by correlating the integrated peak areas of FA with the integrated area of C19:0, which was used as an internal standard. The n‐3 FA content by GC‐MS was calculated as the ratio of n‐3 FA to total FA. In vivo MRS data were compared to GC‐MS with the Pearson correlation coefficient. All data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The amplitudes of MRS signals are shown in a.u.
