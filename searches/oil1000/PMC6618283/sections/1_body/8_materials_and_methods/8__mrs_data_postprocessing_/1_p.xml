<p class="p">The CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and n‐3 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signals were quantified in jMRUI with the AMARES algorithm.
 <xref rid="jmri26605-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">23</xref> In oils, only the CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> peak and central peaks of the methyl triplets were fitted with a single Gaussian line (oil prior knowledge). The T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relaxation times were calculated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), with the following monoexponential fitting function:
