<p class="p">Five samples taken from the same anatomical SAT region measured with MRS were further analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS). Whole SAT samples from the knee region were obtained from three subjects who underwent either elective liposuction of the legs or elective arthroscopy of the knee joint. Subjects were excluded if they presented with leg ulcers or soft‐tissue infection of the legs or suffered from any relevant systemic disease that would exclude patients from local anesthesia. SAT biopsies were performed at the end of the procedures, shortly before suture, by cutting a piece of SAT that did not exceed 3 g, or ~1 cm
