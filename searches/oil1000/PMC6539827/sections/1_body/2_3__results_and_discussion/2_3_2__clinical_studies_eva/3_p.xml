<p class="p">The systematic reviews of Chumpitazi et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] and Shams et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] pointed out that peppermint oil was safe and well-tolerated by the patients, with a minimal side effect profile. Nevertheless, clinical studies evaluating the antispasmodic potential of essential oils have some limitations. They were represented mainly by randomized crossover or control studies using small numbers of patients with an insufficient statistical significance. Only the studies of Khanna et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] and Pittler and Ernst [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] were metaanalysis with superior statistical power. Therefore, additional clinical studies are necessary to ascertain the therapeutic value of antispasmodic essential oils.
