<p class="p">The main intracellular second messengers cAMP and cGMP are directly involved in smooth muscle relaxation. cAMP is generated by adenylyl cyclase mainly as a result of beta-adrenergic receptor activation. cGMP is produced by soluble guanylyl cyclase activated by nitric oxide or other mediators. Both cAMP and cGMP activate protein kinases PKA and PKG which may relax smooth muscles either by increasing the expulsion of calcium from the cell or by activation of MLC phosphatase which inhibits MLCK. The levels of cAMP and cGMP are severely reduced by the intervention of phosphodiesterases (PDE) involved in their degradation to inactive metabolites [

 <italic class="italic">Chrysactinia mexicana</italic> on isolated rabbit ileum. The effect was reduced by the preincubation with dibutyryl-cAMP but increased by forskolin, whereas chelerytrine or L-NNA did not modify the response, suggesting an involvement of cAMP in the antispasmodic mechanism of the essential oil. The study of Kim et al. [
