<p class="p">Thus, the identification and characterization of multiple molecular targets involved in smooth muscle contraction has led to the development of a variety of drugs able to reduce excessive contractility responsible for cramps and colics of the abdominal organs. Among potential new drug candidates, essential oils have become increasingly attractive due to their complex chemical composition and multiple pharmacological mechanisms: inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, modulation of potassium channels, antagonism of cholinergic receptors, and modulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (

Although some details of the antispasmodic effect of essential oils and their constituents have been explained, further research is needed to better understand their mechanism of action at cellular and molecular levels.
