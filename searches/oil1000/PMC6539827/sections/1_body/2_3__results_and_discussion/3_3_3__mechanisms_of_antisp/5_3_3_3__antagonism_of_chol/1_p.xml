<p class="p">The parasympathetic nervous system has an important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Muscarinic receptors located directly on smooth muscle cells can trigger their contraction in response to acetylcholine, but nicotinic receptors have also been identified on the nerve cells from the enteric nervous system. Research on the effect of essential oils on cholinergic receptors from smooth muscles is extremely rare, only a few studies being published to date. Amato et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] found that menthol induced relaxation of isolated mouse stomach by inhibiting nicotinic receptors from the enteric nervous system, reducing the release of acetylcholine from enteric nerves. The study of Lozon et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] investigated the effects of vanilin, pulegone, eugenole, carvone, carvacrol, carveol, thymol, thymoquinone, menthone, and limonene on human nicotinic cholinergic receptors expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Carveol showed the most potent inhibition at the α 7 subunit of the nicotinic receptor. The molecular interactions between terpenic compounds from essential oils and nicotinic cholinergic receptors were investigated by electrophysiological studies which showed that menthol caused a shortening of channel open time and a prolongation of channel closed time of human α4β2 nicotinic receptors [
