<p class="p">Potassium channels are largely distributed in human and animal tissues, having important physiological roles such as the regulation of smooth muscle tone [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Generally, the activation of voltage-gated potassium channels induces a hyperpolarisation of cell membrane with a subsequent de-activation of calcium channels leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Only a few studies investigated the effect of essential oils on potassium channels situated on smooth muscles of internal organs. Mehmood et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] showed that a crude extract from 
 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla L.</italic> containing sesquiterpenes (bisabolol) and flavonoids produced a significant antispasmodic effect on isolated rabbit jejunum. The effect on low K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> induced contractions was completely blocked by 4-aminopyridine, suggesting that the activation of potassium channels was responsible for smooth muscle relaxation. Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] showed that a crude extract from 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> rich in essential oils (thujone, 1,8-cineole, camphor, linalool) caused a dose-dependent relaxation of isolated rabbit jejunum by an activation of K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels.
