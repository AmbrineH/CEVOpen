<p class="p">Other studies were focused on the individual components of the essential oils. Amato et al. showed that menthol (0.1 mMâ€“30 mM) reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the contractility of human colon circular muscle, acting by an antagonistic effect on L-type Ca

The effects of menthol were not influenced by previous incubation with sodium or potassium channel inhibitors or by the removal of urothelium, suggesting a blockade of calcium channels. Electrophysiological studies have shown that menthol was able to inhibit the calcium influx through the low-voltage activated Ca
