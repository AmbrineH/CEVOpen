<p class="p">The opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) is directly responsible for Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> influx into the smooth muscle cells, partially triggering the contractile mechanism. Thus, inhibition of VDCCs has a good potential of relaxing smooth muscles, already used by several antispasmodic drugs like pinaverium [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Essential oils have been studied for their antispasmodic effect, the inhibitory effect on voltage-dependent calcium channels being the most commonly reported mechanism of action in the studies mentioned in our review (19 studies from 39). Some of these studies presented detailed mechanistic explanations of the antispasmodic effect for the non-fractioned essential oils. Makrane et al. [
