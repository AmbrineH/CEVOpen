<p class="p">Smooth muscles are a key element present in the internal structure of multiple abdominal organs including stomach, intestine, bladder or uterus, receiving innervation from the autonomic nervous system but also autocrine or paracrine stimuli [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Recently, considerable progress was made to understand in great molecular detail the complex physiology of smooth muscle contraction. Excitation-contraction coupling occurs when Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> ions enter from the extracellular side into the smooth muscle cells through sarcolemma voltage-dependent calcium channels, being also released from intracellular stores via inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) situated on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. The calcium release from ER is triggered by the binding of agonists like acetylcholine or histamine on specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the membrane of smooth muscle cells, which activate phospholipase-C (PLC) to generate IP3. After the intracellular concentration of calcium has increased, Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> ions bind to calmodulin (CaM) and phosphorylate the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) with the subsequent activation of the contractile apparatus [
