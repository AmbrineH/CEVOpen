<p class="p">Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds with terpenoid or non-terpenoid structure that can be extracted from different parts of plants (flower, buds, seed, leaves, and fruits). Many of those compounds have been identified in essential oils and clasiffied as functionalized derivatives of alcohols, ketones or aldehydes, esters, ethers, oxydes and phenols [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. The composition of an essential oil may vary according to the plantâ€™s environment and growing conditions, stage of development, methods of harvesting, extraction, and storage. The major constituents of an essential oil can also vary according to different chemotypes of the same plant species [

Although there is a tendency to correlate pharmacological properties with the presence of certain functional groups, this concept cannot be generalized. Thus, neurotoxicity cannot be reported for all ketones, even if it was reported in the case of thujone [
