<p class="p">This review showed that essential oils from thirty-nine plant species belonging to twelve families presented antispasmodic properties demonstrated by specific animal models. The plants were organized alphabetically by family and botanical name, the proposed antispasmodic mechanism being also presented, where available. The families with the highest proportion of plant species showing antispasmodic effects due to essential oils (EO) were Lamiaceae (13 species), Apiaceae (6 species), and Asteraceae (5 species). Other identified families were Annonaceae and Poaceae (3 species), Rutaceae and Verbenaceae (2 species) while Anacardiaceae, Araceae, Geraniaceae, Rosaceae and Zingiberaceae families each presented only one plant species with antispasmodic essential oil (
