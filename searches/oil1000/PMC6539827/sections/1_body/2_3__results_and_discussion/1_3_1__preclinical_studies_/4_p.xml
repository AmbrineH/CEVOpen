<p class="p">The collected data from this review confirmed other studies investigating biological effects of essential oils. Martinez-Perez et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] showed that monoterpenes frequently found in essential oils are the leading class of natural molecules responsible for the antispasmodic effect, followed by flavonoids and alkaloids. De Almeida et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] and Sarmento-Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] also showed in their studies that aromatic plants from the Lamiaceae, Apiaceae and Asteraceae families are a rich source of essential oils, highly valuable for medicinal or industrial purposes.
