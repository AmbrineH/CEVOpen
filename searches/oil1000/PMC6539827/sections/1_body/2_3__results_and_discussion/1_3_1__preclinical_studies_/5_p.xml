<p class="p">Also, analysis of the included studies showed that, generally, the experimental models used for the assesement of essential oil antispasmodic activity were represented by ex vivo techniques. Among these, the isolated guinea pig ileum method was preferred, being considered a precise pharmacological tool capable of investigating the antispasmodic effect of natural or synthetic compounds [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The ex vivo techniques are predominant due to their use without the limitations of drug bioavailability which may be a problematic issue for the in vivo models. Ex vivo methods are also well suited for mechanistic studies due to the diversity of contractile agents which could be used experimentally [
