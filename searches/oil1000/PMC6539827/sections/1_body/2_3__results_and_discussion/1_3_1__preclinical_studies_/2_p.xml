<p class="p">The majority of the presented preclinical studies used whole essential oils, the antispasmodic effect of individual chemical constituents of essential oils being rarely investigated. Sadraei et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] demonstrated antispasmodic effects not only for the essential oil from

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] investigated the spasmolytic effects of menthol, a major constituent in the essential oil from

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] tested the antispasmodic effect of several monoterpenes from 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha x villosa</italic> essential oil, carvone and rotundifolone being the most active compounds.
