<p class="p">A search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus scientific databases, including the last 20 years (1998–2018). The search terms “essential oils” and “antispasmodic” (“spasmolytic”) were used for data selection. Only articles in English were included in this work. Our study investigated the antispasmodic effect of the essential oils and was not focused on the bronchodilator and vasodilator effects, presented by other reviews.</p>
