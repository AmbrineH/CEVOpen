<p class="p">This review identified 39 plant species bearing essential oils with antispasmodic effect demonstrated in preclinical studies. The main mechanisms of the antispasmodic effect were represented by inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, modulation of potassium channels and modulation of intracellular cAMP. Certain individual components identified in the chemical composition of the essential oils studied could become promising new drug candidates but future clinical studies are needed in order to ascertain their therapeutical value.</p>
