<p class="p">The antispasmodic (spasmolytic) effect of drugs is commonly used for the reduction of excessive smooth muscle contractility, responsible for cramping and discomfort in the abdominal area, caused by multiple conditions affecting the gastrointestinal, biliary or genitourinary tract [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), biliary colic caused by gallstones, gastritis, colitis and pancreatitis or dysmenorrhea may affect large numbers of patients and usually require antispasmodic treatment for the relief of symptoms [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Additionally, antispasmodic compounds are also used for the reduction of discomfort caused by medical procedures like colonoscopy [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. A variety of synthetic antispasmodic drugs have been authorized worldwide by the regulatory agencies, the most important being anticholinergic agents (butylscopolamine), direct smooth muscle relaxants (papaverine), calcium antagonists (pinaverium) or opioid receptor modulators (trimebutine) [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Despite their clinical efficacy, the use of these molecules is often limited by the development of unpleasant and sometimes severe side effects which may reduce patient compliance and impair treatment efficiency [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Historically, a long time before the golden age of medicinal chemistry, several aromatic plants were used in traditional medicine for the treatment of different ailments in some parts of the world. In Europe, aromatic plants like peppermint or thyme have been used for medical purposes since antiquity while in Chinese or Indian traditional medicine other aromatic species like cinnamon or sandalwood were known for centuries [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Nowadays, antispasmodic botanical remedies are used by a constantly increasing number of patients for symptomatic treatment of functional dyspepsia, intestinal, colonic or ureteral spasms, gallbladder hyperactivity and uterine cramps [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In the large category of medicinal plants, aromatic plants rich in essential oils are considered a valuable and easily accessible natural resource for the development of new molecules capable of becoming drug candidates. Essential oils are complex mixtures containing mainly aromatic terpenes classified in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes according to the number of isoprene units but also phenylpropanoid compounds. These compounds are secondary metabolites formed by isoprenoid pathways in specialized secretory tissues of aromatic plants and diffused at the surface of their flowers or leaves [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The biological effects of essential oils have been extensively researched, as they can easily pass through cellular membranes and influence a variety of molecular targets from ion channels to intracellular enzymes [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiparasitary, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive or antitumoral effects of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01675" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], but the antispasmodic effect has been less studied experimentally, despite being mentioned in traditional medicine sources. Hence, this review was aimed at the investigation of the antispasmodic effect of essential oils, presenting the experimental models used for pharmacological testing with the subsequent mechanistic explanations, but also the chemical composition of the studied essential oils.
