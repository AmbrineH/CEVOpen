<p class="p">Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication following abdominal operations including cesarian section.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] Ileus is a type of functional obstruction owing to the transient impairment of intestinal motility. This interference of the passing of gastrointestinal contents leads to delayed passage of flatus and feces, delayed oral feeding, nausea, vomiting, and postoperative pain.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] The pathophysiology of POI is multifactorial and complex, including inflammatory and neurologic factors.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] Parasympathetic dysfunction following intra-abdominal manipulation is an important etiologic factor.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] Ileus can increase the health-care costs, prolong the hospital stay and reduce patient's satisfaction after surgery especially after cesarean section due to delay mother-baby bonding.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] Fast recovery following cesarean section is important for both baby and mother. Therefore, finding a safe method to improve the management of POI is of great importance.
