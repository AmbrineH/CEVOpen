The polyphenols of chamomile have anti-inflammatory property related to inhibition of proinflammatory biomarkers in macrophages (THP1) and can reduce inflammation of neurovascular units in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, chamomile has neuroprotective property due to the reduction of NO level.[
