<p class="p">The aim of this study was to examine the effect of topical application of chamomile oil on POI after cesarian section. This study was developed based on the principles of traditional Persian medicine, regarding the therapeutic role of topical application of medicinal plants on the gastrointestinal tract. To the best of our knowledge, no other similar studies examining the effects of topical application of chamomile oil on bowel movements during the early stage of POI have been conducted. Our evaluation on 150 parturient patients showed that topical chamomile oil could be effective for the improvement of POI. The data indicated that the postoperative time to first flatus, bowel sound, and defecation in intervention group significantly decreased in comparison with placebo and control groups, but there was not any significant difference in the time of hospital stay.</p>
