<p class="p">For standardization of chamomile oil, chemical composition of its essential oil was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For this purpose, 100 ml of oil was mixed with 100 ml of distilled water and the essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation using Clevenger apparatus for 5 h. The obtained essential oils were dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at low temperature (+4°C). The essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 GC with BPX5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, ft 0.25 μm); carrier gas, He; split ratio, 1:25 and using Mass Detector. The column temperature was programmed at 50°C for 5 min and heated at the rate of 3°C/min until 240°C, then raised to 300°C at a rate of 15°C/min and then kept constant for 3 min. The MS was operated at 70 eV ionization energy. Retention indices were calculated using retention times of n-alkanes. The essential oil components were identified based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Wiley mass spectral library. The major endpoint of the study was to compare time to first passage of flatus in patients of three groups. Secondary outcomes were the time from surgery to first bowel sounds, defecation, return of appetite, start oral intake, and hospital stay. In addition, rate of nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and amount of analgesic used were assessed. The outcomes were recorded based on the end of operation and times were measured in hours. Demographic data included age, body mass index, educational level, obstetrical history, duration of the operation, kind of cesarian, method of anesthesia, perception of analgesic, prior operations, and associated medical problems. Safety assessments in this study included the report of adverse events. Adverse events were defined as any complication if they occurred after the first dose of study medication and up to 2 days after the last dose. Adverse event related to drug usage include erythema, pruriency, dermatitis, and medical problems. The sample size was adjusted to detect a clinically relevant absolute difference of 6 h in the time to the first flatus between placebo and control group and 4 h in the intervention group with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 90%. We calculated that 50 patients per three study arm would be needed assuming a standard deviation of 6 h for the intervention group, 10 h for placebo and control groups, and deviation of 6 h for three groups.[

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] In total, 150 patients were required for the study with an estimated dropout rate of 10% per group. Calculations were performed using G*3power software Universität Düsseldorf, Germany. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (range), and ordinal and categorical data were summarized as counts and percentages. The analysis of categorical data was done using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The primary endpoint (time to first flatus) and secondary endpoints were analyzed using ANOVA, Robust Welch Tests, and Kruskal–Wallis test. Comparisons between groups were done by the Tukey HSD and Games–Howell test. The value of statistical significance was set at
