<p class="p">However, fortification of foods with iron can, in turn, affect the chemical stability of the food products. For instance, lipid oxidation has become a major concern in emulsion‐based food products, such as milk, beverages, and infant formula. Iron catalyzes oxidative processes by forming and decomposing lipid hydroperoxides (ROOH) into highly reactive peroxyl (ROO
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>) and alkoxyl (RO
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>) radicals. These radicals further react with unsaturated lipids, leading to the formation of more lipid radicals, thus propagating the radical chain reaction.
