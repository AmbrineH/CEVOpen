<p class="p">Liposomes are submicron‐scale spherical vesicles composed of phospholipid bilayers, which surround an aqueous compartment. This makes them suitable for the encapsulation and dispersion of both hydrophilic (compartment) and lipophilic (in bilayer) components in aqueous media.

 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">14</xref> and there is even one available example of incorporation of such iron‐loaded liposomes in milk.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">12</xref> In the latter work, no sensory defect could be detected in milk enriched with iron‐loaded liposomes, compared to non‐enriched milk, over one week of refrigerated storage. However, evidence for the potential of iron‐loaded liposomes to be used for iron supplementation in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)‐rich matrices is still scarce.
