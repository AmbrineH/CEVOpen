<p class="p">The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the ability of liposomes to encapsulate iron and thereby limit its pro‐oxidant activity when incorporated into protein‐ or surfactant‐stabilized emulsions rich in PUFAs. The oxidative stability of O/W emulsions fortified with liposomal ferrous sulfate was compared with that of emulsions containing either empty liposomes or non‐encapsulated ferrous sulfate. The physical properties (droplet size, ζ‐potential, and emulsion stability) and chemical stability of all emulsions were determined as functions of time.</p>
