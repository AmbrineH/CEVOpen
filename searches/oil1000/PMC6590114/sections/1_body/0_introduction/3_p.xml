<p class="p">Iron‐catalyzed lipid oxidation can be retarded by preventing hydroperoxides from coming into close proximity of pro‐oxidants, or by adding metal chelators such as ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA).

Beside the prevention of iron‐food interaction, encapsulation may also enhance the absorption of dietary iron.
