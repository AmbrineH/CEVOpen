<p class="p">Tween 20‐ and WPI‐stabilized emulsions containing liposomal iron, free iron, or empty liposomes were incubated for up to 13 days, and primary (conjugated dienes) and secondary (

 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, panels a and c for Tween 20, the other two for WPI stabilized emulsions). For the WPI‐stabilized emulsions, only the first 5 days of incubation are reported (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>(b), (d)), as extensive physical destabilization of the emulsions occurred later on, with macroscopic phase separation of the emulsion.
