<p class="p">From these results, a number of points can be made. First, Tween 20‐stabilized emulsions were more oxidatively stable than WPI‐stabilized emulsions, independently of the presence of iron and / or liposomes. This is particularly clear from the formation of secondary oxidation products, as the pAV was much lower in all Tween‐20 stabilized emulsions compared to WPI emulsions. This was in line with the findings of Berton

Surfactants, and particularly polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as Tween 20, form tightly packed layers, 0.5–1 nm thick, at the oil–water interface, and homogeneously cover the oil surface, while proteins usually form thicker (1–15 nm) but more porous layers

 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">36</xref> As mentioned before, the charge of the interfacial layer may affect lipid oxidation through counter ion compensation that may bring positively charged metal ions such as Cu
