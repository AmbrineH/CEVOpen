<p class="p">Second, the addition of iron actively accelerated lipid oxidation in WPI‐stabilized emulsions, whereas it only had a minor effect on the formation of CD and secondary lipid oxidation products in Tween 20‐stabilized emulsions. This could be explained by the fact that proteins themselves may have been subjected to metal‐catalyzed oxidation, which can help propagate oxidation of oil droplets surrounded by a protein‐based interfacial layer.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">37</xref> The involvement of proteins in the lipid oxidation pathways in emulsions is far from simple. It is also well‐known that proteins, such as WPI, can act as antioxidants in such systems, especially when present in the continuous phase. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>‐Lactoglobulin and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>‐lactalbumin, which are the major components of WPI, contain cysteyl residues and thus thiol groups, which can scavenge free radicals and thereby inhibit lipid oxidation.
