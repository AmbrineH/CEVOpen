<p class="p">Although the results that were obtained were not as initially hoped for, they have taught us that physically sequestrating iron and preventing it from exerting its pro‐oxidant activity through the use of liposomes is challenging when using unsaturated phosphatidylcholine. It is expected that the iron stays inside the liposomes because encapsulation efficiency remained high during storage (89%, Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In WPI‐stabilized emulsions, the amount of CD formed after 5 days of incubation was slightly higher with liposomal iron, compared to non‐encapsulated iron (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>(b)), which was somehow unexpected. The reason might be that the liposomes themselves are highly prone to oxidation, especially when they are loaded with iron (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). It may be presumed that, in the emulsions fortified with liposomal iron, lipid oxidation may have started in the phospholipid bi‐layer, forming hydroperoxides and lipid radical species; then, due to the close contact with iron, decomposition of hydroperoxides formed in the liposomal membrane could proceed rapidly, forming radical species that could in turn attack the PUFA present in the oil droplets. It is interesting to note that the initial oxidative status of the phosphatidylcholine was different from that of the fresh oil: it contained substantial amounts of primary and secondary lipid oxidation products (Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), which could have contributed to the rapid oxidation of the liposomes. This illustrates clearly the pivotal role of the components used for encapsulation, which should not result in just a physical buffer zone but also in a chemical one.
