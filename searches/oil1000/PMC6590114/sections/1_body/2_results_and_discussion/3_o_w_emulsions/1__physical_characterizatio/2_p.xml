<p class="p">For all emulsions, the zeta potential remained stable over the incubation period, and the values were always very negative (Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Whey protein isolate‐stabilized emulsions had higher net surface charge (−48 mV) than Tween 20‐stabilized emulsions (−34 mV). The negative charge of WPI‐stabilized emulsions was expected as the pH of the environment was higher than the isoelectronic point of whey proteins (pI ∼ 5.2) and similar values were found in previous work.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">29</xref> The negative surface charge recorded for the Tween 20‐stabilized emulsions was somewhat surprising, as Tween 20 is a nonionic surfactant. Nonetheless, it was in agreement with results from others,

 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">32</xref> Some results from our department (unpublished data) also suggest that phosphate ions could bind to the surface of emulsion droplets, thereby inducing such a negative surface charge even with nonionic surfactants.
