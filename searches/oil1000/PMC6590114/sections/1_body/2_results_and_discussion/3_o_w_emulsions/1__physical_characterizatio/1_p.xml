<p class="p">The droplet size distribution and average droplet size in emulsions that are freshly prepared or after 13 days of incubation at 40 °C are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Emulsions stabilized with WPI or Tween 20 had an average volume mean diameter (

 </sub>, irrespective of the presence of empty or iron‐loaded liposomes. For Tween 20, monomodal distributions were found both initially and after 13 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>(a) and Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The initial bimodal distribution found for whey protein‐stabilized emulsions was due to flocculation as is evidenced by the fact that after dilution of emulsion samples in SDS solution, the peak corresponding to the largest droplet population disappeared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>(c)). The droplet size of WPI‐stabilized emulsions was considerably larger after 13 days of incubation (Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>(d)), and also remain so after SDS treatment which indicates that coalescence occurred over the incubation period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>(d)).
