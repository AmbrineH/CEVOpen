<p class="p">In previous research, the production of liposomes loaded with ferrous sulfate was optimized for encapsulation efficiency.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">22</xref> In the present work, the liposomes were added to O/W emulsions stabilized with whey protein or Tween 20. The physical and chemical stability of these emulsions was monitored in time. Lipid oxidation was monitored through the measurement of primary and secondary oxidation products, while emulsion droplet size and zeta potential were checked as indicators for any physical change occurring during incubation.
