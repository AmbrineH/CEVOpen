<p class="p">The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of ferrous sulfate was 89% in the freshly prepared liposomes (Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), which is rather high compared to other publications. For milk fortification, the highest reported encapsulation efficiency was 67%,

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded liposome solutions may be related to differences in purity of the phosphatidylcholine source used in these studies. A study by Colletier 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">26</xref> showed that the encapsulation efficiency of proteins in liposomes depends on the type of phospholipid used, with mostly an effect of the type of hydrophilic headgroup, and not so much of the alkyl chains. They suggested that encapsulation could be improved by the establishment of electrostatic interactions between the molecule to encapsulate, and the hydrophilic headgroup of the phospholipids.
