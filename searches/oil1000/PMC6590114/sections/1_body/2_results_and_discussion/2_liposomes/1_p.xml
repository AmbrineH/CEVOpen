<p class="p">The physical properties of liposomes are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. The particle size of empty liposomes was 120 nm, while those containing iron had a slightly larger average size of 137 nm. Similar results have been obtained previously with ferrous glycinate
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">14</xref> and salidroside‐loaded liposomes.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">23</xref> In these studies, the size difference between loaded and empty liposomes was attributed to the neutralization of the electrostatic charge of iron‐loaded liposomes, leading to aggregation. However, the polydispersity index (PDI) of our liposomes was very small, indicating narrow liposome size distributions for both loaded and empty liposomes, which makes aggregation less likely. The slightly larger size of iron‐loaded liposomes compared to empty ones may have been due to osmotic pressure compensation, causing the loaded liposomes to swell slightly.
