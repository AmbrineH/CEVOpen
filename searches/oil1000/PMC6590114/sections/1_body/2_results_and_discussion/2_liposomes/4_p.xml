<p class="p">To determine the oxidative stability of the liposomes themselves during incubation, both empty and FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded liposomal suspensions were kept in refrigerated conditions for 20 h, and then incubated at 40 °C for up to 96 h. Conjugated diene (CD) values and the change in appearance (color) of the liposome suspensions over time are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. After 20 h of storage at 4 °C, CD values of FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded and empty liposomes reached 51 and 38 mmol kg oil
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. After 96 h of subsequent incubation at 40 °C, the CD values for FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded or empty liposomal suspensions increased to 75 and 45 mmol kg oil
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. This is in line with the macroscopic appearance of the liposomal suspensions: fresh FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded liposome suspensions had a blue‐greenish color, which turned into orange yellowish over the incubation period, showing that ferrous iron (Fe
 <sup class="sup">+2</sup>) was oxidized to ferric iron (Fe
 <sup class="sup">+3</sup>). Despite this, the EE% did not change over time (data not shown); from now on we will use the term iron‐loaded liposome to do justice to this effect.
