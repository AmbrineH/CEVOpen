 <sub class="sub">4</sub>‐loaded liposomes were strongly negatively charged, with zeta potential values of −43.6 and − 52.3 mV, respectively, most probably as a result of the negative surface charge of phospholipids in the liposomal bilayer membrane. This likely contributes to the high physical stability of the liposomes.

 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">27</xref> For instance, at pH 3.0, they observed that iron addition led to a reduction of the positive zeta‐potential for protein‐stabilized emulsions, and to a less negative zeta‐potential for phospholipid‐stabilized emulsions. At pH 7.0, however, no clear effect of iron on the zeta‐potential could be found.
