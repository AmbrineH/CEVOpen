<p class="p">The formation of CD hydroperoxides in the liposome suspension can be attributed to oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in the phospholipid structure.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">11</xref> The zeta potential of liposomes at pH 6.8 was approximately −45 mV, indicating the presence of negatively charged functional groups at the bilayer surface. This could attract (free) ferrous cations, bringing them in close proximity to the PUFAs, which could have promoted oxidative reactions, as illustrated by the higher values found for Fe‐loaded liposomes. In addition, lecithin generally contains trace amounts of hydroperoxides,
