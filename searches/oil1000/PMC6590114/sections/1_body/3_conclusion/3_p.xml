<p class="p">As it is of great interest, from a nutritional viewpoint, to develop foods that not only contain a good fatty acid profile (i.e., high levels of PUFA) but are also fortified in dietary iron, the encapsulation material needs to be carefully considered. For example, using more saturated phosphatidylcholine for liposome preparation, or adding cationic polymers such as chitosan, which could adsorb to the liposomal membrane (in layer‐by‐layer fashion) and repel metal cations, may be promising approaches to improve oxidative stability to emulsions fortified with ferrous sulfate‐loaded liposomes.</p>
