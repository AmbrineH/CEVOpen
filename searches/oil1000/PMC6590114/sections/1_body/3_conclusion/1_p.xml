<p class="p">This study showed that ferrous sulfate could be encapsulated at high efficiency using phosphatidylcholine‐based liposomes. The liposomes thus formed were physically stable in time; however the addition of these liposomes to emulsions did not result in higher oxidative stability compared to emulsions to which free ferrous sulfate was added. This was presumably caused by the oxidation of the liposomal membrane material itself: the phosphatidylcholine used contained PUFA, and possibly pre‐formed hydroperoxides, which were the main oxidation triggers in emulsions fortified with iron‐loaded liposomes. It should also be noted that although encapsulation efficiency was high, some non‐encapsulated iron was still present. It could thus be interesting to remove any free iron from the liposome suspension before adding it to the emulsions.</p>
