<p class="p">The size distribution, polydispersity index (PDI) and surface charge (zeta potential) of the liposomes were measured with a dynamic light‐scattering instrument (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The refractive index of the dispersant was set to 1.33 for water and that of the dispersed phase of liposome to 1.47. Samples were diluted 1000‐fold with ultrapure water prior to measurement. Samples were prepared three times independently, then each replicate was measured three times. For the zeta potential analysis, the results are expressed as a mean value in mV ± standard deviation.</p>
