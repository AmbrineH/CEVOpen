<p class="p">Liposome dispersions were prepared fresh before each set of experiments by a reverse‐phase evaporation technique as previously described,

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (except for the empty liposomes). The mixture was sonicated with a probe sonicator (Microtip 3 mm, Branson Sonifier 250, the Netherlands) for 10 min at a frequency of 20 kHz, power of 150 W and amplitude of 40%. The mixture was kept on ice during sonication to minimize temperature increase and any associated chemical degradation. Then, the organic solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator (at controlled reduced pressure and 45 °C), after which 20 mL aqueous phase containing Tween 80 (2.5%, pre‐heated at 50 °C) was added under gentle vortexing. The suspension thus obtained was passed through filter paper (0.45 µm, Whatman, Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, USA) to obtain liposomes that were stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator.
