<p class="p">The so‐called ferene method was used and adapted to determine the content of iron entrapped in the liposomes. Ferrous iron reacts with the chromogen ferene to form a blue chromophore.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">20</xref> The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of iron present in solution and can therefore be determined spectrophotometrically. The wavelength of maximum absorbance of the chromophore (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) adjusted at pH 4.5, in a 1:1 ratio (v/v).
