<p class="p">To determine the concentration of free (non‐encapsulated) iron (Fe
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>, ppm), a 2 mL liposomal ferrous sulfate suspension was placed in a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Amicon® Ultra‐4, 3000 MWCO, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and centrifuged at 4200×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 1 h at 20 °C. The filtrate was collected and diluted 100 times with ultrapure water. To determine the total iron concentration in the liposomal suspension (Fe
 <sub class="sub">T</sub>, ppm), 1 mL liposomal ferrous sulfate suspension was added to 5 mL hydrochloric acid (37%), and boiled for 20 min. The samples obtained were mixed with 1 mL HCl solution (10%). Before analysis by the ferene method, samples were diluted 100 times with ultrapure water.
