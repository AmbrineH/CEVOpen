<p class="p">The droplet size distribution of emulsions was determined using static light scattering (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments Ltd). The refractive indices of sunflower oil (1.47) and water (1.33) were used as particle and dispersant index, respectively. Five measurements were conducted per sample. Results are reported as DeBrouckere mean diameters (
