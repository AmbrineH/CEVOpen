<p class="p">After preparation, emulsions were distributed in 50 mL tubes (40 g per tube). Three different systems were studied: emulsions fortified with liposomal ferrous sulfate suspension (FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> loaded liposomes), emulsions with empty liposome suspension (empty liposomes), and emulsions fortified with non‐encapsulated ferrous sulfate solution (free FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). For both iron‐containing systems, the final iron concentration in the emulsions was 200 µmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Samples were incubated at 40 °C, on a rotating agitation device (5 rpm) for up to 13 days to prevent creaming.
