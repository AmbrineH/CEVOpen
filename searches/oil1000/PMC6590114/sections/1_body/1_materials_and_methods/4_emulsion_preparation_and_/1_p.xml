<p class="p">The aqueous phase consisted of phosphate–citrate buffer (0.18 mol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, pH 6.8) and either Tween 20 (1.5 wt%) or WPI (2 wt%). Tween 20 and WPI were dissolved in the aqueous phase the day before emulsion preparation and gently stirred overnight at room temperature. A coarse emulsion containing 30 wt% stripped sunflower oil was prepared using a rotor stator homogenizer (UltraTurrax T25 Basic Disperser with 25 mm (diameter) blade, (Janke &amp; Kunkel, IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 7000 rpm for 2 min, followed by three passes at 800 bar through a high‐pressure homogenizer (Microfluidizer M‐110Y High Pressure Pneumatic, Microfluidics, Massachusetts, USA). The cooling jacket of the homogenizer was filled with iced water to limit the temperature rise during the emulsification process. The experiments were performed twice as independent duplicates.
