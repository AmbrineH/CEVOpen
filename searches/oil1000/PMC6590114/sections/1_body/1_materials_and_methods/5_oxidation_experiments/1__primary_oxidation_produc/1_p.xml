<p class="p">The formation of conjugated diene hydroperoxides was assessed using the method described previously.
 <xref rid="jsfa9509-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">21</xref> Briefly, emulsion aliquots were diluted in isopropanol, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1200×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 4 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was recorded between 200 and 310 nm using a UV‐visible spectrophotometer (DU 720 Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Results are expressed in mmol of equivalent hydroperoxides per kg of oil (mmol eq HP kg
