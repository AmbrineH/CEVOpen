<p class="p">Dietary fibers (DF) are defined as residues of eatable plant fragments and carbohydrates that can't be absorbed or assimilated and are indigestible in the small intestine of human 
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>. It promotes important physiological effects such as laxation and blood glucose and cholesterol attenuation 
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>. Dietary fibers are composed of various categories of ingredients namely oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectic materials, inulin, lignin and other components like waxes, phytates, cutin, saponins, and resistant proteins and polyphenols 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>. Various DF sources are wheat, oat, and rice bran; sugar beet; soy; brewer's spent grain; pea; vegetables; cereal grains; woody plants; fruits; legumes; leguminous plants, psyllium, etc. have been incorporated in the recipes of certain meat products namely meatballs, patties, and sausages for nutritious daily regime improvement. DF incorporation in meat products improves functional properties such as water retention, lubrication, rheological properties, emulsion stability, neutral flavor and modification in texture 
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>. It also improves cooking yield, reduces formulation costs and enhances the palatability. Dietary Fiber intake through meat substituted with fruits, vegetables, and certain grains protects against cardiovascular diseases, diverticulitis, constipation, irritable colon, colon cancer and diabetes 
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>. Dietary fibers also act as a fat replacer. It also decreases plasma and LDLcholesterol levels, reduces the risk of dietary related problems like obesity, coronary diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, i.e., constipation, inflammatory bowel diseases, etc 
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>. Various food industries manufacture modified energy-dense foods by adding vegetable and fruit fibers. Fiber addition in meat products is considered as suitable and thus increases the cooking yield and texture in cooked meat products because of its water and fat binding properties 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>. Supplementation of DF increases the bulk and reduces cooking losses in meat products. It offers no or fever changes in textural parameters by improving water-binding abilities and also enhances economic advantages for the consumers and processors 
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>. The dietary fiber in meat products is mainly considered clinically better as compared to that of traditional meat products 
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>. Also, the incorporation of dietary fiber in meat products leads to the development of novel meat products. Various types of dietary fibers improve the quality of the meat products are given in
