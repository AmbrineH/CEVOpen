 <p> Schematic scheme of a deep subsurface oil reservoir (oil leg) with underlying brine water (water leg). Most of the biological oil degradation takes place at the oil-water transition zone (OWTZ) and in dispensed water droplets nearby. Microorganisms live attached to rock particles in a thin water film or in dispensed water droplets amidst the oil phase. </p>
