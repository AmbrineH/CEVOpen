However, solid iron(III) and manganese (IV) oxides typically are not available as electron acceptors for microbial oil degradation because they have been reduced over the millions of years and are not replenished. Therefore, the most prevalent processes are fermentation, methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, if there is a source of sulfate [
