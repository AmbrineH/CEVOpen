 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and small water inclusions were discovered in the oil phase of the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago, the world largest natural tar lake [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The 1–3 μl water droplets from Trinidad and Tobago were densely populated with complex microbial communities and actively degrading the oil. The high salinity and water-stable isotope measurements indicated that the water droplets originated from deep subsurface formation water, most likely directly form the oil reservoir feeding the natural oil seep through a geological fracture [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Taking the water droplets as a proxy for subsurface processes, it is very likely that significant microbial populations can thrive within water-filled rock pores away from the OWTZ. Consequently, microbial degradation potential in the reservoir should correlate with the water content of the different phases, building a gradient of degradation activity starting from the OWTZ at the bottom and decreasing to the top of the reservoir (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). In fact, such patterns of biodegraded oil can be found in reservoirs although they have been interpreted as diffusion gradients of alkanes from the non-degraded oil at the top of the reservoirs towards the depletion hot spot at the OWTZ [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, the findings from Tar Pits in Los Angeles and of the dispersed water droplets in the natural oil seep in Trinidad indicate that microbes reside in water pockets within the oil phase or even in the water film around sand grains [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. This concept enlarges the overall oil-water interface and should be considered as having a large impact on the degradation process. Microbial oil biodegradation can consequently occur not only at the OWTZ, but also within the oil leg (
