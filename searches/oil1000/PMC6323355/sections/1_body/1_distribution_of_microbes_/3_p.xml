<p id="par0045" class="p">It has been a paradigm for the last decades that biodegradation mostly takes place directly near the OWTZ. However, studies have shown an increasing saturated hydrocarbon content over approximately 100–130 m away from the OWTZ due to circulation and diffusion [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is always a certain amount of water also present in the oil leg either as water-saturated areas in the pore space of the rock or as a thin water film covering the rock surface in water wet reservoirs. Thus, different oil reservoirs vary in water content as well as in their oil composition [
