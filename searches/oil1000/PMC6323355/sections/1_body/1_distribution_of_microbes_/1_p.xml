 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. To understand the oil-water distribution patterns of microbes, it is important to conceptualize the oil habitat. In general, microbial degradation of oil is limited by the availability of electron acceptors because, due to thermodynamic constraints, hydrocarbons cannot be fermented without a hydrogen and acetate scavenging process. However, microbes can only conserve energy if they have direct contact to both electron donors from the oil phase and electron acceptors from the water phase [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This situation is found at the oil-water transition zone (OWTZ) beneath the oil leg, which is a hotspot of microbial growth and oil degradation [
