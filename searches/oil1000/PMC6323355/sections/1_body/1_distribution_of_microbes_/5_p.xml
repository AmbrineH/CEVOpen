<p id="par0055" class="p">Upon production, oil is pumped to the surface as an artificial mixture of water, oil and gas. One has to be aware that this mixture does not necessarily contain the true composition of the microbial communities in the subsurface. Most of the microbes that thrive either at the OWTZ or in the water-filled compartments in the oil leg will thrive attached to the rock matrix rather than planktonic in the water phase and will not appear in oil or produced water. Furthermore, cells not attached to the rock are probably present in dense biofilms at the oil-water interface.</p>
