<p id="par0060" class="p">Most studies on oil microbiomes classify samples from oil wells as either oil or water phase. The natural water phase mostly consists of formation water, which is naturally present within porous rock as explained above [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The amount and composition of formation water, its natural flow-rate and its flow-path through the oil field can influence the microbial community [

 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Most studies assume that DNA extracted from the formation water represents the microbiome of the total reservoir [

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, analysis of water- and oil phases have revealed vast differences between their microbial community compositions [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The bacterial diversity in the oil phase [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and species richness [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] appeared to be much higher than those of the water phase. Some bacteria might attach directly to the oil surface, while others remain in the water phase.
