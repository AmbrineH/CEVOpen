<p id="par0085" class="p">Oil quality is determined by the degree of biodegradation and physical processes during oil production such as water injection or phase fractionation explained above. Those processes lead to lower concentrations of specific isomers, hydrocarbons, sulfur-, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing compounds [
 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] and an increase in oil viscosity, metals and microbial metabolites such as organic acids or sulfur compounds. Biodegraded oil reservoirs typically consist of oil-water emulsified fluids and systematic gradients built by different oil components [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. For instance, isoprenoids and n-alkanes concentration decrease towards the OWTZ as they are degraded faster than aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. There, the degradation of oil is also controlled by the nutrient availability in the individual reservoir [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In contrast to many oil reservoirs, the bulk water contained in oil of the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago revealed that concentrations of essential nutrients, such as 95 mg/L ammonia and 5 mg/L phosphate, were not growth-limiting [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] demonstrating again that conditions within the oil phase allow biodegradation [
