<p id="par0105" class="p">Taken together, a correlation between functional gene occurrence and reservoir temperature has already been detected in nature. Oil degradation is highest at lower temperatures and reservoirs are more or less sterile at temperatures above 80 °C. Temperature is one of the major factors influencing microbial community composition and function in oil reservoirs producing trends on a genus level but not always on an order level. In general, it can be concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Alpha-, Gamma-,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Epsilonproteobacteria</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Euryarchaeota</italic> are ubiquitous in oil reservoirs across all temperature ranges. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) thrive from 4-85 °C [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Hence, no general predictions can be made on phylum or class level based on the oil reservoir temperature. On order and genus level, however, we can see clear temperature preferences as some orders, most of them archaea, were only isolated from high temperature reservoirs. Thus, they may serve as indicators for determination of 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> reservoir temperature. However, a general prediction of microbial community composition based on temperature alone is still not possible.
