<p id="par0090" class="p">The geology of an oil reservoir determines the temperature, pH and salinity, which influence the composition and metabolic activity of the indigenous microbiota. Temperature is one of the most important factors determining microbial community composition in oil reservoirs [

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Generally, temperature is higher in reservoirs during primary production before injection, compared to similar reservoirs where water injections cool down the reservoir during secondary production [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The maximum temperature for hydrocarbon degradation in oil reservoirs is generally accepted to be around 82 °C [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. The extreme solvent stress of the oil increases with elevated temperature and most likely the integrity of the cell membranes suffers. A study detected hyperthermophilic microorganisms in reservoirs with well temperatures up to 131 °C [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. However, as the real conditions in the habitat could not be determined, it is highly unlikely that the organisms really thrived at that temperature 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>. So far, the record in hyperthermophilic growth is at 95 °C by the bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Aquifex pyrophilus</italic> and at 113 °C by the archaeon 
 <italic class="italic">Pyrolobus fumarii,</italic> which of course did not take place in the presence of hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Therefore, the detection of life at 131 °C is questioned by the indirect estimation of the oil temperatures and the so far known temperature maxima of microbes [
