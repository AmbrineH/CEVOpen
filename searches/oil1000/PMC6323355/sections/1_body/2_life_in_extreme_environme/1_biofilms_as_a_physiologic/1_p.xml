<p id="par0070" class="p">Microbial life in oil reservoirs faces severe conditions with multiple stressors such as toxicity of the oil and low water activity. In addition, planktonic microorganisms often do not have access to both electron donor and electron acceptor as a prerequisite for microbial energy conservation and must attach to the oil-water interface. One microbial adaption to these harsh conditions is organization in biofilms. Microbial biofilms are widely distributed in nature and belong to the most successful strategies of life on earth [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The formation of biofilms was shown in the presence of crude oil under aerobic conditions such as in an oil lake in the Kuwaiti desert [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] or as the formation of microbial mats by cyanobacteria in seawater [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Generally, biofilms are defined as ‘aggregates of microorganisms in which cells are frequently embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are adherent to each other and/or a surface’ [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. EPS are a gel-like network that keep the microbial aggregates together in order to provide mechanical stability to biofilms in flowing or moving systems such as water and oil [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[41]</xref>]. The sticky coating of a biofilm matrix is a protective layer against external environmental stressors including desiccation, temperature and salt concentrations in oil fields. In the presence of crude oil, many bacteria produce EPS, which act as biosurfactants to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or n-alkanes [

 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>]. In addition, a biofilm provides space for mutualistic micro-consortia, confined gradients increasing habitat diversity, resource capture by nutrient sorption, nutrient transport by channel systems, exchange of signaling molecules and acts as a barrier against toxic compounds by increased tolerance due to horizontal gene transfer [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[49]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[52]</xref>]. Because of the protective and nutrient transport properties of biofilms, it is not surprising that they have been found at the alkane-water interface of n-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>-C
 <sub class="sub">28</sub>) and n-alcohols (C
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub>) [

 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Some enrichment cultures were able to build biofilms on the surface of phenanthrene and other PAHs to overcome the mass transfer limitations during the degradation [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Biofilm formation also depends on the solubility of the PAHs; lower solubility results in more attached cells and biofilm formation to overcome the mass transfer limitations [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Due to these advantages of biofilms in toxic and extreme environments, we propose that biofilm formation is also the predominant form of life in oil reservoirs.
