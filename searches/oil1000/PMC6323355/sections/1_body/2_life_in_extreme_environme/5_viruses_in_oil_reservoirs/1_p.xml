 <xref rid="bib0540" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[108]</xref>]. By lysing their bacterial hosts, bacteriophages cause the release and turnover of nutrients such as proteins and nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="bib0525" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Lysis can also result in changes in the bacterial community composition known as the ’killing the winner’ hypothesis [

 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0545" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], meaning that host-specific predators (viruses) attack a bacterial population if the bacterial density increases over a certain threshold abundance. It thus prevents a species from emerging and maintains the coexistence of all species in the system [
 <xref rid="bib0550" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. ‘Killing the winner’ models predict that density- and frequency-dependent viral predation suppresses rapidly growing hosts, which leads to increasing host diversity [
 <xref rid="bib0555" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. Nevertheless, phages can also integrate into the host’s genome as prophages (lysogeny). The ‘piggyback-the-winner’ model predicts relationships between virus-like-particles and host densities. The main advantage for the phage lies in continuous proliferation by the regular host cell growth and division, without killing the host [
 <xref rid="bib0555" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. Prophages protect the microbial cells from new infections by closely related phages. Due to the protection from lysis and other infections, prophages can drive bacterial evolution by transfer of genetic information between multiple hosts and promote thereby an increased diversity [
 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib0565" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[113]</xref>]. The gene transfer can affect the capacity for biofilm formation, the abilities of hydrocarbon-degradation, antibiotic resistance or the virulence in a positive or a negative way [
