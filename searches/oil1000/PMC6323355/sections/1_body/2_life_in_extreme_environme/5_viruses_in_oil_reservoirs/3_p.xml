<p id="par0130" class="p">The studies presented have shown that viruses occur in oil reservoirs. However, questions concerning their ecological importance and the extent to which they shape and control microbial communities and processes remain to be elucidated. Studies on oil-contaminated waters such as spills and plumes and the correlated bioremediation processes propose a phage-driven microbial loop [

 <xref rid="bib0580" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. The authors proposed that phages ensure a persistent nutritional biomass turnover enabling bacterial hydrocarbon degradation [

 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>]. We could not find any support of either ‘killing the winner’ or ‘piggyback-the-winner’ processes in natural oil reservoirs in the literature indicating an open field for ecological research.
