 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, oil reservoirs offer a broad range of niches for a multitude of bacteria and archaea, such as sulfate-, nitrate-, and iron-reducers, fermenters, acetogens, and methanogens [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The microbial degradation of oil results in a higher fraction of bitumen and eventually leads to the deterioration of the worldâ€™s oil resources. Since oil is still one of the most important resources for industry and energy [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], it is crucial to gain insights into the microbiology of oil reservoirs. Over the past decades, numerous reviews on oil microbiology have investigated the extent of biodegradation, the effect of microbes on oil quality, oil production methods and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) [
