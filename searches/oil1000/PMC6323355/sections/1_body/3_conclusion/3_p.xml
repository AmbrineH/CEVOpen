<p id="par0145" class="p">Another important factor are syntrophic interactions between different microorganisms. Often, planktonic microorganisms do not have access to both electron donor and electron acceptor as prerequisites for microbial energy conservation, especially fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Therefore, we suggest that the methanogenic degradation of oil mainly takes place in mutualistic microbial consortia organized in biofilms where fermenting microbes transfer electrons either directly or indirectly to the methanogens. In laboratory experiments, many oil-degrading enrichment cultures and isolates build biofilms on the surfaces of alkane phases or PAHÂ´s. Since known advantages of biofilms include protection against toxic compounds and desiccation and syntrophic electron transfer between fermenting organisms and methanogenic archaea, we propose that life in deep subsurface oil reservoirs is arranged predominantly in biofilms.</p>
