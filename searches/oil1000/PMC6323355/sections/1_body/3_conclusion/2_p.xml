<p id="par0140" class="p">Water samples from oil reservoirs obtained by pumping comprise a foamy mixture of oil, formation or injection water, and gas. We propose to examine both the water and the emulsified water within the oil phase of a sample to get a better picture of the entire community present in an oil reservoir. However, production water samples cannot provide information about the real distribution of the microorganisms in the deep biosphere but may provide insight into which organisms are involved in oil degradation.</p>
