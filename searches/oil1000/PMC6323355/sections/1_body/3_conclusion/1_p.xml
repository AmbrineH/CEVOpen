<p id="par0135" class="p">Microbial oil degradation in deep subsurface oil reservoirs mainly takes place at the so-called oil-water transition zone (OWTZ) or oil-water interface. Even, if the OWTZ is a degradation hotspot, we propose that microbial oil degradation also takes place in small water-saturated parts of the rock containing actively living microbes or even in the thin water film of water wet reservoirs. Thus, biodegradation is distributed in a gradient through the entire oil field starting from the OWTZ and following the water content to the top of the reservoir. Therefore, the water inclusions should be considered as having a notable impact on overall oil degradation process in the deep subsurface.</p>
