<p id="par0150" class="p">An important influence regarding degradation rates of crude oil is reservoir temperature, with most inhabited reservoirs ranging from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions. The largest microbial diversity occurs at moderate temperatures of up to 55 °C, where higher metabolic activity and increased abundance of genes involved in carbon cycling and the degradation of aromatic and other organic compounds occurs. Above ∼80 °C, oil reservoirs are considered to be sterile.</p>
