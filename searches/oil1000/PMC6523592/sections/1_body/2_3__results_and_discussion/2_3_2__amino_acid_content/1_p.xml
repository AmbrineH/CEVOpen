<p class="p">In 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the essential and non-essential amino acid contents of both insect meals and the soybean meal are presented. Roughly similar amino acid spectra were obtained for both insect meals as compared to the soybean meal. Remarkable are the higher methionine contents in the meals of both insect species, and the higher lysine content in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal than in the soybean meal. In diets for Japanese quails and other poultry that are based on cornâ€“soybean meal, methionine is a growth-limiting amino acid that is supplemented [
