The obtained data revealed that the two tested insects were rich in the amino acids aspartic acid, lysine and proline. This is only partly in accordance with scientific literature where it was reported that phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine and lysine contents are the highest in Lepidopteran and Dipteran species [
