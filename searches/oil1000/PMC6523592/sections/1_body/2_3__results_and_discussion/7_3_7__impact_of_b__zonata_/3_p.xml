<p class="p">The data presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> also shows that the triglyceride and cholesterol thyroxin values of quails fed with the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meals, respectively, were significantly higher than the control. These results were in accordance with Loponte et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], who observed high values in the serum of triglycerides and cholesterol in the Barbary partridge fed on 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic>, as well as Duwa et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], who observed significant differences in the triglycerides and cholesterol levels in blood of rabbits that were fed on fish meal and maggot meal. Furthermore, it is suggested that higher triglyceride levels might be due to the higher lipid contents of the two insect-containing diets.
