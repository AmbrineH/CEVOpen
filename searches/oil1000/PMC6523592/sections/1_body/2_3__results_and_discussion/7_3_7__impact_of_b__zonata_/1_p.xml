<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, there was an increase in serum total protein by using 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal as compared to the control diet. This increase was higher for 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal than for 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic>. Moreover, the ratio of albumin to globulin was higher in the control meal than in the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals. Since total protein, albumen and globulin ratios are generally influenced by total protein intake, total serum protein may be applied as an indirect measurement of dietary protein quality [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the albumin to globulin ratio was low in the two tested insect meals. Abnormal serum albumin content usually indicates an alteration of normal systemic protein utilization. In addition, a low albumin:globulin ratio indicates better disease resistance and immune response of birds [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. This is in line with other studies of broilers fed on 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], of laying hens on 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] and of Barbary partridges on
