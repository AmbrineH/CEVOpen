<p class="p">The contents in Ca, Mg and P were higher in the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal than in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and soybean meals. Generally, the Zn content of both insect species was lower, and the Ca content of both insect species was considerably higher than in the soybean meal. The Ca content is especially of interest since, for animal nutrition, Ca plays vital roles in many enzyme-mediated processes like blood clotting and bone building, as well as by virtue of its phosphate salts in neuromuscular function [

 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal was higher than that recorded for the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and soybean meals, while the Fe, Zn and Mg contents of

 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic>. Furthermore, Mg and S contents were relatively similar in the meals of the two tested insect species.
