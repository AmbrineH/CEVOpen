<p class="p">Since the lipid content of soybean meal is comparably low and negligible in comparison, its impact as a lipid and fatty acid source is also low. Therefore, the fatty acid composition of corn oil was considered as well. As shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, both insect meals contained both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Overall, the saturated fatty acid contents of both insect meals were 3.5 times higher than of the soybean meal and corn oil, whereas the unsaturated fatty acid contents were lower in comparison. The comparatively high amount of saturated fatty acids is typical for animal-derived fat and is in accordance with Rumpold and Schlüter [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], who reviewed the average amounts of saturated fatty acids of insect orders from 30% for Hymenoptera to 41% for Isoptera, and unsaturated fatty acids from 15% for Diptera to 39.76% for Lepidoptera and 48% for Hymenoptera. In comparison, both the Lepidopteran 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and the Diperan 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> in our insect meal samples had high saturated fatty acid contents of 41.45% and 46.18%, respectively. The palmitoleic and oleic acid contents in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal were higher than in the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal, while the palmitic, tricosylic and lignoceric acid contents were somewhat similar in the two insect meals, and absent in the soybean meal. The detection of tricosylic acid in the insect oils was remarkable, since fatty acids with an uneven number of carbon atoms are seldomly found in nature. Moreover, the linoleic acid content was more than two times higher in the soybean meal and 3.5–4 times higher in corn oil than in the two insect meals. Regarding the much higher lipid content of both insect meals, they did actually contain more linoleic acid than the soybean meal. The 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal contained 3.92% and the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal 4.51% linoleic acid, whereas the soybean meal contained only 0.76% linoleic acid. Lipid requirements of Japanese quail feed comprise 1% linoleic acid at the growing stage [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], but because corn oil was added as supplementary lipid source in all diets, no conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of the insect meals to the quails´ lipid provisions. Theoretically, 1 kg of quail chick feed would have to contain 255 g 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal or 222 g 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal in order to provide 10 g (1%) of linoleic acid without additional lipid sources. It can thus be concluded that the insect meal contents in diet A and B were both not high enough to be the sole provider of linoleic acid to meet the quails’ requirement. The corn oil supplement could be reduced, however. Furthermore, the data showed that linolenic, stearic and arachidic acids were not detected in the two insect meals, but could be found in the soybean meals.
