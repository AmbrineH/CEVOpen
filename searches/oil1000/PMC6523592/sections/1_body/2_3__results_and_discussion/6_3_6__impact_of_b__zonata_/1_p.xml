 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. The feed conversion ratios of Japanese quail were significantly increased (

 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals, respectively, as compared with the control diet containing only soybean meal (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The highest feed intake and lowest body weight gain were observed for the control diet as compared to the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Moreover, significant differences were observed between the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals. The final weight was highest and the feed conversion ratio lowest for the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal.
