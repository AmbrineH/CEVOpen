<p class="p">The reduced feed intake and increased feed conversion ratio could be due to the increased dietary energy levels of the insect-containing diets, as observed by others [
 <xref rid="B58-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. On the other hand, Gheisari et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] observed that dietary energy levels did not influence the feed conversion ratios of Japanese quails. In our study, the higher dietary level was mostly due to a higher lipid content in the insect-based diets, and it was suggested that feeding on different values of high-fat diet had no impact on growth performance, carcass composition and hormonal level composition [
 <xref rid="B61-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In our study, diet B (with the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal) had the highest lipid and caloric energy contents. Nevertheless, the body weight gain and final weight were higher, and the feed conversion ratio lower, for quails fed 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal. Consequently, more research is required on iso-caloric diets and diets with the same lipid contents containing 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals. Furthermore, the chicks remained healthy throughout the study, and no mortality occurred during the experimental period. This response could be due to the nutritional content of insect meal, which is highly nutritive. These results coincide with those observed by other authors [

 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In contrast, other studies have indicated that there are no differences between feeding insect meals and conventional meals on the growth performance of poultry birds [
 <xref rid="B63-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The percentage of insect feed addition and the replacement of other feed ingredients such as soybean or fish meal with regard to the respective control diet (as well as the individual bird species) has to be considered when comparing these different feeding trials.
