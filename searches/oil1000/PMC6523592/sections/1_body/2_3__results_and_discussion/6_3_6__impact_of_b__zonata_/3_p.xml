<p class="p">The percentages of carcass in the quail birds that were fed on the two tested insect meals were significantly higher than the control (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The comparably high weight of carcass could be due to the fact that 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals have a high content of protein, essential amino acid (Lysine, phenyl-alnine, threonine and isoleucine), fat and energy. Meanwhile, the percentages of liver, heart, spleen and bursa were slightly higher for both insect meals compared with the control diet. These findings in the lymphoid organs can be attributed to an increase in the immune system of growing quail chicks. These results coincide with those obtained by Bovera et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and Schiavone et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], who showed the highest weight of carcass and lymphoid organs in broilers fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal as a protein source. The obtained results suggest that an inclusion of 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> larvae meals in quail diets as a replacement for soybean meal improves the feed conversion ratio and promotes the growth of quail chicks.
