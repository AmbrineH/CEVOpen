<p class="p">Previous studies on the chemical composition of a variety of insect species showed their high nutritive value [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. For instance, crude protein contents up to 40%–70% (on a dry matter (DM) basis), lipid contents as high as 9%–25% DM, unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio up to 5.8–8.2 and crude fiber contents of 0.93%–11% DM were found [

 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The crude protein content of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal (58.1% DM) was slightly higher than of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal (51.2% DM) and soybean meal (44.0% DM) as shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In general, the protein content varied for each insect species from 13% to 70% [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], while Rumpold and Schlüter [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported that the average protein contents of insects ranged from 35.34% for the order Isoptera (termites) to 61.32% for the order Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, locusts). It can be concluded that the protein content of both insect species investigated is high, with values above 50% (based on dry matter (DM)). The crude lipid content of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal (33.1%) was higher than of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal (25.3%), and considerably higher than the soybean meal (1.9%). The carbohydrate and fiber contents of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meals were comparable with 4.9% and 5.2% carbohydrates and 10.9% and 10.7% fibers, respectively, while the carbohydrate content of the soybean meal was much higher (28.51%), and its fiber content was slightly lower at 7.3%.
