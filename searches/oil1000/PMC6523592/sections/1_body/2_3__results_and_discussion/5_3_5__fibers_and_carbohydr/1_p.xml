<p class="p">The data presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00136-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> show that the fiber and carbohydrate contents in the two tested insect species were fairly similar and overall lower than in the soybean meal. The fiber contents of both insect species were much higher than the carbohydrate contents. In comparison, carbohydrate content was higher and fiber content was lower in the soybean meal than in the two insect meals. The common form of insect fiber is insoluble chitin contained mainly in their exoskeletons [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The amount of fiber in seven different insects species varied from 
 <italic class="italic">Locusta migratoria</italic> (27%) to 
 <italic class="italic">Gryllus assimilis</italic> (11%) based on dry matter. Chitin could improve the immune response and was considered to possess antibacterial properties towards pathogenic bacteria as well as antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. It was also shown that chitin could function as an antifungal agent [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Moreover, Khoushab and Yamabhai [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] noticed antibacterial properties of chitin effective against bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio cholerae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides fragilis</italic>. The antibacterial mechanism of chitin is based on induced interaction between the positively charged chitin molecules and the negatively charged surface of the bacteria, resulting in leakage due to the cell wall of bacteria [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Another mechanism includes inducing the accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins and chitinases for the activation of defense mechanisms in the host organism [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Since chitin content was not analyzed in this study, it cannot be concluded that the fiber content and chitin content are one and the same. Although the presence of chitin is certain, it is assumed that other fibers are present in insects.
