<p class="p">The comparative study of two different insect species, 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> (Diptera) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> (Lepidoptera), as a soybean meal replacement in feed for Japanese quail chicks showed that even if the two insects have slightly different nutritional compositions, meals from both insects can successfully replace 50% of soybean meal in the diets of growing quail chicks at a constant protein content of 22%.The feeding trials with insect meals resulted in improved growth, feed performance parameters, carcass characteristics and biochemical indices with regard to the control group fed only soybean meal as a protein source. It is suggested that the increased caloric energy content of the experimental diets containing insect meal might at least partly be responsible for the increased performance of Japanese quails in the feeding trials.
