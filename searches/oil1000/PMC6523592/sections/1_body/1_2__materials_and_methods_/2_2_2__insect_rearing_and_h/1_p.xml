<p class="p">Both the Cotton leafworm 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and the peach fruit fly 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> were reared and maintained in the insect farm of the Department of Biological Application, Nuclear Research Center (NRC), Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA). The adults of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> were fed on sucrose solution (10% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v)</italic> while the adult diet of 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> consisted of one part yeast hydrolyzate (enzymatic) and three parts sucrose. The rearing cages of the flies were additionally provided with drinking water. The hatched larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> were reared on castor bean 
 <italic class="italic">Ricinus communis</italic> leaves until the last instar (sixth instar) within 13–15 days, while the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> were reared on a semi-artificial diet consisting of 28% wheat bran, 7% yeast, 3% sucrose, 0.28% sodium benzoate, 1.5% HCl and 50.20% water until the last instar (third instar) within seven to eight days. The rearing conditions were 25 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5% relative humidity (RH), with a photoperiod of 14 L: 10 D hours. The full grown larvae were collected, ground using a blender (3.8 liter) (Hamiliton Beach blender model HBF900S, VA, USA) and then frozen for storage. Frozen, ground larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> were oven-dried at 40 °C for 24 h before use in feeding trials and analyses of their chemical compositions were performed.
