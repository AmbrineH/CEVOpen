<p class="p">Blood samples were collected from slaughtered birds and left to clot, then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the resulting serum was stocked at −20 °C for hormonal and chemical analyses. Serum total proteins, total antioxidant, triglyceride, total cholesterol, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphates (ALP) were determined using commercial kits produced by Stanbio Company, USA using a computerized spectrophotometer (model Milton Roy 1201, Ivyland Road Ivyland, PA, USA). Serum globulin values were calculated by subtracting albumin values from their corresponding total protein values of the same sample. All analyses were performed in triplicates, respectively.</p>
