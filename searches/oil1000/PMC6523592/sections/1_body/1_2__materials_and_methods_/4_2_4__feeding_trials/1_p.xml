<p class="p">The impact of replacing 50% of the soy bean meal with 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal at a constant protein content on the performance of Japanese quails was investigated in feeding trials in comparison to the control diet. The chicks were maintained at the poultry experimental farm of the Biological Application Department, Nuclear Research Center, EAEA. A total of 360 Japanese quail chicks (180 male, 180 female), seven days old and weighing 22 g on average were randomly allotted three dietary treatments (120 chicks in each group), each consisting of three pens as replicates with 40 chicks (20 female and 20 male) per pen. Three basal diets based on corn–soybean meal were formulated and fed to the Japanese quail experimental groups. Three different sources of protein meal were used: soybean meal was used in the control diet, 50% of the soybean meal was substituted with 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> meal in diet A and 50% of the soybean protein was substituted with 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> meal in diet B (

 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], additional corn meal and oil were added to the insect diets (A and B). This, as well as the replacement of soybean meal, resulted in ~11% higher energy contents (approx.. 300 kcal/kg) of the insect-containing diets in comparison to the control diet. The three feeding trials were carried out in 45 days. All groups were farmed in electrically heat-controlled batteries: in the first seven days the temperature was controlled at 35 °C, while 28 ± 2 °C was maintained after that until the end of the experiment. RH was 50 ± 5% and photoperiod was 14 L: 10 D hours.
