<p class="p">Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were determined for the overall experimental period (38 days). All measurements were performed on the pen basis using a high precision electronic scale. Moreover, the mortality was monitored daily during the whole experimental period. Furthermore, at the end of an experimental period of 45 days, 10 quails from each feeding group (chosen on the basis of average pen final body weight, five females and five males) per pen were weighed and slaughtered for carcass analysis. Carcass, liver, heart and spleen weights were calculated for each slaughtered bird as well as a relative percentage of live body weight.</p>
