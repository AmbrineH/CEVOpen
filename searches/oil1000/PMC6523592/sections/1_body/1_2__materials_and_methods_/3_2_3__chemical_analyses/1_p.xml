<p class="p">The amino acid profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and soybean meal were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following the method by Alikwe et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Moreover, carbohydrate content was estimated following the method according to Albalasmeh [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The total lipids were extracted and purified according to Folch et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The crude fat contents of the insect meals were analyzed according to Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Fatty acid compositions of total lipids were analyzed as described by Knapp [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. A gas chromatograph (hp 6890, Agilent, CA, USA) equipped with innowax-crosslinked polyethylene glycol column 30 m was used for deferential fatty acid analysis. Furthermore, elemental compositions were analyzed by an Energy Dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX, Jeol, Japan) attached to a scanning electron microscope model HEOL-JSM 4500 (Jeol, Japan). All analyses were performed in triplicates, respectively.
