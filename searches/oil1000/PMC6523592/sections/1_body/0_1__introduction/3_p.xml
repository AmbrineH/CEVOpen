<p class="p">The African or Egyptian cotton leafworm 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic> is a common caterpillar (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Africa and feeds on many different crops and vegetables, while the peach fruit fly 
 <italic class="italic">Bactrocera zonata</italic> (Diptera: Tephritidae) feeds on a wide range of fruits and vegetables [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In this context, these two species could be processed sustainably into feedstuffs using food residues. In general, the late larval stages in Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects are particularly recommended to utilize as feedstuff, since they are easy to collect and harvest, large in size and have high nutrient contents [

 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. A major advantage of using insects like 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> as feed insects is the fact that rearing expertise and mass rearing facilities already exist due to existing insect production for biological insect pest control using sterile insect technique (SIT) in. In the present study, two different insect meals derived from 
 <italic class="italic">B. zonata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> larvae were compared in Japanese quail diets. The impact of insect-based feed on the productive performance (growth performance and carcass characteristics) and animal welfare (evaluated by the blood traits) of Japanese quail was investigated.
