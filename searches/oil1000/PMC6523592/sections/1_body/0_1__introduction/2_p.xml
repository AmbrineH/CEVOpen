<p class="p">With that being said, livestock production generally requires high-quality protein as feed [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Soybean, fish meal and animal protein meal are commonly used as protein sources in poultry feed in Egypt. The use of meat protein meals has added constraint to poultry production due to its involvement in the transmission of diseases. Nevertheless, meat is still used in a number of developing countries [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and therefore it is necessary to search for locally available, sustainable, safe and low-cost feedstuffs to replace fish meal and other traditional animal protein sources as well as soybean. Edible insects have been suggested as a potential sustainable alternative source for livestock feed because of their high-value protein, their beneficial nutrient composition and their comparably low environmental impact [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It is proposed that edible insects can play an important role as a sustainable feed source since they are able to transform and valorize low nutritive products into high-quality feed with limited pressure on global land, water and energy resources. Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects in particular are suggested as an alternative protein source for livestock feed due to their comparably high contents in high quality protein, and also because they can be produced in a short amount of time and can reared at low costs on different side stream-residues [
