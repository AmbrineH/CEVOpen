A focus on the research and development of systems in compliance with pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, with a clear evaluation of health and safety guidelines and considerations for operation, and complete with a techno-economic model of the technology, will help realize its potential for implementation and scale-up in pharmaceutical processes in the near future.
