<p class="p">The versatility and compatibility of supercritical fluid processing techniques also allow smart coating materials such as cyclodextrins to be used as encapsulating agents, which is useful in the nanoencapsulation and microencapsulation of flavors and aromas [

 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] using little to no organic solvents during pharmaceutical formulation processing, and a “cleaner” product whereby the efficient removal of the residual solvent by supercritical CO
