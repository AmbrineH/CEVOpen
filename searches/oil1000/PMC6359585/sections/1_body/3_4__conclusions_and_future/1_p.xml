<p class="p">The favorable and tunable properties of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> make it a very attractive option in processing products for pharmaceutical applications, particularly regarding the microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation of drugs or active ingredients for sustained or targeted release. The process that is selected depends on the properties of the active ingredient and coating material of interest, such as the solubility, hydrophobicity, molecular weight, glass transition temperatures, crystallinity, etc. The SAS method is very useful in the micronization and formation of amorphous drug particles. However, not all biopolymers can be processed using SAS due to the interaction of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with the polymer. The SFEE technique provides an elegant alternative to the SAS process, which can be used to process a wider range of drug delivery polymers such as PCL, PLGA, PHBV, etc. Recent developments in combining a fluidization coating with SAS or supercritical drying also offer opportunities for the more specific design of a controlled-release formulation. The supercritical foaming technique allows three-dimensional microporous polymeric structures with encapsulated drugs to be produced. This provides opportunities to develop controlled release scaffold or implant materials.
