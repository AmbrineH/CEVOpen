<p class="p">In particles from gas-saturated solutions (PGSS), supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> acts as a solute, diffusing and dissolving into a melt or solution, forming a gas-saturated solution. The solution will then be expanded via a nozzle into a spray chamber at atmospheric pressure. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas then leaves the gas-saturated polymer/fat droplets and also during expansion, the temperature of the mixture reduces drastically due to the Jouleâ€“Thomson effect, hence causing the polymer solidification [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00021-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) involves mixing an aqueous solution, containing the active material and wall material, and saturating the solution with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Subsequently, the gas-saturated solution is expanded via a nozzle into a spray chamber at atmospheric pressure. This leads to the encapsulation of key compounds by the co-precipitation of the coating and core materials. PGSS holds several advantages over conventional methods such as coacervation, spray-drying, and emulsion techniques due to its mild operating conditions and its ability to produce solvent-free and homogenous products. This is especially beneficial in preserving the stability of ingredients such as essential oils [
