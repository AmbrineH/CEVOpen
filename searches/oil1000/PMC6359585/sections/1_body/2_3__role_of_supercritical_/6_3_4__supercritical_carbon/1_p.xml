<p class="p">Due to its low viscosity and high diffusivity, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can diffuse very efficiently into solutions, polymer melts, and also fatty acids. Using this property of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, strategies for producing microencapsulated particles from an aqueous solution can be achieved.
