<p class="p">The RESS of polymer solutions in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has been limited by low polymer solubility at temperatures below 80 Â°C [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. To overcome this limitation, the RESS process can be modified with the application of a co-solvent. The solubility of the polymers in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases significantly with low molecular weight alcohols as co-solvents, such as ethanol and methanol [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The modified process is termed as rapid expansion of supercritical solutions with a non-solvent (RESS-N). In the RESS-N process, a suspension of the active ingredient in a co-solvent containing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and a dissolved polymer is sprayed through a nozzle to atmospheric pressure. The co-solvent, in pure form, is a non-solvent for the polymer, and is only sparingly soluble in the polymer particles that are produced during expansion [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Therefore, the particles do not agglomerate after expansion, since there is no swelling of polymer products. The modified RESS has been applied to the encapsulation of proteins [
