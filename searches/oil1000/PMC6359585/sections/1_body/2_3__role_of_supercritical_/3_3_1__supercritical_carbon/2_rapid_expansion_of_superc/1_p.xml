<p class="p">In the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS), the active ingredient and coating ingredient are dissolved in a supercritical fluid (acting as a solvent). The supercritical fluid solution containing the solutes is maintained at high pressure before expanding across a fine throttling device, such as a capillary or orifice nozzle [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00021-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) encapsulation applications, the microcrystalline pharmaceutical dominates the core of the particles, while the slower precipitating polymer coats the surface. The advantages of RESS include its capacity for a wide range of inorganic, organic, and polymeric materials, low-temperature operation, and single-step processing [

 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00021-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows some examples of bioproducts that are encapsulated using the RESS process. The prerequisite of this process is that both the active ingredient and the coating material must be very soluble in supercritical fluids. This typically applies to lower molecular weight polymers and small active ingredients such as non-polar small molecule compounds.
