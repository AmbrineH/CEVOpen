<p class="p">CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has relatively accessible critical conditions of 73.8 bar and 31.1 °C. Its low critical temperature allows processes to be developed at close to ambient temperatures (e.g., at 35 °C). Other favorable qualities of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> include its non-toxic and non-flammable nature, gas-like viscosity, liquid-like density with enhanced solubility, microbial inactivation abilities, and relatively low cost. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00021-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the properties of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which allow it to be applied for various microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation processes. The selection of the processing techniques used for microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation depends on the materials and thermodynamic properties of the active ingredient, the coating material, and any suitable co-solvent that is available. Other criteria in the selection of a suitable supercritical fluid technique include the desired formulation (size, morphology, release profiles, porosity, etc.).
