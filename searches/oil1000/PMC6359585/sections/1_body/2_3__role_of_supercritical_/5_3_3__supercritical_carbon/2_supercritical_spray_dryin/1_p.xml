<p class="p">Supercritical spray drying refers to the spraying of an aqueous solution into an excess of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Similar to hot air spray-drying, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> spray drying utilizes the increased solubility of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with water at supercritical conditions. The break-up of the aqueous solution into very tiny droplets (with high surface area to volume ratios) enhances the mass transfer of water into the supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the drying chamber and therefore, the water is removed continually from the drying chamber.
