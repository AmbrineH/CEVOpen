<p class="p">This technique is suitable in the microencapsulation formulations where the coating material is a water-soluble material (such as sugars, starches, maltodextrin, etc.), which will form the aqueous phase that will be sprayed into supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The active ingredient can be dissolved in the same aqueous phase (proteins or hydrophilic compounds) or distributed in the aqueous phase via emulsification (oil, fatty acids, or organic solution) or suspension (fine solid particles). One promising application of the process is the encapsulation of oils to produce free-flowing oil encapsulated powders [

The production of a water-insoluble phospholipid-rich oil has been reported in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WO) patent application (WO 2010014011 A1) [

Units ranging from four liters to 10 liters have been developed for the laboratory to demonstration scale of supercritical spray drying, where a co-axial nozzle was used to introduce and break up the aqueous solution into finely dispersed droplets using scCO
