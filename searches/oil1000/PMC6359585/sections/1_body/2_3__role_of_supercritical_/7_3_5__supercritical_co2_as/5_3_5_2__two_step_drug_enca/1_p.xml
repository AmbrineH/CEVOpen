<p class="p">The two-step process of drug encapsulation and foaming involves first obtaining a drug-encapsulated polymer matrix via methods such as solvent casting [

The drug-encapsulated polymer then undergoes supercritical gas foaming to obtain a microporous polymeric structure with the drug encapsulated in the polymer matrix. The encapsulation of the active ingredient in the polymer matrix is not limited by its solubility in supercritical CO
