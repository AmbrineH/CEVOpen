<p class="p">One of the current limitations of this method is that the drug loading in the polymeric material is limited by the solubility of the solute in the supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. To achieve higher drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies, and to be able to encapsulate a range of different active ingredients (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, etc.), a two-step process can be considered for the design of desired formulations.
