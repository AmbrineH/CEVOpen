<p class="p">The supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> foaming of biopolymers is an attractive method for the production of microporous constructs for biomedical applications. Using supercritical carbon dioxide as a foaming agent, the use of organic solvents for the fabrication of the PLGA foams can be minimized or avoided, resulting in a zero to low-residual solvent product. The pore size and morphology of the PLGA foams can be controlled by factors such as the operating conditions of the foaming process (temperature, pressure), the rate of depressurization, and the nature of the selected co-polymer (polymer functional end groups, lactic to glycolic ratio, molecular weight, etc.). The encapsulation of active ingredients ranging from protein, anticancer drugs, chitosan, etc. has been demonstrated for potential applications for implant drug delivery for chemotherapy, scaffold material for cell cultivation, new carriers for DNA delivery, etc.
