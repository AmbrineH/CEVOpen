<p class="p">In the production of microporous biopolymeric structures via supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> foaming, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is first contacted with the polymer in a high-pressure chamber. The supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> diffuses into the polymer matrix, causing the glass transition temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">g</sub>) of the polymer to be lowered, and forming a solution of the polymer with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. On depressurization, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> leaves the polymerâ€“CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mixture and the polymer vitrify, leaving a microporous structure on the polymer. In this case, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> actually acts both as a solute and a foaming agent. This section will focus of the role of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as a foaming agent to produce the microporous structure within the biopolymer matrix as a potential drug delivery platform for pharmaceutical applications.
