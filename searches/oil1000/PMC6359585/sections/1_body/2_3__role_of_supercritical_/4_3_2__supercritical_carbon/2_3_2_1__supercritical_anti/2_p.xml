<p class="p">Typically, SAS operates by the continuous and simultaneous injection of the organic solution with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into a chamber with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> via a nozzle. The mechanism of particle formation using SAS is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00021-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The means of contact between the solution and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can vary in different versions of the process, leading to several variations in the SAS process such as the PCA (precipitation from compressed antisolvent) [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], ASES (aerosol solvent extraction system) [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], SEDS (solution-enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids) [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and SAA (supercritical-assisted atomization) [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. In the SEDS process, the solution and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were introduced into the precipitation vessel simultaneously via a co-axial nozzle. This enhanced the dispersion and contact between the solution and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Chattopadhyay and Gupta [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] designed a method of combining ultrasonic mixing within a SAS chamber to achieve nanoparticle and nanoencapsulations [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] via an enhanced mixing mechanism between supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the organic solution. These processes were designed and developed to achieve better understanding and control of the SAS process in order to obtain particles with desired characteristics [

 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. In addition, numerous studies were also carried out to understand the underlying mechanism during SAS, such as the jet break-up phenomena [
