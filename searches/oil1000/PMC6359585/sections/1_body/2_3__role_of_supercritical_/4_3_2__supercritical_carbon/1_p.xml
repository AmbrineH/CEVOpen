<p class="p">The limitations of RESS can be overcome by a supercritical antisolvent (SAS), which utilizes the high miscibility of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with organic solvents; this can be used to dissolve both the active ingredient and the coating material of interest. When the organic solution is introduced into supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> rapidly extracts the organic solvent from the solution jet, leading to the rapid precipitation of the composite product. The resulting product will be an active ingredient distributed in the matrix of the coating material.
