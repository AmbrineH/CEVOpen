<p class="p">One of the limitations of RESS and SAS in microencapsulation is the processing of polymers that tend to plasticize in the presence of supercritical CO

 <xref rid="B66-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, Chattopadhyay and Shekunov [
 <xref rid="B66-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] presented the supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions (SFEE) technique. In this technique, the active ingredient and polymer is dissolved in organic solvent, and the organic phase and the organic solution are then emulsified with aqueous phase to form an oil/water emulsion. Supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is used to extract the organic solvent from the emulsion, leading to the supersaturation of the active ingredient and polymer in the aqueous phase, and resulting in the precipitation of the active ingredient and polymer. The precipitated microencapsulation or nanoencapsulation particles are subsequently collected from the aqueous phase.
