<p class="p">In the studies by Subramaniam et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], a Wurster-type coater employing near-critical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as an antisolvent for solvent removal from coated particles was developed. Studies on particle fluidization with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> have shown that conventional correlations for fluidization can be applied for supercritical fluids for the prediction of minimum fluidizing and terminal velocities [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Supercritical fluidized bed coating utilizes the fluidization of solid core particles using supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as a fluidizing medium and at the same time, a solution with the coating material will be sprayed onto the fluidized particles. The supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> plays the role of a drying medium (for aqueous solutions) or an antisolvent (for organic solutions) to dry the fluidized particles in the bed. The coating of API and ingredients such as curcumin has been demonstrated using supercritical fluid coating processes [

 <xref rid="B65-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. This technique has promising development for the production of controlled multi-layered coatings on APIs to achieve formulations with desired sustained release or surface properties.
