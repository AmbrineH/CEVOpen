<p class="p">The main sections for a supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> unit for drug delivery production include: (i) a high-pressure CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> delivery system; (ii) a secondary high-pressure delivery system; (iii) a high-pressure vessel(s)/high-pressure chamber(s); (iv) a product separation/collection/purification system. The basic equipment required for supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> processing include: (1) a compressed liquid CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> cylinder (preferably with a dipstick); (2) high-pressure liquid pumps for the delivery of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to supercritical pressure, and for co-solvents or solutions to be delivered and in contact with high-pressure CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; (3) chillers for liquefying, or ensuring that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at the pump head is in a liquid state; (4) high-pressure chambers/vessels that need to be designed according to specifications of high-pressure vessels with fittings and tubings rated for high-pressure applications (from HIP, Swagelok etc.); (5) pressure controllers (either automated back-pressure regulators or back-pressure valves; (6) product separation units, such as flash vessels, cyclone separators for solidâ€“fluid separation, solid filter units, a zeolite-packed bed for removing moisture from water-saturated supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; (7) heaters/coolers for temperature control at various stages of the process, and (8) a recirculating pump (if the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is recycled). A detailed summary of supercritical fluid particle formation in the pharmaceutical industry and representative vendor for supercritical fluid equipment and accessories can be found in the work of Vemavarapu et al. [
