<p class="p">Well-established processes using supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in pharmaceutical applications include micronization by RESS (rapid expansion of supercritical solutions), SAS (supercritical antisolvent), or ScMM (supercritical melt micronization), microencapsulation via co-precipitation (in RESS, SAS, supercritical spray drying, etc.), active ingredient coating (spray coating, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fluid bed coating, etc.), sterilization (due to microbial inactivation properties of pressurized CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), biopolymeric microporous foam/sponges (supercritical foaming, supercritical impregnation, etc.). Many review and research articles have been published on the topic of using supercritical fluid techniques for the development of drug delivery [
