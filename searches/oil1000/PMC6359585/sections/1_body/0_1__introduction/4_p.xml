<p class="p">The role of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (as a solvent, antisolvent, or solute) in particle design, pharmaceutical ingredient processing, and composite particle production has been evaluated by earlier reviews [

 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In a more recent review by Padrela et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the production of nanoparticle and nanocrystals via supercritical carbon dioxide was evaluated with a comprehensive description of the selection criteria of different methods based on the properties of the active ingredient. This review will focus on the applications where the active ingredient is encapsulated in microsized, nanosized, or microstructured formulations with applications for pharmaceutical or drug delivery. This paper aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive review of the currently available options to design and produce microencapsulated and nanoencapsulated formulations ranging from microparticles to nanoparticles, and including recent developments such as fluidized bed coating using supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the production of drug-releasing three-dimensional microporous foam for pharmaceutical applications. The discussion will introduce readers to different supercritical fluid processing techniques that utilize the favorable and versatile properties displayed by supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, with an understanding of the underlying mechanism behind each method, and the modifications applied to improve the particle size, morphology, and process efficiency.
