<p class="p">The selection of processing technique with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for biopolymers depend greatly on the interaction of the supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with the active ingredient, coating material of interest, and suitable solvent. In biopolymeric drug delivery systems, the interaction of the polymer with supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> plays an important role in the selection of the supercritical process. For instance, polylactide (PLA) is a suitable candidate for SAS, but not RESS, as it is not easily soluble in supercritical CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> makes it difficult to produce discrete free-flowing powders via the SAS process. However, this property of PLGA makes it suitable for the production of microporous polymeric foams with very low residual organic solvent content, allowing the production of microporous drug-releasing polymeric foams that can be used as implant and scaffold material [
