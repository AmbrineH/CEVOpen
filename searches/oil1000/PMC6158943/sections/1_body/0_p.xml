<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are important signaling molecules that maintain cellular homeostasis. Redox imbalance or production of excess amounts of ROS and RNS, however, is either a cause or an important mediator in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of many diseases. It results in oxidative damage to various biological macromolecules including DNA, lipids, and proteins, thereby altering several signaling pathways that ultimately promote cellular damage and death.</p>
