<p class="p">In the review article by M. A. Mendez-Encinas et al., the authors describe the functional properties and potential application as an antioxidant and anticancer agent of ferulated arabinoxylans, which are polysaccharides obtained from the cell walls of cereal grains. They also discuss the gel-forming characteristic of these polysaccharides, which has characteristics such as high water absorption capacity, stability to pH, temperature, and ionic charges, thus making them an excellent drug delivery system.</p>
