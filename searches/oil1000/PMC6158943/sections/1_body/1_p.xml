<p class="p">Natural product-based medicines have been used in medical practices for centuries. Naturally derived compounds have fewer reported side effects than allopathic medicine and may be safer to use over a longer period of time. F. Zhu et al. had reported in 2012 in 
 <italic class="italic">Plos One</italic> that the active ingredients in combinations of natural products can achieve the same level of potency as synthetic drugs, although they may have to be taken in larger quantities or for a longer period. About 8% of hospital admissions in the United States of America are due to adverse or side effects of synthetic drugs, and approximately 100,000 people each year die due to these toxicities, as reported in 
 <italic class="italic">J Appl Pharmaceut Sci</italic> in 2011 by G Philomena. However, toxicity of herbal medicines needs to be seen in context, and although generally considered safe, it can still have side effects.
