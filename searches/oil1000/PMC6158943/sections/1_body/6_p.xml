<p class="p">Authors D. Guo et al. report that natural 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria lemaneiformis</italic> sulfated polysaccharide increased the cell viability and restored the cell morphology of human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) damaged by oxalate. A decrease in released lactate dehydrogenase and an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential were observed. The authors also found that the repair ability of the GLP fractions are closely correlated with the molecular weight of the fractions, with GLP2 exhibiting the strongest repair effect. These results can therefore provide references for inhibiting the formation of kidney stones and developing original antistone polysaccharide drugs.
