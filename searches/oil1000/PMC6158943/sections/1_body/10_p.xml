<p class="p">H. A. Ogaly et al., in their manuscript, have investigated the efficacy of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita L.</italic> essential oil (MPEO) against liver fibrosis in rats and have explored this use of MPEO as an antifibrotic treatment for treating chronic liver diseases. Hepatoprotective effects of MPEO were observed as documented by the reduction of liver injury markers and lipid peroxidation (LPO) with ameliorated pathological and fibrotic liver injuries. Furthermore, reduced expression of desmin, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-SMA, TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1, and SMAD3 proteins indicated that reduced hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. MPEO also resulted in downregulation of CCl4-stimulated p53 expression.
