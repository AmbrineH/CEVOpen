<p class="p">Lycopene, which is a potent antioxidant carotenoid, has been evaluated by N. Stojiljkovic et al. in methotrexate-induced kidney damage in rats. Lycopene was administered in two different forms: dissolved in corn oil or encapsulated in nanoliposomes. Application of both forms of lycopene concomitantly with methotrexate was found to be effective against changes in serum urea and creatinine and oxidative damage markers and markedly reversed structural changes of kidney tissue, with the nanoliposome-encapsulated form being more effective for recovery.</p>
