<p class="p">J. Meng et al. report a potential use of a traditional Tibetan medicine, 
 <italic class="italic">Rheum tanguticum</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Rt</italic>), for treatment in Alzheimer's disease. 
 <italic class="italic">Rt</italic> has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties and inhibits the expression and production of inflammatory and oxidative molecules such as IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, and nitric oxide by microglia. They further found that aloe-emodin and (+)-catechin are responsible for these properties through the secretion of IL-10 from microglia.
