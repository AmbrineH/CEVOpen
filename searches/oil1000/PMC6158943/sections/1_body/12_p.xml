<p class="p">Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, is known for its potent antioxidant and anticancer effects. Authors B. Yan et al. studied the effect of RSV on the biological properties of activated pancreatic stellate cells that initiate pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis. The authors report that RSV downregulates miR-21 expression and induces PTEN expression, resulting in impeded reactive oxygen species induction in PSCs. Collectively, the authors conclude that RSV inhibits invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells through suppression of ROS/miR-21-mediated activation and glycolysis in PSCs and thus may serve as a new strategy for clinical prevention or treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</p>
