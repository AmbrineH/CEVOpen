 <p class="p">The influence of the homogenization time and speed on rheological and volatile composition in olive-based pâtés was studied. Five experimental trials were performed applying different combinations of time and speed homogenization: 1, 3, and 5 min at 12,000 rpm and 4000, 8000, and 12,000 rpm at 5 min. The obtained results showed that the processing parameters of the homogenization step significantly influenced the rheological and sensory properties of olive-based pâtés. Both time and speed influenced the rheological properties of the product. The increase of homogenization time and speed determined a significant reduction of hardness and syneresis. As regards color indices, significantly higher 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>* values were obtained when intermediate time and speed conditions were applied, whereas 
  <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and 
  <italic class="italic">b</italic>* indices showed a not univocal behavior. Both time and speed variables also influenced the volatile fraction of the pâtés (higher homogenization speed and time corresponded to higher terpenes and aldehydes).
