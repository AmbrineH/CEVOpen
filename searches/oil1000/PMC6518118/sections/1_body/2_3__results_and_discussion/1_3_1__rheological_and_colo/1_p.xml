 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported that the rheological properties depend on both the soluble solids in the serum phase and the particles volume fraction of insoluble solids. In particular, the data about the syneresis degree (serum separation of oil and water) showed significantly lower values at longer time and higher speed. Data reflected the behavior observed for texture analysis. This could be due to a more intense and efficient grinding of the ingredients, particularly those with a high degree of fibrousness, which need higher speed and longer times of homogenization. Moreover, higher standard deviations for hardness were observed at lower speed. This result could be due to the higher frequency of particles with non-uniform volume, as a consequence of the non-optimal homogenization phase, thus influencing the repeatability of the results. Higher values of hardness determined a more evident serum separation. Increasing the process time and speed a better homogenization of the ingredients was obtained as well as a softer consistency of the pâtés, preventing serum separation. Syneresis degree negatively influences the consumers quality perception of foods [
