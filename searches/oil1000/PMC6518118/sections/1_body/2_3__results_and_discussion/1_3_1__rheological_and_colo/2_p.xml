<p class="p">A clear influence of the variables under study on sample color was observed. In particular, the index of lightness (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>*) showed significantly higher values when intermediate time and speed conditions were applied. It is known that the values of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>* are influenced by the degree of mincing and the subsequent incorporation of air bubbles during this phase which determine an increase in the diffusion of light [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Furthermore, lightness depends on pH and water holding capacity as well. In our study, mincing did not affect pH and therefore the changes observed in lightness must have been due to other causes, such as the modifications in the structure caused by mincing. The latter, leads to a breakdown of cells making available a greater amount of water on the surface.
