<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* index showed negative values in all the examined samples, indicating a tendency towards a green color. A general decrease of 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* was obtained increasing process time and speed, likely due to a leakage of chlorophylls from the intercellular space, yielding a more intense bright green color on the vegetable surface. On the other hand, the 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* index, which had positive values, showed an opposing trend, indicating a tendency towards a yellow color when higher speed and longer time were applied. This could be attributed to a greater solubilization of tissue carotenoids by the added oil that occurs when processing parameters caused higher tissues breakdown.
