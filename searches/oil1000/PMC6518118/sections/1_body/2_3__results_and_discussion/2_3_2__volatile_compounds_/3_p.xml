<p class="p">Significant influence by the speed variable was observed for all of the volatile compounds. In detail, a significant increase in terpenes and aldehydes occurred with higher homogenization speed and opposingly, alcohols, esters, acids, ketones, and other volatiles significantly decreased. In general, aldehydes with higher molecular weight could act as precursors for volatile alkanals and alkenals for pâtés aroma, although these compounds have less flavor intensity, whereas aldehydes with short chains have sharper flavors. In particular, hexanal, octanal, and nonanal were found to be responsible for green-grassy, green-fresh, and green flavor notes [

 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported that aldehydes should be major contributors to flavors because of their low threshold values and distinct odor characters (for example, rancid, sweet, floral, and pungent notes). The release of ketones is considered the result of greater oxidation of short-chain fatty acids resulting from microbial catabolic pathway in table olives, the main ingredient of pâtés, and characterized by unpleasant, fermented flavor [
