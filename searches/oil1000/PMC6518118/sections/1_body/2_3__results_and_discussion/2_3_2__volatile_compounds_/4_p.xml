 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00115-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the loading plot and score plot of the PCA of the volatile compound classes. The first two components explain over 86% of the total variability. The loading plot shows that PC1, in particular, accounted for 68.5% of variability and was negatively correlated with terpenes and aldehydes, whereas it was positively correlated with alcohols, esters, acids, and other volatiles. Therefore, PC1 allowed us to discriminate samples in the score plot according to homogenization speed and in particular, those obtained by lower speed to the others. Higher homogenization speed corresponded to higher terpenes and aldehydes. The PC2, accounting for about 18% of variability, allowed to separate samples according to the homogenization time whereas those produced in less time showed more ketones.
