<p class="p">Pâtés have been produced for a long time with the aim to extend the shelf-life of vegetables. In the Mediterranean basin, which holds the major production of olives worldwide, the olive processing as pâtés is a consolidated practice since many are not suitable for table olives production due to their size and/or shape. Decades ago, this practice was mostly homemade, while today most of olive-based pâtés are produced industrially. From a nutritional point of view, olives are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic) and bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, considered to be useful for human health [
