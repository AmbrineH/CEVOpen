<p class="p">In recent years several studies have focused on these products. In particular, Marudova et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] described the thermal characteristics of poultry pâtés which were enriched with vegetable ingredients in relation to their chemical composition and technological process. Guimarães et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], investigated the application of the residue from soy drink and tofu in the development of vegetable paste formulations in order to obtain a product with good acceptability and nutritional quality. Cosmai et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], evaluated the effects of freezing storage on the oxidative stability, bio-active compounds and color characteristics of two different type of non-thermally treated tomato-based pâtés compared to the same pâtés subjected to thermal stabilization and stored at room temperature. Cosmai et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], with the aim to minimize the effect of thermal treatment, analyzed the effect of the combination of a natural extract and modified atmosphere packaging on the shelf life extension of fresh olive-based paste. Moreover, the development of new formulations of olive-based pâtés was investigated by Cosmai et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] to satisfy more dynamic, complex, and differentiated consumer demands for traditional and functional foods. Gorlov et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] developed a technology to obtain functional meat-vegetable pâtés based on mutton and poultry by-products with addition of chickpeas. Furthermore, the effects of substituting pork back-fat with different levels of sunflower and canola oil combinations in chicken liver pâtés were studied (Xiong et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-08-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]); the authors further evaluated the effects on pre-emulsification back-fat and oil on the physicochemical properties, fatty acids profile, microstructure, textural, and sensory properties of fine spreadable chicken liver pâtés.
