<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out on the influence of the homogenization step of olive-based pâtés on their rheological properties and volatile composition. As such, the present investigation was aimed at studying the effect of two fundamental processing parameters of the homogenization step, time and speed, on the overall physico-chemical properties of the final mixed system. </p>
