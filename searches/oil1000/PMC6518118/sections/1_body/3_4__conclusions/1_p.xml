<p class="p">The obtained results showed that obtaining good rheological and sensorial properties in olive-based pâtés is necessary to set up and apply optimal conditions in terms of homogenization time and speed. Indeed, hardness and syneresis were significantly influenced by the increase of both homogenization time and speed. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>* values were significantly higher at intermediate time and speed conditions, whereas the volatile fraction was significantly influenced above all by the speed variable. In perspective, the obtained results could be highly useful in olive-based pâtés industries, to save energy consumed by the processing plants and at the same time fulfill the increasing demand of products with agreeable sensory products.
