<p class="p">Color analysis was carried out immediately after homogenization of the samples (to prevent color degradation as a result of light and oxygen) using a Minolta Chromameter 2 reflectance colorimeter (Model CM-600 d, Osaka, Japan), equipped with the measurement head CR 300, and D65 source as illuminant. About 20 g of sample was placed in a quartz cell (diameter 35 by 34 mm, Konica Minolta, Osaka, Japan) and each sample was submitted to three replicate measurements. Color was studied in the CIE L*a*b* color space by measuring the values of
