<p class="p">Before the production of olive-based pâtés, raw materials were subjected to preliminary treatments as follow. Table olives were washed with tap water and destoned. Blanching in boiling water was carried out for red onion and arugula. All these treatments were performed using a pilot plant to simulate the industrial production of this type of product. Each ingredient was gradually added and mixed (about 500 g) in a 1 L stainless steel homogenizer (Waring LB 20 E S, Rome, Italy). </p>
