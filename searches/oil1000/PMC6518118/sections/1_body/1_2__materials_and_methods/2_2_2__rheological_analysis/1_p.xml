<p class="p">Sample hardness was measured with a Texture Analyser (Z1.0 TN, Zwick GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Ulm, Germany), a 1000 N load-cell, and the software, Text Expert 2 (Zwick-Roell, Kennessaw, GA, USA). The analysis was conducted at room temperature (23 °C) and consisted of a 2-cycle compression using a 10 mm diameter cylindrical probe. The samples were previously conditioned for the time needed to reach the proper temperature. A 50 mL beaker (with a diameter of 45 mm and a height of 60 mm, Duran, Meinz, Germany) was filled with pâté and the surface was smoothed with a palette knife. The pâté filled the beaker to a depth of 50 mm. Afterwards, the plunger penetrated to a depth of 30 mm from the surface into the sample at a constant speed of 150 mm min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Force-time deformation curves were recorded, and the maximum force applied was recorded as the hardness (N) of the sample. Values were given as means of 6 measurements per sample.
