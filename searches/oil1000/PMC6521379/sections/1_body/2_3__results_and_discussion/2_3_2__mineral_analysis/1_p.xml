 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) as compared to other literatures [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In the present study as indicated in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> potassium content was very high (446.46mg/100g) whereas zinc content was relatively low (2.01â€‰mg/100g) as compared to the other minerals and this was in good agreement with the findings of El-Safy, Salem, and Abd El-Ghany [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The differences in minerals content reported by various studies could be attributed to the location of plants, application of fertilizers and irrigation use, climate, and genetic differences between the varieties [
