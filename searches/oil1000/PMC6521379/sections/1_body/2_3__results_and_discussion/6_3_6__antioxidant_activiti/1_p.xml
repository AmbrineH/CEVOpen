<p class="p">It has been recognized that the total phenol contents (TPC) of plant extract are directly related to the antioxidant activities due to their redox properties. In the present study, antioxidant activity of cactus pear seed was analyzed. The minimum and maximum capacity of scavenging free radicals of the sample was ranged between 43% and 95% and this inhibition capacity was greater than ascorbic acid standard (20%-94.86%). The concentration of extract providing 50% of radicals scavenging activity (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated from the graph of DPPH inhibition percentage against the extract concentration. Thus, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the sample was 1.32â€‰mg/ml and ascorbic acid was 2.4mg/ml. The lower the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>value is, the higher the scavenging potential is. The concentration of the cactus seed flour extract required for the formation of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was more likely closer to the ascorbic acid standards but lower than the results recorded by Toure, Bouatia, Idrissi, and Draoui [
