<p class="p">Antioxidant compounds of natural plants are more prominent with their functional properties to human health. Thus, cactus pear seed as a crop plant needs to investigate its antioxidant compound and antioxidant activity. In the present study, the antioxidant compound particularly total phenol and total flavonoid accounted 90.2 mg/100g and 0.19mg/100g, respectively. It was noticed that the total phenol content was comparable with the findings (48-89 mg/100g) suggested by El-Mostafa et al. [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, differences in total flavonoids may be created due to the variation in geographical origin of the fruits, degree of maturity, extraction protocols, and analytic assays.
