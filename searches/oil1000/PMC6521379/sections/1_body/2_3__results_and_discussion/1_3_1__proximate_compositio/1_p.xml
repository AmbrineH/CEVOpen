<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, there were no published studies on the nutritional composition and other properties of cactus pear seed grown in Ethiopia though it has been intensively studied in other parts of the world. It has been reported that cactus pear seeds can be used as a source of food since it has high content of protein, fiber, lipids, minerals, and carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The study also confirmed that cactus pear seed predominantly contains high amount of carbohydrate followed by fiber (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and this is in good agreement with the result reported by Nassar [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These dietary fibers are important components which may help to prevent a variety of diseases [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Cactus pear seed has a fat content (10.50g/100g) which is in harmonious with the findings (10.43g/100g) described by Nassar [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The protein and ash content is higher as compared to the result found by Ã–zcan and Al Juhaimi [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. On the other hand, the fat and protein contents obtained in the present study were highly greater than those values reported by Salim, Abdelwaheb, Rabah, and Ahcene [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The difference in results between the present study and other literatures may be due to the variations in climatic conditions, varieties, genetic factors, harvesting time, and soil properties of the land where cactus pears grow.
