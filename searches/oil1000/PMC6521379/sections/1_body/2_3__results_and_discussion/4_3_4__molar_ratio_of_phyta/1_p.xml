<p class="p">The molar ratio between phytate and minerals indicates the impact on the bioavailability of dietary minerals. The critical molar ratio, above which mineral absorption may be inhibited, has been determined as PA:Ca&gt;1.56, PA:Fe&gt;14, and PA:Zn&gt;10 [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In this study these limits were employed to predict the bioavailability of minerals. Accordingly, the results revealed that the molar ratios of both phytate:Ca (0.04) and phytate:Fe (4.99) were found to be below the critical limit. This implies that the bioavailability of calcium and iron is not inhibited by the concentration of phytate present in the cactus pear seed flour. However, the molar ratio of phytate to Zn exhibited a high ratio (12.78) which was beyond the stated critical limit. Thus, such value indicates that the bioavailability of Zn in the seeds is inhibited by phytate. Therefore, the risk of Zn inhibition in this regard requires a preferable mode for minimization of the concentration of phytate in the cactus pear seeds.
