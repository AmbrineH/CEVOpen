<p class="p">Functional properties contribute an important role in determining the competitiveness of ingredients or products in the market, as they can impact the sensory, physical, and chemical properties of a food. Some representative attributes such as bulk density, water/oil absorption capacity, foam capacity and stability, and water solubility index were analyzed to evaluate the functional properties of cactus pear seed flour (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). It was observed that the bulk density which influences the amount and strength of packaging materials, energy density, texture, and mouth feel [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] was lower as compared to the other properties. All investigated properties except bulk density were lower than the results reported by El-Safy, Salem, and Abd El-Ghany [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The functional attributes of products may vary considerably due to the differences in the raw material, processing, extraction methods, and environmental conditions used during testing.
