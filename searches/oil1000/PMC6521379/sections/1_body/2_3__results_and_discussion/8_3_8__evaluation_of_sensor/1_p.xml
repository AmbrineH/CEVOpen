<p class="p">In the present study the sensory characteristics of cactus pear seed particularly its color, taste, aroma, texture, and overall acceptability were evaluated. These sensory attributes are valuable determinant factors for the quality measure of the product (“Himbasha”). The flour ratios are also used to remark the dynamic change in sensory quality of this product. Hence, the results from 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> show that there was no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) between 0% sample replacement (control) and 5% sample replacements in all sensory attributes except texture. Based on the sensory scores marked by the panelist, substitution of cactus pear seed up to 15% was appeared to be acceptable with the approximate preference level of ”moderately” or “slightly like” on the given hedonic scales for all attributes. This was directly agreed with the report of Moreno-Álvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] conducted on cactus pear cladode. From the same table, it was noticed that the level of sensory value decreased as the mixed ratio of cactus pear seed increased and this is in line with the suggestions forwarded by Saenz [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Surprisingly, Aroma had the highest score values for all attributes and sample ratios, with a representative preference hedonic range of “like” to “moderately like” which is in good agreement with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The appreciable aroma level might be due to the presence of volatile organic matters, perhaps the fatty or oily components of the cactus pear seeds.
