<p class="p">Antinutritional factors are generally toxic and may negatively affect the nutritional value of cactus pear seeds by impairing protein digestibility and mineral availability. Three antinutritional factors, namely, phytate, tannin, and oxalate, were examined in this study (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The results indicated that phytate content was considerably higher (259â€‰mg/100g) than other factors which were similarly reported by El-Safy, Salem, and Abd El-Ghany [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] while the oxalate content was lower than the two antinutritional factors. The presence of condensed tannin compounds is of great importance in the health promotion like the antioxidant components [
