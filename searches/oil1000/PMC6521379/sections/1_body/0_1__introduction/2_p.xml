<p class="p">Cactus pear, which is locally known by the vernacular name of “Belles”, was introduced to Northern part of Tigray region between 1848 and 1870 by a Catholic Missionary, priest Abune Yakob. He adopted cactus pear with the realization of climatic and topographic unsuitability of the area for cropping and other agricultural activities. Currently, cactus pear is widely spread throughout the region and is believed to cover more than 379,338 hectares of land, i.e., 7.4% of the total land of the region [
