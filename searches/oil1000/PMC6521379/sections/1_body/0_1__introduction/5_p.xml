<p class="p">Different studies conducted in many countries indicated that cactus pear seed is nutritionally important. However, it is unusual in the study area to use and preserve these seeds as a source of food. Hence, surplus products of cactus pears remain stagnated. Once the ripening period of cactus pear is over, the cultivars tend either to buy their daily foods from the market or they would suffer from starvation during the drought season. This is because the people know nothing about the nutritional and medicinal values of the seed. As far as no study has been conducted in any aspect of cactus pear seed in Ethiopia, the present study intended to determine the nutritional composition, antinutritional factors, antioxidant capacity, and functional properties and to evaluate the sensory acceptability of cactus pear seeds.</p>
