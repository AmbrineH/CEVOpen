<p class="p">Cactus pear is considered as a “Bridge of life” in the region, because its stems and fruits store large quantities of water and provides an important food source to both humans and animals (as forage for livestock). The fruit is also mentioned in traditional song which is translated from the local language (Tigrigna) as ‘A farmer without Belles is like a stream without water.' Cactus pear in Tigray is generally used as a source of food, forage, fuel wood, cash income, live fences, and soil conservation purposes [
