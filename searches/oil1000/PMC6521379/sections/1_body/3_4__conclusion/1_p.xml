<p class="p">The present study demonstrated that cactus pear seeds can be used as sources of food in arid and semiarid areas. It contains high amount of carbohydrate and fiber followed by lipid and protein. In addition, cactus pear seed has an appreciable amount of potassium and calcium and low level of antinutritionals (tannin and oxalate) except phytate. The remarkable capacity of scavenging free radicals resulted from the presence of high value of total phenol in the cactus pear seed. Therefore, the seed can essentially be used as good sources of functional food. The functional properties of the sample show that cactus pear seed flour can be moderately competent in the market. Moreover,
