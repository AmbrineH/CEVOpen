<p class="p">The mole of phytate and minerals was determined by dividing the weight of phytate and minerals with its atomic weight (phytate: 660 g/mol; Ca: 40 g/mol; Fe: 56 g/mol; Zn: 65 g/ mol). The molar ratio between phytate and mineral was obtained after dividing the mole of phytate with the mole of minerals [
