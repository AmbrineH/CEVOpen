<p class="p">Seed flour was extracted using the method of Mau, Chang, Huang, and Chen [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. A 2.5 g of cactus pear seed flour (duplicate) was weighed, mixed with 25 ml of methanol, and put in incubator shaker at 25°C overnight. The supernatant was decanted into another conical flask and the extraction process was immediately repeated for about 2 hours. The supernatant solution was then poured into weighed rotary evaporator flask to be evaporated using rotary evaporator at 300 rpm and 40°C. After the completion of evaporation, the extract was oven dried at 70°C for further elimination of some vapors and methanol droplets. The dried extract was weighed and the difference in weight was used to remark how much methanol is going to be needed to mix with the dried extract.
