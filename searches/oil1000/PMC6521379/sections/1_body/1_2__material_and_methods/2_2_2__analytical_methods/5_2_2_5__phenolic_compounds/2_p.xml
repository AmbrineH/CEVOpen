<p class="p">Total phenol compound was analyzed calorimetrically, according to the method described by Singleton and Rossi [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. One ml of cactus pear seed extracts or gallic acid standard solutions was mixed with 1 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent in each test tube, followed by Swire and incubated for 3 minutes at room temperature. After 3 minutes, 1 ml of saturated Na

The solution was kept in the dark place for 90 minutes. Finally, the absorbance was read at 725 nm using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The concentration of total phenolic was actually determined using the standard calibration curve of gallic acid at a linearity range of 20-160
