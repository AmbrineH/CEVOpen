 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Ripened (yellowish color) cactus pears were randomly collected in October from Hatset Kebele, Tigray region, Ethiopia, and they were washed and peeled using a stainless knife. The seeds were isolated by pressing the whole edible pulp while repeatedly washing with fresh water. The seeds were dried in atmospheric conditions and decorticated using mortar and pistil to remove the sticky-remnant pulps and the seed coat, ground to powder, passed through 0.45mm sieve, and kept in polyethylene bags at room temperature until analysis.
