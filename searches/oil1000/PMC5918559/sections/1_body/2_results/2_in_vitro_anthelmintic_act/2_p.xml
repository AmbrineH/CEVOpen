<p id="Par26" class="p">As observed in the EHT, the anthelmintic activity of all tested oils was also promising in the LDT. The rate of inhibition of larval development by the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> was greater than 85% at a concentration of 0.187 mg/ml (ANOVA: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">(11,24)</sub> = 2540, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) or higher, with this oil showing the lowest IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (0.044 mg/ml) among the oils tested. For the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nobile</italic>, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 0.117 mg/ml, achieving an inhibition greater than 85% at a concentration of 0.375 mg/ml (ANOVA: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">(11, 24)</sub> = 1309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The results obtained for the 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> oil showed inhibition greater than 85% only for concentrations above 1.5 mg/ml (ANOVA: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">(11,24)</sub> = 1485, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was the highest among the oils tested (0.280 mg/ml) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The inhibitory effect of the oils on larval development was dose dependent.
