 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. This livestock sector has faced serious problems related to gastrointestinal infections caused mainly by the parasite 
 <italic class="italic">Haemonchus contortus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The epidemiological importance of this nematode species is related to its wide geographical distribution and pathogenicity. In addition, this parasite is a cause of significant economic losses for the sheep livestock industry around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. As a result of the inadequate management of infections, resistance against the main classes of commercially available antiparasitic agents (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidazothiazoles) has been developed by this species [
