<p class="p">Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a modern chromatographic separation technology that has shown significant potential to contribute to new approaches in natural product drug discovery, specifically towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to isolate active constituents [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. This liquid–liquid chromatographic method permits both normal and reversed-phase separation procedures that are useful in the isolation process of compounds that normally have limited thermal and chemical stability, such as volatile components in essential oils [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. As a support-free liquid–liquid partition chromatographic technique, it eliminates the potential for the irreversible adsorption of samples onto the solid support of traditional techniques [
