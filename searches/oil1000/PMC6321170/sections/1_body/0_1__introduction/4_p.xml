<p class="p">Here, we report on the development of a chromatography method based on HSCCC for the isolation of the compounds from the essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic>. The limited complexity and similarities between different components of this essential oil permitted a comprehensive evaluation of performance. Based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry analyses of the beginning material and resulting purified fractions, HSCCC proved to be a rapid and effective technique for fractionating the volatile components to high purity at milligram quantities.
