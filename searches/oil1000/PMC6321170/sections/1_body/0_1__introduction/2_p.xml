<p class="p">Some of the main constituents of essential oils are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that represent a large and diverse group of natural products. They share a number of important properties. They display a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. They also have similarities in structure, volatility, weakness in polarity, and a lack of UV absorption that create a number of challenges for their preparative separation by conventional methods based on chromatographic columns [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Frequently, column chromatography based on silica gel is used to separate volatile terpenes. However, it is time-consuming and, in most cases, the major components in essential oils cannot be retained on silica gel [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Other complications arise from the use of a silica stationary phase in liquid chromatography such as irreversible solute adsorption, contamination, size exclusion, residual silanols, and pH limitations that affect yield and purity [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Advances have been achieved in the isolation of terpenes by vacuum liquid chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography, which are semi-preparative liquid–solids techniques [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, the use of liquid–liquid isolation methods, such as high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC), improved the separation of secondary metabolism compounds due to its greater selectivity [
