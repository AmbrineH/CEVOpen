 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Yet, the isolation of natural compounds is normally a complex process requiring a comprehensive range of separation techniques that often present multiple challenges including irreversible adsorption, low yield, and low purity. A frequent source of natural bioactive compounds are essential oils derived from plants, which are hydrophobic liquids containing a variety of volatile aromatic compounds. The chemical composition of essential oils is generally very complex and difficult to separate in high yields of sufficient purity [
