<p class="p">The qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out on a GC 2010 Shimadzu with a DB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness). The operating temperatures used were as follows: Injector 260 °C, detector 290 °C, and column oven 60 °C that increased to 290 °C by 10 °C/min. Hydrogen was used as a carrier gas at 1.0 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The method was tested for repeatability by performing separations in triplicate. The yield percentages of a compound were determined by GC-FID analysis.
