<p class="p">Qualitative analyses were carried out on a GC-QP2010 PLUS Shimadzu with a ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness) under the experimental conditions reported for GC-FID analysis. The essential oil components were identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra to published data and computer matching with WILEY 275 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 3.0) libraries provided by a computer-controlled GC-MS system. The results were also confirmed by comparing the compounds’ elution order with their relative retention indices reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The retention indices were calculated for all the volatile constituents using the retention data of linear
