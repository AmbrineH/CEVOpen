<p class="p">A CCC system (model HSCCC No. 403, PC Inc., Potomac, Montgomery, MD, USA), consisting of a PTFE 80-mL coil, an HPLC pump (model M-45, Waters, Milford, MA, USA), a low-pressure injection valve (Rheodyne 5020, Cotate, CA, USA), and a PTFE 5-mL sample loop was used. This system was coupled to a fraction collector (model L-7650, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) programmed to collect at 1 min intervals. Appropriate volumes of the solvents 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/acetonitrile/ethyl acetate (1:1:0.4) were vigorously hand-mixed in a separator funnel, transferred to a flask, and degassed (ultrasonic bath) for 30 min. An isocratic elution was conducted in a tail-to-head manner. The coil was entirely filled with the stationary phase of the solvent system with no rotation applied. The coil rotation was then initiated at 860 rpm and the upper organic phase was pumped at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. The system was allowed to attain the hydrodynamic equilibrium prior to the sample injection. The crude essential oil (1.4 g) was dissolved in the biphasic solvent systems and injected into the apparatus. Fractions (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 120) of 2 mL each were collected in the span of 120 min. The first 80 fractions were collected with rotation “on” and the last 40 fractions with rotation “off”. All the fractions were monitored by TLC and the target fractions considered visually pure were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. The fractions considered pure by CG-FID were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (
