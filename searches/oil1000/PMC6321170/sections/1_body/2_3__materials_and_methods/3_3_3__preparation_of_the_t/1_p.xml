<p class="p">For HSCCC, five different solvent systems were tested with each system generating a two-phase mixture when mixed at the stated volume to volume ratio: System 1—

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and acetonitrile (1:1); system 3—petroleum ether, acetonitrile, and acetone (4:3:1); system 4—
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, acetonitrile, and ethyl acetate (1:1:0.4); and system 5—
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, acetonitrile, and methanol (1:1:0.5). The solutions containing samples were prepared by diluting essential oil into a mixed solution of the lower phase and upper phase (1:1,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) of the solvent system for HSCCC separation. The solution was vigorously shaken and the two phases allowed to settle. The distribution of the essential oil components into the upper and lower phases was first estimated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, silica gel 60 F254 nm) of equal volume samples with Hexane/Ethyl acetate (3:2) as the eluting solvent system. The final separation of compounds was observed under a UV lamp at 254 nm. To assist the visual estimation of the relative distribution of the compounds in each phase, a sulphuric acid/methanol reagent (1:1,
