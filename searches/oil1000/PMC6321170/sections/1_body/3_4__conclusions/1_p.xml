<p class="p">Here, the components in essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic> were separated in a one-step preparative separation process based on high-speed countercurrent chromatography. The technique showed high resolution for the separation of volatile metabolites that display very similar structures and polarity. High purity fractions were recovered over a short run time (&lt;2 h) and the process proved to require less solvent than conventional techniques. An important aspect to this approach was the determination of an appropriate solvent system. Overall, high-speed countercurrent chromatography is a great selective tool for the separation of terpenes and, in particular, the complex compounds contained in botanical essential oils. The HSCCC can be used for the fast isolation of substances of commercial interest such as camphor and nerolidol.
