<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03064-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the developed preparative HSCCC method was successfully used for the separation of the major metabolites from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic> essential oil. In the one-step separation process (2 h), it was possible to obtain 150.0 mg of camphene (1), 85.0 mg of camphor (2), 16.2 mg of bornyl acetate (3), and 100.0 mg of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (4). The purities of the four fractions isolated by this HSCCC system were analyzed by GC-FID, whose results revealed camphene (82.0%), camphor (98.5%), bornyl acetate (91.2%), and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (92.8%). The structural identification of the HSCCC peak fractions was obtained by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR. Thus, the peak fractions 1â€“4 were characterized and identified as camphene (1), camphor (2), bornyl acetate (3), and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (4) respectively.
