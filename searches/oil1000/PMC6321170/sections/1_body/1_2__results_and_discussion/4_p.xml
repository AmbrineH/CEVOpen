<p class="p">Based on the calculated K values for the target compounds, the systems containing methanol were not considered the most suitable for use as solvent systems. The K value for nerolidol of &gt;2 would lead to a long run and the K value for camphene of &lt;0.1 would most likely prove too short of a time in the column to efficiently separate this compound in the partitioning process. In addition, the solvent systems 2 and 4 containing MeOH were also not considered utile for this separation since they presented lower volatility in comparison to the systems 1, 3, and 5, which could limit the mass recovery of compounds. Recovery of volatile compounds by evaporation of HSCCC fractions would be complicated if either methanol or water were contained in the two-phase solvent system. Lastly, in consideration of solubility, the major volatile terpenes are not soluble to the same extent in polar protonic solvents like methanol as in systems containing
