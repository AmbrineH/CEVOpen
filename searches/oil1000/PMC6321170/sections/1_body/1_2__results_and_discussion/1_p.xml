<p class="p">In this work, HSCCC was applied for a fast and economic separation of the constituents in essential oil derived from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic> leaves. Using this technique, the level of solvent consumption was comparatively much less than those using techniques based on conventional chromatographic columns [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In this process, the HSCCC technique was shown as a useful tool in the separation of the volatile compounds that normally have limited thermal and chemical stability [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The essential oils obtained from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic> were first analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. The leaf essential oil was characterized by its high percentage of camphor (39.9 ± 1.9%), camphene (25.3 ± 2.1%), and nerolidol (7.5 ± 1.1%) that also had a minor component of bornyl acetate (2.4 ± 0.2%) in the composition, as shown in
