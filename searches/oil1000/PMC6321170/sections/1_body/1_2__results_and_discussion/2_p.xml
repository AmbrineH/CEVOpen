<p class="p">The execution of a successful separation process using countercurrent chromatography requires a careful search for a suitable two-phase solvent system that can provide an ideal range of partition coefficients (K) for the target components. Since most volatile terpenoids have strong hydrophobic properties, the most commonly described HSCCC solvent systems in the literature for this propose are composed of: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/ACN, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/AcoEt/ACN, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/ACN/MeOH, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/methanol/water, petroleum ether/ethanol/water, and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/ACN/chloroform [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. An ideal partition coefficient for a targeted compound generally ranges from 0.5â€“2.0 for a specific solvent system. A large partition coefficient generally leads to longer retention times while smaller partition coefficients can generally result in poor resolution of the compounds peak. Another consideration is that the two-phase solvent system should display high solubility and stability for target compounds along with the physical characteristics of a short settling time (&lt;30 s) and a satisfactory stationary phase retention of greater than 50% [
