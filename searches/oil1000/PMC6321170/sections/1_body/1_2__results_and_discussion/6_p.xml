<p class="p">The two-phase solvent systems containing 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/acetonitrile were tested in HSCCC running for 
 <italic class="italic">P. mollicomum</italic> essential oil separation. Preliminary tests showed that by using system 1 (Hex/ACN, 1:1) in the HSCCC separation process, it was not possible to separate and obtain the 4 target compounds in a single one-step process with a high purity level, especially for camphene and bornyl acetate, which were easily eluted by the mobile phase together with many terpenes (data not shown). Although both systems are considered suitable for use in HSCCC separation, system 3 was chosen to be used in the separation process based on the considerable difference between their KD values. The insertion of ethyl acetate to system 1 (Hex/ACN) increased the partition coefficient of camphene from 0.07 to 0.37, camphor from 1.13 to 1.40, and bornyl acetate from 0.85 to 1.20. This improved the efficiency and resolution of this separation process by elevating the partition of these metabolites between both solvent phases. Under the optimal condition, an isocratic elution was conducted for the separation of the crude essential oil (1.4 g) using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/acetonitrile/ethyl acetate (1:1:0.4) separation in a one-step process over a 120 min run time in a tail-to-head elution mode. The flow rate of the mobile phase was selected as 2.0 mL/min. Nearly 73 mL (91.2%) of the stationary phase was retained after the hydrodynamic equilibrium was attained in this process.
