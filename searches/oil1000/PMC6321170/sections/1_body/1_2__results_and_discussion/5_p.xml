<p class="p">Compared to systems 1 and 3 that also contain acetonitrile, system 5, with the presence of petrol, presented very similar distribution coefficient (KD) values for the target compounds camphor and bornyl acetate. The calculated KD values for camphene, camphor, and bornyl acetate in system 5 of 0.09, 0.87, and 0.70 respectively were all lower than 1.0, which could lead to a decreased resolution of the separation process. Thus, these compounds would be eluted easily by the mobile phase, having a short time to be properly separated. Based on K values for the target compounds, the best separation results were achieved by using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/acetonitrile (1:1) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/acetonitrile/ethyl acetate (1:1:0.4) as solvent systems.
