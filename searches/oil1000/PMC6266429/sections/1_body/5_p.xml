 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanorods and nano-sheet graphitic carbon nitride. The hybrid materials showed promising results as gas sensors for ethanol detection: The improved sensor response of the hybrids with respect to literature data, is discussed on the grounds of the band structure, resulting from the heterojunction between the two semiconductors, and of the increased number of gas adsorption sites.
