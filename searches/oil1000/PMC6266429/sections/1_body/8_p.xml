 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] dealing with a very high profile topic in the energy conversion community: Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs). Organic-inorganic perovskites have raised world-wide attention in recent years due to their unique electronic, optical and transport properties. In the last few years the power conversion efficiency of PSCs has increased explosively from 3.8% (2009) to about 22% (2017) [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, the stability of perovskite solar cell devices is still unsatisfactory, particularly in the presence of moisture and light illumination. The role played by composition, structure and hybrid architectures were examined in detail in the review and the material design was proposed as a tool to control the material stability and conversion efficiency.
