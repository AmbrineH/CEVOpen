<p class="p">Another field of applied science currently benefitting from hybrid materials is health care. Potential biomedical applications are envisaged in the works by Truong et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and by Predoi et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Truong and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] reported the synthesis of vertically aligned Cu-doped Zn nanorods grown on a platform of Cu
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>Si nanoblocks. The prepared nanocomposites showed an extended absorption edge and bioluminescence in the visible region, which paves the way to their application as bio-probes and luminescent markers. The work of Predoi et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] deals with the very important topic of alternative antimicrobial agents for disinfection. Antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasingly major concern worldwide and has prompted the research of alternative treatments or medications. Predoi and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] described the antimicrobial activity of essential oils deposited onto hydroxyapatite: Hydroxyapatite coated by lavender essential oil showed higher antibacterial activity with respect to other essential oil and, thanks to its biocompatibility, could be proposed to combat infections following prosthetic implantation. Regenerative medicine is also the topic of the review article by Batool et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], more specifically, the new bioengineering approaches in terms of periodontal tissues and bone regeneration. The review sheds light on the use of bioactive hybrid scaffolds, such as functionalized membranes, for the controlled local delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs and growth factors for the treatment of periodontal diseases.
