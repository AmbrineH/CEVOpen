<p class="p">The growing demand of new materials with tailored physicochemical properties has propelled hybrid materials to a position of prominence in materials science by virtue of their remarkable new properties and multifunctional nature. Hybrid nanomaterials, formed by two or more components connected at the nanometer scale, combine the intrinsic characteristics of its individual constituents to additional properties due to synergistic effects between the components [
