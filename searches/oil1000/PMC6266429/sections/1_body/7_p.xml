 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] presents a transparent and conductive hybrid material for use as transparent electrode in flexible electronics. Bidimensional silver nanowires deposited onto PET layers and decorated with nanometric Ti layers were proposed as a flexible substitute to conventional transparent conductive oxides, such as indium tin oxide (ITO). The titanium layer, deposited by electron-beam evaporation, imparted improved ambient-stability under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions and promoted a net increase in the electrical conductivity with respect to the pristine materials, yielding an 88% transparency rate and an electrical performance that is better than commercial transparent conductive electrodes.
