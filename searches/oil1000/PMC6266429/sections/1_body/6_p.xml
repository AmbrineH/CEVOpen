<p class="p">The synthetic approach plays a key role also in the work by Jod≈Çowski and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-08-00891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] where the preparation of nanocomposites between zirconia and non-noble metal oxides, to be used as catalysts for methane combustion, was promoted by sonochemistry. The ultrasound treatment produced an optimal dispersion of the oxides onto the support leading to enhanced catalytic activity.
