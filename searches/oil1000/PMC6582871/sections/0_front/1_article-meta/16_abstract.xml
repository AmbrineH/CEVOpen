 <p class="p">The active component-target network and protein-protein interaction network of Compound Anshen essential oil were constructed. The target functions and related pathways were analyzed to explore the mechanism of Compound Anshen essential oil in the treatment of insomnia. GC-MS was used to detect the chemical composition of Compound Anshen essential oil, and the TCMSP, STITCH, TTD, and DrugBank databases were searched to predict and screen the targets of Compound Anshen essential oil in the treatment of insomnia. Cytoscape software was used to construct the network diagrams of the active component-action target and protein-protein interaction networks, ClueGO software was used to analyze the GO enrichment and KEGG pathway of the target, and the systemsDock website database was used for molecular docking. The analysis of the network results showed that the activity of Compound Anshen essential oil mainly involves biological processes such as the phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, response to ammonium ions, calcium ion transport into the cytosol, and chloride transport. The results of molecular docking showed that linalool, caryophyllene, dibutyl phthalate, (-)-4-terpineol, and (-)-
  <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>-terpineol have good binding activity with ADRB2, DRD2, ESR1, KCNH2, NR1H4, NR1I2, NR1I3, and TRPV1 targets. This study demonstrates the multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel characteristics of Compound Anshen essential oil and provides a new therapeutic idea and method for further research on the mechanism of Compound Anshen essential oil in the treatment of insomnia.
