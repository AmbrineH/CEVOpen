<p class="p">The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) is a database containing known and predicted protein-protein interactions (PPI), and there have been a large number of protein-protein interactions collected, including both experimentally verified data and predicted data using bioinformatics methods. The action target was imported into the STRING database, the species was defined as human, the interaction relationship was obtained, and the result was saved in the RTF format, which retained the node (node 1, node 2) and combined rate score (combined score) information. This information was imported into the Cytoscape 3.7.0 software where the interaction network was drawn and analyzed, with analysis results saved. The node size and color settings were used to reflect the number of combined targets (degree) of the components using Cytoscape tools.</p>
