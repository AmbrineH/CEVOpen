<p class="p">The intersection of the chemical target and insomnia disease target was determined and taken as the potential target, and the components of the chemical composition corresponding to the potential target were taken as the potential active component. The UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/) was used to correct all target names that were subsequently retrieved as official symbols to obtain the target and UniProt number related to the active components. The active components and targets of Compound Anshen essential oil were introduced into Cytoscape 3.7.0 software to construct the network of the Compound Anshen essential oil active component-action target and to predict the main targets and chemical components of Compound Anshen essential oil that are related to treating insomnia.</p>
