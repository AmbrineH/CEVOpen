<p class="p">The retrieved protein targets of Compound Anshen essential oil were examined through ClueGO-mediated enrichment analysis by employing GO terms for the annotation of the biological functions. These GO terms were classified into groups. These groups were mainly involved in responses to the phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, responses to ammonium ions, calcium ion transport into the cytosol, chloride transport, etc. (
