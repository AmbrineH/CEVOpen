<p class="p">Cytoscape software was used to construct the network of chemical composition and targets of action (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), which has 61 nodes. The blue round nodes represent the targets of Compound Anshen essential oil, and the green triangle nodes represent the chemical composition of Compound Anshen essential oil. The “degree” represents the action intensity, and the higher the degree value is, the larger the node is. Each edge represents the interaction between the active component and the target. The results showed that the targets GABRA1, NR1I2, ESR1, NR1I3, GABRA2, and CHRM2 were highly correlated with the chemical components, among which GABRA1 was associated with 15 chemical components, NR1I2 was associated with 13 chemical components, and ESR1 and NR1I3 were associated with 12 chemical components.
