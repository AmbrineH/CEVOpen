<p class="p">GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, mediates neuronal inhibition by binding to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor and opening an integral chloride channel. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. GABA can inhibit neurons in the nervous system, has a neuroprotective effect, and can function as a hypnotic, sedative, and anxiolytic among other functions. If Glu is released in excess, excitatory neurotoxicity will be generated, which will induce insomnia. The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA can inhibit and protect the central nervous system, which promotes sleep [

The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels, through the action of G proteins. The primary transducing effect is phosphoinositol (PI) turnover [
