<p class="p">It is generally considered that a docking score greater than 4.25 indicates a certain binding activity between the docking molecule and the target, values greater than 5.0 indicate good binding activity between the docking molecule and the target, and values greater than 7.0 indicate strong binding activity. The docking results showed that the average docking score of the chemical components, i.e., linalool, caryophyllene, dibutyl phthalate, (-)-4-terpineol, and (-)-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol, with the targets, i.e., ADRB2, DRD2, ESR1, KCNH2, NR1H4, NR1I2, NR1I3, and TRPV1, was 5.36. Caryophyllene and NR1H4 have a docking score of 7.335 (
