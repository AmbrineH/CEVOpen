 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m x 1.8
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m) capillary column was used, the carrier gas was high purity He (99.999%), the sample volume was 1
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L, the shunt ratio was 40:1, and the flow rate was 1mL/min. Temperature program: initial temperature 40°C (1 min), with 10°C/min up to 220°C, and then in 25°C/min up to 280°C (keep 9 min). Mass spectrometry conditions: EI ion source, electron energy 70 e V, ion source temperature 230°C, MS quadrupole temperature 150°C; Interface temperature 250°C, solvent 3.0 min delay, quality scan pattern full scan, scan range of 30 ~ 650 amu. Finally 22 essential oil chemical components were identified by GC-MS (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Linalool, D-limonene, and linalyl anthranilate are the three ingredients with the highest content, accounting for more than 60% of the total composition. Studies have shown that linalool has sedative and hypnotic effects. Linalool is a major component of lavender and may be used subcutaneously, peritoneally, orally, or inhaled [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Studies have shown that linalool has a significant anxiolytic effect. Inhalation of linalool can lead to sedation in mice, increase the sleep time induced by pentobarbital, reduce spontaneous behavior, and lower body temperature without affecting motor coordination [
