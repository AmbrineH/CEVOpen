<p class="p">The protein targets of Compound Anshen essential oil were searched via the TCMSP, STITCH, and PubChem databases for each chemical component. Through the TTD, DrugBank, and DisGeNET databases, the retrieved results were integrated to obtain the insomnia-related disease protein targets. A total of 39 potential targets (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) were obtained based on the intersection of protein targets acting on chemical components and those related to insomnia. Neurophysiological studies have proven that sleep is an active and rhythmic process in the central nervous system. Many of these neurotransmitters are involved in this process and play a key role in helping regulate sleep. GABA is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that can inhibit activated neurons and has a protective effect on neurons. Many studies have shown that GABA abnormalities are closely related to insomnia [
