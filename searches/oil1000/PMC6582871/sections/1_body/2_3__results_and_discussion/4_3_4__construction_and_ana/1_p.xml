<p class="p">The network of protein-protein interactions (PPIN) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) was constructed through the STRING database and Cytoscape software. The edges represent the association between a pair of action targets, the nodes represent the action target, and the “degree” value represents its action intensity. The higher the degree value is, the larger the node is, and the higher degree values are indicated by the color changes from light green to yellow.
