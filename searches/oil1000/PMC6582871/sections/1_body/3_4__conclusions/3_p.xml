<p class="p">In summary, the network pharmacology results showed that the active components in the essential oil of the Anshen recipe acted on targets involved in a variety of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, which reflected the characteristics of the multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway action of the essential oil of Compound Anshen. In this paper, the active component-target network diagram showed the characteristics of Compound Anshen essential oil in the treatment of insomnia. The protein interaction network predicted the important target proteins of Compound Anshen essential oil for insomnia. There were mutual relations between the targets, which was a complex interaction network rather than a simple, single-target interaction. GO enrichment pathway analysis showed that interactions with the neuroactive ligand-receptor pathways played a major role, providing a scientific basis for further clarifying the mechanism of action for Compound Anshen essential oil in the treatment of insomnia.</p>
