<p class="p">From the component-target network diagram, we determined the five chemical components with the highest degree. We docked those five chemical components with the highest degree to the target, and NR1I2, NR1I3, and ESR1, which are the targets with high docking scores, are also the targets with a large degree in the component-target network diagram. This result indicates that Compound Anshen essential oil is closely related to the targets NR1I2, NR1I3, and ESR1 in the treatment of insomnia. However, there are few studies on the relationship between NR1I2, NR1I3, and ESR1 and sleep. Therefore, understanding how Compound Anshen essential oil regulates sleep through these targets is worthy of further study. Linalool, a compound with a high degree value, is also a component with a high content level, which indicates that linalool plays a vital role in the treatment of insomnia with Compound Anshen essential oil.</p>
