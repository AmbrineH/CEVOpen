<p class="p">Compound Anshen essential oil can cure insomnia by olfaction. Compound Anshen consists of seven essential oils, including sandalwood essential oil, aloe essential oil, rose essential oil, and lavender essential oil, Frankincense essential oil, neroli essential oil, and sweet orange essential oil. A large number of studies have found that olfaction is closely related to insomnia. The olfactory pathway not only transmits the sense of smell but also regulates advanced functions of the brain, such as learning, memory, emotion, visceral activity, alertness, and sleep. Olfactory transmission of information occurs through the neurotransmitters glutamate (Glu), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NA), and these transmitters and insomnia pathogenesis are closely related [

However, the mechanisms, signaling pathways, and material bases of the action of Compound Anshen essential oil related to insomnia are unclear. Network pharmacology builds a “drug-target-pathway” multilevel network based on the biological molecular network to analyze the pharmacodynamically active ingredients and the possible molecular network mechanisms, aimed at establishing the synergistic relationship between the multicomponents, multichannels, and multitargets of traditional Chinese medicine and its compounds [
