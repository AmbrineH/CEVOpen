<p class="p">In this paper, four different fucoidan-rich fractions (F0.5/F0.9/F1.1/F2.0) of commercial fucoidan from 
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic> were obtained using differential precipitation with acetone. Chemical analyzes showed fucose was the major component present in all fractions whereas the relative amounts of other monosaccharides vary according to the fraction. Monosaccharide composition, agarose gel electrophoresis, and antioxidant data showed that each fraction had a different type of fucoidan. F0.5 and F0.9 have an adipogenic effect because they stimulated the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through up-regulation of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPAR gamma. On the other hand, F1.0, and F2.0 have antiadipogenic activity. In addition, all samples had lipolytic action, especially F2.0, which tripled the amount of glycerol in the cellular medium. Among these, F2.0 showed a marked effect on the attenuation of lipid accumulation, antioxidant, and lipolytic activities, and we thus recommend it as a natural antiadipogenic agent for several biotechnological applications.
