<p class="p">F1.1 and F2.0 were able to induce the release of triglycerides from the interior of the adipocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The molecular pathways by which these fucoidans act was not suggested, but fucoidan is known to stimulate the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (LSH) [
 <xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. LSH regulates lipolytic activity within adipocytes, and the phosphorylation of this enzyme leads to its activation with consequent hydrolysis of the triglycerides stored inside these cells, which subsequently release their glycerol and fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that the LSH activation pathway may be the target of fucoidan activity demonstrated in our work. We intend to investigate this hypothesis in future work.
