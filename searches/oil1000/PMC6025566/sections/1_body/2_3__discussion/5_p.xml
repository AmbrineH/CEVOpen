<p class="p">Since oil red O has an affinity for neutral lipids (triglycerides), the greater the amount of fat (triglycerides) accumulated within adipocytes, the more dye will be observed within that cell, and vice versa. FF promoted a reduction of triglycerides in cells of around 40%. This value was highly similar to that observed by other authors, for example by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In 2009, they reported that a commercial fucoidan was able to reduce the incorporation of oil red O by adipocytes in 39.7%, at a concentration of 200 Î¼g/mL [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. An unprecedented result was observed for F0.5 and F0.9, which induced the accumulation of triglycerides to approximately 80% more, compared to the control group. On the other hand, F2.0 fucoidan reduced the amount of triglycerides within adipocytes by approximately 50%, with this effect being more pronounced than that observed using FF.
