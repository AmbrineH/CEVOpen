 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows that fucoidans fractions have different electrophoretic mobilities. In this electrophoresis system, the buffer used (PDA) includes 1,3-diaminopropane in its constitution, which is positively charged at pH 9.0. These positively charged buffers are able to link with the negatively charged groups of the polysaccharides that are exposed, such as sulfates, thus neutralizing them. However, the formation of this complex depends not only on the negatively charged groups of the sulfated polysaccharide, but also on the spatial conformation that the molecule takes in the system, and the effects that it has on how the sulfated polysaccharide exhibits its charged groups. Therefore, the amines do not form complexes with all sulfate groups, but only those that are exposed. In this way, the polysaccharideâ€™s mobility depends on the sulfate groups that have not formed complexes. A classic example is the behavior of chondroitin and heparin, two sulfated polysaccharides that are structurally similar, although heparin is more strongly sulfated. However, in the electrophoresis system with PDA, heparin has a much lower electrophoretic mobility than chondroitin [

 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Of these monosaccharides we find neither glucose nor mannose in FF. This is probably because the composition of commercial fucoidans should vary. So, we also did not find these two monosaccharides in the fractions. In addition, the relative proportion of glucuronic acid, xylose and galactose was different in each sample. Overall, these data lead us to propose that we have obtained four different fucoidan-rich fractions from
