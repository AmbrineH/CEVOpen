<p class="p">To better understand the biochemical mechanism by which these fucoidans act, we verified the expression of key regulatory proteins of adipogenesis: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ, as it has been reported that commercial fucoidan affects these enzymes [

 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In agreement with the results of the oil red O test, F0.5 and F0.9 caused an acute increase, mainly in the expression of C/EBPβ and PPARγ, in comparison to the control, confirming that these two compounds are adipogenic agents. However, F1.1 and F2.0 caused a reduction in the expression of these proteins, which in turn led to a reduction in the amount of triglycerides inside the adipocytes, as observed in the oil red O test.
