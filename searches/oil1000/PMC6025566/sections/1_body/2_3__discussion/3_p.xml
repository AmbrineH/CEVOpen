 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] suggested that the antioxidant activity of fucoidan is related to the degree of sulfation: the more sulfated the polysaccharide, the more active it is. However, the data from the TAC test did not agree with those suggested by these authors. In addition, there was a weak Pearson correlation coefficient between the sulfated content of fractions and TAC. Furthermore, the data submitted by various authors that evaluated the antioxidant capacity of fucoidans obtained from other brown seaweed [
