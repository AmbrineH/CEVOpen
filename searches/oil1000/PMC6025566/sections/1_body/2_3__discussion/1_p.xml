<p class="p">Using differential precipitation with acetone, we acquired four different fractions of commercial fucoidan (FF) from

Therefore, the smaller the interaction of the polysaccharide with water, the smaller the amount of acetone that should be added to the solution to precipitate it. Generally, the interactions between sulfated polysaccharides and water partly depend on the amount of charges on the polysaccharide, with the least negatively charged being the first to be precipitated.
