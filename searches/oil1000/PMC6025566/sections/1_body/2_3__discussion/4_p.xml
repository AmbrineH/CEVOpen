<p class="p">The antiadipogenic activity of the fucoidan (FF) from 
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic> had previously been reported [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. However, the fucoidan fraction constituents of FF have not yet been evaluated in isolation for their antiadipogenic potential. In this work, we observed that these fractions had different effects on adipocyte differentiation.
