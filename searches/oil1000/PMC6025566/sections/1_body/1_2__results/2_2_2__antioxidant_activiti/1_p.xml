<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of samples was evaluated in vitro by the total antioxidant capacity test (TAC). All samples showed antioxidant activity, though the values were significantly different from each other, particularly for F2.0 fucoidan, which was approximately 400 ± 12.0 equivalents of ascorbic acid. This is nearly double the values obtained for FF and F0.9, which were 189 ± 10.0 and 172 ± 11.0 ascorbic acid equivalents, respectively. The value identified for F1.1 was found to be significantly lower than the two mentioned above (150 ± 8.0 equivalents). The value obtained for F0.5 was around 38 ± 2.0 equivalents, the lowest recorded in this study. There was positive Pearson correlation coefficient between the sulfated content of fractions and TAC (
