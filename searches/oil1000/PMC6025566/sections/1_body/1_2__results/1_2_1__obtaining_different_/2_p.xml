<p class="p">When the sulfate content of the samples was quantified, it was observed that there is no significant difference between F1.1 and F2.0. Although F1.1 and F2.0 both have the same sulfate content, they were precipitated with different volumes of acetone. This is probably because the sulfated polysaccharide conformation interferes during the precipitation process.</p>
