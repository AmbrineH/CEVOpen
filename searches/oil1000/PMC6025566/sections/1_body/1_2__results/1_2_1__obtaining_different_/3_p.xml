<p class="p">To confirm this hypothesis, the fucoidan-rich fractions were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in 1,3 diamineacetate (PDA) buffer. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows an agarose gel stained with toluidine blue. It is possible to see that all the fractions have a predominant band. For F0.9, F1.1, and F2.0, the bands display different electrophoretic mobilities.
