<p class="p">Using differential precipitation with acetone, we obtained four fractions from FF. These were called F0.5, F0.9, F1.1, and F2.0 corresponding to 4.5%, 35.2%, 22.0% and 38.3% of the material, respectively (

 <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Data show that mannose and glucose were not found in the samples, whereas fucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and xylose were found in all samples. The data also showed fucose was the major component present in all fractions, whereas the relative amounts of other monosaccharides vary according to the fraction. Thus, the relative amounts of these sugars vary according to the fraction.
