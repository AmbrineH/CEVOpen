<p class="p">Over a period of 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A), it was observed that there was a reduction in cell viability (~30%) when the cells were cultured in the presence of FF, F0.5, and F0.9 at the highest concentration tested (1000 µg/mL). A similar effect was observed after 48 h. On the other hand, cytotoxicity (decrease in MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenil tetrazolium bromide) reduction by 20%) was also identified using F0.5 at lower concentrations (100 and 200 µg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). The cytotoxic effects observed with the use of F0.5 was more pronounced after 72 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C), since there was a decrease in the MTT reduction by 40%, 48%, and 64%, using F0.5 in concentrations of 100, 200, and 1000 µg/mL, respectively. The same was also observed with the use of FF, F1.1, and F2.0 (all at 1000 µg/mL), when there was a decrease in MTT reduction of ~55%. Thus, a concentration of 200 µg/mL was selected for use in the following tests relating to the antiadipogenic effects of fucoidans.
