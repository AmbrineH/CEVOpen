<p class="p">As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, all samples induced lipolysis. F0.5 was able to induce the mobilization of triglycerides after only 15 days of differentiation, while F0.9 showed a discreet effect by the ninth day of differentiation and after 15 days of culture. Twice as much glycerol in the medium of cells treated with F0.9 than for the control group was found. F1.1 needed only nine days of differentiation to achieve such an effect, i.e., double the lipolysis in comparison with the control group, with this potential being maintained throughout the differentiation process. In turn, F2.0 showed the strongest lipolytic effect, as it was able to increase the breakdown of triglycerides by three times after only nine days of differentiation. Despite the slight decrease in its potential to induce lipolysis during the differentiation process, we also observed 2.5 times more glycerol in the medium of the cells treated with F2.0 than in the control group at the end of the test.
