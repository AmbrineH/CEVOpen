<p class="p">The expressions of these three proteins were altered when the cells were incubated with fucoidans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>B). F0.5 and F0.9 mainly stimulated the expression of C/EBPβ and PPAR gamma. However, F2.0 reduced the expression of all three proteins evaluated herein, particularly for C/EBPβ and PPARγ, by approximately 55% when compared to the control. In regards to F1.1, we take special note of the particularly strong reduction of C/EBPα expression. These data are in agreement with the oil red test and confirm that F0.5 and F0.9 are adipogenic agents, while F2.0 and F1.1 are antiadipogenic agents.
