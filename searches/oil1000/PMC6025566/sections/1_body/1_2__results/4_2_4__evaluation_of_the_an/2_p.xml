<p class="p">To confirm what was observed by optical microscopy, the oil red O was eluted from the inside of the cells and quantified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). As the oil red O dye has an affinity for neutral lipids (triglycerides), the more fat (triglycerides) that is accumulated in the adipocyte the greater the amount of dye within the cell and vice versa. Thus, it was observed that FF induced an approximately 40% reduction of triglyceride in the cells. F2.0 reduced the amount of triglyceride within the adipocytes by approximately 50% and this effect was more pronounced than that observed for FF. An unprecedented result was observed with F0.5, which induced the accumulation of oil red by approximately 80% more than the control group.
