<p class="p">The structure of fucoidan (FF) from 
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic> was last reviewed by Patankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. It was suggested that it possesses a central core formed by α-L-fucose (1,3)-linked, sulfated at C4. In addition, several branching points (every two or three fucose residues) were present in α-(1,2) or α-(1,4)-linked, on the main chain.
