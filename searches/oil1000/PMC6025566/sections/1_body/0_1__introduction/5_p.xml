<p class="p">Adipogenesis is a process of cell differentiation in which mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into adipocytes, with this process initially involving a stage where cells “compromise” with the adipocyte line [

The process of differentiation is complex and involves the participation of hundreds of proteins, although two proteins particularly play a crucial role in this event: C/EBPα, a protein of the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein class, and PPARγ, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor [
