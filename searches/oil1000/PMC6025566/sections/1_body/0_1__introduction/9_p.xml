 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that some fucoidan fractions showed much greater activity than others did. However, antiadipogenic activity across different fucoidan populations has not yet been evaluated. With this in mind, we obtained four different fucoidan-rich fractions of commercial fucoidan from 
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic> and, assessed them for their adipogenic activity.
