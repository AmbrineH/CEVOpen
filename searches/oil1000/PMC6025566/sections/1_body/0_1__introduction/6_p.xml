<p class="p">Although pre-adipocyte primary cultures are an important tool for understanding the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation, these cells have low mitogenic capacity and lose their ability to differentiate over time under culture conditions [

Therefore, the development of studies on adipogenesis is carried out mainly by the use of cellular models, such as the murine 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A (pre-adipocyte) lines. These cells, when stimulated to differentiate into adipocytes, follow the same metabolic pathways of differentiation of mesenchymal cells [
