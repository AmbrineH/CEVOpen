<p class="p">By using a differentiation cocktail based on insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and fetal bovine serum, it is possible to obtain mature adipocytes from a 3T3-L1 culture. The actions of these compounds result in the initial events of differentiation, represented by the expression of CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins [

 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Besides, the differentiation of these cells takes place in precisely controlled sequential stages: cell cycle arrest, clonal expansion, and differentiation (first phase and second phase of activation of transcriptional factors), by activating hundreds of previously silenced genes [
