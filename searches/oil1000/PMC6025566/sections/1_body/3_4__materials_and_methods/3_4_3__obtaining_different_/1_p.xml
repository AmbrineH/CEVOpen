<p class="p">Four grams of FF were solubilized into 0.25 M sodium chloride. To this solution was added increasing volumes of acetone to precipitate the different fucoidans. To obtain fucoidan F0.5, for example, 0.5 volumes of ice-cold acetone was added to this solution slowly and under gentle agitation, and then held at 4 °C for 12 h. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation at 8000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. Acetone was added to the supernatant until a precipitated material appeared. Like this, we used the acetone volumes of 0.9, 1.1 and 2.0, calculated from the initial solution, and the operations repeated as above.
