<p class="p">3T3-L1 cells were plated in 100 mm plates and stimulated to differentiate into adipocytes (as described above) in the presence or absence of the 200 μg/mL samples (FF; F0.5; F0.9; F1.1; F2.0). After 15 days of differentiation the cells were suspended in the lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); 1% Tween 20; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EGTA; 1 mM Na
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>VO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>; 1 mM NaF; and protease inhibitors] to obtain the protein extract. The protein content was determined using the Bradford method (1976). The control corresponds to cells that were not exposed to fucoidans. For each sample, 30 μg of protein were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with subsequent transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with skim milk (1%) or albumin (1%) and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibody (β-actin, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and PPARγ), in a dilution of 1:1000. After incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution), the detection was performed by chemiluminescence. β-actin was used as an internal control to evaluate the uniformity of protein loading and transfer. The bands were visualized with a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and quantified by ImageJ software ver.1.51k (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, EUA).
