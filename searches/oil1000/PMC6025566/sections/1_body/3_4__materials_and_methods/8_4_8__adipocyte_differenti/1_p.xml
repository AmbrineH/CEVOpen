<p class="p">For adipocyte differentiation the cells were cultured in 24-well plates or 10 mm culture plate containing DMEM medium enriched with 10% FBS and, after reaching 80% confluence, these cells were induced to differentiate by the addition of the adipocyte differentiation cocktail: DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 10 μg/mL insulin. After 72 h, the induction medium was replaced by the adipocyte maintenance medium, which consisted of DMEM, 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL insulin. The maintenance medium was changed every 3 days until completing 15 days of differentiation.</p>
