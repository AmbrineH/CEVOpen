Statistical analysis between FF and fucoidan´s fraction was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Student-Newman-Keuls post-test (significance was set at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was applied to prove some similarities found by ANOVA. All experiments were done in triplicate and data refer to the average of three experiments done independently.
