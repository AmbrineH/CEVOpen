 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Tubes containing extracts and reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate and 4 mM ammonium molybdate) were incubated at 95 Â°C for 90 min. After the mixture had cooled to room temperature, the absorbance of each solution was measured at 695 nm against a blank. The TAC was accounted in ascorbic acid milligrams/sample grams, described as equivalent of ascorbic acid.
