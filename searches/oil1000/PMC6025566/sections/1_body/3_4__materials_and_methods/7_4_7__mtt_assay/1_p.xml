<p class="p">The 3T3-L1 cell capacity to reduce MTT after fucoidan exposure was evaluated in vitro according to the method described earlier [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. This method is based on the reduction of MTT to formazan crystals by living cells. Briefly, 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> 3T3-L1 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate. For which well 100 μL DMEM medium with 10% FBS was the final volume used. The cells grew up (95% air, 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 37 °C) until 80% confluence and then the medium was replaced by a DMEM without FBS, followed by incubation for another 24 h in order to stimulate cells to enter in G0 phase. After, the medium was replaced by a DMEM with 10% FBS in the presence of different fucoidans (from 100 to 1000 μg/mL) or absence (control) for 24, 48 or 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was replaced by a new DMEM without FBS added to 5.0 mg/mL of MTT, followed by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved with 100 µL of 95% ethanol. After 15 min shaking in a rocking shaker, absorbance was read (570 nm) in a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). As a negative control, cells were cultivated only with DMEM with 10% FBS. Results were expressed in the percentage of MTT reduction, as in Equation (1).
