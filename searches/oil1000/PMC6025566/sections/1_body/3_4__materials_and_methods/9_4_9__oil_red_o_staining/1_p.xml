<p class="p">For oil red O staining, cells were initially induced to differentiate into adipocytes, as previously mentioned, in the absence (control) or presence of fucoidans (200 Î¼g/mL). For this, these samples were added to the differentiation medium. The cells were exposed to fucoidan only in the first three days. After 15 days of differentiation, the cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed with a solution of formaldehyde (3.7%) in PBS for 1 h, washed three times in water, dried and stained with oil red O for 1 h. Excess dye was removed by washing with water. Images of the cells were captured using an optical microscope (TE-Eclipse 300, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). We performed three different experiments. Subsequently, the dye was eluted from the cells with 100% isopropanol and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 520 nm. The results of the differentiated cells in the presence of the samples were compared with those obtained for the control cells (100% adipocitary differentiation).</p>
