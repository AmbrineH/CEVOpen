 <p> The effects of FF, F0.5, F0.9, F1.1, and F2.0 on 3T3-L1 cell viability. ( A) 24 h; ( B) 48 h; ( C) 72 h. Each value is the mean Â± SD of three determinations and from three independent assays. Different letters ( a,b) indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between different concentrations of the same sample; Different numbers ( 1,2,3) indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between the same concentration of each sample; Different letters ( x,y,z) indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between the same concentration in different times (24, 48 and 72 h). Asterisks (*) indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between the concentrations of any sample and the control. </p>
