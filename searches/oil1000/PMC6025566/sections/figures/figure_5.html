 <p> ( A) The effects of FF, F0.5, F0.9, F1.1, and F2.0 on the expression of adipocyte markers. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were used for Western blot analysis, for the detection of β-actin, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ. These gels are representative of three separate tests made independently; ( B) Represents the expression relative to the control value. Different letters ( a,b,c,d,e,f) indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between the expression of the same marker for different samples. The control corresponds to cells that were not exposed to fucoidans. Each value is the mean ± SD of three determinations and from three independent assays. </p>
