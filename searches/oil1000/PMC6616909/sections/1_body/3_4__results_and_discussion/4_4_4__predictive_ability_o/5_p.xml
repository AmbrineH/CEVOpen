<p class="p">The results of the comparison between predictive values of component model and sorption isotherm of two herbs and five products were similar. As a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> higher than 0.7, the component model showed a good predictive ability. When a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> was higher than 0.7, the predictive moisture content increased rapidly with an increase of a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub>.
