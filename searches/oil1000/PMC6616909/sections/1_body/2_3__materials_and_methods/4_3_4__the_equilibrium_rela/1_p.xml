<p class="p">The moisture sorption isotherms of 
 <italic class="italic">C. Morifolium C.</italic> flower, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. formosanus</italic> Hayata at five temperatures (i.e., 5 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C) was determined by the equilibrium relative humidity method. Samples of known moisture content were placed in a 350 mL container. RH/temperature probes were inserted into the containers and surrounded with samples. These sensors and containers were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber. When the RH and temperature within the sample containers reached the equilibrate state, RH and temperature were recorded. The samples were taken out and the moisture content was determined again. Then new samples and containers were placed into a temperature-controlled chamber for the next temperature level. The reading of RH and temperature of these probes was transformed into actual values with pre-established equations to ensure measured accuracy. The set-up for the measurement is presented in
