<p class="p">There are several methods to determine the sorption isotherms of biological materials [

For the gravimetric method, the RH is maintained with different saturated salt solutions or sulphuric acid dilutions at different concentrations. The samples are enclosed in this RH environment at content temperature until its weight is balanced with ambient RH [

 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This equilibrium moisture content (EMC) method is simple, inexpensive and can be performed in most laboratories. However, the equilibrium time is longer, especially at higher RH. These samples could be contaminated if the ambient RH value is higher than 75 %. The other method is called the hygrometric or equilibrium relative humidity method. The samples at a given moisture content and fixed temperature are placed in an enclosed container. The RH in the container is measured as the humidity environment reaches the equilibrate state [
