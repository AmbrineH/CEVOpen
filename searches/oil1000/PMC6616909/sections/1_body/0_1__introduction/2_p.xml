<p class="p">At fixed temperatures and pressures, the relationship between the relative humidity (RH) of ambient air and moisture content is called sorption isotherm. The definition of the water activity (a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub>) is the ratio between the partial vapor pressure of water in the biological materials and the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. The equilibrium relative humidity is called water activity in food science field. The sorption isotherm dictates the corresponding water content at the same temperature for each humidity. Sorption isotherm properties include desorption and adsorption according to the adsorption or dehydration of moisture content. The sorption isotherm is essential information for the predicting drying and storage of materials. The design of packaging materials and the method are also related to these properties.
