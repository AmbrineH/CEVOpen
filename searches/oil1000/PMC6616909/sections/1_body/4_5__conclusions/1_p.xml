<p class="p">A component model was proposed to predict the moisture sorption isotherm data. The moisture sorption isotherm of 
 <italic class="italic">C. morifolium</italic> flowers and 
 <italic class="italic">A. formosanus</italic> Hayata was determined using an equilibrium relative humidity method at five temperatures. Seven sorption isotherm models were selected to evaluate the fitting ability and prediction performance for these products. Sorption temperature did not have a significant effect on the adsorption isotherms for the three samples. The Caurie and Henderson equations could be used for 
 <italic class="italic">C. morifolium</italic> flowers. Considering the quantitative criteria, the Caurie equation is the best. The Henderson and Caurie equations were adequate for sorption isotherms of 
 <italic class="italic">A. formosanus</italic> Hayata, but the quantitative criteria were not consistent. The isotherm data of raw bamboo, elecampe and three varieties of corn kernels from the literature were adopted to validate the component model. The component model showed a good predictive ability within an a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> range smaller than 0.7. Considering the practical application, the a
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> range below 0.7 is the main range for the processing of agricultural products, so the predictive values of this component model could be helpful for food engineering and for the food industry.
