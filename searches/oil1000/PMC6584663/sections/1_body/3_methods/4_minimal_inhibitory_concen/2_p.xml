<p id="Par27" class="p">To allow for direct regression of analytical data as a function of antifungal potential, a score representing the global antifungal activity was attributed to each EO. A MIC greater than 512 μg/mL received a 0, a MIC of 512 μg/mL received a 1, a MIC of 256 μg/mL received a 2 and each subsequent reduction in MIC by a factor of 2 increased the number of the score by 1.</p>
