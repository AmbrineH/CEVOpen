<p id="Par23" class="p">A Shimadzu GC-MSQP2010 fitted with a AOC-20i injector and FID and MS detectors (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the GC-MS analysis. The GC was run with a nonpolar Supelco MDN-5S fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness) commonly used for the analysis of VOCs. The injection volume (EO dissolved in chromatography grade hexane) was 1 μL. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 50 °C for 30 s, then increased from 50–150 °C at 4 °C/min, from 150–175 °C at 1.5 °C/min and from 175–300 °C at 20 °C/min for a total analysis time of 58.42 min. The injector temperature was set to 250 °C and the injection was accomplished with a split ratio of 1/50 throughout the entire run. The MS was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV, with a scan range of 40–400 m/z. The temperatures were set to 200 °C for the ion trap, 50 °C for the manifold and 305 °C for the transfer line.</p>
