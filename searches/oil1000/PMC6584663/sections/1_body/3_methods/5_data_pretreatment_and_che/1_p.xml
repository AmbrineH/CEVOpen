<p id="Par28" class="p">The GC/MS profiles recorded on the Shimadzu system were integrated automatically with a slope set to 15,000 and a width of 0.1. The peak corresponding to the solvent stabilizer (di-tert-butyl-2,6-para-cresol, RT = 25.97 min) was removed manually in each analysis. All integrations were checked manually, and some were split, removed or added as necessary. Integrations are reported as a % total integration. All integration tables were gathered in an Excel sheet. The lines were organized by RT. The uncertainty on the RT was estimated at ±0.07 min based on the RT recorded for the solvent stabilizer. A compound code and a putative identification were attributed to each peak. When mass spectra recorded on both systems were considered identical, and when the peaks were not separated by more than 0.15 min, then the same code was assigned to peaks from different EOs. Putative identifications were as described below.</p>
