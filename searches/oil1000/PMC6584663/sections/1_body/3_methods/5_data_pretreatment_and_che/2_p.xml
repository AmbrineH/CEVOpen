<p id="Par29" class="p">The data were then converted in a pivot table, with compound codes as lines and EOs as columns. The table contained 343 compounds from 66 EOs. Each box contained the relative integration of the compound in each corresponding EO. To reduce the number of variables, the compounds that did not account for at least 9% of one EO were removed. Sixty compounds remained. An orthogonal partial least square analysis (OPLS) was performed with Umetrics Simca 15. X-variables were the compound relative proportions in each EO, and the Y-variable was the note of antifungal activity recorded for each EO. One orthogonal component was sufficient to capture most of the inertia of the model. R
