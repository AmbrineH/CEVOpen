<p id="Par31" class="p">A full factorial experimental design including the six putative antifungal markers citral (Ci), thymol (Th), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide (Li), eugenol (Eu), eugenyl acetate (EA), and (−)-citronellol (–C) was constructed with Minitab 16 and XLStat 2014. All 64 possible combinations were randomly tested (order defined by the software) in duplicate against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. for antifungal activity, and MRC
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> cells for cytotoxicity. All compounds were distributed equally in the tested mixtures. All combinations were tested at concentrations ranging from 512 to 1 µg/mL such as performed for crude EOs.
