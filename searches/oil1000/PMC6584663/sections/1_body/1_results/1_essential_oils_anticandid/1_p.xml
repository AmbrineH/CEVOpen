<p id="Par8" class="p">The antimicrobial activities of 66 essential oils off commercial or laboratory origin were evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">albicans</italic> and two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">parapsilosis</italic>. The results are provided in the Supporting Information (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Antimicrobial activity was represented through a score ranking the global antifungal activity (Antifungal Activity Score, AAS). The scores ranged from 0 to 12, with 13 EOs having antifungal scores ≥ 5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). GC/MS analyses performed on all EOs allowed for the detection of 343 different compounds, distinguished by a compound code according to their retention time and mass spectra. Major compounds identified among the most active EOs are also listed in Table
