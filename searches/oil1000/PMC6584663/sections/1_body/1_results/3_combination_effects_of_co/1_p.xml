<p id="Par12" class="p">Citral was commercially available as a mixture of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>) isomers. Since the contribution of both isomers seemed identical, the mixture of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-citral was used for the rest of the work under the name citral. The effect of the six putative antifungal markers citral (Ci), thymol (Th), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide (Li), eugenol (Eu), eugenyl acetate (EA), and (−)-citronellol (–C) alone or in combination with the others was measured using a full factorial design of experiment (DOE). A fractional DOE appeared inappropriate as it was difficult to omit a priori one interaction effect or the other while a full factorial designed required only 128 experiments (64 in duplicate).
