<p id="Par13" class="p">The effect of factors and interaction plots for the antifungal activity calculated from the DOE are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. (Z)-ligustilide is the strongest antimicrobial compound (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Among the 64 combinations tested, for which the antifungal scores ranged from 0 (control) to 11 (Li:Eu 50:50), all the mixtures containing ligustilide exhibited antifungal scores ≥7, with an average antifungal score of 8.1, whereas the mixtures that did not contain (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide exhibited an average antifungal score of 5.6. Citral also exhibited a significant antifungal effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> 0.013). Moreover, the full interaction plot indicates that a slight positive interaction effect exists between citral and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide (average antifungal score of 8.2), thus demonstrating a synergistic effect of these two compounds.
