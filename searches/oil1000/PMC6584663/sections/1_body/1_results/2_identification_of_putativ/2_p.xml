 </sup>, exhibiting a MIC &gt; 64 µg/mL when concurrently tested as a pure compound. The positive coefficient of β-pinene in the OPLS model coefficient-plot evidently originated from its presence in a large relative proportion (6.7 and 14.9%) in moderately active 
 <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic> EOs (antifungal scores of 4–5), along with approximately 60% of eugenol. β-Pinene was also present in many inactive essential oils, although always in a proportion below 6%. Overall, this explains why its regression coefficient was positive, and why β-pinene was excluded from the list of active metabolites.
