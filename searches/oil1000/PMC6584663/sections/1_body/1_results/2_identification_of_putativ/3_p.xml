 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide. In contrast, other compounds such as α-pinene or limonene did not correlate to the EOs antifungal activity because they were also present in some of the inactive EOs. Whereas thymol and ligustilide had VIP values slightly lower than 1, they were selected for further analysis

 </sup>. Their role as putative marker was confirmed by their interesting antifungal potential when tested individually. All selected compounds had AAS ranging from 3 (eugenol) to 9 ((
