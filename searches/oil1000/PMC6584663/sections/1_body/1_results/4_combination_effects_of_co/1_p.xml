<p id="Par14" class="p">The impact of combinations on the selectivity index, here defined as the average IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>(MRC
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> cells)/MIC ratio, was evaluated following the same full factorial experimental design. The effect of factors and interaction plots for antifungal activity are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The two compounds with a significantly positive effect on the selectivity index are (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and eugenol (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> 0.021). Citral demonstrated no effect, and the other three molecules showed a somewhat negative effect, although it was not statistically significant. (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-Ligustilide-containing mixtures exhibit an average SI of 0.21 whereas this value is 0.13 in the absence of the compound. The effect is less obvious for eugenol, with an average SI of 0.18 in the presence of the compound, and 0.16 in its absence. The full interaction plot clearly shows a strong positive effect between (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide and eugenol with an average SI of 0.24 for these two compounds in association. Overall, if the presence of eugenol exerts almost no effect on the antifungal potential of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide, then combinations of these two compounds offer the advantage of decreasing (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide cytotoxicity. On the other hand, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide/citral combinations, which demonstrated intriguing antimicrobial activity, showed no improved selectivity when compared to (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide alone (average SI of 0.21).
