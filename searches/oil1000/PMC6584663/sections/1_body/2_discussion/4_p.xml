<p id="Par18" class="p">The second step was devised to understand the interactions between terpenes on a larger scale, rather than focusing on their individual bioactivity and mechanism of action, and eventually design optimal antifungal mixtures. Such an approach may lead to the development of novel effective antimicrobial agents based on the construction of artificial bioinspired blends. The possibilities of using reconstructed EOs, synergistic combinations of terpenes or synergistic combinations of EOs with antifungal drugs have been explored in the literature

 </sup>. While synergy has been found in some cases, our group also found antagonistic effects between terpenes, and noted that the antimicrobial potentials were simply additive in many cases.
