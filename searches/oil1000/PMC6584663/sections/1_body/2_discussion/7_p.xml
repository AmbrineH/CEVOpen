<p id="Par21" class="p">In conclusion, this work was originally designed as a model study to evaluate the utilization of statistical design for the discovery of innovative antimicrobial natural products and their respective mixtures. To our knowledge, this is the first time that chemometrics and statistical design were associated in a single study to perform a full investigation of putative antimicrobial markers. We highlighted that mixtures of (

Combinations of these two substances in various ratios should be studied, and it will be enlightening to evaluate the interaction effects of either or both (
