<p id="Par17" class="p">OPLS analysis allowed for the identification of seven terpenes influential for this model: (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-citral, thymol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide, eugenol, eugenyl acetate, and (−)-citronellol. Although OPLS analysis did indicate compounds present in high amounts in numerous strongly active EOs such as citral (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> mixture) and eugenol, it also determined additional metabolites such as (−)-citronellol. Moreover, limonene and α-pinene, which were present in very high proportion (90.0 and 77.1%) in active EOs did not exhibit positive regression coefficients because they were also occurring in inactive oils. For example α-pinene was present in variable proportions (from 9 to 55%) of different inactive EOs from the dataset (including 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cupressus sempervirens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Mikania micrantha</italic>) besides 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">trilobata</italic> EO. Limonene was present in proportion ranging from 40 to 96% in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs, or from 43 to 60% in 
 <italic class="italic">Licaria canella</italic> EOs. These results are in accordance with literature data

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup> and with our experimental data, in which limonene and α-pinene tested concurrently were considered inactive pure compounds
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. Interestingly, Maree 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. also identified eugenol as a marker contributing to the antibacterial and anticandidal activity of their selected oils

 </sup> whereas limonene and α-pinene correlated with samples with poor antimicrobial activity. The statistical tool also discovered thymol and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide as putative antifungal activity markers, despite the fact that these compounds were only present in one (ligustilide) or two (thymol) of the 66 EOs. These results reinforce the interest of using chemometric approaches to search for active metabolites in complex mixtures.
