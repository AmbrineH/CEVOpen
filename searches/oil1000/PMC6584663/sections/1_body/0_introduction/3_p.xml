<p id="Par4" class="p">Plant volatile organic compounds serve as chemical answers to the pressure from predators and pathogens and in conspecific and mutualistic interactions. They act through various modes of action linked to the structural and functional diversity of their components

 </sup>. They could, therefore, represent one solution to fight microbial resistance. More particularly, synergy is a composite concept, simultaneously uniting interactions between inactive molecules to create active mixtures and isolated active compounds leading to even more active associations, the second point being the focus of our research.
