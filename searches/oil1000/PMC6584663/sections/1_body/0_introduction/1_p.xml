 </sup> and the global mortality of patients suffering from microbial infections is increasing regularly. Resistance to azoles and cross-resistances to azoles and echinocandins are now emerging in medically relevant fungi

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, it seems that pathogens may be more indomitable than imagined, and even the WHO, alongside several authors, is indicating that humanity is on the verge of a postantibiotic era
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, it is now demonstrated that antibiotic resistance is a natural and ancient phenomenon, even described in pristine environments without exposure to human antimicrobial agents. Inadequate use of antimicrobials may also promote the selection of pre-existing resistance elements

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, even the well-reasoned use of antibacterial and antifungal compounds may be insufficient to prevent the acquisition of resistance, and new concepts and techniques are necessary to manage microbial pathologies.
