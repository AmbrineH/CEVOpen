 <p> ( A) Main effect plot for selectivity index (SI, ordinates). Li: (Z)-Ligustilide; Eu: Eugenol; Ci: Citral; Th: Thymol; EA: Eugenyl acetate; -C: (−)-Citronellol. Abscissa = −1: average SI for mixtures that do not contain the compound; Abscissa = 1: average SI for mixtures containing the compound. ( B) Interaction plot for selectivity index. Abscissa = −1: the two dots represent the average SI for mixtures that contain the cited compound and do not contain the other; Abscissa = 1: average SI for mixtures that contain both compounds. In this representation, two positive slopes indicate synergism, and two negative slopes denote antagonism. Otherwise, the effects are additive. </p>
