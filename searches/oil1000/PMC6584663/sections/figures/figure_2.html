 <p> ( A) Main effect plot for Antimicrobial Activity Score (AAS, ordinates). Li: ( Z)-Ligustilide; Eu: Eugenol; Ci: Citral; Th: Thymol; EA: Eugenyl acetate; -C: (−)-Citronellol. Abscissa = –1: average AAS for mixtures that do not contain the compound; Abscissa = 1: average AAS for mixtures containing the compound. ( B) Interaction plot for Antimicrobial Activity Score. Abscissa = –1: the two dots represent the average AAS for mixtures that contain the cited compound and do not contain the other; Abscissa = 1: average AAS for mixtures that contain both compounds. In this representation, two positive slopes indicate synergism, and two negative slopes denote antagonism. Otherwise, the effects are additive. </p>
