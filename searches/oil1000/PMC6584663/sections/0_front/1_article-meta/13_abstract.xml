 <p id="Par1" class="p">Mankind is on the verge of a postantibiotic era. New concepts are needed in our battle to attenuate infectious diseases around the world and broad spectrum plant-inspired synergistic pharmaceutical preparations should find their place in the global fight against pathogenic microorganisms. To progress towards the discovery of potent antifungal agents against human pathologies, we embarked upon developing chemometric approach coupled with statistical design to unravel the origin of the anticandidal potential of a set of 66 essential oils (EOs). EOs were analyzed by GC-MS and tested against 
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">parapsilosis</italic> (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration, MIC). An Orthogonal Partial Least Square (OPLS) analysis allowed us to identify six molecules presumably responsible for the anticandidal activity of the oils: (
  <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide, eugenol, eugenyl acetate, citral, thymol, and β-citronellol. These compounds were combined following a full factorial experimental design approach in order to optimize the anticandidal activity and selectivity index (SI = IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>(MRC
  <sub class="sub">5</sub> cells)/MIC) through reconstituted mixtures. (
  <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-Ligustilide and citral were the most active compounds, while (
  <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ligustilide and eugenol were the two main factors that most contributed to the increase of the SI. These two terpenes can, therefore, be used to construct bioinspired synergistic anticandidal mixtures.
