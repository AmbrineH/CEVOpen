<p class="p">The extraction processing was conducted in a 500 mL extraction vessel (Hunan Supercritical Extraction Company Ltd., Jiangsu province). The extraction was according to S. R. Sargenti [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] with minor modification. Briefly, a 200 g dried substance would be placed in an extraction kettle, including extractor and separator would be heated to 30°C and 25°C, respectively. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is cooled in a condenser and filled into the extractor. The pressurization was conducted to maintain the pressure at 20 MPa by filling the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; thereafter, the flow of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was adjusted to 20  L/h for essential oil by circulatory extraction. After extraction, the separation temperature and pressure were controlled to 25°C and 4 MPa, respectively. To evaluate the effect of the variables on the extraction yield of essential oil, those factors, including the extraction time, extraction temperature, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow, were studied, respectively, with single-factor experimental. The standard deviation is less than 4.0%.
