<p class="p">The antimicrobial activities of the plant extracts and fractions were determined by paper disc diffusion assay [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The diameter of each inhibitory zone was measured (in mm). Negative controls were prepared using the same solvents employed to dissolve the plant extracts. Citral was used as positive control.
