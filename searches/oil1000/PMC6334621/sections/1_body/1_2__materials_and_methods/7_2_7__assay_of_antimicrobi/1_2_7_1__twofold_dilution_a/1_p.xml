<p class="p">Two bacterial strains and two fungal strains were used in this study: 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. All strains were gained from Key Laboratory of Academy of Life Sciences in Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Hunan, China. The bacterial cultures were grown in the liquid medium at a suitable temperature. The bacterial strains were incubated on micrococcus, nutrient, and YM media and then cultured with shaking for 12 h at 37°C or 30°C. Two plant extracts, which were, respectively, collected within SFE and HD process, were screened for antimicrobial activity using a serial twofold dilution assay [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each compound was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited microorganism growth. Bacterial growth was evaluated visually based on the degree of turbidity. Citral was used as positive control.
