 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves were collected from a local farm in Changsha, Hunan, soon after harvesting, and then transported and preserved in our laboratory. The leaves were air-dried (6% of moisture) and milled into powders using a frozen broken molecular machine (SPEX SamplePrep, USA). Powders were screened through an 80-mesh sieve and kept in a refrigerator at 4Â°C until further use.
