<p class="p">The compositions of essential oil obtained by HD and SFE (in evaluated condition) were analyzed by a GC-MS analysis. The examination was performed on a Scion SQ (Bruker, USA) equipped with an 8400 autosampler. Samples were injected into the capillary column in the split and splitless modes. A 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L aliquot of test solution was injected into a DB-5 (30 m × 250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m, Agilent, USA). The oven temperature was programmed at 5°C/min from 40°C (hold 2 min) to 100°C (hold 2 min) and then 10°C/min to 250°C (hold 2 min). The injector temperature was set at 230°C in the split and splitless modes. The flow rate of the carrier gas helium was set at 1 mL/min, the transmission line temperature was set at 200°C, and the ion source temperature was set at 250°C. The electron ionization (EI) source operated at −70 eV. The MS spectra were monitored in the full scan mode from 15 to 500 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> with a scan event time of 0.3 s and a scan speed of 2000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>/s. The solvent delay time was set to 6.00 min. MS data analyzed by GC/MS were processed by Analyzer Pro Software (Spectralworks Ltd., Runcorn, UK) including deconvolution of mass spectra, data collection, alignment, and normalization. Metabolite peaks were deconvoluted and collected using an area threshold of 7,000, height threshold of 1, signal to noise ratio of 3, width threshold of 0.01, scan windows of 5, and smoothing of 5. The data were aligned with a retention time window of 0.3 min.
