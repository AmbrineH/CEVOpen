<p class="p">As a newly and environmentally separating technology, SFE, also referred to as pressurized extraction, employs environmental-friendly agents, such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and water, as the mediator. SFE is an effective and selective sample separation technique, which has been widely used in industrial production, environmental analysis, and analytical chemistry [

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and SargentiLan√ßas [2] found that the SFE was efficient in selectively fractionating the essential oil under mild extraction conditions. They also evaluated the effect of different factors on extraction yield of essential oil by SFE, resulting in 1.51% of essential oil [
