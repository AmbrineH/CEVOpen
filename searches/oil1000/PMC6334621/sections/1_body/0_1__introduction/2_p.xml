<p class="p">However, the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> essential oil has always been obtained by hydrodistillation extraction (HD) method. Actually, the HD is a widely used method to measure the yield of thermally stable essential oil even today. Various researchers have extracted the essential oil from different oil crops with HD [

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] extracted the essential oil (of 0.03% feedstock) from

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] extracted 0.25% and 1.75% of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> P. and 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic> R. by the HD. 2.69% of essential oil was extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> by the HD with the response surface method (RSM) reported in [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In addition, Sargenti and Lan√ßas [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] performed and reviewed the relative analysis for extraction efficiently of essential oil with various methods, indicating HD can be widely used as a common processing for most thermally stable essential oils. However, many research studies had reported that the high temperature and long treatment time in extraction processing contributed to degradation of thermosensitive compounds and need a great amount of energy consumption [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to continue to search and establish possible alternative process to further improve essential oil quality. Furthermore, in considering the subsequent separation of the essential oil in extraction processing, our group proposed the method of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) in this study.
