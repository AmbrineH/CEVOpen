<p class="p">The objective of this study was therefore to optimize the SFE conditions so as to obtain the highest essential oil yield from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves. In this study, the supercritical carbon dioxide was employed to extract the essential oil, and the operational parameters were optimized using response surface methodology. The chemical compositions of the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves were also identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil extracted by SFE were compared with those obtained by HD.
