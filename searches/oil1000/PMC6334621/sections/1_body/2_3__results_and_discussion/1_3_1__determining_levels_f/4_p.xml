<p class="p">The effects of extraction pressure on the extraction yield of essential oil were studied with five levels at intervals of 5 MPa from 10 to 30 MPa. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(d)</xref>, with an increase in the extraction pressure from 10 to 25 MPa, the yield of essential oil was significantly increased (from 2.7% to 4.0%). As the extraction pressure rose from 25 to 30 MPa, the extraction yield of essential oil changed little (∼4%). This was probably, according to the supercritical extraction principle reported by some researchers [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], due to the enhancement in density and diffusivity of supercritical fluid with the increasing extraction pressure, which prompted the improvement of the strength of extraction. However, it was found that higher extraction pressure decreased the mass transfer time, even carrying part of extracted essential oil in a separator. Consequently, the extraction yield would be stabilized within higher extraction pressure. In consideration of cost, within the range of 22–28 MPa, was the appropriate extraction pressure during SFE processing in this study.
