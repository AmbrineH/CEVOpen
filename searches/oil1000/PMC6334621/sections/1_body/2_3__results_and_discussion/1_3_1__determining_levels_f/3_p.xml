<p class="p">The influence of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow of 8, 12, 14, 18, and 22 L/h is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(c)</xref>, which indicated that the flow of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was a notable factor influencing the extraction results. When the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow increased from 8 L/h to 16 L/h, the extraction yield of essential oil increased sharply, achieving from 2.4% to 3.6%. With the increasing flow of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, nevertheless, there was an abnormal decrease in extraction yield of essential oil. Some researchers indicated that it would be conducive to the area of effective contact between feedstock and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at the lower velocity condition so that it could be much easier to extract the essential oil from original [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Besides, when the flowing of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was too higher, it would possibly lead to the inadequacy for the area of contact, but also part of extracted oil could be brought back to the extractor from the separator, in which the mixture was not separated thoroughly for the shorter separation time. It was, thus, of interest to obtain essential oil within limits of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow.
