<p class="p">By comparison, some recent studies had reported that various factors existed in the separation reactor would have had an influence on the yield of active substance extracted from biomass during SFE processing [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Accordingly, some key factors, such as separation pressure and separation temperature, were evaluated for the SFE treatment in this part. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">1(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">1(f)</xref>, the effect of separation pressure and separation temperature was investigated from 2.5 MPa to 4.5 MPa and 20°C to 40°C, respectively. It was abnormally apparent that the separation pressure and separation temperature resulted in an insignificant impact on extraction yield, wandering in 3.5% approximately. The result was beyond the expectation and inconsistent with previous results that the subsequent separation process would play a restrictive role on extracting essential oil, indicating the supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> had an outstanding capability of efficient extraction of essential oil with SFE, which was not affected by separation pressure and separation temperature. Consequently, in consideration of cost, 3 MPa and 25°C (at room temperature) were selected to be the separation pressure and separation temperature in the next experiment.
