<p class="p">In recent reports, many researchers have indicated the efficiency of extraction would be impacted significantly by some factors in SFE processing, such as extraction time, extraction temperature, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow, which were respectively studied to evaluate the impact of parameters on the SFE; the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Firstly, the effect of different extraction time periods on the extraction essential oil yield was examined at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min in the process of SFE. The essential oil produced during SFE with respect to extraction time on extraction yield is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Results in the extraction yield of essential oil was increased with the extraction time going up from 30 min to 150 min. When the extraction time was shorter than 60 min, the oil was extracted significantly from the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> but the yield was still at a lower level. At 120 min, the extraction yield of essential oil reached 4.0% (w/w on origin feedstock). Thereafter, the extraction yield was almost stabilizing with the extension of time, which would increase the cost of SFE treatment. Therefore, it is favorable to choose the range of 110–130 min as a desirable holding time for the SFE of essential oil.
