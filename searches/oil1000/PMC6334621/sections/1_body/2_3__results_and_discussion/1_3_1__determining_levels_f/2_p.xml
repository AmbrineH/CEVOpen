<p class="p">Extraction temperature was one of the factors affecting extraction effectiveness. According to the above results, the influence of extraction temperature at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40°C was studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(b)</xref>). As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(b)</xref>, the extraction yield of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> essential oil reduced significantly with the extraction temperature going up from 20°C to 40°C. Thus, there are obviously a large number of the essential oils extracted during the SFE, from 2.6% to 4.0%. The reason maybe the viscosity of supercritical fluid decreased and the diffusion coefficient of fluid increased with the elevation of extraction temperature, meanwhile the Brownian motion of essential oil in 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> was enhanced so that accelerated the processing of mass transfer, resulting in improving the dissolubility of oil [

However, no obvious variation in extraction yield was shown after 35°C. In addition, the constituent and structure of essential oil would be degraded and destructed according to some reports [
