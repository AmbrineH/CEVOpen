<p class="p">In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of the variables on the essential oil of extraction yield from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves, the predicted model was presented as 3D/2D response surface graphs, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, respectively, which were generated with one variable kept at its optimum level and varying the others within the experimental range (shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These variables were optimized as follows: extraction time 120 min, extraction pressure 25 Mpa, extraction temperature 35°C, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow 18 L/h for the SFE process. Under optimized condition, the extracted essential oil reached 4.40%. Nevertheless, the result is comparable to that reported elsewhere on extraction of essential oil with various extraction methods, indicating that the SFE had significantly higher extraction efficiency and was the most energy-saving method than other methods, combining with an auxiliary instrument that could raise the cost of production [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Consequently, these results have suggested that the SFE treatment is effective for selectively extracting the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> and may be expected to use in others active components extracted from various plants in future.
