<p class="p">After the single-factor study about the evaluation of the impact of various parameters on the SFE treatment, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the results had revealed the various components that changed tendency in the material, including extraction time, extraction temperature, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow, extraction pressure, separation pressure, and separation temperature, respectively. Thereinto, the separation pressure and separation temperature were not considered in this experiment. Although a large number of essential oils had been extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> in the SFE treatment, the high efficiency needs severe treatment conditions that would increase the cost of SFE treatment. In addition, it would be also increase the cost because of interaction of various variables. Accordingly, these variables were taken into careful consideration by using Boxâ€“Behnken design (BBD) with the soft of Design-Expert V8.0.6 in this study.
