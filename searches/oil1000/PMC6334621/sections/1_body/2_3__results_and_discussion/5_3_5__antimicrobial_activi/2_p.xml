<p class="p">In summary, the SFE extracts have significant antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>, respectively. Antimicrobial activity in essential oil depended on mostly aldehydes and acid esters [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Recently, some literature reported there was the highest level of activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with tea oil, tannic acid, and saponins [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Accordingly, these observations suggested that the antimicrobial activity of essential oil may be due to the presence of ester bond and ether bond [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Other phenolic acid-like phenols were also thought to contribute to plant defenses against pests and pathogens [
