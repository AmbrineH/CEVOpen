<p class="p">The antimicrobial activities of extracts gained from HD and SFE had been assessed using a serial twofold dilution assay and paper disc diffusion assay, according to Hu et al. [

 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 6</xref> shows the variation in the antimicrobial properties of the essential oil extracted from the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves. Among bacterial strains, the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> has the strongest inhibitory effect by the essential oil. Meanwhile, the essential oil shows the antifungal or anticandidal activity as well. On the other hand, more precise data concerning the antimicrobial properties of the extracts were obtained by paper disc diffusion assay [

 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 6</xref> indicates the maximal inhibitory zones for each of the microorganisms that were sensitive to the extracts, which were in the range of 15–35 mm. Thereinto, the greater inhibition was observed in the case of the SFE extracts than the others. Hence, the SFE extracts was significant antimicrobial or antifungal activities against all of the microorganisms tested, except
