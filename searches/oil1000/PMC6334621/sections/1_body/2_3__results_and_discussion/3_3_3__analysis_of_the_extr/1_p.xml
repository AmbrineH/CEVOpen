<p class="p">The chemical compositions identified in the essential oils extracted by HD and SFE are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. There were 35 compounds identified in HD essential oils while 41 in SFE essential oils. These compositions were grouped into seven classes (hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, alkanes, and others) according to their functional groups. Alcohols and aldehydes were the main compositions in the essential oils extracted by HD and SFE. The abundant alcohols can promote the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaf essential oils used for cosmetic applications. The contents of flavourless alkanes in SFE oil were much lower than those of SFE (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), indicating that the essential oil in SFE contains fewer impurities, which were similar to the previous report [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The main component of essential oil extracted by SFE and HD was geranialdehyde and the next was geraniol, which were consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the content of this major compound in SFE extracts was higher than HD. This proved that supercritical fluid did not alter the main effective components in 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> essential oil, but the content of effective composition and extraction yield of essential oil was higher [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>].
