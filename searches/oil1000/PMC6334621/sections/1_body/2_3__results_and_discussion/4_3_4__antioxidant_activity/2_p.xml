<p class="p">Besides, the model of scavenging the stable DPPH radical is a widely used method of evaluating the free-radical scavenging ability of natural compounds. In the DPPH test, the antioxidants were able to reduce the stable DPPH radical to the yellow-colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging was thought to be due to their hydrogen-donating ability [
