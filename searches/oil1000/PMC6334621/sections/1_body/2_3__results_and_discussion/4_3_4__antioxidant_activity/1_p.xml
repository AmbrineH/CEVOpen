<p class="p">In this study, antioxidant activity of essential oil from the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic> leaves was evaluated using DPPH scavenging and 1,2,3-phentriol self-oxidation activity assays. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of essential oil are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. As reports, 1,2,3-phentriol rapidly autoxidizes in the autoxidized solution, and several intermediate products, such as O

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Therefore, antioxidant ability can be determined by the scavenging activity of self-oxidation of 1,2,3-phentriol. 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows that both essential oils, extracted by SDE and SFE, respectively, had much more effective scavenging power for self-oxidation of 1,2,3-phentriol than BHT and ascorbic acid and it should be explored as a potential antioxidant with SFE process.
