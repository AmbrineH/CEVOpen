<p class="p">The essential oil was attained from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citronella</italic>, a common herbaceous plant, by supercritical fluid extraction, resulting in 4.40% of essential oil extracted under mild condition. Alcohols and aldehydes were the main compositions in the essential oils extracted by HD and SFE. Compared with HD essential oils, the SFE essential oils contain fewer impurities and had better antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Supercritical fluid extraction has presented an outstanding feature in efficient extraction of active components of the plant, which can be a desirable candidate for the current extraction processing.
