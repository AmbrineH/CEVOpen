<p class="p">Many species of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> produce rhamnolipid but there are some reports of lipopeptides produced by 
 <italic class="italic">P. fluorescens</italic> BD5 and 
 <italic class="italic">P. putida</italic> (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Acid precipitation is commonly used to purify glycolipid (rhamnolipid) while for purifying lipopeptide, solvent extraction is frequently used but some authors used acid precipitation as well (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to purify the majority of high molecular weight biosurfactants with a considerable amount of protein contents (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). However, a very few articles used this method to purify rhamnolipids. In this method after centrifugation, floating materials contained high concentration of biosurfactants (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). The result of preliminary characterizations showed that produced biosurfactants contained some hydrocarbon and lipid compounds and suggested it was glycolipid as expected from species of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa.</italic> Moreover, the result of ESI-MS confirmed rhamnolipid production with this isolate and it showed 4 different congeners of rhamnolipids (Rha-Rha-C10, Rha-Rha-C8-C10, Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and Rha-Rha-C10-C12:1) in the partially purified biosurfactant.
