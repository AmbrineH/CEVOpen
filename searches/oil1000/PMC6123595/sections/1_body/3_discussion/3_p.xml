<p class="p">According to amphiphilic properties, some biosurfactants are able to break stable emulsions of oil in water or water in oil (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). In addition, for first time the use of rhamnolipid for demulsification of waste crude oil was cited with efficiency of 98% (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). However, the current study showed that this biosurfactant could not destabilize the model emulsion prepared with span-80-kerosene: Tween-80-distilled water with 30:70 ratios. Some effective factors were reported such as culture age, pH and temperature on demulsifying activity. Therefore, pH and temperature with effects on the ionization of emulsion ingredients or any ionized group on the bacterial surfaces and the viscosity of oil phases, respectively, could be effective on demulsifying activity (
