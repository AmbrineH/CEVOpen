<p class="p">Strain ZN was selected as high-efficiency biosurfactant producing strain through preliminary screening methods and 16S rDNA sequencing result showed isolated strain exhibited the highest similarity (99%) to 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. In the presence of n-hexadecane as carbon source, biosurfactant production occurred on the exponential phase. The result was reported when 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> MR01 grew in the presence of glucose. Although some biosurfactants such as surfactin were considered as a primarily products and produced during the exponential phase, limitation of some essential medium ingredients especially nitrogen sources, played a key role for biosurfactant production (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). The maximum rhamnolipids production was reported by 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> UKMP 14T in the presence of glycerol and ammonium sulfate as carbon and nitrogen sources with C/N ratio 14:1 (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). The best C/N ratios for rhamnolipids production were 20:1 and 10:1, respectively, were also confirmed these issue (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). While in the current study, results of oil spreading assay and statistical analysis showed that strain ZN was able to produce biosurfactants in a wide range of C/N ratio between from 10 to 40.
