<p class="p">For preparing the stock solutions of kerosene and Tween-80, 0.8 g of Span-80 (Sigma, Lot No. 98k09888) and 1 g of Tween-80 were added to 1 L of kerosene and 1 L of distilled water, respectively. Before using, they have been stirred for 1 min. To identify model emulsions, different ratios of Span-80-kerosene: Tween-80-distilled water (70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60 and 30:70) were performed. The total volume was 10 ml. Then, they were mixed on a vortex at maximum speed for 3 min and were incubated at 30 Â°C under a static condition. After 24 h, the most stable emulsion was selected as a model emulsion. To carry out demulsification assay, 1 ml of cell-free supernatant was added to 9 ml of model emulsion and mixed vigorously 3 min to form a uniform emulsion and incubated for 24 h (
