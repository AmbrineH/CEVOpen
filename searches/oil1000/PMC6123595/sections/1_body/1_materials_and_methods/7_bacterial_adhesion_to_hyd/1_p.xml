<p class="p">BATH test is indicative of bacterial cell hydro-phobicity in the presence of biosurfactant. One ml of fermentation broth was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged to separate bacterial cells. Then, the cell pellets were washed and suspended in buffer part of modified BH2 medium to obtained approximately 1 for OD
