<p class="p">Partially purified biosurfactant with acid precipitation and column chromatography was used for all process of biosurfactant characterization. The primary biosurfactant structures were determined with a variety of spraying techniques on thin layer chromatography (TLC). In this method, the developing solvent was ethyl acetate: hexane ratio 80:20. The spraying methods were described as follows: ninhydrin, iodine vapor and molish reagents for detection of amino acids, lipid domains and carbohydrate compounds, respectively (
