<p class="p">For partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis, following isolation bacterium chromosomal DNA with High Pure PCR template preparation kit (Roche Applied Science, Germany), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using CinnaGen PCR Master Mix (Cat No. PR8252C) containing MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, PCR buffer, dNTP mixtures and enzymes. Afterward, primers and template DNA were added. In this study, one set of primer 27f (forward primer 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) / 1510r (reverse primer 5′-TACGGYTACCTTGTTA CGACTT) was used to amplify conserved sequences of the bacterial 16S rDNA. The final volume of reaction was 50 μl including 25 μl Master Mix, 1 μl of each primer, 1 μl template DNA and the rest of volume, sterile deionized water was added. PCR amplification was carried out using a thermal cycler (Techne, UK) with following program: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, then 33 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 sec, primer annealing at 56 °C for 55 sec and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product was sequenced by CinnaClone Company and sequence homologies were performed with NCBI. A consensus neighbor-joining tree was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0. The sequencing result was submitted to GenBank with accession number KX808675.
