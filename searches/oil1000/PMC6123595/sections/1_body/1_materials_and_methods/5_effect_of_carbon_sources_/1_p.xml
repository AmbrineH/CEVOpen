<p class="p">In order to determine the optimum conditions for biosurfactant production, modified BH2 culture medium with different carbon sources such as: decane, n-hexadecane, glucose, glycerol, paraffin and cooked oil, at concentration of 1% (w/v) and after selection the best carbon source, different C/N ratios such as: 10, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 were used. The culture media were incubated at 30 Â°C, pH 7 and on rotary shaker at 130 rpm for 10 d. The biosurfactant production and its activity were investigated oil spreading test and E24, respectively at regular time intervals.</p>
