<p class="p">Individual rhamnolipid congeners were identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry equipped with LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA, USA). The sample was dissolved in methanol at a concentration between 0.01–0.5 mg/ml and negative ion mass spectra were recorded in the

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> range of 50–1200. This experiment was carried out under the following conditions: syringe 5 μl/ml, nitrogen sheath gas and auxiliary gas at 20 and 35 (arbitrary units), respectively, spray voltage to 4.5 kV, capillary temperature at 250 °C, capillary voltage to 47 V and tune lens offset to 40 V (
