<p class="p">Two methods were carried out to recover biosurfactants: acid precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation. For acid precipitation method, pH of cell-free supernatant was decreased to below 2 with HCl or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and followed by storing at 4 °C for overnight. The pellet contained biosurfactants were removed by centrifugation (10000 × g, 20 min) and dissolved in sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.6), in the next step, acidification was carried out again (

In order to carry out ammonium sulfate precipitation, 40% of this compound was added to cell-free supernatant and incubated overnight at room temperature. The floating materials were collected by centrifugation (10000 × g, 20 min) and dissolved in distilled water (
