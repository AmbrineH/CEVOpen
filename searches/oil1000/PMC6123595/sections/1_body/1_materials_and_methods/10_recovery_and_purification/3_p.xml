<p class="p">Although a large volume of impurities was removed in the former recovery steps, there were some residual hydrocarbons and bacterial metabolites which co-extracted with biosurfactant. To address this problem and also separation of different biosurfactant congeners, liquid column chromatography was an advantageous technique. A 26 × 3.3 cm column filled up with 20 g silica gel 60 (200–425 mesh)-ethyl acetate slurry and then loaded with 1 g of biosurfactant in ethyl acetate. To remove hydrocarbons used as carbon sources, initially the column was washed with ethyl acetate and after that washed with 40 ml of different ratios of ethyl acetate: methanol (100, 90:10, 60:40 and 100). Oil spreading test was carried out for each fraction (
