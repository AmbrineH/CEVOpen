<p class="p">Results of preliminary tests of developed TLC spraying assay with ninhydrin, iodine vapor and molish revealed that the biosurfactants produced by this isolate contained three different spots (13, 57 and 65 mm) with a low amount of amino acids, which may be due to presence of residual cell debris, a large amount of carbohydrate and lipid groups. These results were confirmed with staining assays on cell-free supernatant with Bradford and anthrone reagents that showed a large number of glycolipids. The exact characterization result obtained with ESI-MS was indicative that the presence of four different congeners of rhamnolipid: Rha-Rha-C10 (479
