<p class="p">In the modified BH2 medium containing with 1% (w/v) n-hexadecane, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> sp. ZN grew to 3.5 during 3 d; hence, surface tension of cell-free supernatant decreased from 70 to 29 mN/m as its minimum level. Cell hydrophobicity (BATH test or CH %) increased immediately after incubation to maximum value (about 55%); Then the end of incubation time it gradually decreased to approximately 40% (
