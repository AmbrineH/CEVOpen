 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> sp. ZN produced rhamnolipids during exponential phase and a wide range of C/N ratios between 10 and 40 had no significant effect on production process. On the other hand, the ability of biosurfactant production in the presence of cooked oil and n-hexadecane is indicative that the using of this strain in order to biodegradation of light fractions of crude oil and wastes of food industries has been optimistic.
