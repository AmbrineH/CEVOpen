<p class="p">Trizol solution (Life Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for total RNA isolation in liver tissue. The total RNA of the sample was synthesized by a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cDNA was used as a template for quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qPCR). qPCR was conducted using Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mixe (Thermo Scientific). Relative quantitative analysis of target genes were calculated as expression ratios of the housekeeping gene.</p>
