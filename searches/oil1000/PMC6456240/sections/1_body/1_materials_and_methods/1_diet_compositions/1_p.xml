<p class="p">Three diets were used in this study to evaluate the contribution of methionine, the essential nutritional component. The first was the normal diet (Pico 5053) as a control. The second was a choline-deficient diet (CDD), custom-made with a modified AIN-93G diet, with no added choline bitartrate product. The third was an experimental soy protein diet (SPD), custom-made with a modified AIN-93G diet and soy protein, with no added choline bitartrate product. The SPD replaced casein protein, the source of protein in the normal diet and CDD, with soy protein. Detailed amino acid compositions of the diets are shown in 
 <xref rid="t1-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The normal diet and CDD contained 0.62% and 0.51% methionine, respectively, while SPD contained 0.22% methionine. The food was stored at 4Â°C prior to consumption.
