<p class="p">For liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> knockout mice, it is impossible to examine the sensitivity of liver disease due to severe liver damage from birth. Therefore, it is necessary to use liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> heterozygous mice to conduct efficient research. Liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> +/− mice and wild type mice were raised in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Male mice (3 ~4 weeks of age) were fed with a normal diet, CDD, or SPD for 16 weeks. Body weight and food intake were measured twice a week. Mice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) and sacrificed. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the liver was removed. Serum and liver samples were stored at −80°C until analysis. All experimental animals were handled and treated in compliance with IACUC standards of Ewha Womans University (approval number 18–021).
