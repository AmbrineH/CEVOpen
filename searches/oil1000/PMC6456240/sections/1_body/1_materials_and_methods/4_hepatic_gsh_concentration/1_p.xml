<p class="p">The concentration of GSH was estimated by reducing total oxidized GSH using GSH reductase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Liver tissue was homogenized by adding 10 times phosphate buffered saline, and centrifuged to measure the protein concentration of the supernatant. The protein was deposited from the supernatant with the same amount of 0.6 M perchloric acid. The content of GSH was assessed by mixing 0.01 mL of sample with 0.1 mL GSH reductase (10 units/mL) and 2.5 mL of reaction buffer [1.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 0.1 mM 5,5â€²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 0.15 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 50 mM NaPO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)], and measuring the change of absorbance at 412 nm between 0 and 60 s. From the GSH standard curve obtained using GSH (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), GSH concentrations in the samples were calculated in nmol/mg protein.
