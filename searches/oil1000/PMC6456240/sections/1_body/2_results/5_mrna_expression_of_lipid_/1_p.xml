<p class="p">To evaluate whether or not the observed changes in gene expression further altered hepatic lipid metabolism, expression of liver lipid metabolism-related genes were examined (
 <xref rid="f3-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fatty acid translocase (
 <italic class="italic">Cd36</italic>), a gene involved in the uptake of fatty acids, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 a (
 <italic class="italic">Cpt1a</italic>), gene involved in the mitochondrial Î²-oxidation, showed higher expression in mice fed the CDD compared with the normal diet, but lower expression in mice fed the SPD compared with the CDD. The CDD increased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (
 <italic class="italic">Acc2</italic>) compared with the normal diet, and the SPD increased mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Acc2</italic> compared with the CDD. Furthermore, the CDD decreased mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (
 <italic class="italic">Fasn</italic>) compared with the normal diet, and the SPD increased expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Fasn</italic> compared with the CDD. The CDD caused upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (
 <italic class="italic">Scd1</italic>), a gene involved in the lipogenesis, compared with the normal diet. However, the SPD did not increase mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Scd1</italic> compared with the normal diet.
