 <xref rid="f2-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The livers of mice fed with the CDD showed an abundance of lipid droplets and vesicle, and hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation in the liver parenchyma and portal duct. The livers of mice fed with the SPD showed small amounts of lipid droplets and lower infiltration of inflammatory cells into the area surrounding the hepatic portal vein. Since hepatic lipid deposition is a key component of NAFLD, the liver samples were processed for oil red O staining to examine the effect of experimental diets on hepatic steatosis. The CDD and SPD induced hepatic lipid accumulation.
