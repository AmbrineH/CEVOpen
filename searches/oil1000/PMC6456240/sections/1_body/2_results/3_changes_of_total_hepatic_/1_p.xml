<p class="p">To evaluate the hepatic antioxidant capacity, total GSH concentrations were measured. The GSH concentration was significantly decreased in mice fed with the CDD and SPD compared with the normal diet. Mean hepatic GSH concentrations (nmole/mg protein) of each group were 191.18±12.31 (normal diet), 120.59±7.65 (CDD), and 136.30±10.25 (SPD) (
