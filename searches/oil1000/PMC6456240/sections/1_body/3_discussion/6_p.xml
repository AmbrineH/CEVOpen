<p class="p">Following on from these histological results, expression of key lipid metabolic genes were examined (
 <xref rid="f3-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Cd36</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cpt1a</italic>, genes involved in uptake of fatty acids (FAs) and β-oxidation, respectively, were increased by the CDD and SPD compared with the normal diet. As influx of FAs into hepatocytes is increased or decreased, FA oxidation occurs. Even if FA oxidation is increased by the CDD and SPD, it would not be able to compensate for diet-induced increases in hepatocyte FAs. Of genes involved in lipid accumulation, ACC2 regulates FAs β-oxidation by inhibiting CPT1, and FASN is an enzyme of 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> lipogenesis. Moreover, SCD1 plays a key role in the synthesis of TG. Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Scd1</italic> was increased in mice fed the CDD compared with the normal diet, but was not increased in mice fed the SPD compared with the normal diet. According to previous studies, consumption of a casein protein diet increases levels of serum insulin and hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (
 <italic class="italic">Srebp-1</italic>) and induces fatty liver in rats. However, consumption of a soy protein diet decreases serum insulin and hepatic 
 <italic class="italic">Srebp-1</italic> levels, and reduces fatty liver (
 <xref rid="b33-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). SREBP-1 serves as a transcription factor to regulate expression of SCD-1 (
 <xref rid="b34-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). Therefore, soy protein may attenuate lipid accumulation induced by choline deficiency in the diet in mice.
