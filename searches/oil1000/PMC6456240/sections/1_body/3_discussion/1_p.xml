<p class="p">The aims of this study were to investigate if soy protein diet impacts NAFLD, and to identify if deficiency of

 <xref rid="b26-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>), the CDD lowers methionine formation in animal livers by 20~25% and induces fatty liver (
 <xref rid="b27-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Therefore, we used CDD as a negative control for NAFLD deterioration when the methionine-deficient soy protein diet was ingested with choline removed.
