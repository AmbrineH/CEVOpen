<p class="p">GSH synthesis involves the two important enzymes glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSS. GCL is the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis and is composed of catalytic and modifier subunits, GCLC and GCLM (
 <xref rid="b51-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Gclc</italic> heterozygous mice have decreased levels of GCLC protein, and of GSH (
 <xref rid="b52-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>). Thus, reductions of GSH may be caused lowered

 <italic class="italic">Gclm</italic>, and
