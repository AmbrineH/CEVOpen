<p class="p">In the present study, we examined the contribution of soy protein to NAFLD induced by CDD. When wild-type mice were fed soy protein, hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation resulting from choline deficiency was relieved; this was confirmed by gene expression analysis. This preventive effect of soy protein on fatty liver may be due to the antioxidant ability of substances such as isoflavone and soy peptide in soy protein. Another important finding was that methionine metabolism was impaired in liver-specific
