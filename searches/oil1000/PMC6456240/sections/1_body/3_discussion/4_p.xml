<p class="p">Since antioxidant functioning affects physiological metabolism in animals, it is important to assess the biological antioxidant capacity. The hepatic concentration of GSH is one of the major indicators to protect the liver against oxidative stress, such as ROS, and determines susceptibility to liver injury (
 <xref rid="b31-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). To investigate the effect of soy protein on liver function, hepatic GSH concentrations were measured. Intracellular hepatic GSH concentrations were significantly reduced in mice fed the CDD and SPD compared with the normal diet (

 <xref rid="b10-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Hepatic GSH levels are decreased in NAFLD patients (
 <xref rid="b32-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). In the present study, no significant difference in hepatic GSH concentrations were observed between mice fed the CDD and SCD. Thus, it can be suggested that choline deficiency, and not methionine deficiency in the soy protein, is responsible for reductions in levels of GSH.
