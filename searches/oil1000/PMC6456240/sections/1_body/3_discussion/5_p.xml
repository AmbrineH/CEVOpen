<p class="p">Lipid metabolism is important to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Obvious differences in histopathological lipid content were observed between mice fed the normal diet and the other two diets, shown using Oil red O staining. In mice fed the CDD and SPD, the liver tissue was stained red, confirming lipid accumulation (
