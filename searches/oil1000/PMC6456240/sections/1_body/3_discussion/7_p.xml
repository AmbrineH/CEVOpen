<p class="p">In the immune system, cytokines secreted by immune cells control inflammatory responses and play important roles in cell survival, growth, and proliferation (

 <xref rid="b36-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Therefore, it is important to properly modulate the inflammatory response. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α plays important roles in liver injury (
 <xref rid="b37-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Tnf-α</italic> was increased in mice fed the CDD compared with the normal diet, but not in mice fed the SPD (
 <xref rid="f3-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>). It can therefore be suggested that SPD alleviates the inflammatory effect of choline deficiency. Previous studies indicate that soy protein enriched in isoflavone markedly reduces expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Tnf-α</italic> in the liver of obese or nephrotic rats (
 <xref rid="b38-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="b39-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). In this study, expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Il-10</italic>, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was increased in mice fed the SPD compared to the other two experimental groups. This anti-inflammatory property of soy protein is due to isoflavone, which is the active compound in soy and modulates immune response (
 <xref rid="b40-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). Therefore, soy protein inhibits induction of liver injury development.
