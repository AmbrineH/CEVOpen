<p class="p">To identify the effect of methionine-deficient soy protein on hepatic methionine metabolism and of 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> deficiency on hepatic methionine metabolism, expression of genes involved in methionine metabolism were examined. Expression of genes related to the methionine cycle, including 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gnmt</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sahh</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bhmt</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ms</italic>, showed different patterns of expression between wild-type and liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic>+/− mice. MAT1A catalyzes the first step in the conversion of methionine to homocysteine. Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic> was increased in wild-type mice fed the CDD and SPD compared with the normal diet; there is lower extrinsic methionine to maintain homeostasis of hepatic SAMe, and lower amounts of methyl donors for re-synthesis of intrinsic methionine in mice fed the CDD and SPD. However, in liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic>+/− mice, the CDD, but not the SPD, increased expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic>. It can be elucidated that in 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> deficient mice, the SPD inhibits the increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic> expression in the recovery system to maintain SAMe. The subsequent genes in methionine metabolism 
 <italic class="italic">Gnmt</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sahh</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bhmt</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ms</italic> showed a downregulated trend in liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">phb1</italic> +/− mice fed the SPD compared with the CDD. The SPD decreases overall methionine cycle pathway reactions when liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> is deficient in mice. Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Cbs</italic> was not affected by the experimental diets or genotypes. 
 <italic class="italic">Cth</italic> expression was increased in wild-type mice fed the CDD and SPD compared with the normal diet to increase cysteine, however this was not observed in liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic>+/− mice. These results suggest that methionine metabolism is remarkably decreased in liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> +/− mice fed the SPD. In patients with liver disease, hepatic mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gnmt</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bhmt</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cbs</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ms</italic> are significantly reduced compared with those without (
 <xref rid="b41-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>), and is coupled with abnormal methionine metabolism (
 <xref rid="b42-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="b43-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">Mat1a</italic> (
 <xref rid="b44-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Gnmt</italic> (
 <xref rid="b45-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="b46-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>) 
 <italic class="italic">Bhmt</italic> (
 <xref rid="b47-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">Cbs</italic> (
 <xref rid="b48-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>) knockout mice, and people with mutations in genes such as 
 <italic class="italic">Sahh</italic> (
 <xref rid="b49-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="b50-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>), are vulnerable to liver disease. Thus, abnormal methionine metabolism by methionine-deficient soy protein is observed in liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> mice, and this abnormal methionine metabolism may contribute to development of NAFLD.
