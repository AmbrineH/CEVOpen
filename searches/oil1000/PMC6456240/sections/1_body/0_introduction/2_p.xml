<p class="p">Methionine, which is mainly metabolized by the liver, is an indispensable amino acid and a precursor of many dispensable amino acids such as homocysteine, cysteine, and cystine (
 <xref rid="b9-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Thus, methionine deficiency results in decreases synthesis of other amino acids and consequential deficiency symptoms. Studies show that methionine deficiency induces growth retardation, decreases in levels of ALT and depletion of glutathione (GSH), and contributes to development of NAFLD through lipid deposition, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis (
