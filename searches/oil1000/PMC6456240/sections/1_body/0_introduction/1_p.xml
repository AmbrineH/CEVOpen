<p class="p">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease (
 <xref rid="b1-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). The estimated prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 10~24% in various countries (
 <xref rid="b2-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). NAFLD comprises of various kinds of liver damage, such as simple hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), progressive fibrosis, and cirrhosis (
 <xref rid="b3-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). These diseases can develop into liver failure and further, hepatocellular carcinomas (
 <xref rid="b4-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for NAFLD pathogenesis are complex and have not yet been fully established. Hepatic steatosis is brought about by the following mechanisms: increased uptake of free fatty acid (FFA) into the liver, increased lipogenesis, decreased Î²-oxidation, and impaired hepatic export of triglycerides as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (
 <xref rid="b5-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Moreover, FFA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, and inflammation can cause NAFLD and hepatocyte injury (
 <xref rid="b6-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). A methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet has frequently been used as a nutritional model of NASH (
 <xref rid="b7-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). The MCD diet increases amounts of alanine aminotransferases (ALT) and induces hepatic histological changes, such as steatosis, focal inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis, and fibrosis (
 <xref rid="b8-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). These histological changes occur rapidly, and are morphologically similar to changes observed in human NASH.
