<p class="p">Prohibitin1 (PHB1) is a pleiotropic protein that has been preserved for a long time. PHB1 functions in various ways dependent on the cell type and subcellular location (
 <xref rid="b23-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). The role of PHB1 in cancer remains controversial, however it has been reported that PHB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the liver. Ko et al. (
 <xref rid="b24-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>) did not observe cristae or mitochondrial abnormalities in 3-week-old mice, whereas oxidative stress and hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 8-month-old liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> knockout mice. In addition, five-month-old male 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> heterozygous mice developed steatohepatitis, and upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines after feeding on an MCD diet for 3 weeks (
 <xref rid="b25-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> is closely related to liver disease susceptibility, and a number of relevant studies are currently in progress. Studies conducted in our laboratory have so far revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> deficiency likely increases susceptibility to hepatotoxicity due to a variety of external challenges. When 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> is deficient, mice show a higher sensitivity to alcohol toxicity, combined with increases inflammation and abnormal lipid metabolism (data not yet published). We therefore also investigated whether a methionine-deficient soy protein diet contributes to the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and if NAFLD deteriorates when liver-specific 
 <italic class="italic">Phb1</italic> is deficient.
