<p class="p">Soy protein is a good source of protein. However, the level of methionine is relatively low. Since methionine is the first limiting amino acid of soy protein (
 <xref rid="b15-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), abnormal changes in methionine metabolism can occur when soy is the major dietary source of protein. Furthermore, protein synthesis during methionine deficiency may be limited in those whose main food is beans, or in vegetarians who consume soybean protein as their major protein source. Since methionine is the initiating amino acid in eukaryotic protein synthesis (
 <xref rid="b16-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), cellular protein synthesis cannot be initiated in methionine-deficiency, which can lead to decreased growth (

There are many studies suggesting that soy proteins are beneficial to health, due to encompassing hypocholesterolemic, anti-carcinogenic, bone-sparing effects, hypotensive activity, and protection against metabolic diseases such as obesity or diabetes (

 <xref rid="b22-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). However, little is known about the adverse effects of soy proteins, with the exception of allergic reactions and poor their digestibility acting as a trypsin inhibitor (

 <xref rid="b22-pnfs-24-032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Despite the abundance of soy protein studies, few have examined development of NAFLD due soy protein-induced methionine deficiency. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a methionine-deficient soy protein diet on NAFLD and growth retardation in mouse.
