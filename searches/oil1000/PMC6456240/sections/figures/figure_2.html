 <p> Histopathological changes in the livers of mice fed the normal, choline-deficient diet (CDD), or soy protein diet (SPD). Liver tissues were stained with (A) hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and (B) Oil red O (Original magnification 200Ã—). CDD triggers steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltrations but SPD attenuates the symptoms. </p>
