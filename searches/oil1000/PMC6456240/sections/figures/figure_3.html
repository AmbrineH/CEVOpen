 <p> mRNA expression levels of (A) lipid metabolism genes and (B) inflammatory cytokines in the livers of wild type mice fed the normal, choline-deficient diet (SDD), or soy protein diet (SPD). The expression of Cd36, Ctp1a, Acc2, Fasn, Scd1, Tnf-α, and Il-10 was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Each bar represents the mean±SEM. Different letters (a–c) indicate significant differences among diets ( P &lt;0.05). </p>
