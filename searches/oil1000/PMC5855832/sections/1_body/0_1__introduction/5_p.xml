 <italic class="italic">Argania spinosa (Sapotaceae)</italic> is an endemic tree of south-western Morocco, which gives valuable Argan oil. The extraction of this oil was made by three methods: (i) a traditional method which is very slow and produces oil with an insufficient quality of conservation due to the water added during the process of extraction; (ii) a mechanical press which does not require the addition of water during extraction; and (iii) a solvent extraction method which produces oil with unsatisfactory organoleptic properties compared to the oil extracted by traditional method or by mechanical press. This technique is exclusively used to prepare the oil for cosmetic purposes [
