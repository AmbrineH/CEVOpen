<p class="p">Regarding the organ weight the results showed that H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> significantly increases the liver and kidney weight and relative weights while it decreases the brain weight and the brain relative weight. This was also observed with the co-administration of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with Argan oil. However, co-administration with the 
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil and Argan oil did not affect the relative weight of the kidney. The changes in the weights and relative weights of the organs may be due to histopathological changes caused by H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2.</sub>
