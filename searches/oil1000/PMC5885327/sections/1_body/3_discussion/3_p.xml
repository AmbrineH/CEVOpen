<p class="p">The gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum</italic> used in the present study revealed that β- citronellol (29%) and geraniol (18.5%) were the major constituents of the essential oil. Toxicity of β- citronellol and geraniol in 
 <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic> complex have been evaluated and ovicidal, larvicidal and moderate knock-down effect of these compounds in adults has been reported (Tabari et al., 2017). Antitrichomonal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum </italic>EO against 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae </italic>is probably due to its citroneloll, geraniol and linalool contents; however, further studies for elucidation of the most effective components and their mechanism of action are still required. Data obtained in this study introduced 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum</italic> as a potent natural antitrichomonal agent effective against 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic>. Bioactive components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum</italic> can be used as leading compounds in development of novel antitrichomonal drugs. In addition, further studies on probable inhibitory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">T. vaginalis</italic> are also recommended.
