A novel high-throughput method for isolating the lipid fraction and a novel three-part method for nanospray-based Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry (DI-MS) were developed to solve the particular problems of profiling milk in a high throughput manner. The data generated provides evidence of our ability to study the effect of formula in birth cohort studies on growth and development.</p>
