<p class="p">This evidence supports the theory of nutritional programming of infants. As self-reporting of mothers across a number of studies indicates that the majority of infants born in the West receive formula (either alone or with breastmilk) [

 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], an understanding of the composition of infant formula is required for investigating the growth and nutritional programming of infants. Despite the wide availability of formula and strict regulations, there is relatively little information beyond the concentrations reported on the package, which only cover macro- and micro-nutrients. A small number of clear and focused studies have profiled formula from particular regions [

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and even used them in metabolic studies [

 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, most of the studies that focus on the relationship between nutrition and development may only record volume, brand name or type. It is currently unclear whether we can compare infants being fed the same brand or same type, without detailed information on the molecular composition of the formula. This led us to the hypothesis that the lipid composition of formula is consistent between manufacturers, countries or by target demographic.
