 <italic class="italic">New method: Extraction of the lipid fraction</italic>â€”We designed experimental procedures that facilitated the profiling of both the phospholipid (PL) and glyceride (triglyceride and diglyceride, TG/DG) fractions in a high throughput manner. This is challenging in milk samples as triglycerides typically dominate (&gt;98%) and have distinct physico-chemical properties to the minor phospholipid component. We therefore developed an existing isolation method for high throughput (384w plate) profiling. The original method was designed for the isolation of both anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids [
