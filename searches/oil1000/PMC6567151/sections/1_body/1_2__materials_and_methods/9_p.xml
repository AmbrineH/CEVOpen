 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Investigation of the secondary hypothesis that the phospholipid profile comprised soya and/or milk lipids (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) used skimmed milk powder and soya milk as comparison samples. Skimmed milk powder is less perishable than fresh animal milk and varies little by season. It therefore represents cows’ milk lipids reliably.
