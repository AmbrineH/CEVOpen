The solution of formula (40 uL, prepared as above) was injected into a well (96w plate, Esslab Plate+™ (Chromacol, USA), 2·4 mL/well, glass-coated) followed by internal standards (150 µL, Mixture of Internal Standards in methanol (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-01122" class="xref">Supplemental File, Table S1</xref>), water (500 µL) and DMT (500 µL, Dichloromethane, methanol and triethylammonium chloride, 3:1:0·005). The mixture was agitated (96 channel pipette) before being centrifuged (3·2×

 <sub class="sub">2 (g)</sub>). A second portion of the extract (80 µL) was transferred to a shallow plate (96w, glass-coated) before being dried (N
 <sub class="sub">2 (g)</sub>), washed (hexane, 2 × 80 µL/well) and re-dissolved (DMT, 30 µL). The samples were transferred immediately to the high throughput plate and dried (N
 <sub class="sub">2 (g)</sub>). The dried films were re-dissolved (TBME, 30 µL/well) and diluted with a stock mixture of alcohols and ammonium acetate (100 µL/well; propan-2-ol: methanol, 2:1; CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COO.NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> 7·5 mM). The analytical plate was heat-sealed and run immediately.
