<p class="p">Positive mode processing used a deviations threshold of 10 ppm and a signal strength threshold of 2. Abundance/Signal intensity was plotted using 25, 50, 100% QC samples and a correlation threshold of 0·75 was used for both whole and petrol-washed samples. Variables with 0% values across all samples were removed before the intensities were signal-corrected. Finally, values more than 4 standard deviations from the average for each variable were considered outliers and discarded. Negative mode processing used a deviations threshold of 10 ppm. QC samples and a correlation threshold of 0·80 was used for both whole and petrol-washed samples. Processing of the negative mode with CID: deviations threshold of 12·5 ppm on a list of fatty acids of chain length 14 to 36 with up to six olefin bonds and/or one hydroxyl group. All signals stronger than noise were carried forward.</p>
