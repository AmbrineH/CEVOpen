<p class="p">The majority of products available were preparations made from bovine material (typically skimmed cows’ milk), across both ready-made liquid preparations and the larger packages (900 g) used by parents every day. As the latter are expected to provide the bulk of formula-fed infants’ intake, these were investigated in the present study. The lipid signals acquired through positive mode (glycerides, untreated), negative mode (phospholipids, washed with hexane) and fatty acid profile were compared using an unsupervised multi-variate test (Principal Component Analysis, PCA). Samples were compared by brand (British brands 1-4, UKB1-4), date sold (November 2017, June 2018, September 2018 and January 2019) and type (age of infant: 0–6 mo, 6–12 mo, 12–24 mo, 24–36 mo). A full set of PCAs is shown in
