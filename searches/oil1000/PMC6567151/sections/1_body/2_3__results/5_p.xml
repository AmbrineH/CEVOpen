<p class="p">An unsupervised MVA of the lipid profile of Dutch and South African infant formula based on bovine material and British formula based on caprine material, along with references of skimmed cows’ milk powder and soya-based formula, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A. This indicated that the lipid profile of British caprine-based formula differed little from the lipid profile of (cows’) skimmed milk powder, or Dutch infant formula based on cow’s milk. Soya-based formula was appreciably different from skimmed milk powder, indicated by it clustering in PC1, where skimmed milk powder was centred on the opposite side in PC1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). South African infant formula was scattered between these two points, with around two thirds of these formulae closer to the soya-based formula than skimmed milk powder.
