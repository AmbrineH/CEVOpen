<p class="p">The variety of lipid and glyceride profiles found in British formula led us to test whether the same formulations were used by one manufacturer across two regions of Western Europe. We used PCAs to compare two brands produced by the same manufacturer, one of which was sold in the UK and the other in the Netherlands. The glyceride fractions of UKB1 grouped clearly (

The difference in the subgroups of UKB1 0–6 mo and 6–12 mo differed by date of manufacture, suggesting that the formulation could have been changed within the order of ingredients listed. The increase in abundance of TG(50:02) in UKB1 formulations (
