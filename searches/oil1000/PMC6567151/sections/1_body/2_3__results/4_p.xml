<p class="p">There was also evidence for subgrouping by phospholipid composition, with two denser areas in the overall plot (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>H), suggesting that the composition of products differs between subtypes (target demographic age-range of infant) and date of manufacture. The ingredients listed on the packaging suggested that this distinction may be due to the presence of soya lecithin. PCAs were used to identify the variables that were the most important for distinguishing the two groups in one brand of formula (UKB1, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A) and which variables best distinguished the lipid composition of skimmed milk powder against soya milk,

Skimmed milk powder and soya milk preparations were used for this comparison as the former contains only milk lipids, where the latter contains no bovine material. The (unsupervised) multivariate analysis (MVA) showed that the same variables were the most important in distinguishing both the different groups of formulae and also cowsâ€™ and soya milk (
