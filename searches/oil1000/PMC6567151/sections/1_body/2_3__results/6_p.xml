<p class="p">A PCA plot of the glycerides in the same samples (collected in positive ion mode) indicated that the Dutch formula falls into two subgroups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>C). The ingredients listed on the packaging suggested that the mixture of oils differed in the composition of formula aimed at the younger (0–6 mo, 6–10 mo and 10–12 mo, 
 <italic class="italic">viz.</italic> 1, 2 and 3) and older (12–18 mo, 18–24 mo and 24–36 mo, 
 <italic class="italic">viz.</italic> 4, 5 and 6) infants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>C). The ingredients lists of the formulae aimed at younger infants quotes palm, rapeseed, coconut and sunflower oils. The formulae for older infants comprise palm, sunflower and rapeseed oils. This indicates that formulations for younger infants are comprised coconut oil and less sunflower oil than rapeseed oil. The variable loadings that are associated with the results of the unsupervised MVA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01122-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>D) show that the formulae for younger and older infants form two subgroups, albeit with variety within groups (mainly in PC2). These results are consistent with this and data already published on the fatty acid profile of rapeseed, sunflower and coconut oils [

 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. These studies showed that over 70% of the fatty acids in coconut oil comprised 14 carbons or fewer, where 80% of the fatty acids in sunflower and rapeseed oil comprised 18 carbons or more. The latter two oils differed in that sunflower oil contained about twice as many unsaturated bonds as rapeseed oil. This suggested that the groups of formulations in NLB2 products differ by both the length of the carbon chains of the fatty acid residues and the profile of 
 <italic class="italic">mono</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">di</italic>-unsaturated fatty acid residues.
