<p class="p">The evidence that formulae have contrasting lipid profiles over time and across brands etc. naturally raises the question of how this affects infants. Large-scale metabolic or random controlled trial studies that detail the lipid composition of both formula and the infants that receive it have yet to be reported. However, there are studies of the lipid profile 
 <italic class="italic">in circulo</italic> of formula-fed infants. This growing body of work suggests that the profile of lipids in the circulation of formula-fed infants at three months may be just as rich as for age-matched breastfed infants. There is even some evidence that formula-fed infants fall into subgroups, unlike breastfed ones [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The same studies suggest that the lipid profile of formula-fed infants is less varied at 12 months than that of breastfed ones [
