<p class="p">However, we also note that formula has evolved differently to fresh milk. Formula has been developed to the point of being a powder that readily forms an oil-in-water emulsion in lukewarm or cold water instantaneously, without using agitation equipment. Practical considerations have also led to it being less perishable than fresh milk. The formula we surveyed typically had a use by date of one month from opening and a date of manufacture as much as three months before it was sold. By contrast, cows’ milk is collected twice daily from the teat, stored for up to 48 h before transport to processing centres where it is pasteurised, homogenised and may be skimmed before being sold. Milk therefore typically reaches the supermarket shelf 3–6 days after collection. It has a use by date of around a week from the date of sale and is marked ‘consume within three days of opening’. Furthermore, evidence that fresh milk comprises active lipases [

 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] suggests that it will also change during storage in a way that a dry powder similar to those investigated in this study will not. Further work is required to determine the fragility of formula, in particular, the evidence for a considerable number of oxidised triglycerides (~4%). The metabolic effect(s) of species such as oxidised triglycerides have not yet been characterised in infants. There is reasonable evidence to warrant the assumption that these compounds can have possible down-stream biological activity [
