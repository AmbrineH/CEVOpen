<p class="p">The suggestion of possible down-stream effects of the components of infant formula, and indeed human milk, naturally raise the question of whether such components should be present in synthetic preparations, and if so, how much. The present study is unable to answer this question formally as it does not comprise metabolic studies. However, further work might include these, perhaps in an animal model, in order to test the relationship between individual molecular components and down-stream cardio-metabolic health.</p>
