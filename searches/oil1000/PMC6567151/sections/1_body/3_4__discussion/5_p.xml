<p class="p">However, despite the utility afforded by the present methods, it is not yet known whether other compounds present in milk, that fall below the limit of detection or for which there are not yet standards available, have associated metabolic effects. Our results show that the molecular profile of formula typically deviates significantly from fresh milk, both in terms of glycerides and lipids. However, a recent study of infant formula sold in Spain and human milk from Galician women suggests that in Galicia at least, the overall fatty acid profile of the two is generally similar except for essential poly-unsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. A combination of the results from that study and the present one therefore suggest that formula may possess different configurations of lipids and fats to human milk, rather than comprising different fatty acids. The essential
