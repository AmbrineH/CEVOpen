<p class="p">In this study, we used direct infusion mass spectrometry to survey the lipids and glycerides in an array of British infant formula, which were sourced over a period of 15 months, as well as formula based on cowsâ€™ milk sold in the Netherlands and South Africa and fresh animal milk. We developed new methods for extracting the lipid fraction from samples, which facilitated the profiling of both the glycerides and phospholipids and fatty acids in the latter. The triglyceride profiles are difficult to predict from the list of ingredients, because the formula tested comprises as many as seven sources of fat in unknown amounts. All formulae that were profiled comprised up to seven of eight sources of triglycerides (palm oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, fish oil, soya oil, single cell oil, oil from

 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], profiles of the fatty acid composition are not commonly available, may vary between regions and growing seasons or comprise a variety of sources (e.g., single cell oil). The phospholipid fraction of formula is typically constructed of material from milk and/or

Because there is a wide range of formulae available and the importance of having a comprehensive overview of the molecular profile increases with the uptake of formula, we needed to develop a high-throughput approach.
