<p class="p">The data collected in the present study rely on the methods used to both extract the analytes of interest and survey the mixture of them. The new preparative and analytical methods developed for this study are sympathetic to the experimental challenges that a large set of samples of milk and formula present. For example, there is at least 50 times as much fat as phospholipid in milk. This is an experimental barrier for detailed molecular profiling as the samples comprise species that differ in abundance by more than three orders of magnitude. This difficulty, as well as an interest in the lipid composition of milk, has led to studies focused on the lipid fraction in milk without profiling the glycerides [

However, we found that using positive mode for the glyceride fraction and negative mode for lipids alleviates many of the problems associated with the suppression of phospholipids by the much more abundant di- and triglycerides. Resolution was improved further by washing phospholipid samples with petroleum ether as this removes the bulk of glycerides. The latter succeeded in increasing the number of phospholipid isoforms measured in negative mode from 153 to 427. The abundance of glycerides means that only a handful were detected in positive mode.
