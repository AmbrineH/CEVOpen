<p class="p">There is a growing body of evidence that the mother’s diet and lifestyle programmes her infants’ metabolic activity for its lifetime [

 <italic class="italic">post partum</italic> may result in systems programmed differently and thus that behave differently. This may have influenced the development of formulations and led to them more closely resembling the fatty acid profile of breast milk. This may also have contributed to recent changes in the composition of infant formula. However, further work is required to elucidate what effect this has and how best to regulate or inform it.
