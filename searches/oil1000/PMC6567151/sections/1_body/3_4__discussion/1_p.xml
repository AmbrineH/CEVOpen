<p class="p">Most infants in the UK will be exposed to formula in early life [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. For many infants, it will be their main source of nutrition. At the moment, it is unclear if the lipid profile of the formula has an impact on the infantâ€™s growth and development. Our ability to characterise the relationship between the lipid composition of formula and infant growth and development relies entirely on the evidence we have about the composition of formula. In most research, it is assumed that formulae are the same or similar and there is very little appreciation of the possibility that the same brand and type of formula can change abruptly. It is also widely assumed that results of research on the effect of the local formula carried out in a particular region or country will be transferrable to other places.
