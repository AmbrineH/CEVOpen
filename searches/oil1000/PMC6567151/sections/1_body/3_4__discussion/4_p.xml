<p class="p">The use of a different mode for profiling phospholipids invites the question of whether or not this is reliable. Despite the possible differences in ionisation efficiency between different lipid head groups in the different modes, the abundance of phospholipids in fresh milk measured using negative mode DI-MS in this study are similar to studies using NMR, an orthogonal technique. 
 <sup class="sup">31</sup>P NMR has been used to profile the relative abundance of phospholipids in cows’ and Ewes’ milk [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and in formula [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Thus, the values reported agree with the abundance of these lipids as measured in negative mode in this study.
