<p class="p">It is not clear at present what effect a different presentation of a similar profile of fatty acids in human milk and formula has on infant development and whether it applies universally. There is evidence for different growth trajectories in breast- and formula- fed infants [

 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], for a different lipid profile in the circulation of breast- and formula fed infants [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-01122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. At present, it is not known precisely how much formula and human milk differ in other respects that influence growth, such as calorific value, mineral composition and protein composition. This is partly due to the experimental barriers of determining the variety of dietary intake across the globe but also the relationship between the motherâ€™s diet and lifestyle and the composition of her milk.
