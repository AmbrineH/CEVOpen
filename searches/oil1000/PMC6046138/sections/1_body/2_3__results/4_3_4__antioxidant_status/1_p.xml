<p class="p">The malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the treated quails decreased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and linearly with the increasing doses of the essential oil compared to the control group. The oral administration of the essential oil induced an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity relative to the control. However, this increase was significant only with 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/kg bw compared to all other doses (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The glutathione (GSH) activities in quails treated with essential oil at 100 and 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/kg bw were comparable and significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than activities recorded in control group and the group of quails treated with 50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/kg bw. The catalase (CAT) activities were comparable with 100 and 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/kg bw but significantly higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than CAT activity recorded in the control group (
