<p class="p">The lack of the intestinal reservoir containing microorganisms that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and degrading toxins before their intestinal absorption in birds [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] led to the massive use of antibiotics in the poultry industry to improve growth performances, as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. Since 2006, the European Union and the authorities of many countries in the world banded the use of antibiotics as feed additives in livestock because of speculated risk in generating antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microbiota [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. As a result, studies on natural products such as essential oils produced by aromatic plants, due to their diverse biological activities, have recently gained a great attention [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Among those aromatic plants,
 <italic class="italic"> Z. officinale</italic> is used worldwide as spice and medicinal plant. The
 <italic class="italic"> Z. officinale</italic> phytoconstituents essentially made up by flavonoid, phenolic acid, and terpenoid possesses many important pharmacological activities such as cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] which can be used in animal farm to boost growth, reduce oxidative stress and histological alteration in vital organs, and subsequently improve fertility. In poultry, producing the maximum number of fertile eggs and viable chicks is a major concern. The health of testes plays a central role in sperm fertilizing capability which is positively correlated to hatchability rate. Testicular weight is highly correlated to the physiological reproductive status in poultry breeders [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. A direct relationship has been established between sperm production and testes weight in boiler breeders [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Ferrouk et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] reported that testicular size is the primary endpoint for spermatogenesis since seminiferous tubules and germinal elements take about 98% of the total testis mass. The beneficial effects of ginger powder in poultry growth performances, egg production and quality, carcass traits, and blood biochemistry parameters can be attributed to the phenolics and flavonoids compounds present [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, up to now few studies have been designed to assess the efficiency of these actives compounds on poultry reproduction.
