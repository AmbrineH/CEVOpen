<p class="p">The present study revealed that the oral administration of essential oil whatever the dose increased significantly the serum content in total protein and globulin compared to the control. This result is consistent with the findings of Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] with 5â€‰g/kg of ginger rhizomes powder in broiler feed. The present results contradicted the findings of many other studies which recorded a significant decrease in serum protein and globulin levels in chickens fed on diet supplemented with ginger rhizomes powder [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The differences between these studies could be the result of difference in the doses used, the shape of the plant (powder, essential oil, etc.), the route of administration, and the experimental conditions. The increase in total protein and globulin may be due to phenolic components, including gingerol, shogaols, gingerdiol, gingerdione, and some related phenolic ketone derivatives of ginger essential oil [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], which have powerful antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties that allow them to improve immune responses.
