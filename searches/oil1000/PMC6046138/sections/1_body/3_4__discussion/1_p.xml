<p class="p">The present study revealed that feed intake, live body weight, and body weight gain were not significantly affected by the ginger essential oil treatments over the 12-week period. This observation agreed with the findings of Dieumou et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] who recorded no significant differences in feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio with 10, 20, and 40â€‰mg/kg bw of ginger essential oil for seven consecutive weeks in broilers. The findings of Fakhim et al. [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] also revealed no improvement in body weight gain of chickens fed on ginger supplements compared to the control group. Feed conversion ratio decreased nonsignificantly and linearly with the increasing doses of essential oil compared to the control. This effect could be explained by the various properties of phenolic and flavonoid compounds of the ginger essential oil in the digestive system of the animal. These bioactive compounds possess antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that allow them to reduce the free radical and pathogenic microbe's attacks and a better use of the nutrients in the digestive tract.
