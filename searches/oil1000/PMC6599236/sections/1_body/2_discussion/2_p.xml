<p id="Par18" class="p">After the success of functional complementation, we then overexpressed the KS domain in wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> under the seed-specific promoter. The result showed that seed weight was increased by 20–40%, and seed oil content was increased by 14% to 28% in four transgenic lines. The degree of the increase was coincided with the expression level of the KS domain in the siliques of these transgenic lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In addition, expression of the KS domain also had positive effects in seed germination and early seedling growth. This result suggests that the expression of the KS domain from the PUFA synthase could boost the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids, thereby increasing the oil content in transgenic seeds.
