<p id="Par19" class="p">In plant, the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids occurs in plastids by a type II fatty acid synthase complex comprising multiple discrete enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Among these enzymes, three β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KASI, KASII and KASIII) are key ones responsible for the condensing reaction, the first of four chemical reactions in a repetitive cycle of fatty acid synthesis by the addition of a two-carbon unit a time donated by malonyl-ACP. KASIII catalyzes the first condensation of fatty acid synthesis between acetyl-CoA/ACP and malonyl-ACP, giving a C4 acyl chain. KASI (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) catalyzes the subsequent condensation reactions from C4 to C16 acyl chains. KASII catalyzes the final condensation of fatty acid synthesis producing a C18 acyl chain. After synthesis, long-chain fatty acids are modified in cytosol and assembled into storage glycerolipid triacylglycerols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Previous studies showed that out of three KAS enzymes, KASI might be the most important in regulating fatty acid biosynthesis in plant. Knocking out/down of 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> gene could significantly reduce fatty acid production, while overexpression of it could increase seed weight and total fatty acids in seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Here, we showed that overexpression of a KS domain from the PUFA synthase of protist 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic> could increase seed weight by 20–40% and total fatty acids by 48–80% per seed relative to the wild-type control in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, which are much higher than those in the overexpression of plant endogenous KASI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. The reason for the difference in the two expressions remains to be determined. It is possible that the KS domain protein from the PUFA synthase might simply possess higher condensation activity. In addition, expression of a KS domain of PUFA synthases of microbial origin in plant might own an advantage in minimizing the possible feedback inhibition over the expression of an endogenous KASI [
