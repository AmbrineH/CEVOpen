<p id="Par17" class="p">In 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic>, the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs is catalyzed by a PUFA synthase, a polyketide synthase-like mega-enzyme comprising three subunits each with multiple catalytic domains predicted on the characteristic active site residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, the exact functions of these domains in the biosynthesis of these fatty acids are not well characterized. Our previous study indicated that a dissected KS domain from Subunit-B of the PUFA synthase from 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic> could complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (
 <italic class="italic">FabB)</italic> mutant and enhance the total fatty acid production in a wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. In the present study, this domain was further functionally analyzed in 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic>. As the 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic> mutant of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> was defective in growth and development, and not amenable for re-transformation to express the KS domain for the complementation test, we resorted expressing the KS domain in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> first and disrupting the endogenous 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> genes subsequently using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two homozygous insertion mutations of the target gene on the KS-expressed background were identified. Both resulted in the open reading frame shifting, which led to the inactivation of the 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In the two complementation lines, the defective phenotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic> knockout mutants such as small seedlings and dwarf plants were not observed anymore (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The RT-PCR analysis showed that transcription of the KS domain was detected in both leaves and developing seeds under the napin promoter, although the transcription level in developing siliques was 10 times higher than that in leaves. The similar expression pattern of the napin promoter has been seen in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic> and tobacco [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, the level of the KS domain expression under the napin promoter was enough for the functional complementation in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>.
