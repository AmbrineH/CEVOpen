 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> at the flowering stage grown in the growth chamber was used for transformation using the floral dip method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The transgenic seeds were selected by fluorescence and grown on soil for the next generation. The transgenic plants were genotyped every generation, and the seeds from positive lines were harvested and planted for the next generation. Genomic DNA of wild-type and transgenic plants was extracted with Edward method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. The PCR condition was 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s with primers F-KASI-1-seq and R-KASI-seq (Additional file
