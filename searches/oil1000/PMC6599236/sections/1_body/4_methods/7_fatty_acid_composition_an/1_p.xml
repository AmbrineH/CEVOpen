 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in methanol was added to the glass tube containing seed and internal standard. Sample was heated for 10 min at 80 °C, and seed was crushed by glass rod and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h to transmethylate fatty acids into their FAMEs. FAMEs were extracted with 2 mL of hexane and 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl. The total fatty acid profiles and quantity were analyzed on an Agilent 7890A system installed with a DB-23 column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm) [
