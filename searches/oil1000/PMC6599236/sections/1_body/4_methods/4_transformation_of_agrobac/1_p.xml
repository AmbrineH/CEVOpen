 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 were prepared as follows. 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium</italic> cells were grown for 24 h in LB medium with 50 µg/mL gentamicin. When the A
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> reached 0.7, the cells were chilled on ice and pelleted by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). The pellet was washed in 1, 0.5 and 0.02 volumes of cold 10% (v/v) sterile glycerol and resuspended in 0.01 volume of cold 10% (v/v) glycerol. The electrocompetent cells were then frozen in liquid N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and stored at ≤ − 70 °C. The 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium</italic> cells were transformed by electroporation with 20 to 50 ng of DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transformed cells were plated on a selective medium (LB agar with corresponding antibiotic), and incubated for 48 h at 28 °C. Transformed cells were grown for 16 h (28 °C, 225 rpm) in 5 mL LB broth with corresponding antibiotic and 50 µg/mL gentamicin. The fidelity of the construct was rechecked by PCR before floral dipping transformation.
