 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. RNA was extracted by Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Germantown, MD, USA) and treated with DNase I for 30 min to digest contaminating DNA in samples. The biosynthesis of complementary DNA was carried out using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix from Fisher Scientific (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and one cycle of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 15 s for melt curve stage.
