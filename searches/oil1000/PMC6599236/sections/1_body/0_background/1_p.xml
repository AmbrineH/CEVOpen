<p id="Par4" class="p">Plant seed oil is an important bioresource not only for food and feed, but also for industrial bioproducts such as biofuel and biopolymers potential for replacing non-renewable petro-polymers and petro-fuels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Therefore, increasing oil content in seeds has long been one of the primary targets in the breeding programs of oilseed crops. In the past few years, the success has been made through various molecular breeding approaches, such as manipulation of transcriptional factors in carbon partitioning, regulation of the biosynthetic process of lipids, and overexpression of key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis and assembly. For instance, overproduction of the regulator WRINKLED1 in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Seed-specific expression of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol transferase 1 (DGAT1) for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) enhanced oil content by about 20% in

In addition, increased activity of plastidial enzymes such as biotin carboxyl carrier protein isoform 2 (BCCP2) in acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase (ACCase), pyruvate transporter (BASS2) and purple acid phosphatase 2 could also raise oil levels in oilseeds [
