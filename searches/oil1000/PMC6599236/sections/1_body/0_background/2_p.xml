<p id="Par5" class="p">In plant, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in plastids where acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA initially, and then, a type II fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex uses malonyl thioester as an extender for the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids such as 16:0 and 18:0 through a repetitive cycle of four catalytic reactions: condensation, keto-reduction, dehydration and enoyl-reduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. After synthesis, these two long-chain fatty acids are often desaturated by a soluble acyl-ACP Δ9-desaturase in the stroma of plastids giving 16:1–9 and 18:1–9. Subsequently, these saturated and monounsaturated long-chain fatty acids are exported to cytosol where they can be further modified by desaturations to introduce more double bonds or elongations to extend the chain length. With few exceptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>], higher plants do not possess capacity to synthesize very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) with the chain length of 20C or more and the double bonds of two or more.
