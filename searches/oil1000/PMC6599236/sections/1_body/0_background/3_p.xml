<p id="Par6" class="p">De novo biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs occurs mainly in microorganisms where their biosynthesis goes through either an aerobic pathway catalyzed by desaturases and elongases or an anaerobic pathway catalyzed by a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase. 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic> is a protist producing a high level of a nutritionally important VLCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6-n3). Biosynthesis of this fatty acid is catalyzed by a PUFA synthase, a polyketide synthase-like mega-enzyme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Structurally, the PUFA synthase shares similarity to both type I and type II fatty acid synthases in catalytic domains and motifs. Functionally, both PUFA synthase, and type I and II fatty acid synthases catalyze the synthesis of fatty acids through similar reiterative reactions such as condensation, keto-reduction, dehydration and enoyl-reduction using acyl-ACPs as substrates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. The PUFA synthase in 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic> comprises three large subunits, each with multiple catalytic domains. However, the exact functions of these domains remain poorly understood. Our previous study showed ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS) domains from the PUFA synthase could functionally complement the defective phenotype of two 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> mutants of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases. Particularly, overexpression of one KS domain from subunit-B (KS-B) resulted in accumulation of a high level of total fatty acids as well as unsaturated fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. The aim of this study was to extend our previous research on this domain to model oilseed plant 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> for further functional analysis. The results showed that the KS domain was functional in the plant and able to complement the defective phenotype of an 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis KASI</italic> knockout mutant generated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated  protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9), and the seed-specific expression of this domain in wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> significantly enhanced seed weight and seed oil and promoted seed germination and seedling growth. These results emphasize that the condensation process of the fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a limiting step and the enhanced activity by overexpression of the KS domain from a PUFA synthase of microbial origin offers an attractive biotechnological approach to increase oil content in oilseed plants.
