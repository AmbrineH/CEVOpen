However, key residues in the active site such as a cysteine (C), two histidines (H) and a lysine (K) essential for the decarboxylation during the condensation process were completely conserved among these sequences. In addition, a glycine (G) residue presumably located at the accepting entrance of the substrate-binding tunnel and two threonine (T) residues likely involved in hydrogen bonding with the ACP phosphopantetheine moiety were also highly conserved. Furthermore, a glycine-rich motif located in the C-terminus contributing to the formation of an oxyanion hole for decarboxylation reaction was also observed among these sequences [
