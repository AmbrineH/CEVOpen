<p id="Par13" class="p">As the first approach for the complementation assay was unsuccessful, we then resorted the second approach by expressing the KS domain in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> first and then disrupting 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> under the KS-expressed background. A transgenic plant expressing the KS domain obtained using the second construct for the first transformation was re-transformed with the disrupting construct of CRISPR/Cas9, and transgenic seeds were selected on both green (by eGFP) and red (by 
 <italic class="italic">Ds</italic>Red) fluorescence signals and grown to the next generation for genotyping and phenotyping. Genotyping analysis identified two mutation lines (
 <italic class="italic">KS</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic>-9, 
 <italic class="italic">KS</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic>-15) with insertion mutation in the target gene. One had a single nucleotide insertion, while the other had a two-nucleotide insertion close to the targeted sites; both resulted in open reading frame-shifting mutations. Phenotypic observations showed that the two transgenic plants had comparable growth and development to the wild type, and no abnormal phenotypes were detected under the growth condition (Fig.Â
