<p id="Par12" class="p">To knock out 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, the disrupting construct was first used to transform wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic>. The transgenic seeds were selected under a fluorescent microscope and grown to the next generation for genotyping and phenotyping. Genotyping transgenic T2 plants by sequencing the amplicons of targeted genes identified three homozygous lines with deletion mutation between two targeted sites of the 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> gene (
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic>-1, 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic>-4 and 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic>-11). All these lines exhibited similar abnormal growth: smaller and shorter seedlings at the early growth stage and semi-dwarf at the late growth stage (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), compared to the wild type. The similar phenotype was previously observed in a 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic> mutant generated by a T-DNA insertion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Due to the severe growth defect, re-transformation of the mutant with the KS-expression construct for the complementation test was not successful.
