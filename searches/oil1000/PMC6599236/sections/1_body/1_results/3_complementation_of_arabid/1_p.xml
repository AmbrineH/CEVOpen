<p id="Par11" class="p">KASI is essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids in plant, and thus, knockout mutants of the gene for this enzyme in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] might not be easily obtained for the functional complementation test. Therefore, for the complementation assays of the KS domain in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, two approaches were attempted. The first approach was to generate a 
 <italic class="italic">kasI</italic> mutant 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> using a CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and then express the domain in the mutant, if it was amenable. The second approach was to express the domain first in wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> and then to disrupt the 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique.
