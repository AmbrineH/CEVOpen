<p id="Par14" class="p">To confirm the expression of the KS domain in a complementation line, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using total RNAs isolated from 7th to 8th rosette leaves and developing siliques at 14 days after flowering [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. A semi-quantitative PCR analysis showed that no expression of the KS domain was observed in the untransformed 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> control, but the expression of the KS domain could be obviously detected in both leaves and developing siliques of the complementation line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). A quantitative PCR analysis showed that the transcription level of the KS domain in developing siliques was tenfold higher than that in leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). This result indicated that the KS domain guided by a seed-specific napin promoter indeed possessed significantly higher expression in developing seeds than leaves, but it did express in leaves, providing the function for complementing the

 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>.
