<p id="Par9" class="p">The second binary plasmid was constructed to express the KS domain in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>. It was comprised of three expression cassettes. The first cassette was to express the KS domain as a standalone protein with a chloroplast transit peptide from 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> fused to the N-terminus under the control of the seed-specific promoter. The second cassette was to express a kanamycin-resistance gene under the control of a constitutive promoter for selecting transgenic plants. The third cassette was to express a red fluorescent protein gene (
 <italic class="italic">DsRed2</italic>) from 
 <italic class="italic">Discosoma</italic> under the seed-specific promoter for screening transgenic seeds (Fig.Â
