<p id="Par8" class="p">To functionally analyze the KS domain in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, two binary plasmids were constructed. The first one was used to disrupt endogenous 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> genes, and the other was used to express the KS domain as a standalone enzyme from the PUFA synthase. To generate a construct to disrupt the 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic> gene in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, two sets of overlapping sgRNA primer sequences targeting the conserved coding region of the gene were synthesized. The adaptor formed from each set of primers with a sgRNA sequence was inserted behind an 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> U3 promoter in an intermediate plasmid pLYsgRNA-AtU3d, giving a sgRNA expression cassette. Two sgRNA expression cassettes were amplified with universal primer sets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] and assembled into a CRISPR/Cas9 binary vector pYLCRISPR/Cas9-P
 <sub class="sub">ubi</sub>-B by a single golden gate ligation, giving the 
 <italic class="italic">KASI</italic>-disrupting plasmid. Besides the two sgRNA expression cassettes for guiding the disruption of targeted genes, this construct was also comprised of a cassette expressing 
 <italic class="italic">Cas9</italic> under a constitutive ubiquitin promoter for cutting the targeted sites, a cassette expressing a herbicide resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Bar</italic> gene under a constitutive 35S promoter for selecting transgenic plants, and a cassette expressing a modified green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from 
 <italic class="italic">Aequorea victoria</italic> under a seed-specific napin promoter for screening transgenic seeds (Fig.Â
