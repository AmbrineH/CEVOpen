<p id="Par15" class="p">To examine the impact of the KS domain in fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>, the second construct expressing the domain under the seed-specific promoter was introduced into wild-type 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>. Transgenic seeds were selected on a red fluorescence signal and propagated to the next generation. To confirm the expression of the KS domain, the total RNAs were isolated from the developing siliques of four transgenic lines (OE-6, OE-8, OE-13 and OE-16) and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. A semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the cDNAs showed that the expression of the KS domain was much higher than that of a housekeeping gene 
 <italic class="italic">Actin</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">2</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). A quantitative PCR analysis showed that the transcription levels of the KS domain were highly varied among the four lines. The expression level of the KS domain in OE-6 was the highest, followed by OE-16 and OE-13, and OE-8 had the least expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). Subsequently, the oil and mass of the seeds in these four transgenic lines were measured. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, all the transgenic lines accumulated more oil relative to the wild-type control and the amount of oil in the mutant complementation line lied between those in the control and transgenic lines. The amount of oil per seed in OE-6, OE-16, OE-13 and OE-8 was increased by 80%, 77%, 69% and 48%, respectively, over the control. In particular, the level of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) such as C18:1 and C20:1 was significantly higher in these transgenic lines over the wild type, the indicator of the seed triacylglycerol production seen previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. In addition, the decrease in total saturated fatty acids and the increase in total unsaturated fatty acids were also observed in the transgenic lines (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Intriguingly, the transgenic seeds were also significantly heavier, representing 1.4, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5-fold increase, respectively, relative to the wild type. Percentages of oil content in these transgenic lines exhibited increases by 14% to 28% over the control. Nevertheless, no significant difference in the seed protein content was detected between these transgenic lines and the control (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S2). These results indicate that expressing the KS domain can significantly increase both seed oil and seed mass in
