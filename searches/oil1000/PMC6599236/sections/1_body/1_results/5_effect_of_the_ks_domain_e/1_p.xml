<p id="Par16" class="p">To examine the growth effects of the KS domain, the growth phenotype of the transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> plants was carefully observed during the life cycle. No obvious phenotypical difference could be detected between transgenic and untransformed wild-type control except for seed germination and early seedling growth. The seed germination rates of four transgenic lines were considerably higher (217%, 205%, 211% and 203%) than that of the control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). The lengths of 4-day seedlings of the transgenic lines were all longer compared to the wild type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b). This result indicated the expression of the KS domain from the PUFA synthase in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> could promote seed germination and seedling growth.
