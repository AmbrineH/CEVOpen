  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">Plants used for traditional medicine produce diverse and complex secondary metabolites exhibiting various medicinal properties. The medicinal plant 
   <italic class="italic">Haplophyllum tuberculatum</italic> is used by native people against malaria and parasitic infections.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">In this study and in order to contribute for the search of new natural drugs for leishmaniasis, the essential oils of 
   <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> leaves, stems and aerial parts (leaves+stems) collected in two different periods, 2013 and 2015, and their components by GC/FID and GC/MS analyses were investigated. Those collected in 2013 were also re-analyzed two years later. The extracted oils were screened in vitro for anti-leishmanial activity on 
   <italic class="italic">Leishmania mexicana mexicana</italic> (
   <italic class="italic">L.m.m.</italic>) promastigotes and cytotoxicity on the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Limonene (1.5 – 8%), its isomers (
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>- (+)-limonene and 
   <italic class="italic">S</italic>-(-)-limonene), linalool and octanol were also tested.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">Results showed that the chemical composition varied according to the year of collection. Though major compounds remain almost the same, qualitative and quantitative variations in the composition of the EOs can be observed between the two years of collection, with some minor compounds identified only in one type of samples. Variation in the composition were also observed in the re-analyzed volatile oils, showing stability concerns. The essential oils and 
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>-(+)-limonene showed moderate anti-leishmanial activity. Their IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> range from 6.48 to 50.28 μg/ml. Cytotoxicity assays for theses volatile extracts, 
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>- (+)-limonene and 
   <italic class="italic">S</italic>- (-)-limonene on CHO cells showed relatively potent cytotoxicity with a selectivity index &lt;10. Their CC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> range from 27.79 to 82.56 μg/ml.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">The findings of the present study demonstrated that 
   <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> might not be considered as a natural source for production of new anti-leishmanial agents without further analyzing its eventual in vivo toxicity as well as that of major pure compounds.
