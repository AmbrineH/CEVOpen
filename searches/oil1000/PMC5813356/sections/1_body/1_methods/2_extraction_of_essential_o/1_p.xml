<p id="Par16" class="p">About 100 g of fresh plant parts (leaves and/or stems or roots) was subjected to a 3 h hydrodistillation with 500 ml of distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus (Clevenger, 1928). The leaves (L), stems (S), and leaves+stems (LS) essential oils (EO) obtained were separated from the distilled water and dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate. No oil was obtained from the roots part. The volatile extracts were stored in sealed glass vials at 4-5 Â°C.</p>
