<p id="p0125" class="p">Micropyrolysis has proved to be an adequate analytical tool for studying fast pyrolysis of genetically modified poplar. In particular, the combination of micropyrolysis and PCA allows discriminating between the biomass feedstocks based on their lignin composition, in terms of H, G and S units. About 46 compounds were identified in the pyrolysis vapours during Py-GC-MS studies performed using transgenic lines down-regulated for 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic>, and their control lines (Tin &amp; Tbr). A functional group analysis of pyrolysis vapour product distributions suggested 2-fold drop in methoxy phenols and dimethoxy phenols due to 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> suppression in transgenic lines compared to their wild-type. According to the PCA analysis, 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> downregulated transgenic lines produced about 33% reduction in syringyl (S) derived compounds and a 15% reduction in guaiacyl (G) derived compounds. The result is in agreement with the biosynthetic pathway, wherein 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> suppression causes decreased incorporation of sinapyl alcohol and sinapaldehyde in the lignin polymer. s
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation leads to nearly 51% reduction in S lignin-derived compounds, while 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulation caused only 7â€“11% reduction. Investigation of peak areas of pyrolysis vapours showed almost 20% decrease in G-derived products for all the transgenic lines. PCA applied in combination with K-means clustering was compared with thioacidolysis experiments and found that the models captured the trends in G and S composition reasonably well. The models could effectively discriminate between the wild-type and two 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> lines (Li18 and Li21), while the Li22 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> line was separated into a third cluster, likely because of its different level of downregulation. 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation causes a strong accumulation of soluble phenolics and their extraction via pre-treatment made the effect of the gene modification on the pyrolysis products more pronounced. From this work, it is concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation in field-grown poplar is a promising strategy to steer the bio-oil composition towards relatively low amounts of G-lignin derived products. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> downregulation is valuable to generate bio-oil with relatively more moderate quantities of G-and S-lignin compounds.
