<p id="p0055" class="p">Transgenic and wild-type poplar samples were subjected to fast pyrolysis to examine the effect of down-regulation of a specific gene in the lignin biosynthetic pathway on the release of products originating from lignin. At first, the pyrolysis vapour composition of non-pretreated transgenic samples was compared to that of their respective non-pretreated wild-type samples. Further, the transgenic lines were compared with their pre-treated counterparts to understand the influence of the extractives on the product spectrum. All the samples were analyzed at least in triplicate. In total 46 compounds were identified in all pyrograms, including the products originating from holocellulose (i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose (C), syringyl lignin (L-S), guaiacyl lignin (L-G), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl lignin (L-H) or lignin in general (L). All the detected compounds along with their retention time (on the presented GC configuration) and origin are listed in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Primarily, L-G and L-S derived pyrolysis compounds produced from the transgenic poplar were relatively lower than their corresponding wild type. A functional group-based analysis of lignin-derived pyrolysis products in terms of organics containing methoxyphenols, dimethoxyphenols, and phenols is presented in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. Overall, downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> led to a drop in methoxy phenols and dimethoxy phenols up to a factor of 1.6 (Li22 and Li11, respectively). Simple phenolic products, however, tended to increase up to 1.6 times during the transgenic poplar (Li22) pyrolysis.
