<p id="p0060" class="p">To extract a correlation in the data set six PCA models were developed, corresponding to each of the poplar types. At first, the number of principal components that need to be retained for each kind of transgenic and wild-type poplar pair were determined with the help of scree plots. The scree plot shows the relative contribution of the principal components to the total variance in the data set for either non-pretreated or pretreated samples. Principal components are included to reach a total sum of at least 70% of the original variation. Later, loading and scoring plots are created to gain insights on the significant contributions, either positive or negative, of the variables, i.e., detected compounds (shown in
