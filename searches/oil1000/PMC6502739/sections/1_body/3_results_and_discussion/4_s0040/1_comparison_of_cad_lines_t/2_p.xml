 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> model consists of Tin wild type and three transgenic lines, viz. Li18, Li21, and Li22. First, three principal components of the non-pretreated samples accounting for 46.93%, 22.60% and 14.03% of the total variance. These values remain similar for the three components of pretreated
