<p id="p0095" class="p">As no distinct clusters could be observed in the score plot of PC1 vs PC2 for the pretreated samples, the PC1 vs PC3 score plots was considered for clustering purposes (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>). The loading plots for PC1, PC2, and PC3 of pretreated samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>c and d. All originating lignin products except phenol (L-H1) and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (L-2) contribute positively to PC1. PC3 contains stronger positive contributions from S-type products, especially syringaldehyde (L-S3) and sinapaldehyde (L-S5). This is very interesting to observe as sinapaldehyde accumulation is very high in the lignin of CAD deficit plants, but negligible amounts of coniferyl aldehyde (L-G7). The strongest negative contributions come from 4-allylsyringol (L-S2) and G-type products. In the score plot (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>b) K-means clustering (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .15) with the Mahalanobis distance method results in 4 sample groups, one for each wild-type and transgenic lines. All three 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> lines are located in the half-plane for negative values of PC1 which indicates that the total amount of S and G lignin-derived products is lower in the pretreated 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> down-regulated samples compared to the Tin control line. For the non-pretreated samples, this was not observed. Therefore, for the 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> lines, the differences in all the three genetically modified materials were visible only after removal of extractives. This observation is substantiated by the work of Van Acker et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. According to their study CAD deficient plants accumulate massive amounts of sinapaldehyde (S(8–8)S) dimeric species as soluble phenolics. Pre-treatment of CAD deficient poplar samples with various solvents mentioned in 
 <xref rid="s0020" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref> results in the extraction of the soluble phenolics from the plant material.
