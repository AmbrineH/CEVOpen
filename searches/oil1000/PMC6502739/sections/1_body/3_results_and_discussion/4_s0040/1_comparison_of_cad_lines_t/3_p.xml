<p id="p0090" class="p">In this model, the untreated poplar lines are grouped in three clusters, viz. Tin wild-type, Li22 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic>, and Li18 and Li21 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> lines together in a third cluster, with a confidence interval of 85%. The three clusters are separated mainly by the first principal component. Interestingly, the transgenic line Li22 is on the positive axis of PC1 while the wild-type Tin is on the negative axis. The third cluster of Li18 and Li21 is at PC1 = 0 implying that no mutual differentiation can be drawn for these two types of samples. At this juncture, it is interesting to note the clear discrimination between Li18 and Li21, and Li22. Li18 and L21 are lines in which the 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> gene was downregulated using an antisense approach, whereas to generate Li22, the downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> was achieved through the introduction of a sense construct. This suggests that the two strategies for genetic modification result in a different material, presumably because of the different levels of CAD downregulation. The substantial positive contribution from lignin-derived products to the first and second principal components comes from 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (L-2), 4-propylguaiacol (L-G6), vanillin (L-G5), 4-ethylguaiacol (L-G3) and 2-methylphenol (L-H2). These products are found in the highest selectivities for the Li22 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> line and the lowest selectivities for the Tin wild type (score plot, 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>b). Coniferyl alcohol (L-G7), 4-vinyl guaiacol (L-G4), syringol (L-S1), syringaldehyde (L-S3) and guaiacol (L-G1) provide a significant negative contribution to the first principal component and are found in the lowest selectivities for Li22 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> and the highest selectivities for the Tin control line. For the second principal component, coniferyl alcohol and 4-vinyl guaiacol contribute the most in the positive direction, while phenol and 4-methylguaiacol provide a substantial negative contribution. S-units like L-S3, L-S4, and L-S5 and L-H1 have positive contributions to PC3 while L-G1, L-G7, and L-S1 are closer to PC3 = 0. The remaining lignin products are on the negative axis of the third principal component. Based on 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>b and c it could be concluded that the Li22 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> line produces higher amounts of coniferyl alcohol and 4-vinyl guaiacol and lower amounts of phenol and 4-methylguaiacol during fast pyrolysis, compared to the Li18 and Li21 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> lines. Since the lignin-derived products are not grouped but spread over all quadrants as can be seen in the loading plots 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>c &amp; d, it is difficult to conclude the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> down-regulation on the change of the amount of G, S and H units in poplar lignin based on the pyrolysis results. Thioacidolysis data (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) indicates a reduction in both S and G representative units in Li18, Li21 and Li22 transgenic lines. However, the ratio of S/G seems to either remain similar or increase compared to Tin. Downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> decreased the relative amount of G-lignin derived products about 25% based on the peak areas. The as
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation leads to a decrease of 21% in S-lignin derived compounds while s
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation showed as high as 51% decrease. This result is in line with the thioacidolysis data and the biosynthesis pathway.
