<p id="p0110" class="p">As the data points of Li03 and Li04 could not be decoupled from each other, a new data set was considered for PCA analysis. In this case, only lignin products have been studied from the pyrolysis of Tbr and 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated samples. The data point number 10 (Li03) was removed from PCA analysis as it was an outlier. Variance values of the first three principal components for the new data set are 53%, 21.8%, and 11.7%, respectively (8a). Three clusters could be identified with a confidence interval of 95%, namely Li02, Tbr and a combination of Li03 and Li04 as seen in 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>b. The clusters are shown in the score plot, 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>b. Surprisingly, the Li02 line (as
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic>) differentiates strongly on the PC1 from the other two transgenic lines, which are so-called sense (s
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic>) lines. The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulation is very evident in the new score plot. The loading plot between PC1 and PC2 also suggests that all the G-derived compounds contribute negatively to PC1, while the S-derived compounds syringaldehyde (L-S3), acetosyringone (L-S4) and sinapaldehyde (L-S5) contribute positively to both PC1 and PC2 (

 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulation should reduce the formation of coniferaldehyde and subsequently, sinapaldehyde. The score plots could be indicative that the amount of G units in the Li03 and Li04 transgenic samples was substantially decreased upon the downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> compared to the control line. The G and S units have been suppressed in Li03 and Li04, while there was a negative effect in Li02 samples. In accordance with PCA results, there was about 20â€“25% decrease in the G-lignin derived compounds upon the pyrolysis of all 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> poplar samples. However, only 7% decrease in S-derived compounds was observed during Li02 poplar pyrolysis. On the contrary, the greenhouse grown 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated lines showed an increase in S-derived products and a decrease in G-derived products relative to the control lines. Thioacidolysis data of field-grown poplar used in this work (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) indicates a minimal reduction in S and G units due to genetic modification. The negative effect of Li02 observed in PCA studies could be attributed to higher S/G ratios than other two 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated lines Li03 and Li04.
