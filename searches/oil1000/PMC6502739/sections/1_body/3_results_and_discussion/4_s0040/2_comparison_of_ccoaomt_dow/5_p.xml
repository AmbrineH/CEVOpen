<p id="p0115" class="p">No effects of extraction (pre-treatment of the biomass) on the fast pyrolysis selectivities of 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated samples could be concluded, as there was a random spread of data in the score plot (Fig. S3). It could be hypothesised that there was no accumulation of monophenolic extractives. One of two data points representing the Tbr wild-type (point no. 2) was grouped into the cluster of transgenic samples, and one data point from Li02 was consolidated with the wild-type samples, even at a confidence interval of 80%. This makes the transgenic cluster spread into the negative axis along PC1. The centroid of the cluster belonging to the transgenic poplar lines is on the positive axis of PC1, and the cluster representing wild-type samples is on the negative axis of PC1. Hence, there is a suppression of G and S units in the 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> lines, which is in line with the lower Klason lignin described for these lines in literature [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The loading points of PC1 vs PC2 convey that almost all the guaiacyl and lignin-derived products contribute negatively to PC1 (Fig. S3). Only L-S3, L-G5, and L-G2 have positive projections on PC1. This could indicate that the quantity of G and S units in the 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated lines has been decreased only by a marginal amount as compared to the wild-type.
