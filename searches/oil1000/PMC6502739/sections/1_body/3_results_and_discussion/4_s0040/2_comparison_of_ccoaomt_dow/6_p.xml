<p id="p0120" class="p">The effect of genetic engineering on large-scale pyrolysis is yet to be tested or on-going. However, with the insights obtained in the current work, it can be said that there is substantial potential to alter bio-oil compositions through engineered feedstock. Although, the modifications need to be more pronounced. Most recent CRISPR-Cas technology could facilitate more pronounced differences in biomass composition and thus in the resulting bio-oil [

 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. This could help in generating oils with substantially improved compositions and better properties for fuel or chemical applications. Moreover, in combination with a catalyst, there is a possibility to achieve high selectivity towards speciality chemicals.
