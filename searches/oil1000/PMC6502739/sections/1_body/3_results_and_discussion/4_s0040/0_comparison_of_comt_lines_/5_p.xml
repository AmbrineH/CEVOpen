<p id="p0080" class="p">The loadings of the pre-treated samples (Fig. S1), on the other hand, indicate that all the lignin-derived products (except L-H1 and L-2) contribute positively to PC1. Moreover, pre-treated 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> lines are found in the left half-plane of the score plot of PC1 vs PC2, i.e., on the negative axis of PC1. The wild-type is pulled towards PC1 = 0 by the deviating sample 3, although sample 1 and 2 are clearly in the positive part of the PC1 axis. The result for the pretreated 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> samples is similar that for the non-pretreated samples, except that L-G5 is not zero for PC1 and is less pronounced for its contribution to PC2. Hence, it is concluded that the pre-treatment of the 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> samples does not have a significant influence on the pyrolysis vapour composition of the genetically engineered poplar and wild type samples.
