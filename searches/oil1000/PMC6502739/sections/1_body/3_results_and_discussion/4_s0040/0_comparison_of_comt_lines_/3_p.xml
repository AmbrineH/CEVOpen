<p id="p0070" class="p">The score plot of PC1 vs PC2 (5b) shows two clusters of 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> and Tin samples with clustering performed at a confidence interval of 85%. Based on the corresponding loading plot (5c), it can be observed that the most considerable positive contributions to the first principal component (PC1) come from G and S lignin units, especially syringol (L-S1), 4-allylsyringol (L-S2), syringaldehyde (L-S3), acetosyringone (L-S4), sinapaldehyde (L-S5), 4-ethylguaiacol (L-G3), 4-vinyl guaiacol (L-G4), 4-propyl guaiacol (L-G6), and coniferyl alcohol (L-G7). The other positive contributions to PC1 come from 2-methyl phenol (L-H2), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (C28), 2-furanmethanol (C21), hydroxyacetaldehyde (C11), furfural (C20), methanol (C4), 1,2-ethanediol monoacetate (C17) and acetic acid (C12). The remaining polysaccharide pyrolysis products contribute negatively towards PC1. Lignin products such as 4-methyl guaiacol (L-G2), phenol (L-H1) and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (L-2) are the most significant negative contributions to PC1. Vanillin (L-G5) and 2-propenal (C6) have nearly zero contributions to PC1, while they are the highest positive and negative contributors to PC2, respectively. On the other hand, all the S derived products contribute positively, and all the G derived products (except L-G6) give negative contributions to PC3 (

 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> lines as compared to the control line. The reduction in G lignin products could either be due to a decrease in G lignin units in transgenic lines or low release of these products during pyrolysis.
