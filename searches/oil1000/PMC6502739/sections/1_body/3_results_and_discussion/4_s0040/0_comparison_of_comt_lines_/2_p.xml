<p id="p0065" class="p">In the case of the 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> model, one control line (Tin wild type) and two transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> lines (Li09 and Li11) were considered. PC1 and PC2 described 53.37% and 27.89% of the total variance in the scree plot for untreated 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> and Tin control samples. On the other hand, for the pre-treated 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> and Tin samples, the first three principal components represented 57.67%, 26.66% and 6.53% of the total variance. The scree plots of untreated and pretreated samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>a and Fig. S1, respectively. The score and loading plots for the principal components PC1 vs PC2 and PC1 vs PC3 of untreated samples are shown in
