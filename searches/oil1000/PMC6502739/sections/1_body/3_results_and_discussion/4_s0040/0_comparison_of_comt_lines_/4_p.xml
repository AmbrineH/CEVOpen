 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> support the observations made from PCA. There has been a significant reduction in S/G ratios. This is due to a substantial decrease in sinapyl alcohol incorporation in lignin of 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> transgenic lines as compared to the wild-type (Tin). This is in line with the biosynthesis pathway shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Amounts of G units in transgenic lines Li09 and Li11 are, however, very similar to the wild-type poplar. On the other hand, Toraman et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported an increase in G-lignin derived products and a decrease in S-lignin derived products during pyrolysis of greenhouse grown 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> downregulated poplar. In this work, field grown poplar downregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic> resulted in a 15% reduction of G-lignin and 33% reduction in S-lignin derived pyrolysis products relative to the wild type.
