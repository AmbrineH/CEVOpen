<p id="p0045" class="p">Principal component analysis (PCA) of the quantified peak areas was performed using MATLAB (R2014b) software. The methodology is similar to the one described by Toraman et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Briefly, PCA analysis provides a statistical analysis of the variation of the selectivity differences between transgenic and control lines, and hence, indicating the effect of genetic modification on the pyrolysis vapours. The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible (PC1), and each succeeding element accounts for the remaining variability (PC2, PC3, etc.). This procedure was repeated until ideally the total variance obtained in the original data set was explained and the resulting PCs formed a new basis [

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[31]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[32]</xref>]. Variations in transgenic and wild-type biomass and their pyrolysis products were studied with the help of score and loading plots, as explained by Toraman et al. [
