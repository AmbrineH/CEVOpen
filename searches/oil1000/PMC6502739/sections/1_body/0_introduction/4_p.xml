<p id="p0015" class="p">Lignin, the primary source of phenolic compounds in pyrolysis oil, is synthesized from monolignols via bond linkages such as β-O-4, β-5, β-β, yielding

 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] lignin structure is argued to be mostly linear due to lack of structural evidence for etherified branching in lignin chains [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The biosynthesis pathway of lignin involves a wide range of enzymatic reactions (as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Lignin composition varies from one plant species to another, even more so in different cell types and cell wall layers [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. CAFFEOYL-CoA O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (CCoAOMT) converts caffeoyl-CoA to feruloyl-CoA, which is a precursor to coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde. The enzyme, CAFFEIC ACID O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (COMT) is responsible for the formation of sinapaldehyde, which is the precursor of sinapyl alcohol. CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (CAD) is involved in the formation of all the three monolignols [

 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Re-directing these pathways by down-regulating one or more of the corresponding genes via genetic modification to yield tailor-made lignin could enable control over the pyrolysis product distribution [
