<p id="p0010" class="p">So far, the focus of the research has been on understanding pyrolysis kinetics and achieving high bio-oil yields through unique catalytic or reactor designs [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Catalytic applications such as hydro-deoxygenation have proven to improve the usability of bio-oils by reducing its oxygen content [

 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>]. Process intensification studies suggest an increase in bio-oil yield by improving heat and mass transfer between biomass and inert gases [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In the recent past, attempts have been made to alter the composition of bio-oil through well-defined feedstocks. The composition of biomass is altered with the help of genetic modification in plant species by down-regulating specific genes encoding the enzymes of phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. As a consequence, the modified feedstock composition could influence the product distribution in fast pyrolysis. In this way the reactions could be selectively directed towards an increased production of high-value chemicals, improving the profitability and industrial relevance of fast pyrolysis of biomass [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, full-fledged analysis of the impact of genetic engineering on biomass fast pyrolysis has yet to be performed.
