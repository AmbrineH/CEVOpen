<p id="p0005" class="p">Biomass fast pyrolysis has gained enormous attention because of its potential to generate large amounts of bio-oil, which is an alternative to liquid fossil fuels. A detailed analysis of bio-oil suggests the presence of a variety of organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, guaiacols, and syringols, which are considered to be speciality chemicals [
