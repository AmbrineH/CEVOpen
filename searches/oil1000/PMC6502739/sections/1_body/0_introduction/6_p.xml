 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> gene suppression, and the effect of pre-treatment on the wood derived from field-grown wild-type and transgenic poplar [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever study on pyrolysis of genetically modified poplars downregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> genes. The primary aim of this study is to understand the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> downregulation on the relative abundance of pyrolysis products. The presence of extractable oligo and monophenols may interfere in the Py-GC-MS studies, and therefore, the samples were also pre-treated to remove extractable phenolic compounds before the pyrolysis experiments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to analyze the extensive multi-dimensional experimental data set, which otherwise would be difficult to interpret. K-means clustering based on the Mahalanobis distance has been applied onto the score plots of PCA to investigate the statistical independence of the pyrolysis products obtained from the genetically modified and wild-type poplars. With the help of PCA and k-means clustering, the effect of the downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">COMT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CAD</italic> on the yields of S and G derived products is understood.
