<p id="p0040" class="p">The transgenic and wild-type poplar samples were pyrolysed in a multi-shot pyrolyser (EGA/PY-3030D, Frontier Laboratories, Japan). The furnace was calibrated to read the centerline temperature of the quartz reactor. A deactivated stainless steel sample cup (Eco-cup SF, Frontier Laboratories, Japan) was loaded with 0.3 to 0.4 mg of fine biomass powder and was dropped into the pre-heated reactor at 500 °C, ensuring rapid pyrolysis. Pyrolysis vapours were directly swept into the injector port (300 °C) of the GC (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) using helium as carrier gas set at a constant flow rate of 100 ml/min with an injector split ratio of 1:100. Pyrolysis products were separated using a Restek RTX-1701 column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) connected to a mass spectrometer (ISQ-MS) with a scan rate set from 25 to 350 a.m.u. The GC oven was held for 3 min at an initial temperature of 40 °C and was subsequently heated to 280 °C at 5 °C/min. The oven was then held at 280 °C for 1 min. After each injection, a blank analysis was carried out to verify potential residual bleeding of the column and leftovers from the previous experiments. Peak integration and alignment were performed in Xcalibur software using a baseline window of 200, area to noise factor of 100 and a peak noise factor value of 10. The products were identified using the NIST library and quantified by normalising the ion current peak areas with the total area of all the compounds. The methodology of the process is pictorially represented in
