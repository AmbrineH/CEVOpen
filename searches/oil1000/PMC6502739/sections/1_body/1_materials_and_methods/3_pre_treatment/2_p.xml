<p id="p0035" class="p">Transgenic samples from block five were pre-treated to remove extractives by incubating them in various solvents, separately [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The solvents were chosen such that the structure of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin remained intact during the pre-treatment [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Depending on the type of solvent, the incubation temperature was set, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. About 12 mg of each biomass sample was incubated in 1 ml of each solvent at 750 rpm. After that, the supernatants were removed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm. Samples were then air dried to evaporate the remaining solvents. The incubation time for all the solvent pre-treatments was 30 min.
