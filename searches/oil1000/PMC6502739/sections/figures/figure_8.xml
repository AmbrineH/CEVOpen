  <p class="p">Comparison of untreated 
   <italic class="italic">CCoAOMT</italic> downregulated lines and Tin wild type. PCA analysis was performed only using the lignin product selectivities (a) Scree plot showing the relative weight percentages of each principal component. (b) Score plot of PC1 vs PC2, with three clusters of Tbr, Li02, and the third with Li03 and Li04 transgenic poplars. The lines are clustered with a significance level of 95%. (c) and (d) Loading plots of PC1 vs PC2 and PC1 vs PC3, indicating the data points that have the highest and lowest contributions to the principal components. (Color codes are as follows: Red, Lignin-H; Cyan, Lignin-S; Blue, Lignin-G; and Yellow, generic Lignin compounds, i.e., L-1 and L-2).
