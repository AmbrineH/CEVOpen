 <p> Comparison of untreated CAD lines and Tin wild type. (a) Scree plot showing the relative weight percentages of each principal component. (b) Score plot of PC1 vs PC2, with three clusters of wild-type, Li22 and the third with Li18 and Li20 transgenic poplars. The lines are clustered with a significance level of 85%. (c) and (d) Loading plots of PC1 vs PC2 and PC1 vs PC3, indicating the data points that have the highest and lowest contributions to the principal components. (Color codes are as follows: Pink, Cellulose; Red, Lignin-H; Cyan, Lignin-S; Blue, Lignin-G; and Yellow, generic Lignin compounds, i.e., L-1 and L-2). </p>
