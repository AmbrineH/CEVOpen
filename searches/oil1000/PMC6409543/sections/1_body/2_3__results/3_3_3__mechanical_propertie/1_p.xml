<p class="p">Since the resultant electrospun films may be subjected to various kinds of stress during use, the determination of the mechanical properties involves not only scientific but also technological and practical aspects. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> displays the values of elastic modulus (E), tensile strength at yield (σ

 <sub class="sub">b</sub>), and toughness (T) of the electrospun films made of PHBV and PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol calculated from their strain–stress curves. In general, all the electrospun films presented characteristics of a brittle material associated to the inherent low ductility of PHBV, showing ε
