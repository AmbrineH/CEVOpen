<p class="p">It can be observed that the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol increased the mechanical strength of the PHBV films while the ductility was slightly reduced. This effect can be related to the reinforcing effect of MCM-41 as a filler in the PHBV matrix, while the smaller impact in ductility may be accounted for the plasticizing effect that the released eugenol may have in the polymer matrix. This mechanical enhancement of E and σ
 <sub class="sub">y</sub> indicates a good transfer of mechanical energy from the hard filler, that is, MCM-41, as well as the interaction between the biopolymer matrix and the silica nanoparticles. Considering both the low concentration of MCM-41 and the presence of eugenol, which acts as plasticizer, the mechanical reinforcement of the filler is thought to dominate the enhancement in E and σ
 <sub class="sub">y</sub>. However, a comparative reduction, change in trend, in mechanical strength was observed when the content of the antimicrobial filler exceeded 10 wt.-%. This effect may be ascribed to a balance between filler agglomeration and stronger plasticizing effect of the released eugenol. High tensile strengths are generally necessary for food packaging films in order to withstand the normal stress encountered during their application, subsequent shipping, and handling [

 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] reported that the addition of 3 wt.-% of mesoporous silica nanoparticles to bovine gelatin films improved their mechanical resistant properties, that is, σ

Others studies have also demonstrated that the incorporation of mesoporous silica nanoparticles can remarkably enhance the mechanical strength in PVOH-based materials due to the intermolecular interactions between the fillers and the polymer when prepared by in situ radical copolymerization [

As compared to commercial biopolymers for packaging applications, the here-developed electrospun films of PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol are slightly less deformable but more elastic than thermo-compressed PHBV films, stiffer but less ductile than rigid polylactide (PLA) films, and mechanically stronger but considerably more brittle than flexible poly(butylene adipate-
