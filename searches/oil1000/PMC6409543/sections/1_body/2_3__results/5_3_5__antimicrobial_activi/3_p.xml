<p class="p">The tested closed system was aimed to better represent the real conditions in a packaging material. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, which is shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>, the film with 10 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol was selected since this sample showed a high R value at a relatively low content of filler. One can observe that the antimicrobial activity was higher than that observed in the open system, showing R values of 1.35 and 1.64 for day 0 and 15, respectively. This confirms the high volatility of eugenol, which remained enclosed and still active in the system in comparison to the open one. In 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>, for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, the R values were 1.34 and 1.58 for day 0 and 15, respectively, in the closed system. Therefore, the here-achieved antimicrobial effect was somehow higher in the closed system than in the open one. This result has been recently ascribed to the volatile portion of active components accumulated in the systemâ€™s headspace, which successfully contributed to decrease bacterial growth [
 <xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. In any case, the differences in bacterial reduction in both tested packaging conditions, that is, the open and closed systems, for each type of bacteria was relatively low. This observation can be related to the use of MCM-41 that successfully performed as vehicles to control the release of eugenol and to render high antimicrobial activity.
