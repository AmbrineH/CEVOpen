<p class="p">Similar to this study, other authors have previously reported the antibacterial activity of eugenol in different biopolymer articles. For instance, PCL/gelatin electrospun membranes loaded with active peptide containing 30 wt.-% of eugenol successfully inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with inhibition rates of 71.6% and 78.6%, respectively [

In this previous research, the added active agents were more effective against G- than G+, which in agreement with the present results. The benefit of loading antimicrobial agents in MCM-41 has been also studied elsewhere, both against bacteria and fungi. For instance, Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] loaded allyl isothiocyanate, a natural antimicrobial, in MCM-41 as a novel controlled release vector against selected foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. In other studies, other volatile EOs were immobilized on the surface of mesoporous silica materials acting as antifungal agents and showing improved antimicrobial activity than the free compounds [
