<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the film samples was evaluated using the JIS Z2801. The reduction values in the open system against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> are gathered in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, respectively. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref> includes the values against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, respectively, in the closed system. As expected, it can be observed that both the unfilled PHBV film and the different PHBV films containing MCM-41 without eugenol showed no inhibition effect on the bacterial growth (R ≤ 1). In contrast, the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol into the PHVB film exhibited significant antibacterial activity against both bacteria. In the open system, at the initial day, that is, for the tests carried out the same day of the film production, the bacterial reduction on the film surface gradually increased with the content of MCM-41 with eugenol. As it can be seen in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, at the lowest contents, that is, 2.5 and 5 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, the films presented a slight antibacterial activity (R ≥ 1 and &lt; 2). For the highest tested contents, that is, 7.5 and 10 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, the films generated a significant surface reduction (R ≥ 1 and &lt; 3). Although none of the films produced a strong reduction (R ≥ 3), materials with values of surface reduction in the 1–2 range are usually considered as bacteriostatic [
 <xref rid="B82-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Therefore, electrospun PHBV films with 10 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol were able to provide a bacteriostatic effect against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. As also shown in the table, after 15 days, the films still kept a significant antibacterial activity. In particular, the films with 7.5 and 10 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol still presented significant values of reduction (R ≥ 1 and &lt; 3) while these presented slight values (R ≥ 0.5 and &lt; 1) for loadings of 2.5 and 5 wt.-%. This suggests that, although part of eugenol was released from the films, MCM-41 was still able to retain over time a significant amount of EO. Regarding 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, the required concentration of MCM-41 with eugenol to generate an antimicrobial effect in the open system was 15 wt.-%. At this content, the films presented a significant value of reduction, that is, R values of 1.30 and 1.40 at days 0 and 15, respectively. This supports the above-described higher antimicrobial resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, as a G- bacterium, which would need more exposure time to the active oil to render a similar antimicrobial activity.
