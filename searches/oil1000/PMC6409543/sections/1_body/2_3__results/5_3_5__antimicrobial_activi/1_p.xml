 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> are common microorganisms associated with food-related diseases. Therefore, the incorporation of active substances in the design of packaging materials can be an important technology not only to avoid food waste but also to enhance food safety [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were 1.25 µL/mL and 2.5 µL/mL, respectively, and for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> these values were 2.5 µL/mL and 5 µL/mL, respectively. The MCM-41 particles with eugenol presented a MIC value against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> of 10 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL, respectively, while the BIC values were 40 µg/mL for both bacteria. The higher value observed for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> can be ascribed to the greater bacterial resistance of G- bacteria than G+ ones [
