<p class="p">The here-prepared electrospun films of PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol showed higher WVP values than PHBV films with 12 mol.-% HV prepared by solvent casting, that is, 1.27 × 10

 <xref rid="B73-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], which can be related to the higher mol.-% HV fraction in the here-used copolyester. Therefore, it can be considered that intermediate contents of MCM-41 with eugenol inside the fibers promoted lower free volume available for diffusion. Similar results were reported for instance by Hashemi Tabatabaei et al. [

 <xref rid="B75-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] reported a reduction of up to approximately 33% in WVP for whey protein isolate (WPI)/pullulan (PUL) films containing 1, 3, and 5 wt.-% mesoporous silica nanoparticles prepared by a casting method. The barrier improvement achieved was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polymer hydroxyl groups and the oxygen atoms of silica and also to the good dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. In relation to eugenol, some studies have also demonstrated that the direct incorporation of EOs, among them eugenol, in polymer films do not induce significant change in WVP, concluding that water permeability basically depends on the hydrophilic–hydrophobic ratio of the film constituents [

 <xref rid="B77-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Other studies have reported that the addition of EOs can negatively increase the water permeability depending on the nature of the polymer matrix and the type and concentration of EO [
 <xref rid="B78-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. However, this impairment may be attributed to the difficulties encountered to integrate the hydrophobic EO in hydrophilic networks that might cause matrix disruptions and create void spaces at the polymer–oil interface [
 <xref rid="B79-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. However, in the current study, the expected plasticizing effect of the hydrophobic eugenol within the PHBV matrix is seen detrimental for the barrier performance at lower silica loadings.
