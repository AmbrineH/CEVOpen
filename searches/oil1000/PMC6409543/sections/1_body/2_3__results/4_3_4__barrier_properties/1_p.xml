 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> gathers the WVP and LP values of the electrospun PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol films. It can be observed that the incorporation of low contents of MCM-41 with eugenol, that is, 2.5 and 5 wt.-%, induced an increase in the WVP values of the electrospun PHBV films while the water vapor barrier properties were improved for contents higher than 7.5 wt.-%. A similar effect was observed in the case of LP. The resultant increase in permeability observed at low filler loadings can be related to the plasticizing effect of eugenol on the PHBV matrix outweighing the barrier effect of the MCM-41 filler, as above discussed during the thermal analysis, with a subsequent increase in the matrix free volume. At higher contents, however, the barrier improvements can be ascribed to the presence of large quantities of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Then, MCM-41 successfully acted as barrier elements forcing the permeant molecules to travel through a longer path to permeate across according to the early theory suggested by Nielsen [

It is also worthy to mention the change in the barrier trend observed for the film samples containing the highest filler contents, that is, 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol. This permeability change in trend can also be ascribed to the above-mentioned higher filler agglomeration resulting in a somewhat increased porosity as observed in the morphological analysis, leading to preferential paths for diffusion.
