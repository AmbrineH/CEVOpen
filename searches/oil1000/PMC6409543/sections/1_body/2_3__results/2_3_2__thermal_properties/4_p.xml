 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> gathers the main relevant thermal parameters obtained from the TGA curves. As one can observe in the graph, the neat MCM-41 particles presented a mass loss of ~5% at a temperature close to 100 °C, which can be ascribed to residual humidity on the surface and/or in the pores of the nanoparticles. In addition, the neat MCM-41 particles provided a residual mass of 95.0 ± 2.3% measured at 800 °C. On the contrary, the eugenol free oil had a relatively low thermal stability, showing full decomposition at approximately 200 °C. Moreover, comparison of the TGA curves of the MCM-41 nanoparticles with and without eugenol corroborated that the eugenol loading was 49.5 ± 1.2%. This loading capacity of MCM-41 was higher than other encapsulation techniques reported for polyphenols [
