 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> displays the main thermal transitions, obtained by DSC during the heating and cooling steps, of the annealed electrospun neat PHBV film and the films containing MCM-41 without and with eugenol. It can be observed that the neat PHBV film presented a glass transition temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub>) of 2.6 ± 0.4, while the addition of MCM-41 without eugenol had a negligible effect on T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub>. Interestingly, after the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol, the T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> values were reduced to 1.8–0.6 °C in the PHBV film samples. Reductions of T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> are habitually associated to a plasticization process by low-molecular weight (M
 <sub class="sub">W</sub>) molecules with high chemical affinity to the polymer matrix by which the free volume of the polymer is enlarged since they increase the distance between the polymer chains and then favor segmental motion [
 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Some previous studies have already reported the plasticizing effect of eugenol on different polymer matrices. For instance, Fernandes Nassar et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] reported a reduction in T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> when eugenol was incorporated into soy protein isolate (SPI) films, ascribing this effect to the plasticizing role that the aroma compound played in the protein matrix. Also, Narayanan et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] observed a reduction in T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> from 4 °C, for the neat PHB film, to −14 °C, for PHB films containing up to 200 μg/g of eugenol.
