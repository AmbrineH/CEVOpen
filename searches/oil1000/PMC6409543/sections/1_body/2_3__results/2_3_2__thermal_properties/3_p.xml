<p class="p">During heating, the neat PHBV film melted in a single peak at 170.4 ± 0.2 °C while all the PHBV films containing MCM-41 without eugenol presented similar T
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> values in the 169–171 °C range. However, the T
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> values progressively reduced in the PHBV films containing MCM-41 with eugenol was as the filler content increased. Up to contents of 15 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, the PHBV films presented a single melting peak in the 163–171 °C range, whereas the film filled with 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol showed two endothermic peaks, starting melting at 160.5 ± 1.5 °C. Therefore, the MCM-41 particles when loaded with eugenol were able to impair and induce some defects in the PHBV crystals, particularly at the highest tested contents. It is also worthy to note that the presence of MCM-41 without eugenol, up to fillings of 15 wt.-%, increased the values of enthalpy of melting (ΔH
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>), confirming the formation of more perfect PHBV crystals with thicker lamellae by a nucleation phenomenon. As opposite, all the PHBV films with MCM-41 with eugenol presented lower values of ΔH
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>, being this reduction significantly noticeable for the films filled with contents above 15 wt.-%. Therefore, the presence of MCM-41 with eugenol impaired the crystallization of PHBV due to the above-described reduction of the biopolymer segments packing. It has been similarly reported that the addition of mesoporous silica nanoparticles has a slight influence on T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> or T
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> in polymer nanocomposites [

 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], therefore supporting that the here-observed suppressed effect on the melt behavior is ascribed to eugenol. In this sense, Garrido-Miranda et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] showed that the T
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> value of PHB/thermoplastic starch (TPS)/organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) nanocomposites was reduced by approximately 4 °C when 3 wt.-% eugenol was incorporated, concluding that eugenol induces the formation of less perfect crystals. Woranuch et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] also observed a ΔH
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> reduction when eugenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were incorporated into thermoplastic flour (TPF) made of cassava, rice, and waxy rice through an extrusion process. The reduction observed was related to a plasticization by eugenol.
