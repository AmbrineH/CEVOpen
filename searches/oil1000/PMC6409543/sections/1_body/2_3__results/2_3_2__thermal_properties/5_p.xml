<p class="p">In relation to the neat PHBV film, a low-intense first weight loss process (&lt;1%) was observed at 100 °C due to absorbed moisture and/or volatiles leaving the samples. Trapped solvent losses were discarded by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and TGA of the neat PHBV fibers (results not shown). One can also observe that the biopolymer presented the onset of degradation, measured at the temperature at which the mass loss was 5% (T
 <sub class="sub">5%</sub>), at 259.9 ± 1.2 °C. The degradation temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">deg</sub>) occurred at 277.3 ± 0.6 °C, degrading in a single step and producing a residual mass of 2.0 ± 0.2% at 800 °C. In addition, the weight loss process corresponding to thermal decomposition reaction of the biopolymer chain occurred sharply, approximately from 225 °C to 275 °C. The thermal degradation onset was shifted to lower temperatures when both the MCM-41 without and with eugenol, in all the composition range, was incorporated. This result suggests that the nanoparticles catalyzed thermal degradation. Interestingly, the T
 <sub class="sub">5%</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">deg</sub> values were slightly improved at the lowest content of MCM-41 with eugenol, which can be related to the above-described nucleating effect and restricted mobility of the biopolymer chains by the presence of MCM-41 and eugenol. However, the thermal stability was reduced at the higher filler contents, that is, 15 wt.-% and 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, due to the high content of both MCM-41 and eugenol. Furthermore, the residual weight at 800 °C of the PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol films increased due to the presence of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles. In any case, the incorporation of up to 10 wt.-% of MCM-41 with eugenol had a relatively low influence on the thermal stability of the PHBV films, which can be considered a positive result since they encapsulate an active component with low thermal stability. In this sense, Requena et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] reported that the incorporation of carvacrol and eugenol enhanced the thermal sensitivity of PHBV, decreasing the onset temperature, whereas the incorporation of whole essential oils (oregano and clove) slightly promoted its thermal stability. The latter effect was suggested to occur due to a strong bonding of the eugenol with the polymer network.
