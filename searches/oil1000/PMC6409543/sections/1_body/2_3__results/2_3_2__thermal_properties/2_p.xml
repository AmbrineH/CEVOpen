<p class="p">Whereas cold crystallization phenomenon was not observed in any of the PHBV films during heating, all the samples crystallized from the melt during cooling. In particular, the neat PHBV film showed a crystallization temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>) of 116.8 ± 0.5 °C. The presence of MCM-41 without eugenol increased the crystallization temperature of PHBV, up to reaching a maximum value of 120.5 °C for the film filled at 15 wt.-%. This result suggests that the nanoparticles provided a nucleating effect on the PHBV molecules, except for the film filled with 20 wt.-% MCM-41, possibly due to nanoparticles agglomeration as previously described during the morphological analysis. On the contrary, one can observe that the T
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> values of the film samples containing MCM-41 with eugenol decreased as the filler content increased. Then, the T
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> value was reduced up to a value of 113.8 ± 0.6 °C for the film filled with 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol. This restrained crystallization of PHBV can be ascribed to the above-described plasticizing effect of eugenol, which impair the packing of the polymer chains to form crystals.
