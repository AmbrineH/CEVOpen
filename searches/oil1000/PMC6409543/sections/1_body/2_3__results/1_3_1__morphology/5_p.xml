Although the contact transparency of the films was similar in all the samples, the films with the highest particle contents, that is, 15 and 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, developed a yellow color. A similar yellowing and, in some cases, browning was previously observed by Muratore et al. [

This effect was ascribed to the intrinsic eugenol color, which is a pale yellow oily liquid, as well as secondary reactions and/or by-products due to thermal oxidation and chain scission of the substrate favored by high temperatures and prolonged time. Therefore, the incorporation of up to 10 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol successfully allows the production of contact transparent films of PHBV.
