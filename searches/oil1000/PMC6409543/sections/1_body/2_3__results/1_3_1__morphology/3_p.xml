<p class="p">TEM was also performed in order to evaluate the distribution of the MCM-41 particles inside the electrospun fibers. The detailed morphologies of the electrospun mats of PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol, at different particle contents, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. One can observe that at low contents, that is, from 2.5 wt.-% to 7.5 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, the functionalized silica nanoparticles were relatively well distributed inside the electrospun fibers. However, for higher filler contents, the MCM-41 particles were mainly agglomerated in certain regions of the fibers. This fact supports the above-described morphology during the SEM analysis by which the silica nanoparticles interconnected the fibers in the electrospun mats. A similar morphology was recently reported, for instance, by Cherpinski et al. [
