 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a,b present the SEM images of the MCM-41 powders with and without eugenol, respectively. One can observe that the silica particles presented a spherical shape with a mean size of around 100 nm, where the incorporation of eugenol slightly reduced their particle size. Therefore, the incorporation of eugenol did not alter the morphology of the mesoporous MCM-41 type nanoparticles. TEM was carried out in order to further ascertain the morphology of the MCM-41 particles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c confirmed the spherical shape of the MCM-41 particle without eugenol, showing that their mean size was 96.1 ± 3.8 nm. A similar morphology can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>d for the MCM-41 powder with eugenol, having a mean diameter of 88.6 ± 2.1 nm. Similar results were reported by Ribes et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] in which the immobilization of eugenol and thymol on the surface of MCM-41 did not affect the integrity of the mesoporous silica particles. Also, Ruiz-Rico et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] observed that the appearance of fumed silica, amorphous silica, and MCM-41 particles did not change after functionalization with thymol. Indeed, MCM-41 has been widely used as a model material in the context of porosity characterization owing to its peculiar features, such as high surface area, large pore volume, low toxicity, high chemical and thermal stability, and versatile chemical modifiable surface. It has been reported that the pore structure is organized in the form of hexagonal arrays of uniform tubular channels of controlled width [

As a result, mesoporous silica nanoparticles are excellent candidates for reference adsorbents for standardizing adsorption measurements and methods for characterization of porous solids due to their regular pore structure, high stability, and also convenient method of synthesis [
