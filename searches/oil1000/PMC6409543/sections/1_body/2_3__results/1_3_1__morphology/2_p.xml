 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the resultant electrospun mats obtained from the neat PHBV solution and the different solutions of PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol. One can observe that, in all cases, the electrospinning process generated a mat composed of non-woven fibers with a similar morphology. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the mean diameters of the electrospun fibers. The neat PHBV fibers without MCM-41, processed in the same conditions, presented a mean diameter of 0.89 ± 0.30 µm. It can be observed that the mean diameters of the electrospun fibers varied in the 0.6–0.7 µm range when the silica particles were incorporated. However, one can observe that the electrospun fibers with the highest particle contents, that is, 15 and 20 wt.-% MCM-41, presented certain cross-linking or fibers coalescence. This can be related to difficulties encountered during the fiber formation more likely due to a phenomenon of particle aggregation in the electrospinning process. Indeed, it is known that high nano-sized filler contents habitually lead to the formation of beaded regions in the electrospun fibers [
