<p class="p">The morphology of the electrospun materials was also analyzed by SEM in order to ascertain the effect of the film-forming process on the PHBV fibers. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00227-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the SEM images at both the cross-section and surface of the electrospun PHBV materials containing different amounts of MCM-41 with eugenol. The surface cryo-fractures of the electrospun materials, shown in the left column, revealed the formation of a continuous film with much reduced porosity. This process has been ascribed to a process of fibers coalescence that occurs during annealing, that is, at a temperature below the polymer’s T

In the case of the electrospun films having the highest particle contents, that is, 15 and 20 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol, the films presented a higher porosity and also certain plastic deformation. This observation can be related to the above-described fiber morphology and, more importantly, to the presence of high loadings of eugenol that could plasticize the PHBV matrix and/or migrate during the annealing process. In the top view of the electrospun films, shown in the right column, one can clearly observe that the film sample containing 20 wt.-% MCM-41 presented higher porosity on its surface. This morphology confirms that contents above 15 wt.-% MCM-41 with eugenol are not optimal to be processed by electrospinning and thermally post-treatment at 160 °C. Similar findings were concluded when electrospun mats of PHBV with ~20 mol.-% HV were post-treated at higher temperatures than optimal, resulting in an increased porosity due to partial polymer melting and/or degradation [
