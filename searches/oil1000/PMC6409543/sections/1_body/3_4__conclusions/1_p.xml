<p class="p">EOs are well known for their antimicrobial properties, being suitable as food preservatives. However, to ensure their long-term effect, which is controlled by their volatility, it may be necessary to encapsulate them in, for instance, porous materials. The present study evaluated the complexation of eugenol EO on MCM-41 to be thereafter incorporated into PHBV biopolymers by electrospinning. The resultant electrospun mats were annealed below the biopolymer melting point to generate continuous films. The thermal analysis performed on the films showed that the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol induced certain plasticization on PHBV as well as a reduction in crystallinity. Interestingly, the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol up to 10 wt.-% had a relatively low influence on the thermal stability of the PHBV films. During the mechanical analysis, it was observed that the mechanical strength of the PHBV films was increased while the ductility was only slightly reduced after the incorporation of MCM-41 with eugenol. The barrier properties were also enhanced due to the presence of the eugenol-containing nanofillers and were optimal around contents of 15 wt.-%. Finally, the antimicrobial activity against

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was studied in both an open and closed system to better represent the real conditions in packaging applications. The electrospun biopolymer films showed antibacterial activity after 15 days, being higher (as expected) in the ones that were studied in the closed system, which was ascribed to the accumulation of eugenol in the systemâ€™s headspace. For all this, the films developed can be regarded as a sustainable material to be used in the form of interlayers or coatings for active food packaging applications.
