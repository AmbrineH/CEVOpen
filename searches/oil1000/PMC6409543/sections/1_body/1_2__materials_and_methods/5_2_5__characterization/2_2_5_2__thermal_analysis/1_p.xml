<p class="p">Thermal transitions were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a DSC-7 analyzer from PerkinElmer, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a cooling accessory Intracooler 2 also from PerkinElmer, Inc. A heating program was applied from −30 °C to 190 °C, followed by a cooling program to −30 °C. The heating and cooling rates were both set at 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow-rate of 20 mL/min. The typical sample weight was ~3 mg while an empty aluminum pan was used as reference. Calibration was performed using an indium sample. All tests were carried out, at least, in duplicate.</p>
