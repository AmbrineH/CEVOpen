<p class="p">The morphologies of the MCM-41 type particles as well as the electrospun PHBV fibers and films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an S-4800 device from Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were fixed to beveled holders using conductive double-sided adhesive tape and sputtered with a mixture of gold-palladium under vacuum prior to observation. An accelerating voltage of 10 kV was used. For the cross-section observations, the films were previously cryo-fractured by immersion in liquid nitrogen. </p>
