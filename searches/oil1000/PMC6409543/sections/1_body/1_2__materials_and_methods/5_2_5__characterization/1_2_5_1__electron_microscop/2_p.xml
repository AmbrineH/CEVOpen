<p class="p">Detailed morphology of the MCM-41 particles and their distribution in the PHBV fibers was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 1010 from JEOL USA, Inc. (Peabody, MA, USA) using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The estimation of the dimensions was performed by means of the Aperture software from Apple (Cupertino, CA, USA) using a minimum of 20 SEM or TEM micrographs in their original magnification.</p>
