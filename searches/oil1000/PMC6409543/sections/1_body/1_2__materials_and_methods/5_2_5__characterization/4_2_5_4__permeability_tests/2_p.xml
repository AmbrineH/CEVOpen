<p class="p">Similar as described above for WVP, limonene permeability (LP) was measured placing 5 mL of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene inside the Payne permeability cups. The cups containing the films were placed at the controlled room conditions of 25 Â°C and 40% RH. The samples were measured in triplicate and the limonene vapor permeation rate (LPRT) values were estimated from the steady-state permeation slopes and the weight loss was compensated by the comparatively marginal loss through the sealing and by the fluctuations in mass of the films due to eugenol evaporation and potential water sorption. LP was calculated taking into account the average film thickness in each case.
