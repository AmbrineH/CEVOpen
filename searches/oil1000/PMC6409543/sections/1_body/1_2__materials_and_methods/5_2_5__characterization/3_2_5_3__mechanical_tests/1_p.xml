<p class="p">Tensile tests of the PHBV films were performed according to ASTM standard method D638 using an Instron 4400 universal testing machine, equipped with a 1-kN load cell, from Instron (Norwood, MA, USA). The tests were performed, at room conditions, with 115 Ã— 16 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> stamped dumb-bell shaped specimens using a cross-head speed of 10 mm/min. Samples were conditioned for 24 h prior to tensile assay. A minimum of six specimens was measured for each sample and the average values with standard deviation (SD) were reported.
