<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC) of eugenol against the selected foodborne bacteria was tested following the plate micro-dilution protocol, as described in the Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial. Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard Tenth. Edition (M07-A10) by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). For this, a 96-well plate with an alpha numeric coordination system (columns 12 and rows A-H) were used, where 10 µL of the tested samples were introduced in the wells with 90 µL of the bacteria medium. In the wells corresponding to A, B, C, E, F, and G columns different concentrations of eugenol, that is, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 µL/mL, were tested, in triplicate, from rows 1 to 10. Columns D and H were used as control of eugenol in TSB without bacteria. Row 11 was taken as positive control, that is, only TSB, and row 12 was used as negative control, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in TSB. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Thereafter, 10 µL of resazurin, a metabolic indicator, was added to each well and incubated again at 37 °C for 2 h. Upon obtaining the resazurin change, the wells were read through color difference. The MIC value was determined as the lowest concentration of eugenol presenting growth inhibition.
