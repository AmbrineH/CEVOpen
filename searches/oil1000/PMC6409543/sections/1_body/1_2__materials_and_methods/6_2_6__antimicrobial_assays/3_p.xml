<p class="p">The antimicrobial performance of the films was evaluated by using a modification of the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z2801 (ISO 22196:2007). A microorganism suspension of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was applied onto the test films of PHBV/MCM-41 with eugenol and also PHBV/MCM-41, as negative control without eugenol, both sizing 2 × 2 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. After incubation for 24 h at 24 °C and at a RH of at least 95%, bacteria were recovered with PBS, 10-fold serially diluted and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in order to quantify the number of viable bacteria by conventional plate count. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated from 1 (initial day), 8, and 15 days. The antibacterial activity was taken as the test surface reduction (R) using the equation 1:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">R = [log(B/A) − log(C/A )] = log(B/C),
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>where A is the mean of bacterial counts of the control sample immediately after inoculation, B is the mean of bacterial counts of the control sample after 24 h, and C is the mean of bacterial counts of the test sample after 24 h. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated with the following assessment: Nonsignificant (R &lt; 0.5), slight (R ≥ 0.5 and &lt;1), significant (R ≥ 1 and &lt;3), and strong (R ≥ 3) [
