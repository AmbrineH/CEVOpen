<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of the neat eugenol, the eugenol-containing MCM-41 particles, and the electrospun films with MCM-41 with eugenol was evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> CECT240 (ATCC 6538P) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> CECT434 (ATCC 25922). These strains were obtained from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT, Valencia, Spain) and stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 wt.-% tryptic soy broth (TSB, Conda Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) and 10 wt.-% glycerol at −80 °C. Previous to each study, a loopful of each bacteria was transferred to 10 mL of TSB and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A 100-µL aliquot from the culture was again transferred to TSB and grown at 37 °C to the mid-exponential phase of growth. An approximate count of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of a culture resulted in an absorbance value of 0.20, as determined by optical density at 600 nm (UV 4000 spectrophotometer, Dinko Instruments, Barcelona, Spain).
