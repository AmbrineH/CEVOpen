<p class="p">The MCM-41 type mesoporous particles were synthesized using the following procedure [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]: 2 g of CTAB, 5.48 mmol, was first dissolved in 960 mL of deionized water. Then, 7.00 mL of NaOH, 2 M, was added to the CTAB solution, followed by adjusting the solution temperature to 95 °C. Later, 10 mL of TEOS, 5.14·10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> mol, was added dropwise to the surfactant solution. The mixture was allowed to stir for 3 h to produce a white precipitate. The solid product was centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and, thereafter, dried at 60 °C to obtain solid MCM particles. Lastly, to prepare the final porous material, i.e., the MCM-41 type particles, the as-synthetized MCM particles were calcined at 550 °C using air atmosphere for 5 h so that their template phase was removed.
