<p class="p">Silica loading with eugenol was achieved via vapor adsorption by mixing 100 mg of eugenol with 100 mg of the MCM-41 type particles in a tightly closed vial [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The mixture was incubated in an oven at 40 Â°C for 24 h while being continuously shaken. The amount of eugenol loaded in the MCM-41 type support was determined by monitoring the sample weight increase before and after the loading process. Approximately 500 mg/g of the final weight corresponded to eugenol.
