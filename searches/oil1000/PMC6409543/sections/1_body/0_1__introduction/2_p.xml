<p class="p">Among PHAs, the most widely studied and easiest-to-produce member of this family is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This isotactic homopolyester presents a relatively high melting temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>) and good stiffness due to its high crystallinity (&gt;50%). However, the use of PHB has been limited due to several drawbacks, particularly its poor impact-strength resistance and low thermal stability. To overcome these shortcomings, the use of its copolymers, such as those made with 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) or 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) to produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-

 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB-
 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-4HB)), can improve these limitations and widen its processing window [

For instance, PHBVs have been applied in the form of films, fibers, and foams for everyday articles such as shampoo bottles and plastic beverage bottles due to its renewability, biodegradability, and high water vapor barrier [

In addition, the incorporation of antimicrobial and/or antioxidant substances into a PHA-based packaging material can result in high interest to improve both protection and shelf life of foodstuffs during the storage period [
