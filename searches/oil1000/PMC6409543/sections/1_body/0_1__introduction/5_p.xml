<p class="p">In this study, it is initially reported the preparation of nanometric MCM-41 particles loaded with eugenol, a phenylpropene and an allyl chain-substituted guaiacol that is primarily extracted from cinnamon, bay leaf, nutmeg, basil, and clove [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The resultant MCM-41 particles containing eugenol were thereafter incorporated, for the first time, into PHBV by electrospinning. The generated electrospun composite fibers were thermally post-treated to produce films that were characterized in terms of their morphology, thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties. Finally, the antimicrobial performance against foodborne bacteria was also determined. In a packaging context, the active tests were carried out as a function of time in open vs. close conditions in order to simulate potential real conditions.
