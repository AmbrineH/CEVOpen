<p class="p">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) currently represent one of the most important alternative to petroleum-based materials in the frame of the Circular Economy [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. PHAs, which are synthesized by a wide range of microorganisms as carbon storage material, are thermoplastic materials, biodegradable, and present similar physical properties to other plastics, e.g., polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), such as high mechanical strength and water resistance [
 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. PHAs have been prompted as potential packaging applications due to their biocompatibility and physical properties [
 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, the PHA production currently associates a high cost due to the carbon sources of the raw materials, i.e., low yield and productivity, and the down-stream process [
 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The synthesis of PHA through fermentation from industrial by-products and waste, particularly the use of mixed microbial cultures, is nowadays seen as an option to reduce the production costs [
