<p class="p">Natural antimicrobials, such as essential oils (EOs), are currently regarded as an alternative to synthetic preservatives of food because they are considered as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substances, being acceptable to consumers [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and having the capacity to exert a multitude of biological effects [
 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. For instance, eugenol, which has potential antimicrobial and antioxidant actions, has been effectively applied against foodborne pathogens [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, EOs are frequently unstable and can be easily degraded in stressful situations such as in the presence of oxygen, temperature and light, so that they can lose their antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. To avoid this issue, encapsulation is considered a good way to protect and preserve the effectiveness of active and bioactive substances [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In this sense, silica mesoporous supports (SMPSs) [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] show a great deal of potential for the storage and release of active substances [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In particular, the typical sizes of SMPSs range from microns to nanometers, presenting tailor-made pores of around 2–10 nm [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The particular morphology of SMPSs renders a very large specific surface area, up to 1200 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g and, then, an enhanced loading capacity for the encapsulation and release of natural antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Within SMPSs, Mobil Composition of Matter (MCM), including both MCM-41 and MCM-48, are among of the most popular mesoporous molecular sieves in which their pore diameter can be nicely controlled by adjusting their synthesis conditions and/or by employing surfactants with different chain lengths in their preparation [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Silica mesoporous materials are thus able to encapsulate organic molecules, forming host–guest complexes with volatile molecules (e.g., EOs) to efficiently control their volatility and reactivity. So far, many studies have employed MCM to encapsulate active substances with positive results in different applications, for instance, caprylic acid against foodborne pathogens [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], EOs as antifungal [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and antimicrobial systems [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], and poplar-type propolis in drug delivery platforms [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In particular, the antimicrobial and antifungal effect of the EOs-functionalized supports improved compared to the free compounds due to the EOs encapsulated inside MCM released in a controlled manner [
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-00227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. These previous results suggest that the immobilization of EOs onto silica supports can represent a novel strategy to develop a new generation of long-term antimicrobial systems that may not only enhance the antimicrobial activity of EOs, but also mask their characteristic odor/taste for food-related applications.
