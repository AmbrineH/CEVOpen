<p class="p">To our knowledge this work is the first investigation related to the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic>, and confirms the importance of chemical, biological and cytotoxicity assessments of EOs. The results demonstrate the wide spectrum of antiparasitic activities, in particular against 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>, with a potential margin of safety based on the high SI obtained from comparison with mammalian cells. Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the potential use of this EO and its main compounds as antitrypanosomal agents.
