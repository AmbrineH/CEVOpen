Suspensions of infected human red blood cells (1% parasitemia, 2% hematocrit) were added to each well with the same test concentrations of EO. The plate was incubated for 72 h under the same conditions, and then the plate was frozen at −20 °C. Parasite multiplication was measured after mixing 20 μL of the hemolyzed parasite suspension with 100 µL of Malstat (Flow Incorporated, USA) reagent in a new plate, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After that, 20 μL of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 2 mg/mL/phenazine ethosulfate (PES; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 0.1 mg/mL solution was added. The plate was incubated again for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and the absorbance was read at 655 nm in a Biorad 3550-UV microplate reader. Chloroquine, donated by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases from the World Health Organization (WHO-TDR), was also included as a reference drug.
