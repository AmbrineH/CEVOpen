<p class="p">Antileishmanial activities against the intracellular amastigote form of 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> were performed. For 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic>, 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> PMM were infected with amastigotes obtained from an infected hamster at a density of 15 parasites per cell, and the plate was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Pre-diluted concentrations of EO were added and the plates were then incubated under the same conditions over a 120-h period. In the experiment with 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic>, PMM were plated at 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>/mL in a 24-well Lab-Tek (Costar, USA) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were removed and stationary-phase promastigotes were added at a 4:1 parasite/macrophage ratio for 4 h. Cells were washed to remove free parasites, EO was added, four serial dilutions were carried out to test from 12.5 to 100 µg/mL and the plates were further incubated at same conditions for 48 h [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In both cases, after the incubation period with the products, the supernatant was discarded and cells were fixed with methanol, stained with 10% Giemsa and microscopically examined (Motic, Japan) under immersion oil. The total parasite burden was determined according to the number of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes inside the macrophages. Miltefosine (donated by WHO-TDR) and amphotericin B (Imefa, La Habana, Cuba) were used as reference drugs, respectively.
