 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/well was added with different EO concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 64 µg/mL. After 17 h of incubation at 37 °C, bacterial or fungal viability was determined fluorimetrically by the addition of resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C to bacteria cultures, or 4 h at 37 °C to fungi [

Finally, fluorescence was measured using a Tecan GENios Multifunction Fluorimeter (Tecan Group, Maennedorf, Switzerland) at 530 nm excitation and emission of 590 nm. At the same time, reference drugs were tested, including chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) for
