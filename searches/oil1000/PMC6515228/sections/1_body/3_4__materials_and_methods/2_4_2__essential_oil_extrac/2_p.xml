<p class="p">Chemical characterization of the EO was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometric detector (GC–MS) using Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) equipment, which was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), with a scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s and GC-MS solution software. The GC column was a ZB-5-fused silica capillary column with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 552 kPa and a flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed for a 50 °C initial temperature, with temperature increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 5%
