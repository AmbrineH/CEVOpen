<p class="p">In each case, percentage growth inhibition for each concentration of EO was calculated compared to the untreated controls. The median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) for antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal assay were determined, while median cytotoxic concentrations (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) were obtained in the cytotoxicity experiment. In each case, the values were calculated from lineal dose-response curves, and results are expressed as the means of three experiments. To compare the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values between EO and reference drugs, statistical differences were determined using Mann-Whitney with Statistica for Windows program (Release 4.5, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA, 1993), considering statistical differences as 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Finally, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated for each evaluated product, which was determined by CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>.
