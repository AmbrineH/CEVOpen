After 2 h, the medium was removed and 98 µL of fresh medium with 10% FCSi and antibiotics were added, with an additional 48 µL in the first wells and 2 µL of pre-diluted EO, ranging from 12.5 to 200 µg/mL. The plate was incubated at same conditions for 48 h, and viability was measured with 15 μL of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; SIGMA, St. Louis, MO, USA) solutions. After 4 h, formazan crystals were dissolved with 100 μL of DMSO and the optical density was measured at 560 nm and at 630 nm as a reference wavelength using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, California, USA).
