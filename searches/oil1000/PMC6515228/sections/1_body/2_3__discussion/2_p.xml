<p class="p">Cabrera et al. reported that the yield of EO from fresh aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic> range between 0.06% and 0.41% under different conditions of treatment of the plant material (fresh plant material, drying in the shade and drying in a stove) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Thus, in the present investigation, the yield fell into the referred range. Although the oil yield was not high, it played an important role in the biological activities presented by the plant, justifying in some way its traditional dermatological and digestive uses.
