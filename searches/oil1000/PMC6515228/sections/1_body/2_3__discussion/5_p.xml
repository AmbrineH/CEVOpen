<p class="p">There have been several studies reported in the literature, supporting the suggestion that certain EOs from various plant species can demonstrate antiparasitic activity [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. As has been demonstrated in the present study, the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic> inhibited the growth of all tested parasites, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranging from 2 to 57 Âµg/mL. In comparison with reference drugs, the studied EO showed higher IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values with statistical differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), except in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>, which displayed higher sensitivity (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) to the EO than to benznidazole. Other Cuban EOs, have also demonstrated a wide spectrum of antiprotozoal activity, including 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, as biological properties of the main identified compounds in the studied EO are still scarce, further studies of pure compounds, other components and/or synergistic effects remain to be analyzed to explain the observed activities.
