<p class="p">Innovative approaches for effective proof-of-concept research and the development of new types of plant-derived products effective against recently emerging problems related to human microbial diseases are needed. In this regard, research on antimicrobial agents from natural sources has grown in importance in order to discover novel, effective and less expensive drugs, and to combat microbial resistance. Consequently, in our continuing search for valuable and promising natural products from Cuban medicinal plants against infectious diseases, this study was carried out to analyze the chemical composition of the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic>, and was extended to investigate the antimicrobial activity of this product against a wide panel of microorganisms.
