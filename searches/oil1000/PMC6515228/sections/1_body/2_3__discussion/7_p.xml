 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi,</italic> the causal agent of Chagas disease, is a complex zoonosis transmitted by more than 100 species of triatomine insects (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) and sustained by more than 70 genera of mammalian hosts, including humans [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Infection is endemic from Northern Mexico to Argentina, and is considered the parasitic infection with the greatest socioeconomic burden in Latin America, although human migrations have earned it global importance [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Clinical development of the disease has two successive phases: acute phase (typically asymptomatic or with variable symptoms that may last four to eight weeks) and chronic phase (presented in the majority of patients as chronic infection, which can develop irreversible lesions of the heart, esophagus or colon, ultimately leading to death of the patient) [

 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> has not been eradicated, and the development of an effective human vaccine against Chagas disease has been slow [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01615" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Currently, the only two anti-trypanosomal drugs available for Chagas disease—benznidazole and nifurtimox—are far from ideal. Both require prolonged treatment, display a wide range of side effects and, although being effective in the acute phase, have a limited efficacy in the chronic stage [
