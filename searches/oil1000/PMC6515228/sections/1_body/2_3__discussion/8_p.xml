<p class="p">Against the other tested protozoal parasites, higher IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were obtained (7.5–56.6 µg/mL). However, in this case it should be taken into account that EOs are mixtures of different components, and the main antiprotozoal principle could be in a lower concentration. As a consequence for these parasites, lower SI values (≤ 4) were also observed, which limit the potential application of the studied EO by a systemic administration route, although the application by a topical route could be feasible as well as the use of carriers such as nanoparticles [
