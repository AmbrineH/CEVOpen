  <title class="title">Background:</title>
  <p class="p">Recently, there has been an increasing growth in research on medical plant's effect on dental plaque bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial effects of 
   <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic> extract and its essential oil (EO) on 
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus sanguis</italic>, and 
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> as important bacteria in early supragingival dental plaque formation.

  <title class="title">Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">In this 
   <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study, different concentrations of 
   <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> extract and its EO were prepared using double dilution method. The disc diffusion method was used to determine antibacterial activity. Based on these measurements, the minimal inhibitory concentration value was reported for each bacterium. Antibiotics used as positive controls in this study were erythromycin (15 μg) and tetracycline (30 μg). 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">Aqueous and methanolic extract did not show significant antibacterial activity, but the EO significantly inhibited the growth of the test bacteria compared to positive control (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). High concentrations of EO processed greater antimicrobial effects against three oral bacteria than other low concentrations (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). For 
   <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, the inhibition effect of tetracycline 30 μg was similar with 50% (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.789) and 25% (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.158) dosages of the EO. For 
   <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic>, the effect of tetracycline 30 μg was similar to 50% dosages of the EO (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.122). For 
   <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic>, the effect of erythromycin 15 μg was lower than 50% (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0006) and 25% (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.003) dosages of the EO. The inhibition effects of all concentrations of EO were higher for 
   <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic> are more sensitive than 
   <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> to 
   <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> EO.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">Due to the strong antibacterial effect of 
   <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> EO on the oral bacteria growth, it can be served as herbal mouth rinse, while to confirm this antibacterial effect, further clinical studies are necessary.
