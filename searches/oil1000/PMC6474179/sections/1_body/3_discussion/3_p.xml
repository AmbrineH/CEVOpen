<p class="p">Herbal medicines have been used in different fields of traditional medicine. Currently, their efficacy has been shown with the use of new techniques for the analysis and identification of their chemical structure with scientific evidence.[
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] EOs are usually the product of a combination of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids.[
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] Several studies on different aspects of EOs have demonstrated their different properties, including antineoplastic (with necrosis and apoptosis of cancerous cells),[

 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] antimutagenic (through inhibition of synthesis of P450),[
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] antifungal and antioxidative (due to the presence of thymol and carvacrol),[

 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] antiviral (through inhibition of viral proliferation), and anti-inflammatory (by inhibition of the release of free radicals) properties.[
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] These products are lipophilic and therefore have the capacity to penetrate through the cell wall and cellular membranes. These compounds increase the permeability after they affect polysaccharides, phospholipids, and fatty acids of the cell membrane. In addition, they can affect the proton-pump mechanism and deactivate cellular enzymes after denaturing the plasma proteins to cause cellular death.[
