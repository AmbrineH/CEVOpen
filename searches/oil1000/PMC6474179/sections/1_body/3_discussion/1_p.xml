<p class="p">The results of the present study showed that the aqueous extract tested had no antibacterial effects on the three microorganisms evaluated; however, EO had strong antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic>. In the present 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study, to evaluate the effect of the extract and EO of 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic> on the three dominant microorganisms in the oral cavity, the MIC technique was used. In the majority of cases, MIC, minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, MIC50, and lethal dose 50 (minimum lethal concentration) are used to evaluate the efficacy and effect of herbal components and for comparison of the required concentration to exhibit the growth of microorganisms.[
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] The results of MIC test in the present study showed the antibacterial effects of 3.125% concentration on 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 1.56% concentration on 
 <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic>.
