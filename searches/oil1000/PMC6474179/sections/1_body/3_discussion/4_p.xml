<p class="p">The chemical structure and EO content of different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja L</italic>. are different. Evaluation of EO in 
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis L</italic>. has shown a high content of phenolic components, including carvacrol and γ-terpinene.[
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] The concentrations of these compounds in descending order are as follows: carvacrol, cymene, α-pinene, terpineol, thymol, β-pinene, linalool, and borneol.[
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] It should be pointed out, apart from the genus of the plant, the conditions affecting its growth, climate and geographical location, seasonal and temperature changes, and even conditions after its harvest affect the chemical composition of EOs.[
