<p class="p">Carvacrol is the chief ingredient of EO of this plant and an increase in the concentration of carvacrol and thymol results in an increase in its antibacterial activity; however, it should be pointed out that the antibacterial activity does not increase with only an increase in concentrations of these two compounds and the presence of other ingredients at proper concentrations will improve the performance of other ingredients with their synergistic effects.[

 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] The most important mechanism of action of the EO of the plant under study is its ability to penetrate into the bacterial cell and its effect on the vital organelles of the microorganism after disrupting the permeability of the cell wall and cell membrane through its effect on the lipids of the cell membrane.[
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] In addition, the ability of EOs to penetrate into microbial biofilms that are resistant to the penetration and effect of antibiotics[
