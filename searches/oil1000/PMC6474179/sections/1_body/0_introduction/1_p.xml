<p class="p">Dental caries and periodontal diseases are two of the most important infectious diseases in the community at present.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] Accumulation of microbial plaque on tooth surfaces is one of the first stages of caries process and periodontal diseases.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] The microbial plaque consists of a wide spectrum of bacteria with complex interactions. The dominant microbial composition of the dental plaque, which is often affected by the oral environment, can determine the potential for damage.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] The basic stage in plaque formation is the ability of adherence for microorganism to dental and tissue surfaces. In early dental plaque formation, primarily Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">cocci</italic> can attach to dental surfaces.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] Recently, molecular methods such as proteomics and 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrate the predominant species of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus sanguis</italic>, and Streptococcus mitis in the supragingival plaque.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] Over time, Gram-negative bacteria are added to the plaque and complicate the plaque environment and so increase the potential for damage.[
