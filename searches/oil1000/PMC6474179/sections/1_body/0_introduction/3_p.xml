<p class="p">In 2002, emphasis was put on the use of mouth rinses by the International Association for Dental Research as an adjunct to control plaque.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] In this context, various mouth rinses were introduced to help control plaque. Of all these, chlorhexidine (CHX) is used as the most important antiplaque mouth rinse.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] A systematic study has shown that CHX at concentrations of 0.06% to 0.2% is effective in decreasing bacterial plaque. In this respect, its overall dose is important for its efficacy.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] Studies have shown that the optimal dose of CHX is 20 mg twice daily.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] There is a direct relationship between the concentration of CHX and the incidence of complications at doses &gt;0.1%.[

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] Due to their side effects, including a change in taste and formation of stains on the teeth, and also the presence of chemical agents such as alcohol, preservatives, and synthetic pigments, many patients are not interested in the long-term use of chemical mouth rinses.[
