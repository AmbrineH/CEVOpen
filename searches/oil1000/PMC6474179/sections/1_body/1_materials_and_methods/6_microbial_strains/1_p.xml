<p class="p">The extracts and the EO were tested against three oral bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> PTCC1683, 
 <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic> PTCC1448, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sanguis</italic> PTCC1449). These bacteria were provided by the Iranian Type Culture Collection and then the lyophilized strains were inoculated on blood agar and then incubated for 18 h at 37°C. The precultures of bacteria were prepared for the susceptibility tests. For this purpose, the bacteria strains were taken by sterile inoculating loop touching to 4–5 colonies raised from pure microorganism culture, and these strains were inoculated in physiologic serum at the concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml (in order to achieve the McFarland no: 0.5 density) and then incubated at 37°C.
