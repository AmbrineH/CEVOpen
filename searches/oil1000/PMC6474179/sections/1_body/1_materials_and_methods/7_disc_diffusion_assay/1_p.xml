<p class="p">Extracts and EO were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the different test concentrations (for extract test, concentrations were 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, and 0.15625 mg/ml, and for EO test, concentrations were 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.125%, and 1.5625%). Antimicrobial tests were carried out by the disc diffusion method. The discs (6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 30 μl of the extracts and oil dilution and placed on the inoculated blood agar. Negative controls were prepared using the same solvents to dissolve the extracts and EO (DMSO). Tetracycline (30 μg) and erythromycin (15 μg) were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of a strain of each tested microbial species. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test microorganisms. The least concentration of each extract and EO showing a clear zone of inhibition were taken as the MIC. The assays were performed three times for each bacterium.</p>
