 <p> mRNA expression of IL-1β ( A), IL-10 ( B) and TNF-α ( C) in the colons of mice. mRNA of the colon was obtained from sham mice and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or an 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 42 days. mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. The ordinate axis indicates the relative amount of mRNA compared with that in sham mice. Gene expression was expressed as the fold-change relative to sham mice and normalised with 36B4. Values are the mean ± SEM ( n = 8). mRNA expression in the colon was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment groups were assessed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. a, b Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different and ns: not-significant. </p>
