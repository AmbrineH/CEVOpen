 <p> Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur was obtained from sham and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 42 days. BMD of the ( A) whole femur ( B) proximal femur, ( C) middle femur and ( D) distal femur were analysed by DXA. BMD of the ( E) Cortical and ( F) trabecular bone, and ( G) bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) on distal femur were analysed by uCT. Values are the mean Â± SEM ( n = 8). Significant differences in BMDs were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and the Bonferroni significant difference test. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. Body weight was used as a covariate in the analysis of BMDs to adjust for a possible confounding effect. a, b, c Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different. </p>
