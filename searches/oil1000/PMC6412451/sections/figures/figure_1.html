 <p> ( A) Composition of caecal faecal microbiota in mice. Sham: sham-operated group; OVX: ovariectomised group; OVX + HAS: OVX + high-amylose corn starch diet group; OVX + AH-HAS: OVX + acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch diet group. Values are the mean (sham and OVX groups: n = 6, OVX + HAS and OVX + AH-HAS groups: n =8), with their standard errors represented by vertical bars. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. The influences of HAS or AH-HAS treatments upon composition of the faecal intestinal microbiota were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test if the data had a normal distribution. If the data did not have a normal distribution and their variances were not equivalent, a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was carried out to determine significant differences between groups. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. a, b Significant differences in the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Clostridium cluster IV spp., Clostridium cluster XI spp. among the groups. ( B) Cluster analysis of intestinal microbiota based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses. T-RFLP was compared using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The Dice Similarity Matrix was used to construct a dendrogram of the T-RFLP fingerprint profiles. </p>
