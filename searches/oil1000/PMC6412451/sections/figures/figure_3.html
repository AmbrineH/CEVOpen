 <p> mRNA expression of bone-marrow cells collected from the tibia was measured from sham and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 14 ( A–C) or 42 ( D– F) days. Expression of IL-7 ( A, D), IL-7R ( B, E) and RANKL ( C, F) were determined by qRT-PCR. The ordinate axis indicates the relative amount of mRNA compared with that in sham mice. Gene expression was expressed as the fold-change relative to that of sham mice and normalised to β-actin expression. Values are the mean ± SEM ( n = 8). mRNA expression of bone-marrow cells collected from the tibia was measured using one-way analysis of variance. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. a, b, c Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different and ns: not-significant. </p>
