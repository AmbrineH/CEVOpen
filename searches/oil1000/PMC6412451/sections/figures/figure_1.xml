  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Composition of caecal faecal microbiota in mice. Sham: sham-operated group; OVX: ovariectomised group; OVX + HAS: OVX + high-amylose corn starch diet group; OVX + AH-HAS: OVX + acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch diet group. Values are the mean (sham and OVX groups: 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6, OVX + HAS and OVX + AH-HAS groups: 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> =8), with their standard errors represented by vertical bars. Differences were considered significant if 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The influences of HAS or AH-HAS treatments upon composition of the faecal intestinal microbiota were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey’s 
   <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test if the data had a normal distribution. If the data did not have a normal distribution and their variances were not equivalent, a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was carried out to determine significant differences between groups. Differences were considered significant if 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. 
   <sup class="sup">a, b</sup> Significant differences in the abundance of 
   <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp.,

   <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> spp., 
   <italic class="italic">Clostridium cluster IV</italic> spp., 
   <italic class="italic">Clostridium cluster XI</italic> spp. among the groups. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Cluster analysis of intestinal microbiota based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses. T-RFLP was compared using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The Dice Similarity Matrix was used to construct a dendrogram of the T-RFLP fingerprint profiles.
