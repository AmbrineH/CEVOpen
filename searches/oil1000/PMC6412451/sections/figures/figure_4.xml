  <p class="p">Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur was obtained from sham and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 42 days. BMD of the (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) whole femur (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) proximal femur, (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) middle femur and (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) distal femur were analysed by DXA. BMD of the (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Cortical and (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) trabecular bone, and (
   <bold class="bold">G</bold>) bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) on distal femur were analysed by uCT. Values are the mean Â± SEM (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8). Significant differences in BMDs were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and the Bonferroni significant difference test. Differences were considered significant if 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Body weight was used as a covariate in the analysis of BMDs to adjust for a possible confounding effect. 
   <sup class="sup">a, b, c</sup> Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different.
