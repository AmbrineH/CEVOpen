  <p class="p">mRNA expression of bone-marrow cells collected from the tibia was measured from sham and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 14 (
   <bold class="bold">A–C</bold>) or 42 (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) days. Expression of IL-7 (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>), IL-7R (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) and RANKL (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) were determined by qRT-PCR. The ordinate axis indicates the relative amount of mRNA compared with that in sham mice. Gene expression was expressed as the fold-change relative to that of sham mice and normalised to β-actin expression. Values are the mean ± SEM (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8). mRNA expression of bone-marrow cells collected from the tibia was measured using one-way analysis of variance. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by Tukey’s 
   <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test. Differences were considered significant if 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. 
   <sup class="sup">a, b, c</sup> Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different and ns: not-significant.
