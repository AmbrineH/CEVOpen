  <p class="p">mRNA expression of IL-1β (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>), IL-10 (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) and TNF-α (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) in the colons of mice. mRNA of the colon was obtained from sham mice and OVX mice fed a control diet, 20% high-amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), or an 20% acid-hydrolysed high-amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS) for 42 days. mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. The ordinate axis indicates the relative amount of mRNA compared with that in sham mice. Gene expression was expressed as the fold-change relative to sham mice and normalised with 36B4. Values are the mean ± SEM (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8). mRNA expression in the colon was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment groups were assessed by Tukey’s 
   <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test. Differences were considered significant if 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. 
   <sup class="sup">a, b</sup> Mean values with unlike letters are significantly different and ns: not-significant.
