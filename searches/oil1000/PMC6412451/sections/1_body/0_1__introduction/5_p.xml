<p class="p">Resistant starches (RSs) are a subgroup of dietary fibre that includes all starch and starch-degradation products that are not absorbed and digested in the small intestine of healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Though resistant to digestion in the small intestine, RSs can be used as substrates by bacterial species that reside in the colon, and these fermentations lead to an increase in levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Several studies have characterised the capacity of RSs to induce alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, including increases in 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that SCFAs generated from prebiotics regulate the number and function of regulatory T cells in the colon, thereby controlling inflammation [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination of 9% RS and isoflavones inhibited oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomised (OVX) mice, and that this combination has probiotic effects that increase the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in the intestinal microbiota of mice [
