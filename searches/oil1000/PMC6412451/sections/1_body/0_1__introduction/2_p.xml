 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This phenomenon has been suggested to be due to loss of the immunosuppressive effects of oestrogen (which results in increased production of the cytokines that promote osteoclastogenesis) and the direct effects of oestrogen on osteoclasts [

Osteoclastic bone resorption is driven by proinflammatory cytokines such as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± produced by immune cells (e.g., activated T cells and B cells) [
