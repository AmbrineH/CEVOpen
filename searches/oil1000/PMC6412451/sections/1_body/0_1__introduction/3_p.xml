<p class="p">In addition, increased permeability allows an expanded range of molecules and potential antigenic load to enter epithelial submucosa, which may initiate abnormal intestinal and systemic proinflammatory responses [

This process is critical in the context of bone homeostasis because osteoclastogenic cytokines are also produced by immune cells present in intestinal subepithelial compartments of the intestine, and any change in intestinal permeability is likely to increase levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines and affect bone density. Li et al., reported that a deficiency of sex steroids increases gut permeability, expands the number of T-helper-17 cells, and upregulates expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokines TNF-Î±, RANKL, and interleukin (IL)-17 in the small intestine and bone marrow [
