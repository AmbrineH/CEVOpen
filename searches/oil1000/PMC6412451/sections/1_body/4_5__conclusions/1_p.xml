<p class="p">The present study demonstrated that OVX mice fed an AH-HAS-containing diet accelerated fermentation in the caecum, and increased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in faeces. The AH-HAS diet tended to upregulate mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the colon, and downregulate expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL and IL-7R genes in the bone marrow of OVX mice. AH-HAS treatment attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss.
