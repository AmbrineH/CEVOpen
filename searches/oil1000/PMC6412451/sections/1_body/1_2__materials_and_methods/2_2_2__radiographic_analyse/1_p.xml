<p class="p">BMD of the femur was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry with a specialized software program for small animals (DCS-600EX-RIII, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Before measurement of the femur, calibration was performed using a phantom; all femoral bones were then scanned together. BMD was calculated using the bone mineral content of the measured area. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 1.0% and 4.8%, respectively. The detection limit of BMD was 15 mg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The scanned area of the mouse femur was divided into three equal parts: proximal, midshaft, and distal.
