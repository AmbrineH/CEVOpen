<p class="p">Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised from 1 μg of total RNA using PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). cDNA was quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR™ Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa Bio). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The primer sequences are shown in
