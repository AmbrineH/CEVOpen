<p class="p">Amplification of faecal 16S rDNA, digestion using restriction enzymes, size fractionation of terminal restriction fragments, and analyses of T-RFLP data were done according to the method used by Nagashima et al., with modifications [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Briefly, PCR was carried out using total faecal DNA with primers for 5′-carboxy-fluorescein-labelled 516f and 1510r. The resulting 16S rDNA amplicons were treated for 3 h at 55 °C with 10 U of Bs/I (5′-CCNNNNN|NNGG-3′) (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). The fluorescently labelled terminal restriction fragments produced by digestion with Bs/I were analysed by electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) in GeneScan mode (injection time was 30 s, and run time was 40 min).
