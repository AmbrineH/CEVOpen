<p class="p">Caecal content was collected, and caecal tissue washed with physiological (0.9%) saline and wiped. The weight of caecal content was calculated by subtracting the tissue weight from the total weight. The pH of caecal content was measured with a pH meter (B-212 Twin Compact; Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). Beta-glucosidase activity was measured by determining the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenol generated from 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenyl β-pyranoside. The reaction mixture contained 40 µL of substrate solution (50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 with 1 mM 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenyl β-pyranoside) and 10 µL of sample solution at a 1:9 (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) dilution of the caecal sample in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. This reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenol concentration was measured at 405 nm by spectrophotometry after the addition of 200 µL of 0.1 M NaOH. Enzyme activity was expressed as moles of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenol per total caecal content in 60 min.
