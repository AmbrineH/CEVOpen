<p class="p">Mice (all groups, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8 each) were fasted overnight immediately before anatomical investigations. After 42 days of treatment, mice were euthanised by exsanguination under anaesthesia. The uterus was removed and its wet weight recorded. The caecum was removed with its contents, weighed, placed immediately on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until assay. The left femur was removed, submerged in 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C until measurement of BMD. The right tibia was removed to extract total RNA from bone-marrow cells. A segment of the large intestine was collected from each mouse and its contents removed. Then, the tissue was washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline, submerged completely in RNAlater
