<p class="p">Female mice (ddY strain, 8 weeks) were purchased from Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan). Mice were housed in individual cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 °C ± 1 °C and relative humidity of 60 ± 5%) with a 12-h light–dark cycle. Mice were given free access to an AIN-93G diet for 4 days before surgery was undertaken [

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8) or underwent ovariectomy (OVX) on the same day. OVX mice were divided randomly into three groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8 each): OVX control (OVX), OVX fed a 20% high amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), and OVX fed a 20% acid-hydrolysed high amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS). Mice were pair-fed their respective diets for 42 days with free access to distilled water during this period. AH-HAS contains higher amounts of RS than HAS; the hydrolysed granules have more crystalline regions and, thus, greater resistance to enzymatic digestion [

 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Dry powdered HAS or AH-HAS, as indicated, were added to the diets instead of corn starch. In the supplemented diets, RSs were included as 40.5% and 68.0% of the dry weight for HAS and AH-HAS, respectively (Amylofiber

 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. When preparing the diets, the RS content of HAS and AH-HAS was 34.4% and 60.0%, respectively (wet weight). HAS and AH-HAS diets contained 6.8% and 12% of RS, respectively. HAS and AH-HAS were kindly provided by J-OIL MILLs.
