<p class="p">After 14 days of treatment, mice (all groups, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8 each) were euthanised by exsanguination under anaesthesia. The right tibia was removed to extract total RNA from bone-marrow cells. The proximal and distal sections of tibia were cut off, and an injection needle was stick into the bone marrow on the proximal and distal sections, respectively. Isogen
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> II (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) solution was injected into the tibial bone marrow from the proximal and distal sections and the bone marrow flowed out with Isogen
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> II from tibia. Isogen
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> II was mixed with the bone marrow, and then stored at −80 °C until assay. After 40 days of treatment, faeces and 48-h urine were collected. Faeces placed immediately on dry ice for freezing, and stored at −80°C until assay, and 48-h urine were stored at −20°C until assay.
