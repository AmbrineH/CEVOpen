Briefly, the fecal 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and the sequences of both strands of the cloned NDA (E. coli positions 516 to 1510) were determined using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The sequence data were subjected to homology searches with the BLAST or FASTA program, the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the CLUSTAL W program and TreeView software (these programs are at the DDBJ web site,

The sequence data for individuals C and G, and reference strains used for phylogenetic analysis methods are used by Nagashima et al. [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The length and peak areas of terminal restriction fragments were determined, and a phylogenetic tree constructed using GeneMaths (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The fingerprint profiles generated by T-RFLP were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Dice Similarity Matrix was used to construct a dendrogram of T-RFLP fingerprint profiles. DNA extraction from faeces, analyses of TRFLP and clone libraries were conducted by TechnoSuruga Laboratory Co., Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan).
