<p class="p">Data are the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The influences of HAS or AH-HAS treatment upon the composition of the faecal intestinal microbiota were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc test if the data had a normal distribution. If the data did not have a normal distribution and their variances were not equivalent, a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was carried out to determine significant differences between groups. The statistical significance of differences in femoral BMD was determined by analysis of covariance and Bonferroni significant difference test. Body weight was used as a covariate in the analyses (ANCOVA) of femoral BMD to adjust for possible confounding effects. The remaining data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Differences between groups were assessed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant if
