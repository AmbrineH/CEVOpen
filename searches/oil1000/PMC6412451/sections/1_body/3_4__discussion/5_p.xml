<p class="p">In the present study, AH-HAS treatment has been found to attenuate bone loss in the whole and proximal region of the femur significantly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A,B). There were no statistically significant effects of AH-HAS in BMD of the trabecular and cortical bones, although AH-HAS treatment tended to attenuate trabecular bone loss, and the reduction in BV/TV. The results of femoral BMD analyses were not consistent between those measured by DXA and µCT. Whole femoral BMDs were measured by DXA analysis, whereas BMDs measured by μCT analysis were partial sections of trabecular and cortical bone in the distal femur. Additionally, DXA analysis was performed using the bone mineral content of the measured area, which is a two-dimensional analysis; conversely, μCT analysis is a three-dimensional analysis. Thus, we speculate that differences between these data were caused by variations arising from the analytical sections, as well as differences in the principle of femur measurement.
