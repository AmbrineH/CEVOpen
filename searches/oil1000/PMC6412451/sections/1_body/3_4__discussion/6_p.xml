<p class="p">Oestrogen deficiency leads to an increase in bone resorption through increased osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, resulting in the progression of osteoporosis [

Our current study indicated that oestrogen deficiency decreased the femoral BMD of OVX mice; HA-HAS attenuated bone loss in the OVX mice. However, there was no effect of HAS or AH-HAS treatment on urinary CTX-I in OVX mice. AH-HAS treatment attenuated OVX-induced bone loss moderately; hence, it might reduce the urinary CTX-I level if the AH-HAS treatment lasts for a longer duration.
