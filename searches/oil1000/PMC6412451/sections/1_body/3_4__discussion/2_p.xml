<p class="p">Our results showed that AH-HAS had greater effects than HAS on the weight of caecal content, pH, β-glucosidase activity, changes in the composition/diversity of the microbiota, and gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon (

In healthy individuals, starch entering the large bowel is metabolised actively by the numerous saccharolytic bacteria inhabiting that region of the intestine, thereby resulting in SCFA production and a concomitant reduction in luminal pH [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Acidification of the intracolonic environment is considered important for suppression of the production and activity of a range of bacterial metabolites implicated in colonic disease. Be-ta-glucosidase, an enzyme generated by the intestinal microbiota, contributes to the hydrolysis of glucose monomers from the non-starch polysaccharides. Thus, the increase in β-glucosidase activity might exhibit the change in microbiota composition/diversity.
