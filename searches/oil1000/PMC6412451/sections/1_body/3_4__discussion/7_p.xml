 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. A potential mechanism for this effect is hypothesized to be the caecal wall hypertrophy and caecal acidification that RS-induced fermentation produces in the colon. There are a few reports on the effect of RS on BMD. Zafar et al., reported that diet treated with 5% RS did not increase calcium absorption capacity, and did not affect femoral BMD in male rats, which were fed with the recommended levels of dietary calcium (0.5%) [

Although the dietary calcium level used in the study was the same as our study, the diet treated with AH-HAS (12% RS) attenuated the OVX induced bone loss in our study. The effects of AH-HAS on BMD in sham mice were not examined in our study. In future, it is also necessary to examine the effect of AH-HAS on BMD in normal mice.
