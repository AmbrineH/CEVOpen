<p class="p">We evaluated the effects of RS supplemented in diets on the intestinal microbial composition, BMD, and expression of inflammation-associated genes in the colon and bone marrow of OVX mice. We found that treatment with HAS or AH-HAS increased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in mice faeces. AH-HAS downregulated expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL and inflammation-related IL-7R genes in the bone marrow. AH-HAS treatment attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the alleviative effect of RS feeding on bone loss was associated with inhibition of expression of ovariectomy-induced inflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic mRNA in bone-marrow cells.
