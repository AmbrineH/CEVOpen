<p class="p">In the colon, we assessed mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and tight-junction proteins. mRNA expression of IL-10 was significantly higher in the AH-HAS group than that in the sham group. IL-10 is an essential component of the immune system within the intestinal tract, where it dampens inflammation and helps to restore tissue homeostasis. Bassaganya-Riera et al. reported that dietary supplementation with RS decreased ileal and colonic inflammatory lesions, and increased IL-10 expression in the splenocytes of wild-type mice [

According to Vaziri et al., consumption of a RS-supplemented diet significantly increased intestinal expression of tight-junction genes, claudin-1 and occludin in rats [
