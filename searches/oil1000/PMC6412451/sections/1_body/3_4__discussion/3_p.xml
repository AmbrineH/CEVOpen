<p class="p">The selectively of dietary fibre regulates intestinal bacteria (at least in part) by stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacterial species (
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Those observations are agreement with the findings of our study: HAS and AH-HAS increased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A). In a previous study, it was reported that mice fed on diets containing 18 and 36% RS were colonized with higher levels of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Allobaculum</italic> species in proportions that were dependent on the concentration of the RS [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. According to Hu et al., an RS diet caused shifts in microbial composition/diversity, including increase in the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp., increased production of SCFAs, and reduced inflammation [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Conversely, in the present study, AH-HAS decreased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium XI</italic> spp., but there were no effects on clusters of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridum IV</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">XIVa</italic>. It has been reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> spp. can promote increased expression of IL-10 in regulatory T cells [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Whether the decrease/increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Clostrida</italic> spp. can cause inflammation is not known, but it has been speculated that they are related to immune homeostasis and inflammation.
