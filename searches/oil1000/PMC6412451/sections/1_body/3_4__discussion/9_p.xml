<p class="p">RANKL is an important osteoclast-specific gene and a critical regulator of osteoclast development and bone metabolism [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. RANKL expression is upregulated by inflammation related-cytokines and hormones. On day-14, we did not observe any significant effects of AH-HAS on expression of RANKL mRNA, although we did observe some effects on IL-7R expression in the bone marrow, as well as significant AH-HAS effects on RANKL expression on day-42. Therefore, these results suggest: (i) ovariectomy-induced expression of pro-inflammatory in bone-marrow cells; (ii) ovariectomy-induced osteoclastic RANKL expression might be downregulated by a diet supplemented with AH-HAS.
