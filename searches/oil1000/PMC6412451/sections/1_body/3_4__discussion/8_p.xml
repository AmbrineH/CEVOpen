<p class="p">We hypothesized that RS intake would modulate the intestinal microbiota, resulting in reduced inflammation of bone marrow and bone loss caused by oestrogen deficiency. Therefore, we assessed the expression levels of cytokines related to inflammation and bone resorption in bone marrow cells. AH-HAS attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A,B), and inhibited the ovariectomy-induced increases in expression of IL-7R mRNA on day-14 and day-42, and RANKL expression on day-42 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B,E,F) in bone-marrow cells. The association between inflammation of the bone marrow and bone loss is well established. Studies have shown that bone inflammation is increased in the context of oestrogen deficiency and linked to osteoclastogenesis, and that bone resorption is derived by cytokine-producing activated T cells [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. IL-7 regulates homeostasis of T cells and B cells via IL-7R signalling, and IL-7 causes bone resorption through activation of T cells and T cell-dependent augmentation of osteoclastogenesis [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. There were no significant effects of AH-HAS on expression of IL7, but IL-7R suppressed the increase in OVX-induced IL-7R expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B,E). In our previous study, soy isoflavones and/or RS inhibited the increase in OVX-induced IL-7R mRNA expression [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Thus, these results suggested that AH-HAS might attenuate the bone loss caused by oestrogen deficiency via regulation of T cells.
