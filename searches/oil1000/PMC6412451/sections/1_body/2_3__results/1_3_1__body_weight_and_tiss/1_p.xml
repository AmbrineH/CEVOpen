<p class="p">Significant differences in initial body weight, final body weight, or total food intake were not observed among groups (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00297-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The uterine weight from all OVX groups was significantly lower than that in the sham group. Treatment with HAS or AH-HAS did not affect uterine weight in OVX mice.
