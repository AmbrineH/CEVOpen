<p class="p">While the trabecular and cortical bone BMDs, and bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) of the distal femur were significantly lower in the OVX groups than those of the sham group, there were no significant differences among the OVX groups (

However, AH-HAS treatment significantly attenuated the trabecular bone loss and the reduction in BV/TV, when the statistical analysis in trabecular bone BMD were performed by ANCOVA among the OVX, OVX+HAS, and OVX + AH-HAS groups (data not shown).
