 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> spp. in the OVX + AH-HAS group (13.32 ± 3.77%) was significantly lower than those in the sham, OVX, or OVX + HAS groups (35.17 ± 4.97%, 36.96 ± 4.78% and 30.98 ± 1.94%, respectively). The abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium cluster IV</italic> spp. in the OVX + HAS and OVX + AH-HAS groups was 0.25 ± 0.04% and 0.04 ± 0.04%, respectively, but those species were not detected in the sham or OVX groups (
