There were no significant differences in the ratio of expression of RANKL/OPG among the groups on days 14 or 42 (data not shown). There were not significant effects of HAS or AH-HAS on the expressions of TNF-Î± and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in bone marrow cells on days 14 or 42 (data not shown).
