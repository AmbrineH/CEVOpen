<p class="p">Combined with an independent measure of total fatty acids per unit fluid (e.g., milliliter of plasma) or tissue (e.g., g of muscle), all fatty acids can be converted to absolute concentration units. The percentage of total fatty acids normalizes to the total fat amount, which is often reflective of sampling (e.g., volume of plasma, number of cells) in a manner similar to normalization to protein for other analytes. Fatty acid profiling does not capture changes in the total fatty acid pool, for instance, when lipemia increases the total fatty acids per unit plasma. Decreases in a particular target fatty acid can be misleading under these circumstances when, for instance, the total fatty acid concentration increases but a target fatty acid decreases as a percentage of the total. As an example, long-chain PUFAs as a percentage of total fatty acids tend to be at higher concentration in plasma PLs than in plasma TGs (
