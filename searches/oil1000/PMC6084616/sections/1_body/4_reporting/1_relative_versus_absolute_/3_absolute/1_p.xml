<p class="p">Expressing fatty acid concentrations in terms of concentration in a fluid (e.g., plasma) or tissue, for instance, as mg fatty acids/mL plasma, is appropriate when the goal is to establish the total available fatty acids. Importantly, in most biological systems, lipids are not dissolved but are maintained in suspension in various ways, as cells (e.g., RBCs), lipoproteins, or bound to transport proteins. Dissolution in aqueous solution implies a molecular dispersion, useful as a proxy for collision frequency, which enters into the reaction rate definition. Lipids in suspension are not molecular dispersions, and in their native environment where biology occurs (e.g., a membrane or the core of a lipoprotein particle) they are at a far higher concentration than in the bulk fluid or tissue. The concept of absolute concentration must therefore be understood as defining an average mass per unit fluid or tissue. Methods for measuring concentration do not inherently depend on measurement of a range of fatty acids; rather, they can be restricted to a single fatty acid.</p>
