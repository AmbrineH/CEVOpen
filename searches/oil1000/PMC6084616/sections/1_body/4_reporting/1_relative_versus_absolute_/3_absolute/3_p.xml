<p class="p">Both relative and absolute fatty acid measures are used for expressing fatty acid concentrations, their use depending on the nature of the specific issue considered. The choice of units influences the magnitude of the apparent changes (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>), and can yield an apparent contradiction in final conclusions (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>). One of the many considerations involved in formulating a critical hypothesis at the heart of competing theories in equipoise and in designing a study to provide an unambiguous confirmation or refutation of the hypothesis is what units to use to express the outcome. The hypothesis and research questions in fatty acid studies should be formulated in sufficient detail to specify which units are relevant.
