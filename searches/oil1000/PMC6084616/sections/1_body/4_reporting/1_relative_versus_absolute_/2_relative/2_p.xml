<p class="p">Profile percentages tend to exhibit lower variability than absolute concentration (discussed below) and tend to be distributed normally, a statistical advantage. As a result, proposed blood biomarkers of n–3 PUFA status are typically relative percentages or ratios (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>); concentrations of n–3 PUFAs without context are difficult to interpret because high concentrations could be a result of general lipemia rather than a specific increase in n–3 PUFAs. A recent systematic review of the blood fatty acid data of healthy adults across the globe revealed that 78% of the data were reported as weight percentage overall, with higher reporting percentages in the erythrocyte (91%), whole blood (92%), and plasma PL (83%) blood fractions (
