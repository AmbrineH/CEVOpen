<p class="p">Known as fatty acid profiling, the units are expressed as percentage by weight of total fatty acids, also known as weight-for-weight and abbreviated variously as “%, wt:wt” or “g/100 g”. Profile reporting is the most common means of expressing fatty acid data (

Weight is the natural unit for a GC-FID analysis because the FID responds to the total C and H burned rather than the moles of each analyte eluting from the column. Importantly, this method is also natural for studies focused on competition between various fatty acids for access to metabolism such as transport proteins, esterification, and interconversion from one fatty acid to another.
