<p class="p">The recent systematic review of blood fatty acid composition of healthy adults across the globe (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>) shows that 9.4 ± 5.8 fatty acids are reported. Surprisingly, &gt;30% of the studies reported ≤5 fatty acids, with 2% of the studies reporting no individual fatty acids, but only composite scores (e.g., n–3 EPA + DHA). This variation in reporting is remarkable, particularly considering that the data were all generated by nominally similar analytical procedures—GC with a capillary column.
