<p class="p">The fewer the fatty acids that are summed, the greater the apparent profile percentage of those reported. Researchers have employed 2 approaches for choosing fatty acids: 
 <italic class="italic">1</italic>) summing the total of identified fatty acids, and 
 <italic class="italic">2</italic>) summing the total of unidentified fatty acids. For the “identified fatty acids” approach, fewer fatty acids are typically summed, inflating the relative percentage of fatty acids reported. For the “unidentified fatty acids” approach, it is important to establish that the unidentified peaks are in fact fatty acids and not other lipids or contaminants such as cholesterol (
