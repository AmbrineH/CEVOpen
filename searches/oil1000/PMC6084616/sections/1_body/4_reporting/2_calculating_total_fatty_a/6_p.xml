<p class="p">The sum of the fatty acids in the various blood fraction profiles should reflect ≥95% of the total plasma fatty acids at minimum, with &gt;97% being desirable. The mean number of reported fatty acids noted above, 9.4 ± 5.8, would not fit this criterion. Recognizing that an increase of 10% in many fatty acids is biologically important, the choice of base is clearly important for any particular study. Moreover, systematic reviews and meta-analyses would suffer substantial increases in uncertainty, which would bias toward the null result solely based on nonstandardized analysis. Additional fatty acids may need to be identified for other human tissue pools (e.g., skin) or foods.</p>
