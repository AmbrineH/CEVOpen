<p class="p">The number of fatty acids that can be identified and quantified is dictated in part by capillary column choice. The use of a traditional polyethylene glycol capillary column and a biscyanopropyl column marketed for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-fatty acid determinations for plasma profiling serves as an example (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">
  <bold class="bold">Table 1</bold>
 </xref>). The biscyanopropyl column enabled the quantification of 12 additional minor fatty acids (percentage contributions &lt;0.15%). Based on reporting practices and relative percentage contribution to the total fatty acids, this working group categorized the fatty acids into categories primarily based on arbitrary abundance ranges (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The A category includes fatty acids with abundances &gt;0.30% of total fatty acids, with some fatty acids known to be critical for interpreting metabolism (e.g., see Mead acid below). This list has 21 fatty acids, which sum to ≥95% of the total plasma fatty acids. To our knowledge, no external standard mixture currently exists with all 21 A fatty acids listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The B category includes 7 fatty acids with abundances typically between 0.10% and 0.30% of total fatty acids that can be detected on a general Carbowax column but may vary across blood pools. Finally, the C category includes fatty acids comprising &lt;0.20% of the total and requires high-polarity columns for detection. While as many fatty acids as possible should be included in calculations of “total fatty acids,” it is important that the fatty acids in category A are reported to improve the consistency of relative percentage data. Any exceptions should be noted. For example, Mead acid (20:3n–9) is important in assessing essential fatty acid status and should be reported. If below the limit of detection or quantitation, as is common in populations with contemporary high dietary intakes of PUFAs such as 18:2n–6, it should be reported as such. Category B and C fatty acids will be important to specific cases and should be reported when relevant.
