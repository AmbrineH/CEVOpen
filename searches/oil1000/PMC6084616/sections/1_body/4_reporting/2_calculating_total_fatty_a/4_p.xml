<p class="p">In 2012, the NIST, along with the CDC and NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements, initiated the FAQAP to promote clinical comparability of analytical results (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>). This was followed up by second and third exercises in 2015 (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>) and 2016 (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>) using a procedure generally referred to as a “round robin” or “ring test.” Several laboratories around the world received standard reference materials (SRMs) generated by NIST consisting of serum for fatty acid analysis. In the initial exercise, a preliminary list of 24 fatty acids was requested, although participants were asked to include any fatty acids that they typically report. The percentage of participating laboratories reporting each of these 24 fatty acids varied from 100% for 20:4n–6, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 in all 3 exercises to 64%, 50%, and 33% for 22:1n–9 in exercise 1, 2, and 3, respectively (

 </bold>). The reduced percentages in the reporting of common fatty acids in exercises 2 and 3 were because of the inclusion of a laboratory using targeted HPLC measurements, rather than comprehensive GC profiling. In addition, for exercises 2 and 3, participants were encouraged to include measurements of additional fatty acids, but the percentages of laboratories reporting any of these additional fatty acids were all &lt;50% (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplemental Table 3</xref>
 </bold>). The frequency of reporting for 22:1n–9 and 14:1n-5 was quite low (&lt;10% in all blood fractions). The mean relative percentage contribution of 14:1n-5 was &lt;0.04% for all blood fractions, whereas for 22:1n–9 it was 1.00% in plasma PLs.
