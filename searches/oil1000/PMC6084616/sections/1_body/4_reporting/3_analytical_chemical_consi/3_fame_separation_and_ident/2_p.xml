<p class="p">Positive identification of FAME, including double-bond position and geometry, and chain branching, which excludes all but one correct structure, generally requires higher end equipment and methods than are available in most laboratories or can be justified for all samples. At a minimum, retention times and molecular weights should match those of genuine standards. Laboratories that do not have advanced methods should adhere carefully to sample types with a known pattern of FAME, for instance, the various blood lipid or lipoprotein groups or cell types. Non-FAME compounds eluting in FAME analyses include plasticizers, antioxidants and their reaction products, and peaks originating from unknown sources. All unknown peaks appearing in one or more chromatograms in a series should be evaluated as to whether they are FAME or not. Methods for estimating retention times, such as Kovats retention indexes, can be executed without access to mass spectrometry.</p>
