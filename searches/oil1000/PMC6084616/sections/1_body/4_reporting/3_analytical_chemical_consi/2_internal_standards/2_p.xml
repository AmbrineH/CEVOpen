<p class="p">When appropriate, IS should be added quantitatively so that a calibration factor can be derived in the units of concentration per count, for instance milligrams of fatty acids per milliliter of FAME mixture per raw data count. These can then be applied to calibrated profile area percentages to determine concentrations of all FAME in the extraction mixture. Conversion factors to the sample sizes (e.g., milliliters) and customary units (milligrams of fatty acids per deciliter of plasma) yield the final results.</p>
