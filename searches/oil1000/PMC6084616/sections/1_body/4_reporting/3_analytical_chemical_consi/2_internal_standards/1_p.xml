<p class="p">Internal standards are added quantitatively to a sample mixture to calibrate the signal at the step where addition occurs and for all subsequent steps. Their advantage is that they parallel the chemistry of the analyte, including losses, during all protocol steps. For water-soluble analytes, methods have been established for treating internal standards (IS) (

However, for lipid analyses in biological mixtures, &gt;1 phase is present in starting materials, thus the concentration of the IS is an unknown partitioned between the phases. Therefore, IS are not appropriate until lipid is extracted into a single phase unless the partitioning behavior of the IS in the specific protocol has been specifically examined. IS can be added when there is one phase in an extract mixture, such as the single-phase water:methanol:chloroform mixture of the Bligh and Dyer method (

The standard should be a fatty acid that is reliably found at negligible concentrations in the sample, appears at a retention time that is free of interferences, is added at a concentration to provide a peak height within the range of fatty acids to be calibrated, such as 5% of the total fatty acids or a ratio of 1:20, and may be added as a target lipid class (e.g., diacyl phosphatidylcholine) of interest to accurately track the behavior of the target analyte. If mass spectrometry is used, then an isotopically labeled species is appropriate, or possibly GC can be used to isolate deuterated FAME chromatographically. Depending on the target fatty acids and the questions being addressed, it is not always possible or desirable to add IS, and the fatty acid profile can stand on its own.
