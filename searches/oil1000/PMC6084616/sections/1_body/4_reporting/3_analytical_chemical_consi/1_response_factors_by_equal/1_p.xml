<p class="p">Fatty acid profiles are panels of fatty acid measurements. Each measured fatty acid is an integrated peak area that must be calibrated in some way to yield interpretable results. The classic method for calibration is via response factors (

 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>), with the detector responding similarly to each fatty acid according to its carbon and hydrogen content. Response factors are determined by preparing an external standard mixture of FAME all at equal weight, or known unequal weight, and applying a correction to the raw areas based on the differential response. Typically, a single fatty acid of strong intensity in the external standard and the samples, such as 16:0, will be chosen as a base. Alternatively, the instrument settings can be adjusted to yield equal raw areas across the range of relevant fatty acids, so that no correction is needed later. Area percentages are raw data. They are generally biased measures unless calibrated, and should not be reported as representative of fatty acid abundances (
