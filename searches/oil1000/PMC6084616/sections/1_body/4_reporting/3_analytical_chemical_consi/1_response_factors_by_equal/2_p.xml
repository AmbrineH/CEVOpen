<p class="p">For GC/MS, response factors are particularly critical because the response depends on the ionization and fragmentation behavior of each FAME and the ions chosen to quantify FAME. As a general rule, GC/MS is not recommended for quantitative analysis because the FID is a more stable and more linear detector.</p>
