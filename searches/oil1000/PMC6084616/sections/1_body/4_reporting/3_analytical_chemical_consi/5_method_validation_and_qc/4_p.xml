<p class="p">Precision and lower limits of quantification are always functions of signal intensity. When injected masses or concentrations (depending on the technique) are unnecessarily low, precision is unnecessarily low and minor peaks can fall below quantifiable limits. Undetected fatty acids pose statistical dilemmas, as their treatment as missing values, or as zero, influences the outcome of statistical analysis (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>). Care should be taken to ensure that all relevant peaks are on scale. Linearity should be established for specific instruments. A common solution to a limited linear dynamic range is to inject samples of different concentrations or quantities and bridge the data in the 2 chromatograms using intermediate intensity peaks that are on scale in both injections. Most reports record “not detected” or “trace” to reflect no signal or a signal below the quantifiable limit, respectively. It is far more useful to estimate, by similar detected or quantified signals, the ability of the protocol, including important but unreported details, like injected quantity and concentration, to detect particular low concentration fatty acids.
