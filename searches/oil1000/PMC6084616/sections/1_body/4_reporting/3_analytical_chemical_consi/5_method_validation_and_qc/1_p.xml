<p class="p">The validation and QC for laboratory fatty acid measurements may be established in part to be consistent with the validation principles for drugs, as stated in the Food and Drug Administration's Guidance for industry: bioanalytical method validation (
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>) and reported by Shah et al. (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>). Analytical figures of merit include intra-day and inter-day precision, accuracy, linearity range, and should be established by appropriate working standards. Validation should be conducted when fatty acid analyses are new to a laboratory or when a method is modified in a chemical procedure such as a high-throughput assay, microwave irradiation, or instrumental parameters such as fast GC, and/or use of high-efficiency columns.
