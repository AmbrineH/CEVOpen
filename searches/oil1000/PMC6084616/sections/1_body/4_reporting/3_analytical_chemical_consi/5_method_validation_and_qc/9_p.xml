<p class="p">In conclusion, though fatty acid studies are among the most common in nutrition and biomedicine, their translation into recommendations is limited by heterogeneity and limited comparability owing to differences between studies in design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation. The contemporary trend of combining studies in systematic reviews and meta-analyses tends to include all studies fitting particular criteria. However, such reviews often only refer to outlines of published details. Peer-reviewed primary reports of clinical studies are more thorough in their vetting and reporting of statistics than in the many details specific to fatty acid metabolism and analysis. Careful attention to the many known details is expected to improve the accuracy and precision of results from study to study.</p>
