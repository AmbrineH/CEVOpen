<p class="p">Precision of concentration measurements (e.g., milligrams of fatty acids per milliliter of plasma) is acceptable at the ±15% CV level through the linear range and ±20% at the lowest level of quantification, as recommended for conventional measurements by Shah et al. (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>). Precision for data expressed as percentage by weight should be considerably improved compared with these criteria (the descriptive words “improved” and “poorer” are used to refer to precision, rather than “lower precision”, which can be confused with a smaller SD, for instance), with major peaks (&gt;3% of total fatty acids) having a CV of &lt;5%. Precision for minor peaks is poorer and depends on the peak abundance. Precision and accuracy must be fit for purpose, where the hypothesis is stated a priori as a part of the study aims and will often be addressed implicitly in a power calculation. A reasonable reference point is the biological variability of the specific fatty acids in the population under study or the closest population for which data are available. For instance, the test-retest SD should be lower than the SD of the population.
