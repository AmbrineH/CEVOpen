<p class="p">QC should be conducted routinely for both chemical procedures and instrumental performance in all laboratories. One recommended QC standard sample is the certified NIST SRMs for fatty acid measurement containing high, middle, and low concentrations of fatty acids. Others can be laboratory working standards containing fatty acids within a close range of those in the samples of interest. The frequency of QC testing for fatty acid measurement will depend on the number of samples, such as adding one QC sample every 100 samples or one for each batch of high-throughput fatty acid assays. A QC test for instrument performance can apply the reference standard, either as single fatty acids or as a mixture of fatty acids of known weights for checking the retention time, resolution of peaks, and response factors. The frequency of this QC test should be on a regular basis (e.g., once every week or every 100 samples).</p>
