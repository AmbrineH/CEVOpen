<p class="p">LC-MS/MS is the standard method for pharmaceutical analyses of drugs and metabolites. The recommendation for the methodology used for method validation and QC is long established (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>). The rise of “omics” techniques and especially targeted analyte panels is analogous to the fatty acid profile used for decades by GC (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). Generally, high-performance methods are needed to provide similar specificity of qualitative analysis for structure, separation power, and quantitative analysis as high-resolution GC. LC-MS can also be used for analysis of intact glycerolipids, but is not recommended as a method to assess the overall fatty acid profile because of difficulties calibrating the vast number of chemically distinct species in a single biological sample. Hydrolyzed fatty acid LC analysis is analogous to FAME analysis by GC.
