<p class="p">This sample preparation step typically requires some form of hydrolysis or transesterification of the fatty acids from complex lipids. While saponification with a strong base prior to esterification was once common, several transesterification protocols have been developed where the fatty acid methyl ester is formed during hydrolysis from the complex lipid. Base-catalyzed methylation procedures are not suitable for esterification of NEFAs or transesterification of amide linkages found in sphingolipids. Acid catalysis can drive esterification and transesterification reactions. While methanolic HCl and sulfuric acid in methanol can be used, the much harsher BF

 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80â€“82</xref>) and no extraction, direction transesterification methods have often been used. In general, all chemical methods are specific to the analyte and to the chemical matrix. For example, water content can be critical in direct transesterification methods (

Therefore, methods developed for fatty acids in one sample matrix (e.g., RBCs) are not applicable to fatty acids in another matrix (e.g., milk) without a specific validation study. Validation studies for the specific methods mentioned develop a set of chemical principles and report optimized parameters. Laboratories using any method should use proper quality control (QC) techniques upon first use to establish routine protocols on surplus samples prior to use of study samples. Applying an established method to a new sample matrix requires side-by-side, replicate preparation with an extensive set of internal standards to compare the accuracy and precision of the putative method with the established method. Specific principles are usually relevant to particular methods. For instance, the Bligh and Dyer (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>) method requires a ternary mixture of chloroform, methanol, and water to achieve a single phase and highly effective extraction. Failure to achieve a single phase because of excess water in the sample causes the method to be very inefficient.
