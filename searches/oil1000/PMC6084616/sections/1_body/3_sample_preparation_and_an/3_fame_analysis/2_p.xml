<p class="p">The classic and most widely used method for FAME analysis is GC coupled to either a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) or an electron ionization (formerly known as electron impact) ion source mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The FID inherently produces signal on an approximately per milligram basis, whereas GC/MS produces signal on a per mole basis. Importantly, the FID does not yield information on chemical structure. GC/MS yields structural information such as molecular mass (weight), but for FAME cannot locate the double bond position (
