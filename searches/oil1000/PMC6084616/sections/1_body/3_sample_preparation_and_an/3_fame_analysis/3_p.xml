<p class="p">Neither electrospray MS/MS via liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS nor shotgun methods are preferred for fatty acid analysis because these approaches are not as specific or broadly applicable for fatty acids as GC. Because of the chemical properties of aliphatic hydrocarbon chains in mass spectrometers, double bond position and geometry (
 <italic class="italic">cis-trans</italic>) and chain branching are seldom captured in conventional LC-MS/MS analyses. Carbon and double bond numbers typically can consist of dozens of possible isomers and require information external to the sample to assign them to a structure (e.g., 22:6 is usually all-
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid). Moreover, LC-MS/MS generally requires isotopically labeled internal standards to enable acceptable quantitative analysis. Analysis over a range of 24 fatty acid features requires a similar set of isotopically labeled internal samples, which is seldom available.
