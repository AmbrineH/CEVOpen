<p class="p">Fatty acids are endogenous biomolecules, macronutrients, and n–3 α-linolenic and n–6 linoleic acid are essential nutrients. As such, they differ from xenobiotics—drugs and toxins—which do not occur widely in humans. Without exception, endogenous compounds are handled by specific metabolic mechanisms that have evolved to regulate concentrations and distribution, and have required roles in healthy humans. Xenobiotics, in contrast, are optional compounds that are normally not at appreciable concentrations unless purposefully ingested. The term “drug” is also a regulatory term that is applied to fatty acids when they are an active ingredient component of a preparation that is approved via a drug regulatory scheme. We note, however, that this does not change the fundamental character of fatty acids as nutrients. As nutrients, the diverse and highly regulated character of fatty acids must be figured into any study design and interpretation, including, for instance, known concentration ranges in healthy populations, enzyme-mediated interconversions, and de novo versus exogenous origin.</p>
