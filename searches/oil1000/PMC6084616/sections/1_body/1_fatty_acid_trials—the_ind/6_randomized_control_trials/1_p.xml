<p class="p">Randomized control trials (RCTs) are an intervention study design in which outcomes from participants in â‰¥1 treatment group are compared with those in a control group. Assignment of participants to treatment groups is random, with the person assigning individuals to treatments and/or the participants being masked (blinded) or open, depending on the hypothesis. RCTs, which are usually necessary to establish causality, vary in duration, from as short as 2 wk to as long as multiple years. As discussed below, equilibration times vary by pool and in some cases by fatty acids.</p>
