<p class="p">Rationales should refer specifically to whether the biological question responds on a short- or long-term basis. For instance, a short-term intervention might seek to rapidly alter postprandial lipemia, whereas a long-term intervention might seek to alter the whole-body status of PUFAs for studies of chronic disease. In the latter case, reference should be made to the known timing of the disease etiology as justification to avoid spurious nonsignificant results because the term of exposure is too brief.</p>
