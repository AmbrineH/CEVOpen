<p class="p">A major source of heterogeneity among studies is perceived to be the de facto use of intent-to-treat (ITT) rather than per-protocol (PP) analysis, as well as imprecise application of the 2 approaches. Strictly interpreted, ITT analysis applies specifically to the entire treatment, for instance, an entire caplet, regardless of whether the active ingredient was delivered to the participant. For example, an nâ€“3 fatty acid supplement contained in a gel capsule that prematurely breaks causing high levels of fishy burping could result in lower compliance in the experimental group and bias toward the null compared with a properly functioning capsule supporting higher compliance.</p>
