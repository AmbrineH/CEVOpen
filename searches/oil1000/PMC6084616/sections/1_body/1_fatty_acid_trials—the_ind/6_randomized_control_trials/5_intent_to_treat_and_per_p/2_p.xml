<p class="p">Trials of fatty acid intake accomplished with either foods or supplements are administered for the express purpose of altering the fatty acid profile of one or more endogenous tissues or fluids, usually intermediate to measuring a health outcome. During all trials, participants are consuming food with the target fatty acids and with other fatty acids that influence endogenous pools of fatty acids. Preparations that fail to sufficiently influence endogenous concentrations because, for instance, compliance is low influence the dependent outcomes. Xenobiotics are appropriately analyzed on an ITT basis because they are inherently medical treatments with medical indications. ITT applies to the entire good manufacturing practice defined treatment, and not exclusively to the test active ingredient. If no fatty acid measurements are made and a null result is found, the results cannot be ascribed to a failure of the test fatty acids to induce an effect, but only to the intervention as a whole. When no fatty acid measurements are made, such studies are particularly difficult to put into context of overall metabolism because changes in biological pools and biomarkers of compliance are undocumented. PP analysis, in contrast, can effectively ignore many details of the preparation and focus on establishing how changes in fatty acid concentrations in tissues correspond to changes in the health outcome. However, care must always be taken in interpreting any PP to avoid assigning significance to reverse causality. Treatment outcome may be correlated with compliant participants, who may be very different from noncompliant participants in any number of uncontrollable lifestyle factors, such as exercise, habitual diet, and smoking, and this may render any effects to be group differences not ascribable to the fatty acid intervention.</p>
