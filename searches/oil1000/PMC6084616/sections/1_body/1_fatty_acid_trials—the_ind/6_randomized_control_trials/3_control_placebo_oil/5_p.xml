<p class="p">Blood fatty acids differ in their response to dietary fatty acid intake. For essential fatty acids such as n–3 α-linolenic acid, total fatty acid profiles shift to reflect changes in intake in ways that can be useful. For instance, n–3 α-linolenic acid concentrations expressed as a percentage of total identified fatty acids increased &gt;2-fold in humans following a controlled feeding period of 4 wk where &gt;20 g/d n–3 α-linolenic acid was consumed (

However, for n–6 linoleic acid, the percentage offsets in the circulating compartment were notably less (i.e., &lt;10%) even after substantially higher n–6 fatty acid intakes, and for oleic acid–rich diets the offsets were even more modest (i.e., &lt;5%) following dietary substitutions containing high oleic acid canola oil with as high as 72% oleic acid. This latter finding possibly reflects the nonessential nature of oleic acid; because this fatty acid is synthesized de novo, manipulation of its concentrations in plasma and tissues is more resistant to changes in intake.
