<p class="p">Critical to deciding the fatty acid composition of a control oil is the question of fat substitution. When replacing one type of fat in the control for another type in the intervention, the nontrivial issue of whether there is any effect on health risk biomarkers because of the addition of the test or the removal of the control oil must be considered. For instance, a PUFA-rich fat intervention test would be expected to lower cholesterol relative to a saturated fat control beyond that attributable PUFA relative to a control PUFA or monounsaturated oil. A possible solution is to use a low-fat control, thus enabling the biological impact of the test fat in the intervention to be assessed without being confounded by the action of removing the control fat. However, in that instance, either the effects of the reduced energy level or the change owing to other macronutrients may confound the assessment of the direct effect of the test fat on the biomarker of interest. Therefore, this issue of substitution of certain bioactive fatty acids for others has to be carefully examined when designing a clinical study and interpreting its results.</p>
