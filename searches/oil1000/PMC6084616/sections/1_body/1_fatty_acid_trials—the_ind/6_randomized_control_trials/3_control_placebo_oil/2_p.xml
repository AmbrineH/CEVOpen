<p class="p">Ideally, the fatty acids of the control oil should mimic the common diet of the country where the trial is conducted unless the investigators are purposely manipulating the diet without use of a control, as would be the case with dietary fat replacement. Another point to consider in the rationale for choosing the appropriate control oil should be whether the participants have a special health condition, such as pregnancy, cardiovascular risk, or cancer. For instance, high intakes of n–6 linoleic acid directly suppress n–3 fatty acids at multiple levels (

Using placebo oils with PUFAs very different to the population background diet, richer in n–6 or n–3 PUFAs, may shift metabolism, depending on dose and duration. The background diet of the study population should be considered when inferring effects to other populations, and in many cases may restrict application of the findings of the intervention to that specific population. A background diet containing the fatty acid of research interest can also affect the sample size required to achieve meaningful results. The commercial availability of fatty acid supplements can also cause compliance issues in treatment and control groups (
