<p class="p">Similarly, the sum of EPA and DHA concentrations in multiple circulating compartments in the blood has been used as a measure of compliance. Patterson et al. (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>) demonstrated in a controlled supplement intervention study that the sum of EPA + DHA in plasma PLs, erythrocytes, and whole blood increases from 85% to 95% for every gram of EPA and DHA consumed over a negligible intake baseline. For intervention studies, available data suggest that certain fatty acid classes provide a better degree of representation of dietary intake shifts than do other classes, as discussed below. These data are at variance with reported shifts within RBCs and PL EPA and DHA concentrations within less well–controlled feeding studies, where the responses were generally more gradual with increasing intakes, particularly at higher concentrations of EPA and DHA consumption (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). From those anticipated responses, target threshold values can be set to identify and possibly exclude study participants whose circulating fatty acid profiles fail to meet those thresholds, as an indicator of poor compliance. The failure of an individual's circulating fatty acid concentration to meet an established threshold value is taken to imply that an inadequate proportion of the treatment fat was consumed. However, the degree of correspondence between circulating fatty acid concentrations and dietary intake will vary depending on the circulatory fatty acid compartment examined, whereby total circulating fatty acid concentrations would be expected to shift more rapidly over time relative to a more slowly turning over pool, such as erythrocytes.
