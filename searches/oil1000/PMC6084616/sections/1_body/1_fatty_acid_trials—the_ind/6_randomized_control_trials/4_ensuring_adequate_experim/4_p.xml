<p class="p">An excellent example of the use of fatty acids to reflect protocol compliance is the case of DHA supplementation. In the absence of changes in other fatty acids, tissue DHA concentrations are largely governed by dietary intake as its synthesis from α-linolenic acid is low under the industrial food supply's dietary intake of competing linoleic acid (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Circulating DHA concentrations in plasma TLs, but not RBCs, increase swiftly after DHA supplementation; for instance, volunteers consuming 4 g/d of DHA-supplemented canola oil under compliance-controlled conditions showed an increase in plasma TL DHA concentration of well over 2-fold over 4 wk compared with the consumption of regular canola oil (

Any instance in which DHA concentrations have moved in opposite directions between control and DHA supplementation phases indicates potential problems in treatment assignment, blood collection procedures, or subsequent experimentation stages. In instances of reverse responses of circulatory fatty acid concentrations to dietary treatment assignments, investigators should scrutinize protocol execution to identify errors. Other studies show consistent deflections in DHA concentrations in blood subsequent to n–3 fatty acid feeding (
