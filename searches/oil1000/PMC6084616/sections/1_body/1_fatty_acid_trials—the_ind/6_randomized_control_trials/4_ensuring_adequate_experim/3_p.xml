<p class="p">For other types of interventions, such as with nâ€“3 fatty acid supplementation, blood fatty acid concentration shifts should be used to confirm that the experimental protocol has been correctly deployed, as well as an estimate of subject compliance. However, a more in-depth benchmarking of anticipated shifts in the fatty acids of particular interest is required to best utilize this approach. In order to assess the utility of using circulating fatty acid concentrations as surrogates for ensuring experimental correctness and or compliance, it is necessary to explore what offsets would be expected in controlled dietary scenarios where specific fatty acid substitutions are made under compliance-assured conditions. Then, comparing observed offsets to what would be expected can inform investigators as to the degree of compliance of any particular participant in clinical trials.</p>
