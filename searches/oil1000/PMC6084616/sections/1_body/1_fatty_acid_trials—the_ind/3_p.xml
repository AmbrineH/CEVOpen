<p class="p">Drugs undergo extensive preclinical formulation and testing for safety and efficacy prior to being permitted to be used in humans. Formulations in particular are carefully defined according to good manufacturing practice, requiring extensive documentation of starting materials, procedures for creating the specific drug, including all excipients, and specifications for allowed concentrations of components in the final drug. In contrast, studies of fatty acids in foods or supplements routinely rely on generic labeling information to define composition. Omission of the actual analysis of the test article, the target oil under investigation, for both quantity and quality of the putative active ingredients may be a major source of response variability.</p>
