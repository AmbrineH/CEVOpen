<p class="p">Erythrocytes have a distinct advantage as the main blood pool with a lipid bilayer, with a more complete spectrum of PL classes, and therefore a fatty acid composition that may better reflect the cell membranes of biological tissues (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Erythrocyte TLs and fatty acid content are also relatively stable when compared with plasma (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), although this stability is often overestimated (see below). Sample collection, storage, and preparation of erythrocytes can, however, be problematic (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). Specifically, plasma and serum tend to be collected as the primary blood sample for clinical studies in general (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), although the heme content of erythrocytes can promote the oxidation of PUFAs unless preventative steps are taken (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Erythrocyte lysis, extended extraction times, and reduced chloroform-methanol ratios, or the use of isopropanol rather than methanol, are needed to maximize erythrocyte lipid recovery (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles are often considered a better long-term marker of dietary fatty acid habits based on the life span of erythrocytes (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>) and the half-life of fatty acids in erythrocytes as compared with serum cholesteryl esters (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). However, there is evidence that the half-life of palmitate is quite short in erythrocytes (&lt;30 min for some acylated erythrocyte proteins, 7–9 h for erythrocyte PLs) (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). With fish oil feeding, EPA can increase more rapidly than erythrocyte turnover, within 4 wk and possibly as soon as 1 wk, whereas increases in DHA are subtle (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). In a sporadic fish oil supplementation trial mimicking UK fish intake patterns, the dose relationship of EPA in erythrocytes was also relatively weak (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). This is likely because of differences in the incorporation of EPA and DHA into lipid classes (phosphatidylcholine versus phosphatidylethanolamine) and/or sequestering into the outer versus inner membrane bilayers (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). It is important to note that the rapid incorporation of EPA into erythrocytes may result in the masking of nonadherence to long-term fish oil intervention when the only n–3 PUFA biomarkers that are monitored are sums or composites of different n–3 PUFAs, such as EPA + DHA (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Overall in erythrocytes, because the PL concentration dominates over triacylglycerols, the fatty acid composition tends to have lower percentages of 18:2n–6, whereas stearic, oleic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acids tend to be higher (
