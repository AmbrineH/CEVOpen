<p class="p">Plasma PL fatty acid determinations take advantage of the availability and stability of plasma blood sample collections. The isolation and focus on the plasma PL pool eliminates the variability introduced by the transient postprandial triacylglycerol pool, and the resulting fatty acid composition is believed to better represent the cell membrane fatty acid composition. However, plasma PLs are more highly concentrated in phosphatidylcholines found in the lipid monolayer of lipoproteins, and as a result plasma PL measurements can be a biased view of the fatty acid composition of lipid bilayers. Specifically, phosphatidylethanolamine, a dominant PL of the inner bilayer (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8–11</xref>). This results in plasma PLs tending to be higher in n–6 linoleic acid and lower in n–6 arachidonic acid (20:4n–6) than fatty acid compositions from sources with lipid bilayers (

However, single-step selective lipid class extraction protocols using polar solvents (e.g., methanol) are available to isolate PLs and have high throughput potential (
