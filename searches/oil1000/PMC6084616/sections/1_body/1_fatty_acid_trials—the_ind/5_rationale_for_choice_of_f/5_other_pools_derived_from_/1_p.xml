<p class="p">Fatty acids in other blood pools are also available, and their use may be warranted depending on the research goal and hypothesis (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). This includes lipid classes that can be isolated from plasma, such as the triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester pools mentioned previously, but also the plasma NEFA pool. The fatty acid composition of these plasma lipid classes are not reported as often as those of plasma PLs when examining long-chain PUFAs (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>), but the cholesteryl ester pool has been used in several studies examining saturates, monounsaturates and 18-carbon PUFAs (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). However, unless a specific rationale is provided, reporting the fatty acid composition of cholesteryl esters is not advised since this pool is influenced by recent diet and fatty acyl substrate specificity of sterol 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-acyltransferase, and in particular phosphatidylcholine-sterol O-acyltransferase (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). In addition, the fatty acid profile of other blood components, such as white blood cells and platelets, may be informative in certain situations (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>).
