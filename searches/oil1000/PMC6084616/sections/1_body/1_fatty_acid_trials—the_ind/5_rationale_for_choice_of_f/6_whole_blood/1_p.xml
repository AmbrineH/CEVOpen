<p class="p">The use of whole blood sampling for fatty acid profiling is increasing (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). It has a distinct advantage in sample handling and processing as no separation is required, it is amenable to capillary blood collection (e.g., fingertip prick), and it can be collected and preserved as a dried blood spot. Whole blood is, however, a comprehensive sample in that the fatty acids of the various blood components contribute to the overall fatty acid composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to plasma and erythrocytes, lipid structures in the buffy coat, such as white blood cells and platelets, are included. This can be disadvantageous as information about the sampled blood pool of the fatty acids is lost, limiting interpretation. Therefore, whole blood fatty acid composition may be influenced by hematocrit or changes in white blood cell pools owing to infection, in addition to the changes in plasma lipoproteins outlined above.
