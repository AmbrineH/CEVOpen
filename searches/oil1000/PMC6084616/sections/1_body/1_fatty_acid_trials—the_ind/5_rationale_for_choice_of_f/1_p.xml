<p class="p">Numerous circulating fatty acid pools can be sampled, each with their own properties (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). When fatty acids are the primary outcome the pool must be specified prior to the study initiation for power calculations. In 2016, a global survey of n–3 fatty acids reported that ∼90% of studies concerned at least one of 3 blood pools: plasma total lipids (TLs), plasma phospholipids (PLs), and red blood cells (RBCs) (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). In recent years, total blood lipids derived from dried blood spots have become prominent for their simplicity of collection and storage. Each of these pools, however, has its inherent strengths and limitations, so the rationale for choosing the most appropriate pool should be based on the research design used and the specific question being asked. We discuss here the strengths and limitations of the blood pools, emphasizing the 3 most studied pools. We also discuss how to choose the blood pool in which the fatty acids will be analyzed based on the 3 main types of research designs and what type of question will be answered when analyzing the fatty acid profiles in these various pools.
