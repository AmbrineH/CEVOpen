<p class="p">The plasma TL pool has logistic advantages for fatty acid analysis, but can present challenges in interpretation. Specifically, plasma sample collection tends to be routine in clinical studies, and the fatty acids in the sample can be relatively stable. Plasma fatty acids are found in various pools, including NEFAs bound and unbound to albumin, and fatty acyls in complex (acylated) lipids of the lipoproteins. The bulk of the complex lipids consist of triacylglycerols (49%), PLs (24%), and cholesteryl esters (16%) (

Plasma TLs tend to have n–6 linoleic acid (18:2n–6) as the dominant fatty acid, in excess of palmitic acid (16:0), and oleic acid (18:1n–9) tends to be more abundant than stearic acid (18:0) (

 </xref>). The plasma TL fatty acid amounts can vary considerably compared with relevant mean treatment effects within and across individuals. These are largely owing to gene-diet and gene-environment influences on lipoproteins and the triacylglycerol pool, which include fasting or the sample timing relative to dietary intake, specifically the types and amounts of foods and/or supplements consumed, as well as genetic polymorphisms (
