<p class="p">The rationale for choice of blood sample must reflect fatty acid status over the relevant time period. A representative example of fatty acids in circulation reflecting patterns of intake for fat qualitatively is seen in the case of the ω-3 index, which is intended to serve as a barometer of n–3 fatty acid consumption. The ω-3 index calculates the sum of n–3 fatty acids, usually the addition of EPA and DHA concentrations, within the erythrocyte compartment, and has been substantiated as reflecting longer term intakes of dietary n–3 fat relative to other fatty acid species. Other instances of use of fatty acids in blood exist to quantitate the types of fatty acids consumed over the longer term. For instance, margaric acid concentrations have been used as a proxy for dairy fat consumption (

In some cases, it may be possible to translate fatty acid data from one blood fraction to an equivalent in another blood fraction (

Any such translation should be done with caution, and appropriate caveats should be considered. Such monitoring is useful to assess adequacy of intakes particularly for essential fatty acids, and especially in low-resource regions, where essential fat intakes, including n–3 fatty acids, appear insufficient (
