<p class="p">Moreover, this type of study often reports dietary fat intake collected by dietary record or food frequency questionnaires. Some studies report dietary intakes in EPA + DHA evaluated from dietary recall or food-frequency questionnaire. In cross-sectional studies, circulating compartment fatty acid composition data can provide insight into habitual consumption patterns for dietary fats with far better accuracy than do dietary intake data. The substantial limitations of self-reported dietary intake assessment instruments have been identified by experts in that area (

In these types of studies, it is far more informative to look at fatty acid profiles within the circulating compartments rather than rely on the vagaries of recall methods and limitations of nutrient databases to identify dietary patterns of individuals.
