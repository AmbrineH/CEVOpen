<p class="p">Prospective cohort studies and many cross-sectional studies, for practical reasons, obtain samples over extended time periods, collecting biological samples for subsequent banking, typically for several years, in freezers at −80°C. Often a general lack of information exists in publications about the timing between when the biological samples were collected and when the fatty acid profile analysis was performed on them. For instance, some samples collected in the 1990s could have been analyzed &lt;2 y after collection even though the paper reporting the analysis was published in 2000; for other studies, the samples may have been collected as early as the 1990s but the fatty acid analyses were performed in 2010, hence leaving a large gap between collection of samples and their subsequent analyses. An important question becomes whether the quality of the sample persists after having been stored for so long and whether the data are accurate, particularly in the case of n–3 fatty acid concentrations. Storage conditions are particularly important because practical considerations often require wide variability between sample collection and analysis, as, for instance, for enrollment of participants or sample collection over many months. Details about storage temperature and duration are provided below.</p>
