<p class="p">Researchers should also be aware that biological ranges of fatty acids in the blood of humans have been established in many cases. These ranges should be used when interpreting the study results. For example, the ratio of EPA + DHA to total fatty acids ranges over ∼1–15 in various blood pools from populations across the globe according to a comprehensive literature review (
