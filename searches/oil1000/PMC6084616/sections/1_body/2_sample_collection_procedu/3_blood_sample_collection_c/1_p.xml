<p class="p">Biochemistry parameters are generally derived from measurements of serum or plasma. Blood collection parameters, such as participant posture, season of blood collection, and the duration of the tourniquet application, can cause shifts in cholesterol and TG pools (

 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>). Plasma samples have several advantages over serum samples, including obtaining the samples faster since there is no waiting for the blood to clot, and shorter centrifugation time since the centrifugation speed can be higher for plasma samples compared with serum samples (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>). Plasma samples have been shown to have slightly lower concentrations of cholesterol than serum because of an osmotic effect of the anticoagulants extracting water from cellular contents (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>). However, the fatty acid composition of serum and plasma has been shown to be remarkably similar when expressed as relative percentages of total fatty acids (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>). The most popular vessels for collecting plasma are tubes loaded with EDTA, heparin, and citrate, and for collecting serum the most popular tubes are those coated with silica. Between blood sample collection and centrifugation, blood samples to be used for separating plasma from red cells should be kept on ice to avoid fatty acid hydrolysis from glycerolipids, a process that can result in artifactual change in the concentrations of NEFAs, and possibly PLs and TGs, in the plasma.
