<p class="p">Many sample collection conditions can influence the blood fatty acid profile, including but not limited to fasting or postprandial status, variations related to sex (e.g., menstrual cycle timing), dynamic effects related to diagnosed medical condition or syndrome and corresponding treatment therapy, recent alcohol, tobacco or drug use, and the blood sampling protocol itself (e.g., use of anticoagulants, use of antioxidants, length of handling time). Details of sample storage and archiving, including timing, freezing, and storage temperatures, should be reported. Special attention should be given to conditions that may cause PUFA oxidation, including the use of antioxidants and iron chelators intended to minimize the oxidation risk. Storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and oxygen exposure may all increase the oxidation risk. Numerous control points require special attention to ensure sample collection that minimizes alterations in the fatty acid profile during storage.</p>
