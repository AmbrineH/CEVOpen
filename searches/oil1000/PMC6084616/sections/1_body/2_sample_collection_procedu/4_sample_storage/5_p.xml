<p class="p">Other storage conditions that should be considered include the size of the aliquot to be stored and freeze-thaw cycling. Smaller aliquots of samples have a greater surface area to volume ratio than larger aliquots, which increases the exposure to oxygen and results in more degradation (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>). Freeze-thaw cycling of samples is largely believed to be detrimental, but this appears to be based on studies employing enzymatic assays to examine various clinical blood lipid classes such as cholesterol and TGs, and the findings are not consistent (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>). Limited research exists probing the effects of freeze-thaw with subsequent fatty acid determinations by gas chromatography (GC); one of the few studies suggested that repeated freeze-thaw cycling had limited impact on lipid concentrations, including fatty acids, in unfractionated serum (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>). However, sample handling should limit freeze-thaw and minimize the time a sample spends at temperatures above ultracold temperatures (&lt;−50°C). Reference should be made to validation that the key fatty acids or indexes (e.g., %HUFA) are preserved under the conditions of storage.
