<p class="p">Compared with plasma fatty acid stability lasting for ≥10 y if stored at −80°C, RBC fatty acid stability is lower because RBC iron, when released, catalyzes long-chain PUFA oxidation (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Therefore, specific considerations require attention when dealing with this lipid pool. For instance, fatty acids from RBC TLs that were stored at −20°C without any specific storage additive such as N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were stable for 13 d to &lt;6 mo (

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>). Fatty acid stability was highly improved when RBCs were stored at −70°C without any added antioxidant agents (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>). One study showed that fatty acids in RBC phosphatidylcholine were stable for &gt;2 y if the RBCs were stored at −80°C (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). Studies using unwashed erythrocytes yielded results similar to studies that washed erythrocytes prior to storage (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). To maintain the stability of RBCs, investigators should consider adding an antioxidant such as BHT to stabilize RBC-containing samples. Therefore, storage temperature seems critical, especially for RBCs, for maintaining sample quality with respect to fatty acid content and prevention of oxidation. Storage also depends on the form of storage vehicle, with vials limiting oxygen exposure more reliably than paper; details are available elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). Storage for weeks at −20°C (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>) should be avoided for erythrocyte-containing samples to avoid iron release through hemolysis (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>); samples stored at room temperature or 4°C are more stable.
