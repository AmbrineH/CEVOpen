<p class="p">Whole blood samples appear to be the less stable than plasma and RBC samples (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). The increased risk of PUFA losses in whole blood appears to be because of the water content in the samples, as RBCs diluted in saline are less stable than packed RBC samples (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), suggesting that the higher water content may increase the amount of freezing-induced hemolysis, which releases iron. Freezing-induced hemolysis appears to be responsible for the rapid decline in PUFAs in whole blood and RBC samples when they are stored at −20°C (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>), as samples stored at room temperature and 4°C are more stable (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). Freezing-induced hemolysis also occurs at −80°C, but PUFA concentrations are relatively stable when compared with −20°C storage. It appears that −20°C storage is not sufficiently cold to prevent oxidative processes, as BHT can prevent much PUFA loss at −20°C (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). Cryopreservatives that protect against hemolysis and chelators that bind iron prevent PUFA losses at −20°C, but BHT appears to be the most effective single treatment (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). For whole blood stored as dried blood spots, the risk of oxidation is increased compared with storage in tubes as dried blood spots are exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Drying the blood spot thoroughly before low-temperature storage can prevent hemolysis and increase stability. However, BHT and/or other protective agents should be considered as they can extend PUFA stability in DBS under various conditions (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), including room-temperature storage (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>).
