<p class="p">Appropriate storage of plasma or blood samples collected during an RCT, a cross-sectional study, or a prospective study is critical to preserve sample quality and to ensure an accurate measure of the fatty acid profile. Inappropriate storage conditions can lead to peroxidation of the fatty acids and the hydrolysis of fatty acids from PLs. In general, the presence of RBCs in a sample can increase the risk of oxidation. The stability of blood fatty acids during storage and possible mechanisms of fatty acid degradation have been reviewed recently (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). In general, PUFAs are susceptible to peroxidation because of the attack of free radicals. Free radical generation is increased with exposure to oxygen and the presence of iron (hemoglobin complex) in the samples. Peroxidation can be prevented or reduced through the addition of antioxidants (
