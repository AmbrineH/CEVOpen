<p class="p">Samples should be stored at −80°C to prevent oxidation of plasma PL PUFAs. This temperature prevents degradation of long-chain PUFAs in the PL fraction serum pool for ≥10 y (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>). The fatty acid composition of plasma PLs is also stable for ≥1 y when stored at −20°C (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>). Surprisingly, there are no studies that have evaluated the stability of the fatty acid profile in plasma TL extracts. Therefore, it is difficult to make any recommendation with respect to number of years and storage temperature. However, Matthan et al. (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>) performed fatty acid profile analyses in TGs, PLs, and cholesteryl esters in samples stored at −80°C and found that the fatty acid profile was stable for &gt;10 y. Another group also analyzed the fatty acid profile in TGs, PLs and cholesteryl esters in plasma samples stored at −20°C for 3 y and they determined that PUFAs were stable for &lt;3 y (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>). Considering these caveats, and because there are no data per se on the stability of fatty acids in plasma TLs, fatty acids in plasma TL extract are considered stable for ≥10 y if stored at −80°C but are stable for &lt;3 y if stored at −20°C. Plasma NEFAs are known to increase when stored at ≥−20°C as these temperatures do not appear to be cold enough to prevent phospholipase activity (
