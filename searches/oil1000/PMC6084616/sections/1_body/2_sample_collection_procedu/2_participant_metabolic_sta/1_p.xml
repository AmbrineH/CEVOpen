<p class="p">Marked fatty acid shifts occur in the plasma in response to food intake. After food intake, the postprandial state is characterized by higher triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations in the plasma. Moreover, the postprandial state is more variable metabolically than the morning fasting state. Therefore, the postprandial stage is a transition stage and samples collected in this period should be avoided unless the investigators are purposely evaluating that specific stage, or unless a blood fraction or fatty acid pool that is relatively stable with regard to fatty acid (e.g., PLs) in the postprandial state is to be examined. The postprandial rise in plasma fatty acids studied with and without stable isotope labels show that concentrations remain elevated even at 4–6 h after the meal (

In contrast, if fatty acid profiles are evaluated in RBCs, strict guidelines for fasting may not be necessary. Also, certain fatty acids appear to be more resistant to postprandial effects. For example, n–3 PUFA status can be accurately assessed in postprandial samples in whole blood, plasma, or erythrocytes, depending on how the samples are analyzed and the data are expressed. For instance, the percentage of n–3 HUFA in total HUFA is more robust to transient changes in circulating postprandial fatty acids than other indexes or individual fatty acids as a percentage or concentration of total fatty acids (
