<p class="p">We chose not to consider fatty acids with chain lengths of ≤12 carbons to avoid methodological issues particularly with regard to the volatility of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of these shorter chain fatty acids. In its initial study, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) fatty acid quality assurance program (FAQAP), involving dozens of fatty acid analysis laboratories, used a similar range and reasoning, as outlined below. Subsequent studies revealed that a minority of laboratories report fatty acids with chain lengths of ≤12 carbons. Specific methods are required to avoid uncontrolled losses of short- (
