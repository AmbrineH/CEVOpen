<p class="p">The recommendations are meant to be adopted as appropriate by various stakeholders in fatty acid studies, whether researchers, reviewers, or readers, and are not intended to be prescriptive. The extent to which the recommendations should be applied depends directly on the specific issues investigated in each study. Principal investigators and their research team members are ultimately responsible for the design and conduct of studies, taking into account all factors relevant to the hypotheses or research questions to be investigated. Hundreds of fatty acids are present in human plasma, derived from diet and metabolism. Clearly, it is not possible to consider all issues relevant to all fatty acids in a limited document. The focus here is on fatty acids that have been of primary interest in clinical studies measuring circulating fatty acids with chain lengths from 14 to 24 carbons. This includes examinations of SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs, as well as long-chain PUFAs (≥20 carbons, ≥2 carbon-carbon double bonds) and highly unsaturated fatty acids (≥3 carbon-carbon double bonds, HUFAs).</p>
