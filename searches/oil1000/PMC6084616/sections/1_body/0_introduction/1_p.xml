<p class="p">Fatty acids are among the most studied nutrients and bioactive compounds. A 2017 PubMed search on the specific term “fatty acids” limited to human and clinical trials exceeded 24,000 hits. The intake of fatty acids influences all aspects of health and disease because of their diverse roles as structural lipids in every cell, signaling precursors, and as the major component of oily secretions on the skin and elsewhere. The rich preclinical literature developed in cells and animals on the metabolism, biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysics, and genetics of fatty acids indicates that the choice of dietary fats is a key modifiable factor determining proper development, and best health, through the life course.</p>
