<p class="p">Despite the dozens of peer-reviewed reports appearing weekly, standardization of the many parameters and considerations common to fatty acid studies has not been undertaken. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have produced mixed results owing to heterogeneity between studies. Heterogeneity reflecting true physiologic or intervention differences is important in translating findings into recommendations and dietary guidance. Heterogeneity because of study design, fatty acid biochemical analysis, and reporting obscures true differences and reduces the strength of overall evidence. Therefore, the best practices currently described are intended to inform the design, implementation, and reporting of human clinical studies investigating fatty acid metabolism and function so that consistency and strength of the totality of evidence reflect physiologic rather than methodologic differences. Our goal here is to guide choices and recommend reporting standards that reveal issues that can lead to apparent but not real differences in outcomes, rather than to be all inclusive.</p>
