<p class="p">The materials examined in this study were plants of narrow-leaved lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavendula angustifolia</italic>), ‘Munstead’ cultivar. Single-node shoot fragments with a length of 1–1.5 cm were put in glass jars with a capacity of 300 mL, filled with 30 mL of the medium. The media, with a mineral composition developed by Murashige and Skoog [
