<p class="p">The qualitative GC-MS analysis of the extracted essential oils was carried out using HP 6890 gas chromatograph coupled with HP 5973 Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) operating in 70 eV mode. Samples of 2 μL (40 mg of oil dissolved in 1.5 mL of dichloromethane) were injected in a split mode at a ratio of 5:1. The compounds were separated on a 30 m long capillary column (HP-5MS), 0.25 mm in diameter and with 0.25 µm thick stationary phase film ((5% phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane).</p>
