<p class="p">Aqueous suspensions of gold and silver nanoparticles were synthesized using Turkevich et al. [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] methods with modified synthesis conditions and a two-stage microwave-convection heating method. For this purpose, aqueous mixtures of 0.903 g·dm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> of sodium citrate with 2.378 g·dm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> of tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), and 1.189 g·dm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> of silver nitrate (AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), respectively, were prepared. After their purification with a small (0.2 μm) pore antibacterial filter (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), they were placed in a microwave (MX 245), where they were stirred and heated to 100 °C at 800 W, which allowed for reaching a heating rate of approx. 1.6 °C/s. Once the preset temperature was reached, the mixture was kept in the microwave for an additional 20 s, and then placed in HBR 4 digital IKAMAG heating bath (IKA, Staufen, Germany), where it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and incubated at 95 °C for an additional 15 min. It was then gradually cooled to room temperature (0.8 °C/min). To obtain a similar distribution of nanoparticle diameters, the resulting mixtures were homogenized in a centrifugal force field in Beckmann JA-20 centrifuge to obtain similar nanoparticle concentrations in both mixtures. Once their spectra were plotted with UV-VIS EPOCH microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany), the optical density of the fractions obtained was adjusted to a common DEV value, using the following spectra absorbance maxima λ
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 520 nm and λ
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 445 nm for gold and silver colloids, respectively (

The similarities in morphology, shape, and size of the synthesized and prepared gold (24.2 ± 2.4 nm) and silver (27.5 ± 4.8 nm) nanoparticles were assessed after their application to the surface of a nylon membrane (Supelco, Park Bellefonte, PA, USA) and through an analysis of images from a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200 FEG model) (FEI Company, Tokyo, Japan,
