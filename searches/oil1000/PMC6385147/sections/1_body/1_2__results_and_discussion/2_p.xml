 <xref rid="molecules-24-00606-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, where the percentage composition and retention indices of the constituents are given. A total of 97 different compounds representing 99.29–99.95% of the oils were identified. The main volatile constituents were: Borneol (12.14–16.46%), τ-cadinol (12.96–16.63%), caryophyllene oxide (8.79–12.23%), γ-cadinene (4.54–6.08%), and 1,8-cineole (2.80–4.58%). Other important constituents were: Cis-14-nor-muurol-5-en-4-one (2.68–4.45%), β-pinene (1.93–3.14%), camphor (2.05–2.79%), and α-santalene (1.42–2.64%). The extracted oils were the most abundant in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (36.34–43.36%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenes (27.77–38.23%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (10.27–14.35%), and monoterpene hydrocarbons (5.57–10.40%).
