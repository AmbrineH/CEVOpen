 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> of AgNPs differed the most with respect to the control culture (plants propagated on the culture medium with no nanoparticles) in terms of the number of compounds: While 10 compounds were not found in it at all, 13 others were detected which were not observed in the control oil. The addition of AuNPs and AgNPs to the media resulted in a decrease in compounds with lower molecular weight (e.g., α- and β-pinene, camphene, δ-3-carene, p-cymene, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), trans-pinocarveol, camphor, and borneol), which were replaced by those of higher molecular weight (τ- and α-cadinol 9-cedranone, cadalene, α-bisabolol, cis-14-nor-Muurol-5-en-4-one, (
