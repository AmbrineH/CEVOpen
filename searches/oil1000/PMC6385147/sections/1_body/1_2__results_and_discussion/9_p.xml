<p class="p">Heavy metal nanocolloids that have been recently used in plant in vitro cultures, as elicitors provoke the production of secondary metabolites. There are research reports confirming that these particles are capable of eliciting responses in plants consistent with those generated when typical elicitors are used [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. It is commonly believed that the production of secondary metabolites in plants is significantly affected by environmental stress. Biotic and abiotic stresses delay cellular differentiation through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which directly destroy cells by producing secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The researchers suggest that oxidative stress induced by nanoparticles is correlated with the production of secondary metabolites in plants. Due to their small size, nanocolloids can easily attach to plant cell walls, destroy them, change their permeability, and thus significantly affect cellular metabolism [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] confirmed the effectiveness of silver as an elicitor using silver ions in the production of diterpenoids in the cultures of root hairs of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> genus. The addition of silver to the culture media of root hairs resulted in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species. Activation of ROS-based mechanisms following exposure of plants from 
 <italic class="italic">Calendula officinalis</italic> L. genus to nanoparticles was also confirmed by Ghanati and Bakhtiarian [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] in the production of secondary metabolites. Fazal et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] demonstrated that a callus of 
 <italic class="italic">Prunella vulgaris</italic> genus treated with silver and gold nanocolloids produced significant quantities of antioxidant enzymes, such as POD and SOD, as well as phenolic and flavonoid compounds that are directly related to the protection of plants against environmental stress. Silver nanocolloids were used to produce capsaicin from 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic> sp. and resulted in a significant increase in the production of this compound [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Hemm et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] showed that growth regulators combined with elicitors resulted in a larger organogenic potential of plants and increased the production of primary and secondary metabolites.
