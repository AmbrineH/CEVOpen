<p class="p">The study showed that the addition of gold and silver nanocolloids to the culture media significantly affected the composition of essential oil derived from narrow-leaved lavender cultivated in in vitro cultures. In the oils extracted from plants propagated in vitro on culture media with the addition of nanoparticles, a variety of compounds were identified that were not present in the oil derived from plants grown on the control medium. The above suggests that gold and silver nanoparticles can be successfully used to obtain essential oils of different composition which may result in different properties: Fragrance and, above all, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, but the latter requires further studies. It is also necessary to determine the toxicity of nanoparticles in relation to plant tissues.</p>
