<p class="p">Nanoparticles are easily absorbed and accumulated by plants. The processes of nanopenetration into the cells of living organisms are still to be explored in detail. However, it has been confirmed they enter certain cells through endocytosis or through pass through surface pores in plant cell walls [

The selective properties of cell walls enable the transport of particles measuring from 5 to 20 nm, allowing nanoparticles to easily penetrate cells and spread throughout the entire organism, ultimately affecting biological processes occurring in the cells [
