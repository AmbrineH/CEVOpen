 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] show that the application of metal nanoparticles to plants growing under natural conditions results in a change in the essential oil content extracted from their tissues. The aim of this study was to verify how gold and silver nanocolloids influence the composition of essential oils in narrow-leaved lavender (
