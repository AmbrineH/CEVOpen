<p class="p">Ongoing studies are attempting to determine the suitability of nanoparticles as elicitors in the in vitro cultures. Currently used elicitors are either biotic agents derived from biological sources, such as components of fungal and bacterial cell wall structures (polysaccharides, glycoproteins, inactivated enzymes, curdlan, chitosan), or abiotic factors of chemical or physical origin (heavy metal salts, osmotic stress, mechanical damage, ultraviolet radiation) [
