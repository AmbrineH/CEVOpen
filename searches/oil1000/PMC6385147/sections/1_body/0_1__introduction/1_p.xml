<p class="p">Nanotechnology has become one of the fastest growing interdisciplinary fields of science today. Nanoparticles, i.e., compounds or elements reduced to the size of less than 100 nanometers, differ in terms of their atomic structure compared to the material they are derived from, and also differ in terms of their physical, chemical, and biological properties. The most important advantage of nanoparticles is a high surface-to-volume ratio, which tends to increase with the reduction in their diameter, whereby nanoparticles demonstrate very high chemical activity [
