<p class="p">Animals are known to be a rich source of protein, and livestock production has over the years been a major source of providing the human species with their protein requirements. In recent times, however, there have been concerns with regard to the environmental effects of livestock production. Increasing animal protein production through the traditional livestock rearing is said to lead to an unsustainable rise in greenhouse emissions (Gerber et al.,

Decreasing livestock production on the other hand may be beneficial to the environment but will increase malnutrition incidences, because about 10.7% (815 million) of the world's population currently suffer from chronic undernourishment (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, &amp; WHO,

The use of insects as food is among the many approaches that have been thought to provide a long‐lasting solution to this foreseen future deficit in animal protein supply. Other underutilized indigenous crops such as the orange‐fleshed sweet potato could also provide other nutrients resulting in a balanced diet that pregnant women could rely on to supply their nutritional needs.
