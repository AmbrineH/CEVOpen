<p class="p">Despite the enormous nutritional benefits of eating insects and other indigenous food crops, Westernization, in recent times, has affected the attitudes of people negatively regarding their consumption. It will therefore be prudent to adopt the approach of merging the nutrient‐rich traditional cuisines with popular foods such breads, biscuits, chocolates, and even juices. Biscuits are popular ready‐to‐eat convenient and affordable snacks that are widely consumed by all age groups in many countries and have been used for nutrient supplementation in many cases. The principal ingredients for making them are wheat flour, shortening, and sugar. These ingredients result in products that are high in carbohydrate but low protein and micronutrient contents. We therefore developed a supplemental palm weevil larvae and orange‐fleshed sweet potato biscuit as a snack with the aim of harnessing of the nutritional and health benefits of the palm weevil larvae and orange‐fleshed sweet potato to help improve the protein and vitamin A intakes of pregnant women in Ghana.</p>
