<p class="p">The practice of using insects for food although may be new to some populations, especially in Western countries, has existed for thousands of years and is currently practiced by over 2 billion people in 113 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Beetles, caterpillars, wasps, bees, crickets, grasshoppers, termites, and locusts are common among the over 2000 species of insects known to be consumed by humans (Van Huis et al.,

In addition to their nutritional benefits, insect production can be advantageous to the environment due to reduced pesticide use and the use of smaller land areas to produce the same quantities of the protein resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and higher efficiency in feed conversion (Oonincx &amp; De Boer,

 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Unfortunately, most of these benefits are largely unknown to the public leading to the marginalization of entomophagy even in countries where insects are part of traditional cuisines.
