<p class="p">Pregnant women in sub‐Saharan Africa are at risk of poor nutritional status and adverse outcomes due to poverty, suboptimal healthcare facilities, and infections. Food insecurity also contributes to the risk of poor nutrition among pregnant women in sub‐Saharan Africa. Studies in Ghana have shown a high prevalence of nutrient deficiencies such as iron, protein, vitamin A, and folate, which is largely due to the unavailability of adequate food sources (Ayensu, Edusei, Oduro, &amp; Larbie,

Documented consequences of maternal protein deficiency include anemia, embryonic losses, intrauterine growth restriction, and reduced postnatal growth. Adequate intake of essential nutrients is therefore necessary for averting undesirable birth outcomes. It would also be important to make the food sources of essential nutrients available in a convenient, cheap, and sustainable manner to enable the populace have easy access to them.
