<p class="p">The nutrient composition of the formulated product compared to 100% wheat flour biscuits was higher. The trend observed was that increasing the percentage of PWLF was directly proportional to an increase in nutrient content. Microbial analysis deemed the formulated product safe for consumption. The formulated product was also accepted according to the sensory evaluation of its sweetness, color, aroma, and texture. This study has shown that it is possible to use palm weevil larvae, orange‚Äêfleshed sweet potato, and wheat composite flour to produce acceptable biscuits of high nutritional value.</p>
