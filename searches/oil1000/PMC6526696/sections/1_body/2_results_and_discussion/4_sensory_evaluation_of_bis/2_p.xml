 <xref rid="fsn31024-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the acceptability of the developed biscuits among 130 pregnant Ghanaian women. It was observed that majority of the pregnant women liked the biscuit very much in terms of the color, sweetness, aroma, and texture and are willing to buy the biscuits if it is sold on the market (Figures

 <xref rid="fsn31024-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the overall acceptability of the biscuits was found to be significantly dependent on the sweetness (

The acceptability was done among pregnant women because the study aimed to develop a product that would be acceptable among them and can be used to supplement their protein and iron intake to reduce the incidence of anemia and severe acute malnutrition. It seemed from the study that the use of palm weevil larvae in biscuit production reduced the stigma associated with edible insect consumption, thus making it easier for pregnant women to accept the product.
