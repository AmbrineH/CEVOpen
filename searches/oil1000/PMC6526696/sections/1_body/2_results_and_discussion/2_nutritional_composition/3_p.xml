<p class="p">The protein content of the biscuits developed in this study is lower than those obtained by Adeboye, Bolaji, and Fatola (

 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) in PWLF‐enriched cookies and wheat burns, respectively. It is important to note, however, that the formulations used by Adeboye et al. (

 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) had an additional source of protein being eggs, but this study did not. The difference in protein content could therefore be attributed to this factor. Again, since the nutrient composition of edible insect is influenced by their feed; another reason for the difference in protein content could be that the protein levels of PWL used in the formulation in this study were generally lower than the ones used by Adeboye et al. (

 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, defatted palm weevil larva (dry basis) has been found to have a protein content of 66.3% (Elemo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). This implies that the protein content of the biscuit developed in this study can be improved by defatting of the larvae used in the production of PWLF. The results of the study indicate that the protein content of the biscuits developed can meet about 16% of the dietary reference intake of protein for pregnant women, which is 71 g, making it a good addition to the diet of pregnant women. The protein quality of food is dependent on its essential amino acid content. An amino acid profile evaluation of palm weevil larvae revealed that it contained isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, histidine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine which are all essential amino acids. Leucine and histidine are known for enhanced growth in infants and young children making the biscuits suitable for infants and young children as well. Also, adding palm weevil larvae flour to wheat flour in snack production would provide the lysine and threonine lacking in the wheat. This could contribute to the reduction of protein‐related malnutrition cases in many developing countries like Ghana where starchy foods are major staples.
