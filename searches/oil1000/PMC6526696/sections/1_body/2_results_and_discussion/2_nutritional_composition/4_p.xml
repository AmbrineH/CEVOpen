<p class="p">The fat, fiber, and energy levels increased as PWLF substitution increased. This does not pose a problem because pregnant women need extra calories to support the development of the growing fetus. Palm weevil larvae are known to contain 65% fat, predominantly composed of saturated fats. Caproic acid and arachidic acid were the most abundant fatty acids in all three formulations, contributing between 43.3% and 50% and 36% and 43.5% of total fatty acids, respectively (Table

The fats were predominantly saturated (92.5% to 95.5%). Several studies have reported a number of health benefits for medium‐chain fatty acids (MCFAs) including caproic acid. It was found that consumption of MCFAs resulted in a reduction in fat deposition through enhancement of thermogenesis in rats (Papamandjaris, MacDougall, &amp; Jones, 1998). Clinical studies in both healthy and obese human subjects found greater fat oxidation and postprandial energy expenditure after consumption of medium‐chain fats (St‐Onge, Peter, &amp; Jones,
