<p class="p">The nutrient composition of the biscuits enriched with PWL and OFSP is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The moisture content of the biscuits ranged from 4.0% to 7.07% decreasing with increasing percentage of PWLF substitution. Biscuits produced from 70% PWLF had the lowest (4.0%) moisture content while the biscuits produced from 100% wheat flour had the highest (7.07%). The shelf life of baked products has direct associations with their moisture content, which is an index of water activity and a measure of stability and susceptibility to microbial contamination. Low moisture content of biscuits between 1% and 5% renders them less perishable, thus suggesting that the biscuits produced from 70% PWLF substitution could be stored for a longer time if packaged and stored in appropriate conditions. The carbohydrate content of the biscuits decreased with an increased proportion of PWLF addition. This was expected as increasing PWLF substitution reduced the amount of wheat flour used. The protein content of the biscuits ranged from 8.01 g to 11.68 g. A progressive increase in the protein content in proportion to the percentage of PWLF added was observed. Previous studies have reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Rhychophorus Phoenicis</italic> is a good source of digestible protein, with a protein content of 25% (dry matter) (Okunowo, Olagboye, Afolabi, &amp; Oyedeji, 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and this perceptibly is the reason for the biscuits with 70% PWLF substitution recording a higher protein content as compared with the 100% wheat flour.
