<p class="p">Mineral analysis was done to test for the content of iron, calcium, and zinc on extracted dry ashed samples using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer according to the AOAC (
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) method. Briefly, 5 g of each sample was weighed into a crucible and ashed overnight in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne/Thermo Scientific) at 550°C. The resulting ash was dissolved in 25 ml of 20% HCl at low temperature on a hot plate. The solution was filtered into a 50‐ml volumetric flask, diluted to the volume with deionized water, and mixed thoroughly. For calcium determination, 2.5 ml of Lanthanum chloride solution (1%, w/v) was added to the analyte. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
