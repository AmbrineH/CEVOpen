 <xref rid="fsn31024-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The palm weevil larvae flour (PWLF) and the orange‐fleshed sweet potato flour (OFSPF) were mixed with wheat flour in three formulations that had 0%, 35%, and 70% of the larvae before being made into biscuits. The preparation was done using the creaming method described by Okaka (

The basic formulations were OFSPF, PWLF, and wheat composite flour, fat (30%), sugar (20%), salt (2%), and baking powder (1%). The sugar and fat were mixed to produce a creamy mixture after which the flour and other dry ingredients were weighed out and added. The mixture was extensively blended to form a hard consistent dough. The dough obtained was kneaded for about 5 min, thinly rolled on a wooden board with a rolling pin until a consistent thickness, and cut out (using a biscuit cutter) to desired shapes of similar sizes. The cutout biscuit dough pieces were then arranged on greased baking trays and placed in an oven to bake at 200°C for 20 min. The biscuits were cooled immediately after baking and packed in polyethylene bag. These were sealed and kept at room temperature until used for chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. The biscuits used as the control were produced using wheat flour (100%) following the same procedure.
