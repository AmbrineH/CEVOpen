 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus species</italic> were isolated and enumerated by spread plate method and grown on salt Mannitol agar (SMA). Serial dilutions of 10
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">‐4 </sup>were prepared by diluting 10 g of sample into 90 ml of sterilized peptone water for stock dilution. One milliliter of aliquots from each of the dilution was inoculated into Petri dishes with already prepared SMA. The inoculum was evenly spread with a sterile bent rod and allowed to dry for 15 min at room temperature. The plates were inverted and incubated at 35 ºC for 24 hr. After incubation, yellow colonies were counted and recorded as 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> counts.
