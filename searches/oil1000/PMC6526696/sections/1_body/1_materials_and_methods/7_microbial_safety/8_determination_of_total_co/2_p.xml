<p class="p">The TCC was carried out by spread plate method on MacConkey agar (MA). Serial dilutions of 10
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">‐6 </sup>were prepared by diluting 10 g of sample into 90 ml of sterilized peptone water for the stock dilution. One milliliter aliquot from each of the dilution was inoculated into Petri dishes with already prepared SMA. The inoculum was evenly spread with a sterile bent rod and allowed to dry for 15 min at room temperature. The plates were inverted and incubated at 35°C for 24 hr.
