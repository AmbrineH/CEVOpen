<p class="p">Spread plate technique was used to inoculate the microorganisms. An inoculum volume of 0.1 ml from each dilution series was pipetted to their respective labeled Petri dishes of plate count agar plates. The glass spreader (hockey stick) was sterilized using ethanol and spread over a Bunsen burner. The solution was spread evenly over the agar plate using the hockey stick while carefully rotating the Petri dishes underneath an angle of 45

Different isolates that grew in the agar were classified based on their morphological characteristics. The morphological parameters considered were the shape/form, color, margin, elevation, and optical characteristics of the isolates (Fung,
