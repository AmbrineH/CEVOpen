<p class="p">Serial dilution was done to reduce a dense culture of cells to a more usable concentration. Each dilution done reduces the concentration by a certain amount. A mass of 5 g of each sample was weighed and placed in 45 ml of peptone water solution. Serial dilution was performed for 10
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>, and 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup>. The serial dilution done for 10
 <sup class="sup">−3 </sup>provided very clear and distinct isolate; hence, it was selected for the subsequent analysis (Fung,
