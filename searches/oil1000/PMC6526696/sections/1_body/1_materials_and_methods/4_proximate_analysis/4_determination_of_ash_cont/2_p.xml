<p class="p">The ash of a foodstuff is the inorganic residue left after the organic residue has been burnt away. In this study, the total ash content of the biscuits was determined by incinerating samples overnight in a muffle furnace according to the AOAC, 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref> method. Briefly, 2 g of each sample was transferred into dry and weighed crucibles. The sample in the crucible was charred for 3 hr in an oven and incinerated overnight in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne/Thermo Scientific) at 550°C. Samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature in a desiccator and weighed afterward. The difference in weight was expressed as the percentage total ash of the biscuit samples.
