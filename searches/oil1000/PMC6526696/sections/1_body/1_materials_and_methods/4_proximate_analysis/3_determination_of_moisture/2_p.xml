<p class="p">The moisture content of the formulated biscuits was determined according to the official methods of analysis (AOAC, 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). Briefly, 2.00 g of each sample was placed into already dried and weighed moisture dishes and dried in an oven (Memmert GmbH) at 105°C for 6 hr, after which the dishes were placed in a desiccator to cool to room temperature, weighed, and placed in the oven and dried overnight till a constant weight was obtained. The moisture content was expressed as a percentage of the average weight loss after drying the sample according to the formula:
