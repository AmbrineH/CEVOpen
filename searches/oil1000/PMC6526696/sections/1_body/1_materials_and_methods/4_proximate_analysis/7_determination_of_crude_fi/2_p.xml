<p class="p">The defatted sample from the crude fat determination was transferred into a 500‐ml round bottom flask, and 200 ml of boiling 1.25% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4 </sub>was added and then connected to a condenser. The sample was boiled for 30 min after which the content of the flask was filtered. The residue was washed with boiling water until it was no longer acid, and boiled again for 30 min with 200 ml 1.25% NaOH, and filtration was repeated until the residue had no base. The residue was transferred to a Gooch crucible and the remaining particles washed into the crucible with 15 ml 10% HCl and filtered. The crucible and its content were weighed and dried overnight at 105°C, cooled in a desiccator, and reweighed. This was then ashed in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne/Thermo Scientific) at 550°C for 3 hr. The crucible was cooled in a desiccator and reweighed. The difference in the weight of crucible and its content before and after ashing was expressed as the percentage crude fiber.
