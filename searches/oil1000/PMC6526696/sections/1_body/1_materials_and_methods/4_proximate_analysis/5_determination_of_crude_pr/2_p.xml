<p class="p">The Kjeldahl method (AOAC, 
 <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) was used for determining the crude protein content of biscuits in this study. Briefly, 1 g each of homogenized sample was weighed and transferred into digestion tubes and 0.5 g of Kjeldahl tabs was added to each sample. After this, 12 ml of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was added and the tubes were agitated to wet the samples. The sample was digested at 420°C for an hour when a clear solution was obtained. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and distilled (FOSS
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Kjeltec
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> 2,200), after which the bluish green distillate was titrated with 0.1 M HCl solution. The acid was added until the first color change was observed. The volume of acid used for titrating each sample and the blank was recorded. The percentage nitrogen was estimated using the formula:
