<p class="p">The Soxhlet extraction method was used for crude fat determination. In the experiment, 2 g of dried samples from moisture determination was transferred into extraction thimbles and covered with balls of cotton wool. The thimble and its content were placed in a Soxhlet extractor and connected to a weighed dry 500‐ml round bottom flask containing 250 ml of petroleum ether. The apparatus was then connected to a quick fit condenser and refluxed for 16 hr 30 min on an electrothermal extraction unit. The flask was removed after extraction was completed and the petroleum ether evaporated on a rotary water bath (Buchi Rotavapor R‐200). After the evaporation, the flask with the fat was heated in an oven for 1 hr at 103°C, cooled in a desiccator, and weighed. The crude fat content was calculated according to the formula below:
