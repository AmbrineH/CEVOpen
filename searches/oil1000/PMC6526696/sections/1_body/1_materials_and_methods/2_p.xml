<p class="p">Three biscuits, of varying palm weevil larvae composition, made with wheat flour were developed based on the current protein dietary reference intake of 71 g/day or 1.1 g/kg body weight/day for pregnant women. It was estimated that pregnant women would obtain at least 70% of their protein needs from household food sources and the palm weevil larvae and orange‐fleshed sweet potato‐enriched biscuits would provide 30% of the remaining needs, whereas the plain wheat biscuits would provide minimal protein. Farmed palm weevil larvae were obtained from the ASPIRE Food Group breeding site, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. The orange‐fleshed sweet potato flour and other ingredients were purchased from a local market in Kumasi, Ghana. All reagents used in the analysis were of analytical grade, obtained from Chemolab Supplies, Malaysia. The experiment was carried out in the Food Processing Laboratory, Department of Food Science and Technology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana, and the Nutrition Laboratory of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia.</p>
