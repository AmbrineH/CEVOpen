<p class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of the biscuit samples were prepared according to the method described by Frank et al. (2006). For each sample, 2 mg of oil was weighed into a 15‐mL capped centrifuge tube, dissolved in 1.5 ml of sodium hydroxide (2M NaOH) in methanol, and heated in a water bath at 100°C for 5 min. After cooling, 12% BF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in methanol was added and the samples were heated again at 100°C for 30 min after 20 ml of hexane was added and stirred. To enhance phase separation, 5 ml of saturated NaCl was added. Supernatants were transferred to a 2 ml autosampler vial and analyzed using gas chromatography (Agilent 6,890, Wilmington, DE, USA). FAME standards were used to determine each type of fatty acid by comparing retention times of fatty acids of analyzed samples with that of reference standards. Results are reported as g fatty acid/100 g of total fatty acids. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
