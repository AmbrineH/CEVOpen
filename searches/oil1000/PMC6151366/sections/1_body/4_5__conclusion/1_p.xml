<p class="p">Result of current study indicated that EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>had strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against skin disease causing microorganisms. Moreover, hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment containing EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini have</italic> superior antimicrobial activity against the majority of tested organism when compared to their respective commercial topical drugs. In addition, the 5% topical formulation of the EO has showed no visible sign of irritation and sensitization. Therefore, EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>and topical formulations prepared from the oil could be recommended as alternative topical product to synthetic topical drugs for the treatment of skin infection with superiority activity, less toxicity, and low risk of emergence of drug resistance due to the presence of complex mixture of chemical constituents believed to have different mechanism of action and targets. However, further studies should be conducted to explore the shelf life, chronic toxicity, and clinical study to evaluate its safety and efficacy on human subject.
