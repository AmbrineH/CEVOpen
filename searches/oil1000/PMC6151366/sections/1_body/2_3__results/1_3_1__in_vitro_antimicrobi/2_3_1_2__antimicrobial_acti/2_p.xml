<p class="p">Antifungal activity of topical formulations containing
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>EO at a concentration of 1%, 1.5%, and 2% in five different formulation bases was displayed in 
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The table represents that hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment had fungal growth inhibitory activity while the rest of the formulation (macrogol cream ointment, simple ointment, and white petrolatum ointment) have no inhibitory effects on the growth of tested skin disease causing fungi. Superior antifungal activity was recorded by hydrophilic ointment at all tested concentration and organisms with the inhibition zone diameter ranging from 21.0±1.7 to greater than 140 mm. Dermatophyte was the most susceptible organisms to the treatment of both hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment containing
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>EO. Complete inhibitions of fungal growth were recorded against clinical and standard strains of
 <italic class="italic"> T. mentagrophytes</italic> at all concentration except 1% against clinical isolates of the organism. Similarly, hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment exhibited inhibition of the entire plate against
 <italic class="italic"> T. rubrum </italic>at a concentration of 1.5% and 2% and against
 <italic class="italic"> T. verrucosum</italic> exposed to hydrophilic ointment containing 1.5% or 2% EOs and to macrogol blend ointment containing 2% EO.
