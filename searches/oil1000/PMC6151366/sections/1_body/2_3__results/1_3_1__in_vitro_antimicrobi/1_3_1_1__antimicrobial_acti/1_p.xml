 <italic class="italic">(1) Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations.</italic>
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> showed the minimum inhibitory concentration of the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>against skin disease causing bacterial and fungal strains of standard and clinical isolates. The oil has superior biological activity against fungal pathogens compared to bacteria. In bacterial pathogens the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>have showed potentially highest inhibitory activity against the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus pyogenes </italic>with MIC of 2.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml.
 <italic class="italic"> Trichophyton </italic>species were the most susceptible pathogens in fungal category, with the MIC value of 0.65 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml. Standard strains of all bacterial strains are susceptible to the challenge of EOs, as compared to clinical isolates except for
 <italic class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus </italic>where both clinical and standard stains are susceptible to the same MIC value of 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml. Higher MIC of oil was recorded against clinical isolates compared to the standard strains of
 <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>. Similarly, among the tested fungal pathogen, less susceptibility was recorded by both clinical and standard strains of
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus niger</italic> with MIC value of 2.5
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml.
