<p class="p">The EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> displayed significantly high inhibitory activity against all tested skin diseases causing fungi with inhibition zone ranging from 10.5 ± 0.0 to greater than 90 mm (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Strong inhibition was recorded against all dermatophytes (
 <italic class="italic">M. canis</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> T. verrucosum) </italic>at all tested concentrations followed by standard strains of mold,
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus niger,</italic> with the inhibition diameter of 70 mm at a concentration of 4%
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO and yeast,
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic>. Absolute inhibitions of growth of fungi were recorded against
 <italic class="italic"> T. mentagrophytes </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> T. rubrum</italic> at concentrations of 1%, 2%, and 4%
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO and against clinical isolates of both
