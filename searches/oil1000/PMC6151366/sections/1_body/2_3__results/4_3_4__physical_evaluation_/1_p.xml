The result showed that the formulations had good appearance, all the formulations are homogenous, and they all are stable to creaming and coalescence test and centrifugation test. Formulation of C.
 <italic class="italic"> martini</italic> oil in hydrophilic ointment base, macrogol ointment base, and white petrolatum base has shown stability in thermal cycle test and in freezing and thawing test. No weight loss was recorded in all formulations. Hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment formulations showed good release with pH value of 5.8 and 6.2 and spreadability values of 14.7 and 10.5, respectively. In many of the test parameters both hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment have better characteristics.
