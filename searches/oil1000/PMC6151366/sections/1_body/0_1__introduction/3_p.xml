<p class="p">The management of skin infections requires treatment by oral and/topical antimicrobial formulations [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]; however, there has been negative treatment outcomes due to abundant harmful effects associated with synthetic antimicrobials and due to the emergence of resistance in common skin pathogens such as
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus </italic>resulting as methicillin-resistant
 <italic class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(MRSA),
 <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and other such strains [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Treatment has therefore become a challenge and is often not successful [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. There was a report of infections that are unresponsive to all known antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This threat has become so severe that simple ulcers now require treatment with systemic antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] and simple cut on the finger could result in death by infection [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that common infections may be left without a cure as we are headed for a future without antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Therefore, one of the candidates available to use is the oldest form of medicine, natural product for the treatment of skin disorder [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Essential oil (EO) with its complex chemical constituents can be the best source to develop novel topical antimicrobial formulation with different mode of action.
