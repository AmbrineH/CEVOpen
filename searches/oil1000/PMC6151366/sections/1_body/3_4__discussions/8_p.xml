<p class="p">Our result has shown significantly higher efficacy of topical formulations (hydrophilic ointment and macrogol blend ointment) containing
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EOs than the used commercial topical antimicrobial drugs (1% gentamicin cream for bacteria and 2% miconazole cream for fungi) at a concentration greater than 1% of preparation against almost all test organism used in the study. The efficacy can be attributed to the presence antimicrobial active major constituent geraniol and the presence of various bioactive constituents in the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic>, which would have imposed additive toxic effect towards the skin disease causing microorganism. Moreover, the small molecular weight of chemical constituents in the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO may have resulted in easy diffusion of the molecule in agar, as light compounds diffuse larger than heavy compound. Various previous studies have reported that a bioactive principle with light molecular weight diffuses easily in agar medium than constituents with heavy molecular weight [
