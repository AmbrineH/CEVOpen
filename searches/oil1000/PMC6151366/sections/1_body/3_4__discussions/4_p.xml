<p class="p">The findings from agar well diffusion techniques have shown that the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> have strong antibacterial property at all tested concentrations in dose-dependent manner. Previous study has shown similar results, upon the increment of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO concentration and increased inhibition of the growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, indicating dose-dependent response [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This strong potency of the oil can be attributed to the presence of large group of components, allowing the oil to have diversity of mechanism of action and targets [

Previous studies have linked the mechanism of action of EO to its lipophilic nature resulting in increased cell permeability and leakage of cell constituents which can result in different alteration to bacterial cell through cell wall and membrane disturbance, ATP losses, inhibition of protein synthesis, pH disturbance, intracytoplasmic changes, DNA damage, and inhibition of cell-cell communication (quorum sensing) [
