<p class="p">Higher inhibitions were recorded against gram positive bacteria, particularly
 <italic class="italic"> S. pyogenes </italic>at all tested concentrations compared to gram negatives especially
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. This may be attributed to the presence of additional outer membrane acting as an effective barrier for amphipathic agent [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and overexpression of efflux pumps responsible for innate antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Similar findings were reported by previous study indicating that gram positive bacteria are more susceptible to
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO than gram negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>].
