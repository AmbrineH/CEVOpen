 <italic class="italic"> C. martini </italic>was found stable to the exposure of high temperatures. This may be attributed to the thermodynamic stability of bioactive components present in the EO and also partly due to temperature used during hydrodistillation to bear the EO from the start. It has been shown in several reports that the antimicrobial activities of EO were stable in contrast to varying chemical composition to the exposure of different temperature [
