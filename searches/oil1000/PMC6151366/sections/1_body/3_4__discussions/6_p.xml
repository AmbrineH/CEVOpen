<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> EO had showed strong dose-dependent broad-spectrum antifungal activity against
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> A. niger,</italic> and dermatophytes. Complete inhibitions were recorded at a concentration of 4% against all dermatophytes and at a concentration of above 1% against
 <italic class="italic"> T. mentagrophytes </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> T. rubrum</italic>. The strong antifungal activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. martini</italic> to different group of fungi could be due to the constituents of EO, which may have exerted their efficacy towards the fungal pathogen individually or in a synergetic manner [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Moreover, these constituents would be responsible for multitarget action on fungal cell, which would have led to the permanent damage of the fungal cell [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In addition, several works have reported the antifungal, particularly antidermatophyte activity of geraniol, the major constituent of
