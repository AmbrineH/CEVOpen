 <italic class="italic">(3) Antimicrobial Activity of Topical Formulations.</italic> Release antimicrobial activities of topical agents were performed using the method adopted in our laboratory [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Fifteen milliliters of molten and cooled molten and cooled (45°C) Muller-Hinton agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (for fungi) was added to sterile Petri dish and allowed to solidify. After solidification, one hole with 10 mm diameter was made by cutting out a plug of agar from the center of each plate using sterile cork-borer. About 0.1 ml (0.2 g) of designated topical formulations was added to each well. A volume of 0.2 ml suspension of overnight microbial having standard turbidity of the respective fungus and bacteria was added to a test tube containing 7 ml of respective molten agar. The agar suspensions of organisms were thoroughly mixed by vortex mixer and poured into a plate containing topical formulation to make an agar overlay. After the plate was solidified for 2-3 minutes, it was inverted and allowed to stand for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated at 25°C for 7 days (for fungi) and 37°C for 24 h (for bacteria). After incubation the diameter of zones of inhibition was measured.
