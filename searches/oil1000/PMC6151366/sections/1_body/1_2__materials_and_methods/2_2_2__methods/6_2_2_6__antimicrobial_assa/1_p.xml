 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Twofold serial dilutions of EO solution in Muller-Hinton agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (for fungi) have a final concentration of EO ranging from 0.25% (v/v) to 4% (v/v). The assays were performed in triplicate. Control plates, containing no EOs, were run simultaneously. The agar surface of the plates containing the dilution of EOs and the control plate were inoculated by standard inoculum (having optical density of 0.08 -01 at 625 nm wavelength) of overnight (bacteria and yeast) and five-day (mold and dermatophyte) grown cultures. The plates were incubated at 25°C for seven days (for fungi) and 37°C for 24 h (for bacteria). After incubation, the end-points for the EO were determined by placing plates on a dark background and observing the lowest concentration that inhibits visible growth, which is recorded as the MIC.
