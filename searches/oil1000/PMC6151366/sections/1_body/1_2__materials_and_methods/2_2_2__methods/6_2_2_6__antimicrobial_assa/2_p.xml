 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. (1) Agar well diffusion for EO: A volume of 0.2 ml suspension of overnight microbial having standard turbidity of the respective fungus and bacteria was added to a test tube containing 20 ml of molten and cooled (45°C) Muller-Hinton agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (for fungi). The agar suspension of organisms was thoroughly mixed by vortex mixer and poured onto the respective sterile Petri dish and allowed to solidify. After solidification, one hole with 10 mm diameter was made by cutting out a plug of agar from the center of each plate using sterile cork-borer. About 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of EO solutions was transferred to the prepared well. The plates were allowed to stand for 2 hours at room temperature in order to allow diffusion and incubated at 37°C for 24 h (for bacteria) and 25°C for 7 days (for fungi)). After incubation, the diameter of zones of inhibition was measured.
