 <italic class="italic">(7) Spreadability.</italic> The spreadability was determined by applying weight to glass slides into which formulation placed, and time in seconds required to separate the slides was noted [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The spreadability was calculated by using the formula, S = M.L/T (1), where, S is spreadability, M is weight tide to upper slide, L is length of glass slide, and T is time taken to separate the slide completely from each other.
