 <italic class="italic">(1) Organoleptic Examination.</italic> The prepared formulations were inspected visually for their physical appearance, color, texture, phase separation, and homogeneity. Except for homogeneity and texture, all the characteristics were inspected visually; however, the homogeneity and texture were tested by pressing small quantity of the formulated product between thumb and index finger. The consistency of the formulation and presence of coarse particles were used to evaluate the texture and homogeneity of the formulation.
