<p class="p">In this paper, there are several conclusions obtained based on the results provided by X-ray diffraction and SEM with EBSD techniques in order to investigate the microstructure evolution of the reverted austenite and tempered martensite in the present work. The following conclusions can be drawn according to the research in this paper:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">

   <p class="p">The microstructure mainly consists of tempered martensite and reverted austenite in the supermartensitic stainless steel. The amount of reverted austenite at room temperature increases and the micro-hardness correspondingly decreases during tempering at 620 °C for 1 h to 32 h. The results suggest that the contents of reverted austenite have an effect on the mechanical properties;</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The reverted austenite nucleates uniformly and transforms at sub-block boundaries and prior grain austenite boundaries. As the tempering time increases, the low angle grain boundaries decrease and the dislocation density also exhibits a dramatic decline compared to the martensite matrix of tempering at 620 °C for 2 h to 32 h. The orientation relationship between reverted austenite and martensite is (111)γ//(011)α and [1

   <p class="p">The transformation mechanism of martensite to reverted austenite is formed by a diffusional process. Considering the chemical composition of nickel contents, it is concluded that the reverted austenite is formed by nickel diffusion during the tempering process. It revealed that the growth kinetics of the reverted austenite are dominated by the diffusion of Ni contents and there is no shear of the martensite matrix in situ observation by HTLSCM.</p>
