<p class="p">Supermartensitic stainless steel was obtained by a commercial Super 13Cr and its composition is given in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-00589-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The materials were hot rolled, followed by heat treatment and then air cooling to room temperature. The samples from a commercial 13Cr supermartensitic stainless steel were subjected to quenching at 1050 °C for 30 min in a resistance furnace, followed by tempering at 620 °C for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 32 h by air cooling to ambient temperature. To better characterize the formation of reversed austenite during the α→γ transformation, austenite nucleation and growth characteristics from martensite were observed in situ by a high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscope (HTLSCM) (YONEKURA MFG CO., LTD, Osaka, Japan). The microstructure during the heating and holding process was observed and stored as a video file by a high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscope (HTLSCM), which is a rather new technique for the in situ analysis of high temperature phase transformation and microstructure evolution [

 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The specimens were machined to round bars of 8 mm diameter × 3 mm thickness and the samples were oil quenched at 1050 °C for 30 min. One side of the disc specimen was mechanically polished for observation before being mounted in a high purity alumina crucible. The specimen was heated to 620 °C at the rate of 5 °C/s and held at this temperature for 60 min. Heating, holding, and observation of the α→γ transformation under HTLSCM were carried out in a vacuum of about 1.33 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> Pa. Microstructure development during the heating and tempering holding process was then observed and stored as a video file.
