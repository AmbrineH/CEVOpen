<p class="p">The specimens was etched by Vilella’s etchant, which contained 5 mL hydrochloric + 4 g picric acid +100 mL ethyl alcohol. Microstructural characterization was determined by optical microscopy (CarlZeiss, Jena, Germany) and JEOL6490 scanning electron microscopy (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The crystallographic orientation relationship between reverted austenite and martensite matrix was characterized by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) (Oxford, London, UK). The EBSD specimens were polished with a 3 μm diamond suspension for 60 min and a 1μm diamond suspension for 60 min. Finally, the colloidal silica solution slightly etched the sample during the mechanical polishing process to remove relief. Ideally, the samples should be polished for 10 min to several hours with colloidal silica. The EBSD maps of tempering samples were obtained using a high resolution microscope FEI-Nano 430 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operated at 20 kV and with a 200 nm step size.</p>
