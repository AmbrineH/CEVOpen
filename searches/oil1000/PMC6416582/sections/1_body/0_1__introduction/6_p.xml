<p class="p">In the present work, more precise study on the reversed austenite formation during tempering has been done using the electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) technique. The effects of different tempering times on the reversed austenite formation are still unclear. It has been used to investigate the phase transformation distribution and examine the crystallographic orientation between reverted austenite and martensite with a large area covering prior austenite grain in SMSS. Additionally, the work was pursued to find the transformation mechanism of reverted austenite using a high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscope (HTLSCM) and the factors that influence the amount of the reverted austenite and mechanical properties.</p>
