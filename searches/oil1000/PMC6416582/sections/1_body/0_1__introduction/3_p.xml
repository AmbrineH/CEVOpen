<p class="p">The microstructure is tempered martensite and reverted austenite produced by the quenching and tempering of supermartensitic stainless steel. The nanometer scale of reverted austenite is fine and dispersed in the tempered martensite matrix. The tempered martensite structure has been shown to supply a superior strength and excellent low temperature toughness owing to the reverted austenite [

 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The existence of the reverted austenite improves the excellent mechanical properties, especially ductility for the steel, and the amount and morphology of reverted austenite was controlled by tempering temperature and time [
