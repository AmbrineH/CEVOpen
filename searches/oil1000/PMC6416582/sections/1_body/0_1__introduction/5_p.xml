<p class="p">The formation mechanism that transforms the martensite to the reverted austenite has been discussed for supermartensitic stainless steel in the literature [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which has presented the diffusion mechanism and diffusionless shear mechanism. Previous research has proven that Ni is enriched in the reverted austenite and affects its stability [

 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], and the growth of the reverted austenite is the diffusion process of the Ni element. The tempering temperature was the main factor affecting the reverted austenite formation of SMSS. The transformation mechanism is still ambiguous and the research methods used are practically insufficient. This is because that crystallographic information is relatively microscopic and is only on a scale of one single austenite grain obtained by TEM.
