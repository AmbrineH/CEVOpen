<p class="p">Tempering processes are mandatory for supermartensitic stainless steel in order to achieve the desired microstructure. However, the amount, morphology, and distribution of reverted austenite are very sensitive to the tempering temperature and tempering time. Therefore, it is essential to study the microstructural characteristics, volume fraction, and formation mechanism of the reverted austenite in SMSS [

 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. There are several factors that affect the stabilization of the reverted austenite in steel. The nickel and carbon elements are partitioned into the austenite and stabilize it to ambient temperature [
