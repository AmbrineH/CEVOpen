<p class="p">The orientation angles distribution in the martensite structure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>e,f. The large angle boundaries with misorientation larger than 15° are depicted as thick blue lines. Generally speaking, the prior austenite grain boundary orientation angle is greater than 15° [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The low angle sub block boundaries in martensite were marked by green lines with misorientations in the range of 5° to 15°, whereas red lines mark small angle grain boundaries with misorientations that range from 2 to 5°. All the laths of martensite have crystallographic and morphological features with the misorientation range of 0~60° in low carbon steel and the angle of the martensite sub-block is about 10° [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. It was found that the low angle martensite sub block boundaries are significantly reduced and the small angle grain boundaries are also decreased in the tempered microstructure. Meanwhile, the internal stress of the microstructure is released and the defect density is decreased. Finally, the prior austenite grains grow coarse after a long period of tempering and the microstructure tends to be homogenized.
