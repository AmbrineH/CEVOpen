<p class="p">The micrographs of phase distribution show that the reverted austenite phase is red colored and the martensite phase is green colored. It is obvious that the plated reverted austenite primarily located in the region of lath martensite, and some are distributed in the prior austenite grain boundaries. It can be seen that the reverted austenite content of tempering time for 32 h is much greater than tempering for 2 h. It can be regarded that the reverted austenite phases, as a plate-like shape or a globular morphology, distribute in the martensitic lath boundaries and prior austenite grain boundaries, and are sometimes concentrated in the phase interface [
