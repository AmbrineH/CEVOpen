An identical orientation K–S relationship is seen for the martensite matrix and reverted austenite: plane (111)γ//(011)α and direction [1

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a, the blue color represents the ideal K-S relationship angle that is more than zero degrees, and the green color is the deviation angle greater than 10 degrees. It is shown that the martensite phases colored white have good interface distribution characteristics with red reverted austenite phases. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b, it can be conspicuously seen that martensite and reverted austenite satisfy the K-S orientation, and the deviation angle is mainly concentrated at about 2 degrees. According to Grajcar et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], it is estimated that a fraction of grain boundaries fulfilling the K-S relationship within 10 degrees of the deviation angle is approximately 98.4%. It is verified that the result on the K-S orientation relationship obtained by EBSD has universal applicability by TEM technology. The analysis results are also consistent with the theoretical calculations in the literature [
