<p class="p">The microstructure of the samples tempered at 620 Â°C for 2 h and 32 h and characterized by EBSD is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The color represents the crystallographic orientation in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,b. It can be seen that there are multiple martensite crystallographic orientations within the prior austenite grains. The martensite structure consists of packets and blocks of different colors and orientations.
