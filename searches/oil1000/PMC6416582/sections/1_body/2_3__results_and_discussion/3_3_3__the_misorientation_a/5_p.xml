<p class="p">The orientation distribution of reverted austenite was investigated by a pole map in order to discuss orientation analysis. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, there are (100), (110), and (111) pole figures showing orientations of the reverted austenite corresponding to the EBSD orientation map, respectively. The reverted austenites with different colors have the same orientation as the surrounding martensite, and satisfy the K-S orientation distribution characteristic. The different colors of reverted austenites indicate that there are different close packed planes and close packed directions [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. It considers that the nucleation position and growing mechanism of the other color reversed austenite are different from the reverted austenite [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Therefore, we showed that the growing mechanism of this kind of reverted austenite is a diffused phase transformation, and the growth of the reverted austenites is closely related to the diffusion process of Ni.
