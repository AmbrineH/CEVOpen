<p class="p">The multiphase microstructure of samples tempered at 620 °C for different times is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. There is low carbon tempered martensite and reverted austenite in the microstructure of supermartensitic stainless steel. It can be seen that the martensite exhibiting lath morphology and reverted austenite formed at the laths in the micrographs. It seems that the reversed austenite was transformed at α phase lath boundaries and inside the laths. When the tempering time is increased from 1 h to 32 h, the martensite lath width gradually becomes narrowed and the reverted austenite content increases remarkably. As the tempering time increases, the inter-granular dislocation density of lath tempered martensite decreases and the martensite is decomposed; meanwhile, the internal stress of the microstructure is gradually released, since the reverted austenite is arranged like platelets among martensite laths [

 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In previous research [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], the carbon element was preferentially positioned in the reverted austenite, it was not precipitated in alloy carbides in the matrix during tempering, and the martensite was kept in the shape of laths. Subsequently, a coalescence of the reverted austenite appeared.
