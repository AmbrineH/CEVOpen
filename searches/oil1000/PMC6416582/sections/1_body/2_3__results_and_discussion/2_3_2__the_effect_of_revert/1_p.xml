<p class="p">The reverted austenite content determines the properties of the supermartensitic stainless steel [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Therefore, it is critical to precisely measure the reverted austenite contents after different tempering processes of supermartensitic stainless steel. It is guaranteed that the reverted austenite is transformed from martensite in the tempering process, rather than being retained as austenite in the quenched sample. The XRD pattern of supermartensitic stainless steel after quenching and then tempering at 620 °C for different tempered times is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The XRD pattern figure indicated that there are only the α-Fe and γ-Fe phases in the samples of different tempering times. However, there are no γ-Fe phase peaks in the quenched sample, which reveals that the content of the retained austenite is close to zero. This means that there is no retained austenite after quenching at 1050 °C. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the black squares represent martensite and the white squares represent reverted austenite, and no texture exists in the samples. However, the intensity of the (111) crystal plane varies greatly. This represents that reverted austenite contents are different in the supermartensitic stainless steel for different tempering times.
