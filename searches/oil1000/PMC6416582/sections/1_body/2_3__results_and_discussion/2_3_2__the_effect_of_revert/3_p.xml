 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> represents the variation in micro-hardness and the contents of reverted austenite tempered at 620 °C for different tempering times. It manifested that the average hardness gradually decreases from 290 HV to 275 HV as the tempering time increases. There is a remarkable decrease in the hardness with the increasing tempering time, which is marked on the black dot line. However, the amounts of reverted austenite marked on the blue dot line had an opposite tendency with the tempering time. It was anticipated that the value must be the maximum amount of austenite and the hardness reaches the minimum value when the specimens were tempered at 620 °C for 32 h in the steel. It is quite obvious that the amount of reversed austenite gradually increases with tempering time. The trend in the hardness decreased, which can be attributed to the amount of reverted austenite. Additionally, the average grain size became coarser with an increasing tempering time. The amounts of reverted austenite are dependent on grain size, along with chemical elements enrichment. The C and Ni elements are steadily partitioned into austenite with increasing tempering time, thus resulting in a higher volume fraction of reverted austenite. is the results also indicated that the hardness decreases with an increasing tempering time [
