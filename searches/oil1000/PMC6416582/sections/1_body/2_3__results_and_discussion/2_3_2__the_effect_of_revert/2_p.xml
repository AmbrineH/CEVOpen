<p class="p">The XRD pattern indicated that the volume fractions of reverted austenite are different in samples as the tempering time increased from 1 h to 32 h. According to the Equations (1) and (2), the results revealed that the abundance of reverted austenite phase was 8.7%, 12.5%, 13.2%, 20.4%, 22.9%, and 27.3%, respectively. The amounts of reverted austenite show a significant upward trend according to the results of the XRD pattern of the supermartensitic stainless steel for different tempering times. It was found that the reverted austenite content increased gradually when the tempering time increased from 1 h to 32 h, as shown in

 <xref rid="B39-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The austenization stability elements of partitioning C and Ni are enhanced as the tempering time increases. The result of the concentration of C and Ni elements is that the Ms point is lowered and the stability of the reverted austenite is increased, leading to an increasing amount of reverted austenite [
