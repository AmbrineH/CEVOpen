<p class="p">The reverted austenite as a soft phase after tempering does not retain the high density dislocation structure [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. As the tempering time increases, the concentration of the quenching vacancies becomes lower in the microstructure, reducing the strength and hardness. The result reveals the strong dependence of mechanical properties on the tempering processes.
