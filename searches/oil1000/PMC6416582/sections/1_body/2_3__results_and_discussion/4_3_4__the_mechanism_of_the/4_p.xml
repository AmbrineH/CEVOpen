 <xref rid="B42-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The stability of reverted austenite depends on the Ni contents concentration of the reversed austenite. At a shorter holding time, Ni atoms are enriched in the reverted austenite, which increases the stability of reverted austenite and increases the volume fraction of reverted austenite. Therefore, the diffusion and redistribution of Ni between reverted austenite and the matrix are responsible for the reverted austenite transformation and growth [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The reverted austenite that showed a plate-like shape acts as the core of nucleation and reverted austenite formation is accompanied by the Ni diffusion process. It is revealed that the growth kinetics of the reverted austenite are dominated by the diffusion of Ni in the austenite and martensite phases, particularly in the austenite phase due to its relatively higher diffusion contents [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Martensitic shear reversion is characterized by a rapid change that only depends on the temperature change, but not on the time. It was known that the transformation thermodynamics are the temperature gradient, as is the fact that austenite formation is diffusion driven. The tempering time was focused on the influence it had on the reverted austenite above the As point tempering in the steel. Therefore, the mechanism through which the reverted austenite transformed from martensite is a diffusion mechanism.
