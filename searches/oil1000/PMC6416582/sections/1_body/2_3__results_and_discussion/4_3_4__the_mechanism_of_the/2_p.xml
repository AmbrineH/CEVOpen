The tempered martensite matrix is a light gray area and the reverted austenite is represented by a white color with a strip or plate shape. The line scan results of EDX show that the Ni element contents appear as unevenness trends in the curve, indicating that the Ni distribution is different in the two structures. At the same time, the nickel content of the reverted austenite appears to be a peak value, but the matrix around the reverted austenite appears as a trough. It was obviously manifested that the content of Ni in the reverted austenite is higher than the matrix-tempered martensite. Considering the chemical composition of nickel contents, we may conclude that the reverted austenite is formed by a diffusional process of the alloying elements, particularly nickel, during the tempering process.
