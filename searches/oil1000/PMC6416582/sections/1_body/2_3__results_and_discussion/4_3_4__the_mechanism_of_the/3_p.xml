 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00589-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows a series of images of the reverted austenite transformation in situ observation of the 13Cr supermartensitic stainless steel tempering at 620 °C for 0~60 min. There is no obvious change in the microstructure from martensite to reverted austenite and the volume change was not observed to be associated with the transformation of acicular austenite [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. It is indirectly manifested that the martensite conspicuously transformed to reverted austenite is a diffusion mechanism. Firstly, the volume shrinkage during martensite transformation to reverted austenite is slow in the tempering heating and holding processes. Secondly, the reason for this is that the surface relief is different from martensite transformation and there is no high-density dislocation. Therefore, it is considered that the formation of the reverted austenite should be generated by the nucleation growth method related to diffusion [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], not the diffusionless shear mechanism. The result of the reverted austenite transformation mechanism in our study is consistent with Lee’s research [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It is possible that Ni and C austenite stabilization elements gradually diffused to the reverted austenite at the temperatures for a long time. In the previous research work [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-00589" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], carbon elements were preferentially positioned in the reverted austenite and alloy carbides failed to precipitate in the martensite during tempering, which meant that the martensite was unable to decompose. Subsequently, coalescence of the reverted austenite appeared.
