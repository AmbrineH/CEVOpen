<p class="p">Many isolated bacteria possess the ability to mineralize chemically simple petroleum hydrocarbons completely, such as linear alkanes, as long as these bacteria possess all of the enzymes for the targeted substrate (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Margesin et al., 2013</xref>). However, few bacteria can completely mineralize complex compounds such as resins and asphaltenes because of the lack of some enzymes (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani, 2017</xref>). The advantages of microbial communities are presented because there are a variety of catabolic genes in a bacterial consortium, and the synergistic effects of these genes are beneficial to achieving the purification of pollutants (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gurav et al., 2017</xref>). A bacterial consortium composed of five culturable bacteria has been constructed by 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wanapaisan et al. (2018)</xref>. Researchers found that these five bacteria showed synergistic pyrene degradation due to the following aspects: (1) The 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> strain enhanced the bioavailability of the pyrene by producing biosurfactant, (2) two 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium</italic> strains contributed to the initiation of pyrene degradation, and (3) 
 <italic class="italic">Novosphingobium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ochrobactrum</italic> efficiently degraded the intermediates of pyrene. Given the complexity of the petroleum components, construction of the minimal functional bacterial consortium or genetic engineering bacteria for bioremediation of petroleum oil has become a trend in this field (
