<p class="p">The ability to biodegrade petroleum oil is associated with the concentration and composition of hydrocarbons. Extremely high levels of petroleum hydrocarbons strongly inhibit bacterial growth, resulting in poor biodegradation efficiency and even death of the bacteria (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). As reported by 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani (2017)</xref>, the order of biodegradability of hydrocarbons is as follows: linear alkanes &gt; branched alkanes &gt; low molecular weight alkyl aromatics &gt; monoaromatics &gt; cyclic alkanes &gt; polyaromatics &gt; asphaltenes. This is related to the physico-chemical properties of the substrate and its bioavailability, which affect the contact, transport and transformation of bacteria to hydrocarbon substrates (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani and Upasani, 2016</xref>). The vast majority of indoor studies are focused on the degradation of a single substrate, but in nature the components of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants are extremely complex. Accordingly, it is difficult to reproduce laboratory results in practical applications. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic> F1 can efficiently mineralize benzene, toluene and phenol. While in the substrate mixtures, toluene and benzene enhance the biodegradation of phenol; however, phenol inhibits the biodegradation of benzene and toluene (
