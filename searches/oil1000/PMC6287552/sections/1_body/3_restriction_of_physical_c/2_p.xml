<p class="p">Bacterial surface properties are essential to the effective biodegradation of hydrophobic hydrocarbon substrates (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>) and their adhesion mechanisms are of great importance (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ron and Rosenberg (2014)</xref> found that adherence of hydrophobic pollutants to bacterial cells is mainly related to hydrophobic fimbriae, fibrils, outer-membrane proteins and lipids, as well as certain small molecules present in cell surfaces such as gramicidin S and prodigiosin. Fimbriae present on bacterial surfaces were confirmed to be necessary for the growth of

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rosenberg and Rosenberg, 1985</xref>). Nevertheless, bacterial capsules and several anionic exopolysaccharides produce inhibitory effects on hydrocarbon substrate adhesion. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> decreases cell surface hydrophobicity in response to exposure to organic solvents and has little affinity for toxic organic compounds (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Torres et al., 2011</xref>). Although bacterial adherence can enhance the biodegradation of hydrophobic hydrocarbons, it is not necessary to attach bacterial cells to targeted substrates (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abbasnezhad et al., 2011</xref>). This is because, in some instances, bacteria with high surface hydrophobicity are easily aggregated and form biofilms, thereby producing potential risks such as diseases (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Doyle, 2000</xref>). Indeed, not only hydrophobic bacteria can biodegrade hydrophobic pollutants; several solvent-resistant hydrophilic bacteria are also capable of metabolizing such pollutants (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heipieper et al., 2007</xref>), which may be because of the modification of lipopolysaccharides or porines of the outer membrane of the bacterial surface (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krasowska and Sigler, 2014</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Megharaj et al. (2011)</xref> also reported that the solvent-resistant bacteria were first to colonize and dominate for the removal of pollutants. Therefore, the use of hydrophilic microorganisms to treat hydrocarbon pollutants seems to be more advantageous than hydrophobic microorganisms (
