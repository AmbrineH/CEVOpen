<p class="p">The core element of bioremediation is functional microorganisms that need sufficient nutrients and suitable environmental conditions. In general, petroleum oil hydrocarbons are not necessary substrates for hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and they utilize these compounds as alternative carbon and energy sources, especially in the absence of their preferable substrates. The function of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria mainly depends on their hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes, the expression and activity of which are closely related to the physiological activity of bacteria (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Sufficient time is needed to synthesize hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes because of the requirements of bacterial growth and synthetic metabolism. Although some bacteria have been reported to mineralize petroleum hydrocarbons completely within several days, or even less than 1 day under culture conditions, the degradation efficiency of these bacteria makes it difficult to meet the expected effects in practical usage (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The complex combination of various biological and abiotic factors limits the function of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in many ways (

 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang Y. et al., 2018</xref>). The degradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbon in the actual environment is the result of these factors acting on the petroleum hydrocarbon-degradation bacteria, which has led to most microbial remediation technologies taking a long time, especially when compared to physico-chemical remediation techniques. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fida et al. (2017)</xref> found that the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged variant of 
 <italic class="italic">Novosphingobium</italic> sp. strain LH128 showed a dramatic decrease in colony forming units (CFU) within 4 h and entered a viable but nonculturable (VBNC)-like state upon inoculation into phenanthrene spiked soil based on physiological and transcriptome analysis, which could be related to the response to environmental stimuli in the soil by expression of stress protective mechanisms. This disadvantage makes it almost impossible to do anything when dealing with emergency pollution incidents because bioremediation will not remove contaminants as soon as the contamination occurs, but rather requires sufficient time to be achieved. In addition, there is no time to screen for indigenous bacteria or flora in contaminated accident zones, and the application of exogenous bacteria requires scientific assessment, government approval, etc., all of which will consume time (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ivshina et al., 2015</xref>). However, microbial remediation technology plays an irreplaceable role in ecological security when dealing with petroleum hydrocarbon-polluted environments due to its low cost, positive effect, little environmental influence and lack of secondary pollution (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dvořák et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, petroleum hydrocarbons are completely mineralized into carbon dioxide and water under the action of various microbes, although bioremediation is time-consuming. Hence, to effectively reduce the microbial remediation period and improve the remediation rate, using a combination of microbial remediation technology and other technologies such as electrokinetic remediation technology (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ma et al., 2018</xref>), photocatalytic remediation technology (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), nanotechnology (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alabresm et al., 2018</xref>) and bioreactor technology (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Safdari et al., 2018</xref>) is an effective strategy to accelerate the removal of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants.
