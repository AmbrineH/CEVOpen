<p class="p">Many environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients, electron acceptors and substrates play vital roles in bioremediation and influence biodegradation reactions (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani and Upasani, 2017</xref>). This is why most researchers have found that many petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria can achieve excellent results during degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons under laboratory conditions yet exhibit dissatisfactory results in field-scale tests (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Head et al., 2006</xref>). The bacterial strains 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> sp. JLS1 and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> JLC1, isolated from Momoge wetlands in Jilin Province, China, showed different sensitivity to temperature during the biodegradation process of C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub> alkane, suggesting that temperature strongly affected biodegradation efficiency (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In a laboratory study, the petroleum hydrocarbons phenanthrene and dibenzothiophenes were well degraded, but similar degradation effects did not occur in a field experiment, which could be attributed to the temperature range during the study (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Röling et al., 2002</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Indeed, temperature can affect bacterial growth and metabolism, the soil matrix and the mode of occurrence of pollutants, thereby indirectly affecting biodegradation efficiency (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abed et al., 2015</xref>). It is well known that the growth of bacteria requires sufficient carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and various trace elements. However, the main components of petroleum hydrocarbons are only carbon and hydrogen, therefore the environment must have enough other nutrient elements to ensure growth of bacterial degraders. It is estimated that approximately 150 g of nitrogen and 30 g of phosphorous are consumed to convert 1 kg of hydrocarbons in bacterial cells (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ron and Rosenberg, 2014</xref>). Extensive laboratory and field studies have been devoted to solving this problem. The addition of fertilizers containing bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus has been successfully applied to stimulate petroleum oil biodegradation on a number of different shorelines and sandy beaches (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hazen et al., 2016</xref>). Soluble and non-soluble nutrients suffer from problems in the actual remediation, leading to low bioremediation efficiencies (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ron and Rosenberg, 2014</xref>). Researchers have found that using nitrogen-fixing hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to improve the bioremediation efficiency was another good strategy instead of providing nitrogen sources (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thavasi et al., 2006</xref>). For aerobic degradation processes, using oxygen as an electron acceptor is quite important, but it is usually not adequate in petroleum oil-contaminated environments because of the limited air permeability. 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gogoi et al. (2003)</xref> reported that up to 75% of the hydrocarbon contaminants were degraded within 1 year in field tests by controlling and regulating aeration. However, providing a sufficient oxygen supply to stimulate the bioremediation of petroleum pollutants in the environment is rather expensive and not feasible. Hence, the application of bulking agents such as saw dust into the soil to increase permeability or other electron acceptors (NO
