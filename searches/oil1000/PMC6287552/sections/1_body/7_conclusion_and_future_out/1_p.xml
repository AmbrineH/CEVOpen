<p class="p">Petroleum hydrocarbons are one of the most alarming pollutants due to their high toxicity to human and environmental health. Bioremediation with petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria is widely regarded as an eco-friendly and efficient technology. A large amount of bacterial species with petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading ability have been exploited and applied in bioremediation. However, various problems that slow down biodegradation effects have been found during the process of practical application. This review highlighted these restriction factors, including the toxic effects of petroleum hydrocarbons, the bioavailability of pollutants, environmental constraints, metabolic restrictions and time consumption, and then summarized the current countermeasures against these problems. Several strategies, such as regulating environmental factors and optimizing microbial inoculants, have been investigated and fulfilled. Based on the current state of knowledge reviewed here, a series of investigations still needs to be conducted prior to the successful application of bioremediation for the restoration of petroleum oil contaminated environments. It is concluded as follows: (1) Continue the theoretical basis of the interfacial interaction mechanism between bacteria and petroleum hydrocarbons in order to overcome barriers for microbial uptake of petroleum hydrocarbons, (2) develop novel biocompatible surfactants to enhance contact between bacteria and petroleum hydrocarbons, (3) explore undiscovered resources of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria via new biotechnology, such as a high-throughput screening method to increase and enrich functional bacterial resources, (4) further optimize the strategy of artificial microbial consortia, such as by way of the metagenome enrichment approach to enrich and develop preferable consortia, (5) explore the novel functional genes controlling the pathway of hydrocarbon degradation to provide new looks on the molecular mechanism and microbial remediation, and (6) construct genetically engineered bacteria by using synthetic biology technology to give them more ability for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation.</p>
