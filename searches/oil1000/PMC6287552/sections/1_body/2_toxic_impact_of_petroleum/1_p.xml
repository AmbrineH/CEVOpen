<p class="p">The harm that oil pollution causes to the ecological environment is well known (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sikkema et al., 1995</xref>). For example, the Deep Water Horizon oil spill accident in the Gulf of Mexico produced a profound impact on the economy and environmental safety, which is still the focus of people’s attention (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Although people are becoming increasingly concerned about the toxic effects of oil pollution on humans and animals in affected areas, (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Díez et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mason et al., 2012</xref>), the strong toxic impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons on affected microbial communities are often overlooked (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rivers et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Overholt et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Labud et al. (2007)</xref> reported that petroleum hydrocarbons inhibited microbial biomass, and that the greatest negative effects were observed in the gasoline-polluted sandy soil. In diesel exposure experiments, researchers found that the primary effects of diesel fuel toxicity were reductions in species richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity, with the resulting community being heavily dominated by a few species, principally 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic>. Moreover, they found that the decline in richness and phylogenetic diversity was linked to the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, with species and functional genes involved in nitrification being significantly reduced (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cerniglia et al. (1983)</xref> investigated the toxicity of naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, and 2-methylnaphthalene as well as their oxygenated derivatives to bacterial cells of 
 <italic class="italic">Agmenellum quadruplicatum</italic>, and found that these compounds produced no significant inhibitory effects on bacterial growth. However, the phenolic and quinonic naphthalene derivatives inhibited bacterial growth. This could be explained by phenols and quinones with higher solubility, enhancing the mass transfer of molecules to bacterial cells, resulting in higher toxic effects than the former compounds. Several studies have also reported that certain metabolic intermediates with relatively high solubility produced from the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by bacteria may have higher cytotoxicity than the parent molecules and therefore damage the bacteria (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hou et al., 2018</xref>). However, indigenous bacteria form very large aggregates, and each species has its own function. Accordingly, while some bacteria that are sensitive to petroleum hydrocarbons are greatly inhibited upon exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, others that can efficiently degrade petroleum hydrocarbons, as well as bacteria that can take advantage of cytotoxic intermediate metabolites, will flourish. However, clean-up of petroleum oil pollutants by relying on the strength of these indigenous microorganisms alone will take a long time; therefore, it is necessary to develop intervention measures to speed the process up.
