<p class="p">Accordingly, there is a constant threat of contamination wherever oil is exploited when coupled with an insufficient ability to deal with oil-contaminated environments, especially in extreme or unique environments such as polar regions, deep sea areas, deserts, and wetlands. Although oil pollution is difficult to treat, petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have evolved as a result of existing in close proximity to naturally occurring petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment. Such organisms are candidates for the treatment of oil pollutants (

Therefore, bacteria have been screened and utilized to degrade waste products produced by the food, agricultural, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In recent years, the use of bacteria to deal with environmental pollutants has become a promising technology because of its low cost and eco-friendly nature (

The purpose of this review article is to provide some suggestions for the future development of bacterial remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons on the basis of previously published studies related to new advances in the area of bacterial remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons.
