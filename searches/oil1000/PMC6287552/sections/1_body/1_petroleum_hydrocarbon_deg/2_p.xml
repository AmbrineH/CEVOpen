<p class="p">Many normal and extreme bacterial species have been isolated and utilized as biodegraders for dealing with petroleum hydrocarbons. The degradation pathways of a variety of petroleum hydrocarbons (e.g., aliphatics and polyaromatics) have been shown to employ oxidizing reactions; however, these pathways differ greatly because of the specific oxygenases found in different bacterial species. For instance, some bacteria can metabolize specific alkanes, while others break down aromatic or resin fractions of hydrocarbons. This phenomenon is related to the chemical structure of petroleum hydrocarbon components. Petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and the type of petroleum components they degrade are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Recent studies have identified bacteria from more than 79 genera that are capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tremblay et al., 2017</xref>); several of these bacteria such as

 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alkanindiges</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alteromonas</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptobacillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic>, and

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, “conditionally rare taxa” in soil, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alkanindiges</italic> sp., have been reported to exhibit rare-to-dominant bacterial shifts that are strongly affected by environmental constrains such as diesel pollution (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuentes et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, some obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB), including 
 <italic class="italic">Alcanivorax</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Marinobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Thallassolituus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cycloclasticus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Oleispira</italic> and a few others (the OHCB), showed a low abundance or undetectable status before pollution, but were found to be dominant after petroleum oil contamination (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yakimov et al., 2007</xref>). These phenomena suggest that these microorganisms are crucial to the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, and that they significantly influence the transformation and fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment. Although some bacteria have been reported to have a broad spectrum of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation ability, 
 <italic class="italic">Dietzia</italic> sp. DQ12-45-1b utilizes 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C6–C40) and other compounds as the sole carbon sources (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic> DN002 works well on a variety of monoaromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), almost no bacteria can degrade the entire petroleum hydrocarbon fraction. Indeed, most bacteria can only effectively degrade or utilize certain petroleum hydrocarbon components, while others are completely unavailable (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chaerun et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani, 2017</xref>). This can be attributed to the fact that different indigenous bacteria have different catalytic enzymes; thus, their roles in oil-contaminated sites also vary widely. This also implies that the remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination requires the joint action of multiple functional bacteria to achieve the best environmental purification effect (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dombrowski et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this view, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani et al. (2015)</xref> constructed a halotolerant Hydrocarbon Utilizing Bacterial Consortium (HUBC) consisting of the bacterial isolates 
 <italic class="italic">Ochrobactrum</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> that was found to be good at degrading crude oil (3% v/v), with a degradation percentage as high as 83.49%. 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al. (2017)</xref> utilized a defined co-culture of an indigenous bacterial consortium and exogenous 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> to effectively accelerate the degradation of crude oil. 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang C. et al. (2018)</xref> found that an aboriginal bacterial consortium based on the Penglai 19-3 oil spill accident (China) had higher oil degradation efficiency compared to individual bacteria and demonstrated that this indigenous consortium had the potential for bioremediating crude oil dispersed in the marine ecosystem. A field study showed that bioaugmentation with an artificial consortium containing 
 <italic class="italic">Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alcaligenes xylosoxidans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gordonia</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodococcus equi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. maltophilia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Xanthomonas</italic> sp. contributed to high biodegradation efficiency (89%) in a 365-day treatment of diesel oil-contaminated soil (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Szulc et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these studies indicate that improving the biodegradation potential via the application of bacterial consortia possessing multiple catabolic genes is a reasonable and feasible strategy for accelerating the removal efficiency of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated environments.
