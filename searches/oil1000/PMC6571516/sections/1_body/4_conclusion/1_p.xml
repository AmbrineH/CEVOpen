<p class="p"> The Niâ€’Cr alloy is susceptible to corrosion when exposed to mouthwashes. According to the findings, the amount of ion release was within the safe limit. Based on our results, further randomized clinical trials are recommended to evaluate the exact effect of mouthwashes on ion release. Therefore, Listerine mouthwash should be used cautiously in patients allergic to Ni. </p>
