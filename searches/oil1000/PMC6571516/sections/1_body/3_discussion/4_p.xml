<p class="p"> In this study, we examined Niâ€’Cr metal disks that are widely used for the fabrication of dental prostheses. The specimens were immersed in two types of mouthwash and distilled water for 45 days and then tested by means of an ICP mass spectrometer. Unlike other methods, such as atomic emission spectrometry, ICP has the advantage of extracting each ion simultaneously and detecting the metals without the interference of other ions.
