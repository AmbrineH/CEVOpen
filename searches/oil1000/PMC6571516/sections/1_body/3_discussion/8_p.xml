 </sup> the greatest amount of metal ion release was observed in the mouthwashescontaining Na and alcohol.Listerine and Oral B mouthwashes have a pH of 4.33 and 5.1, respectively. A lower pH can affect the ion release of appliances and alloys in the oral cavity. Metal is released into the oral cavity with saliva as the medium. This could be influenced by a high chloride mixture in the saliva or the intake of various foods and drinks with low pH levels. Moreover, the characteristics of the saliva might change based on the patientâ€™s health and time of day.
