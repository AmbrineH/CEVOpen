<p class="p"> Mouthwashes are usually used twice a week for about 1 minute. The patients are recommended not to eat, drink or rinse after using a mouthwash. Therefore, the components of mouthwashes can be in contact with the Ni‒Cr crowns for a long time; nonetheless, it is difficult to determine the exact duration of this contact. In the current study, we assumed that the mouthwash was present for 6 hours in a patient’s mouth each time. Consequently, the metal disks were immersed in mouthwashes and incubated for 45 days.
