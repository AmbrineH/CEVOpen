 </sup> The alloys utilized in the oral cavity have been reported to leach heavy metals in the saliva under normal conditions. In an in vitro study, metal ion leaching was indicated to be pH-dependent. In another study, Ni and Cr were reported to leach out of metal alloys; however, molybdenum and carbon were more stable.
