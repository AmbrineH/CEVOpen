 </sup> Corrosion is an electrochemical reaction on the metal surface, which leads to the release of ions by the metal. This process can occur as a result of internal and external factors. The internal factors affecting corrosion include metal composition and structure. On the other hand, the external factors that could affect corrosion are the biological environment, pH and temperature.
