 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> presents the means and standard deviations of the released ions. The results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed normal distribution of data in all the groups (P&gt;0.05). According to ANOVA, there was a significant difference among the three groups (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the results of post hoc tests revealed a statistically significant difference between the experimental groups in this regard (P&lt;0.05). The Listerine group exhibited the highest release of Ni ions, compared to the other groups. On the other hand, the control group had the lowest mean value of Ni ion release.
