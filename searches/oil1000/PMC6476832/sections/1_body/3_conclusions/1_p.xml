<p id="Par60" class="p">In the light of the present investigation, we would suggest conducting future wastewater and sludge sample treatments to recover MPs using the previously introduced filtration device. Its advantages are low cost and zero use of chemicals, which make it feasible for all laboratories around the world. Staining methods could be useful in separating MPs from other materials. Nevertheless, according to current study Rose Bengal is not suitable for separating cellulose and plastic fibres.</p>
