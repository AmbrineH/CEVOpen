<p id="Par30" class="p">Density separation was conducted according to Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>) using potassium formate (KHCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) solution with density of 1.5 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (1000 g/L). Spiked influent and sludge samples were sieved through test sieves with 1 mm and 250 μm mesh sizes and MPs were collected with tweezers from the 1-mm sieve. Retained fraction from the 250-μm mesh was rinsed into a glass beaker and dried at 60 °C, after which 150 mL of potassium formate solution was added to each sample and samples were let settle overnight. Supernatants of the samples were vacuum-filtrated on glass fibre filters (VWR, Grade 696, porosity 1.5 μm) and oven-dried for 30 min at 60 °C.
