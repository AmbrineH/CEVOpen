<p id="Par26" class="p">In part II, the effect of lower temperature and decreased lower size limit on the recovery was studied with WPO. Lower temperature was studied in order to prevent possible melting of MPs. Spiked influent and sludge samples were sieved through a cascade of test sieves, with mesh sizes of 250 and 20 μm. Retained material was rinsed with small amount of distilled water into glass beakers and dried in oven at 50 °C with a pierced foil cover until dry (approx. 53 h). Samples were further treated as described for part I, except heating at 50 °C during WPO.</p>
