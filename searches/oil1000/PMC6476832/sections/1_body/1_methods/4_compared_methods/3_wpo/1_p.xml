<p id="Par25" class="p">In part I, WPO was conducted according to Lares et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>). Spiked samples were sieved through a metallic test sieve with a mesh size of 250 μm, retained material was rinsed into a beaker and samples were dried in oven at 75 °C. For dried influent samples (0.26–0.28 g dw), 20 mL of 0.05 M FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution and 40 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) were added. After 20-min heating at 75 °C, 20 mL of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was added, after which samples were heated for another 30 min. For dried sludge samples (0.15–0.23 g dw), only 20 mL of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was added and samples were heated for 30 min. All samples were vacuum-filtrated on gridded membrane filters (Sartorius, cellulose nitrate filter, porosity 0.8 μm) with glass fibre filters (VWR, Grade 696, porosity 1.5 μm) at the bottom for mechanical support and dried in petri dishes with loose foil cover at RT.
