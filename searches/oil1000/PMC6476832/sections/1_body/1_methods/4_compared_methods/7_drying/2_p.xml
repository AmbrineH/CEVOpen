<p id="Par32" class="p">In part II, the effect of sieving was studied in order to decrease the amount of organic material in sludge samples. Spiked sludge samples were sieved through a test sieve with mesh size of 20 Î¼m. Retained material was rinsed into two petri dishes with small amount of distilled water, because the volume increased during rinsing of the sieve. Samples were further dried and examined similarly as in part I.</p>
