<p id="Par10" class="p">Efficiencies of different methods were studied with seven different MPs, including both microplastic particles (MPPs) and fibres (MPFs) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Altogether, seven different polymers were used in this study, namely (unexpanded) PS, PE, PVC, PET, PA, PP and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). Densities of selected MPs varied between 0.9â€“1.6 g/cm

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>). The size of each type of spiked MPs (particles and fibres) varied in the ranges listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. PS beads were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and SBR fragments were offered by Saltex Oy. Non-commercial MPs were cut from plastic items and stored in distilled water before spiking. Furthermore, similarly looking MPs (i.e. compared to the spiked ones in this study) were not detected in the WWTP in question during our previous sampling campaign (Lares et al.
