<p id="Par11" class="p">In order to test different treatment methods with real wastewater and sludge, samples were collected from Kenkäveronniemi WWTP (Mikkeli, Finland) and used as test media. Influent water was collected after 6 mm screen, in the beginning of the grit separation basin, with a 10-L stainless steel bucket attached to a metal wire and poured into 5-L PE containers. Digested sludge (250 mL) was collected directly after digestion into a glass flask. Sampling locations are marked in Figure
