<p id="Par33" class="p">Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25) using non-parametric tests. Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparison was used to assess significant differences between treatment methods by comparing recoveries of MPPs, MPFs and MPs. If distributions of compared methods were different, Welchâ€™s test with Games-Howell post hoc test was performed instead of Kruskal-Wallis. The significance level of all statistical analyses was set at 0.05.</p>
