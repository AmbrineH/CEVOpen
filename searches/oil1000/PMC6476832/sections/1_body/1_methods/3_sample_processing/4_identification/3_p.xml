<p id="Par20" class="p">For Raman analyses, micro-Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Labram HR) was used with green laser (514.53 nm). Spectra were produced with wavelengths 300–3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> using LabSpec 5 software and they were compared to spectra library collected from the literature (Frère et al.
