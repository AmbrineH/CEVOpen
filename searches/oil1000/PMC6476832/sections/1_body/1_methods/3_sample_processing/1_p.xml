<p id="Par12" class="p">Sample preparation and examination were done similarly for all of the samples. Subsamples of thoroughly mixed influent and digested sludge were spiked with ten pieces of each one of the seven types, i.e. total of 70 MPs. Model MPs were collected on a Petri dish in a small amount of distilled water, and spiked in 1 L (part I) or 0.1 (part II) of influent or 3 g (wet weight) of digested sludge with small amount of distilled water. Petri dishes were checked under a digital optical microscope (Zeiss, SteREO discover. V8 with Axiocam 503 color) to ensure that all MPs were transferred to the samples. In part I, spiked samples were further treated with six different methods: filtration, WPO, degradation with KOH, OEP, density separation and drying. Three replicates were conducted for each method. All vessels were rinsed three times with distilled water when transferring the samples. Petri dishes and filters were examined for contamination under the microscope before use.</p>
