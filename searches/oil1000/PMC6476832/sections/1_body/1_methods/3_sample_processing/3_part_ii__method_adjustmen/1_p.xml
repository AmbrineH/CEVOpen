<p id="Par14" class="p">After several pre-tests including all of the six methods, described in the coming “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Compared methods</xref>” section, were compared, three methods (one using chemicals and two chemical-free methods) were selected for further optimization, based on the recovery rates calculated in part I (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, for wastewater, filtration and WPO were selected, with total recovery rates of 83.3% (± 2.5) and 85.2% (± 2.1), respectively. For sludge, drying (85.3 ± 3.4%), filtration (72.4 ± 2.4%) and WPO (90.0 ± 0.8%) were selected.
