<p id="Par16" class="p">In addition, because yellow and flexible PET fibres were difficult to separate from high loads of cellulose fibres in WWTP samples (and they repeatedly had lowest recovery rates of all spiked MPs), the suitability of staining was studied with adjusted filtration and WPO. Rose Bengal was selected, because it is not toxic and it stains other materials than plastics. Through this way also, the colour of the MPs could be assessed, which is not possible with e.g. Nile Red, because it stains specifically MPs (Fischer et al.

The resistance of model MPs to Rose Bengal was confirmed by staining ten pieces of each of the model polymers with 0.2 mg/mL Rose Bengal solution (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2’,4’,5’,7’-tetraiodofluorescein disodium salt, ≥ 80% dye content) according to the method by Ziajahromi et al.
