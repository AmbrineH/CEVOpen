<p id="Par15" class="p">Adjustments were done based on the size limitations and used temperatures. As the diameter of spiked fibres varied between 20–30 μm, they were able to pass the 250-μm mesh lengthwise. This could explain the low recovery of MPFs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Because lower size limitations used in MPs studies has been recommended (Talvitie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2017a</xref>; Lares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>), the lower size limit of sample treatment was decreased from 250 to 20–25 μm in filtration and WPO. Samples sieved with smaller mesh sizes were also examined with higher magnifications (× 31.5). With the introduction of finer mesh sizes, the volume of sieved influent samples was decreased in order to prevent clogging. First, 0.9 L of influent was sieved with the coarse mesh (250 μm), after which 0.1 L of spiked influent was sieved with the whole cascade of filters.
