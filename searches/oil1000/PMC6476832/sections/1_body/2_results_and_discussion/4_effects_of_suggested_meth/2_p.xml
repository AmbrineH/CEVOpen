 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2016</xref>) previously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of FTIR and Raman analysis and suggested using both methods in optimized analysis of unknown particles and fibres. Raman analysis is not dependent on the thickness of the particle, but it is more sensitive for the before-mentioned fluorescence and for the chemical transformation of particle surface. As Song et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>) suggested, identification of a wider set of samples should be based on both microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. First, different particles and fibres should be identified with FTIR or Raman and then the microscopic analysis could be done based on the information gained from the spectroscopic analysis. Nevertheless, there would still be a risk of misidentification, especially with smaller sized particles.
