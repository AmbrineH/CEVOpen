<p id="Par51" class="p">Neither filtration nor staining caused any changes in the identification of particles or fibres, which was confirmed with μ-Raman and μ-FTIR, respectively. Still, it is essential to consider that some of the spiked MPs were difficult to analyse with methods used in this study. SBR fragments were not possible to identify reliably with neither μ-FTIR nor μ-Raman, probably due to the light-absorbing nature of black rubber (Ribeiro-Claro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>). μ-FTIR was able to give identifiable spectra for all other model MPs. Nevertheless, it was more suitable for fibres, as identification of thick MPPs with μ-FTIR in transmittance or reflectance mode was challenging. Raman analysis in turn gave identifiable spectra to most of the spiked fragments (PS, PE and PVC) and PET fibres. All spiked fibres (PET, PA and PP) were still somewhat problematic to identify with Raman. Because all of the fibres were colourful, difficulties were probably caused by their fluorescence, which can be due to pigments or dyes used in plastics (Löder and Gerdts
