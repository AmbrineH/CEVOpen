<p id="Par54" class="p">When filtration is conducted with filtration device and nylon filters (Talvitie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>), also following issues need to be taken into account. Meticulous rinsing of sampler and filtration device with MP-free water is essential before and after the sampling. Connector parts should be rinsed carefully with water before transferring the filter, as some material can be attached to the connectorâ€™s seal. Sludge samples should be mixed with only a small volume of water (e.g. 1 g ww/100 mL). As a disadvantage of this method, both nylon mesh and filtration device (PVC) are possible sources of contamination, and the condition of the device need to be checked before use. Therefore, any MPPs similar to the used PVC and nylon parts should be excluded from results. If possible, non-plastic materials, like metal or glass, should be preferred in order to diminish possible contamination from equipment.
