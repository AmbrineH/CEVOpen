<p id="Par56" class="p">For future MPs studies, we recommend to pay attention to some general issues. First, in order to decrease the risk of contamination and to increase the recovery rates of the examination, method testing with spiked samples before collecting real samples is highly recommended. It should also be noticed that reported recovery rates are accurate only for the applied protocols. Consequently, recovery rates should always be studied and reported together with the MP concentrations with respect to the adopted analytic procedure (whether adjusted from previous methods or completely new ones).</p>
