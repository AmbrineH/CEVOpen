<p id="Par59" class="p">In addition, this study focused only on assessing the efficiency of different methods used in preparations of wastewater and sludge samples for MPs analysis. Also the sampling methods have significant impact on the counted number of MPs related to the real amount of MPs in the samples. Setälä et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2016</xref>) and Barrows et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2017</xref>) compared MP concentrations in seawater samples collected from same areas either with Neuston tow net or as grab samples. Because Neuston nets usually have the mesh size of 330–335 μm, and for grab samples the lower size limitation can be set as small as necessary, MP concentrations were much higher in grab samples than in Neuston net samples. Neuston net is also not suitable for wastewater sampling, where samples are collected from specific and limited areas. Other possible sampling methods for wastewater are pumping, composite samplers and surface filtering assemblies (Talvitie et al.
