<p id="Par57" class="p">Second, rather large MPs were used in these experiments. Even though the procedure would allow collection of very small MPs (&lt; 100 μm), there would be a risk of missing them during the microscopic examination before identification with Raman or FTIR microscope. Therefore, the lower size limitation of counted MPs is partly dependent on the available magnification of the microscope. Nevertheless, there are always smaller micro- and even nanoplastics, which will pass the sieves or filters and become excluded from the reported MP concentrations. We would suggest to draw the line of lower size limitation around 20 to 25 μm, as most of the cloth fibres have diameter above that, and those size limitations has already been used in some previous publications (Talvitie et al.
