<p id="Par49" class="p">Due to the sieving, time needed for drying the samples increased considerably. Each sieved sample was divided into two petri dishes before drying, which increased the possible loss of MPs and risk of contamination (not assessed in this study). Few brownish PS beads were collected also from the dried sludge samples, but no other deformations were noticed. As sieving did not improve the recovery compared with the original method (Murphy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2016</xref>), we would not recommend adding a sieving step to this method. Based on our observations, larger volume of the samples caused by rinsing of the sieves together with drying might cause MPs to attach on the vertical surfaces of petri dish, thus further complicating the examination of MPs.
