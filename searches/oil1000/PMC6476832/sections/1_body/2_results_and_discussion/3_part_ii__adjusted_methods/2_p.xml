<p id="Par45" class="p">The narrow nature of fibres was taken into account in part II, as the lower size range of treatment methods was decreased to 20–25 μm. Overall, recovery rates were slightly higher with decreased mesh size of cascade sampler, as meshes below 250 μm collected 0–18.6% of spiked MPs, all of which were fibres. This difference was significant only for sludge between filtration at RT, with and without staining (pairwise Kruskal-Wallis 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.046 and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.043, respectively). If size of spiked MPs had been smaller, that proportion of MPFs on smaller-sized meshes would presumably have been larger. On the other hand, when focusing on the time consumptions of different methods, decreasing the lower size limit increased the time needed for treatments and examination due to multiple size fractions per sample. Overall, it should be noticed, that when the lower size limit is increased, the treatment and examination of samples are quicker and easier, but the results for MPs concentrations are less accurate. In addition, handling of smaller particles with tweezers is difficult, and therefore new reliable methods must be developed in order to include wider particle fraction into further studies.
