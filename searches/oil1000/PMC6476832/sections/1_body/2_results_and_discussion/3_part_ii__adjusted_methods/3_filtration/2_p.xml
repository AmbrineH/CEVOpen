<p id="Par47" class="p">Samples were fractionized by size more easily with filtration device, when they contained fewer large-sized materials. This was clear when filtered samples of influent and sludge were compared. More fibres were counted from smaller sized meshes with sludge samples than with influent samples, which contained higher amount of cellulose fibres with the ability to retain other particles and fibres on the 250 Î¼m mesh.</p>
