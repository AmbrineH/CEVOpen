<p id="Par44" class="p">Total recoveries of adjusted methods varied between 84.8 and 92.9% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and filtration was found to be the most efficient method for both wastewater (91.4% ± 1.7) and sludge (92.9% ± 1.4). Filtration had also highest recovery rate for MPFs; 83.3% (± 3.8) for wastewater and 83.3% (± 3.3) for sludge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Nonetheless, none of the adjusted methods differed significantly from others (all pairwise Kruskal-Wallis comparisons or Games-Howell post hot tests 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). This means that by using either one of these adjusted methods, rather similar types and number of MPs would be counted in case of the size of studied MPs is similar with spiked MPs used in the current study. This could ease the comparison of already reported abundances of different kinds of MPs.
