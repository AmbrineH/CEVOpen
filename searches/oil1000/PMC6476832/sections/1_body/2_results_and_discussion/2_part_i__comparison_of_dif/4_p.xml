<p id="Par38" class="p">Also, density separation was excluded due to the low recovery rate and the fact that cellulose fibres (with density of 1.5 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) were concentrated in the supernatant with MPs. Solid material attached the glass surfaces during drying, which could have affected on the recovery of MPs. Because cellulose could not been separated based on its density, this method was excluded from further optimization. We agree that density separation could be more useful with sediment samples, where it could separate denser mineral particles from MPs (Zhang et al.
