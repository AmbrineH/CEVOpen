<p id="Par40" class="p">Some problems were noticed with all tested treatment methods. First, none of the tested procedures were able to remove all cellulose fibres from samples. Overall, cellulose is an organic polymer, which is relatively stable against most of the mild chemical treatments. If harsh chemicals would be used to degrade cellulose, also MPs might be prone to chemical degradation. Therefore, staining was also tested in the second part of the study in order to separate non-plastic particles and fibres from microplastics. Another option could have been enzymatic degradation of cellulose, which was not found to be useful with influent samples (Lares et al.
