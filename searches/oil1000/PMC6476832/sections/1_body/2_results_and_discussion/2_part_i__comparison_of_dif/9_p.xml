<p id="Par43" class="p">In addition, average time consumptions of different methods are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Active time consumptions for spiked wastewater and sludge samples varied between 1.0 and 4.5 h. OEP, with its multistep procedure, needed clearly more active time than other treatments. Total time needed for treatment, drying and examination varied between 4.5 and 57.0 h. Nevertheless, total time consumptions were highly dependent on the time used for drying and they were also dependent on the water addition caused by spiking. Drying of any filter at low temperature (e.g. 45 Â°C) would decrease both the time needed for drying and risks for contamination, as samples would be exposed to aerial contamination for a shorter period. Overall, active time consumptions were more representative in this case.
