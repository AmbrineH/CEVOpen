Those fibres were more flexible than PA and PP fibres, which may have allowed them to pass sieves more easily. They were also difficult to separate from cellulose fibres during the visual examination. In addition, the light colour of the filters or microscopeâ€™s sample holder might cause some errors in the results, when MPs are collected visually. Light-coloured MPs are more easily recognized from dark-coloured background and vice versa. However, selecting the optimal background colour (i.e. colour of the filter) to analyse all MPs would probably not be possible.</p>
