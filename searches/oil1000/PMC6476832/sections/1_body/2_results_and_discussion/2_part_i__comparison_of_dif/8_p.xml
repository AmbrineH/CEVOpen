<p id="Par42" class="p">When recovery rates of methods for particulate material are discussed, it should be noticed, that recovery rates depend highly on the used mesh sizes and particles in question. If the portion of spiked large particles increases, the recovery rate of the method will also increase. If only fibres are studied, the total recovery rate would likely decrease. This was taken into account in the current study, as recovery rates were also counted separately for particles and fibres. In addition, even though only the number of recovered fibres was counted, it seemed that longer PET fibres were counted more often than shorter ones. As not all of the MPs were measured before spiking, this was not further examined and discussed.</p>
