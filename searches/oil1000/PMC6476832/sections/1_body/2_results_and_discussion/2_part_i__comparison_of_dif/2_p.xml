<p id="Par36" class="p">Furthermore, filtration, WPO, KOH treatment, OEP (with wastewater) and drying were efficient methods with MPPs over 250 μm. However, MPFs were more difficult to collect from environmental samples by sieving due to their shape (Lares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>). Therefore, it was not surprising that the average recovery rates for MPFs varied between 16.7% for density separation (sludge) and 78.9% for WPO (sludge). As the diameter of spiked MPs in the current study varied between 20 and 30 μm, they were able to pass the 250-μm mesh lengthwise.
