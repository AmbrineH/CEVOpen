<p id="Par6" class="p">To the best of our knowledge, the most inclusive testing for recovery rates and suitability of different chemicals in MP analyses was conducted by Karami et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2017</xref>). They studied suitable procedures for examining MPs from fish samples and included low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinylchloride (PVC), nylon-6 (PA 6) and nylon-66 (PA 66) to their experiments with sizes mostly under 300 Î¼m. Generally, most of the researchers have still relied on one or two polymers as representatives of all microplastics in recovery rate testing (Masura et al.
