<p id="Par7" class="p">In addition, effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were proven to be a route for MPs to reach the environment, as they collect MP-containing discharges from both industrial and municipal wastewaters (Talvitie et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>). In WWTPs, most of the MPs have been reported to be concentrated into sludge (Murphy et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2017b</xref>; Lares et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2017b</xref>). On the other hand, wastewaters substantially differ from many natural waters, because they contain large amounts of organic materials, especially cellulosic fibres, which can be easily mixed with some plastic fibres (Lares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>). As a result, the recovery and examination of MPs become more difficult and time-consuming.
