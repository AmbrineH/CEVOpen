 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>), more plastics are also discharged to both terrestrial and aquatic environment. Plastics may become shredded into smaller fragments during the use or after reaching the environment as a result of different kind of weathering and physical breakdowns (Arthur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2009</xref>). As well, they can be purposely produced as small particles, for example for plastic industry or cosmetic use (Fendall and Sewell
