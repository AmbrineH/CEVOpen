 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>), the variability of sample matrices (e.g. wastewater, sludge, sediment, biota) necessitates the establishment of specified methods for different types of samples (Hale

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2017</xref>). For example, if additives or contaminants attached to MPs are supposed to be studied, samples should not be treated with highly alkaline or acidic chemicals (e.g. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> or KOH), which might destroy or remove the substances of interest (Rios Mendoza et al.
