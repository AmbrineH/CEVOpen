<p id="Par5" class="p">Because MPs are formed from a various group of polymers and differently shaped particles, environmental MPs may have a high variation in their compositions, which should be taken into account with selected treatment methods. Some polymers are known to be more sensitive to acidic solutions or higher temperatures than others (Lusher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>). Different polymers have also different densities, varying from 0.9 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> for polypropylene (PP) to 1.6 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> for polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyoxymethylene (POM) (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>), which might have an effect on the results from density-based separation methods. In addition, various research investigations concurred that microplastic fibres (MPFs) are the most abundant types of MPs in the marine environment (Browne et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2017a</xref>). Nevertheless, fibres have been excluded from most of the studies concerning recovery rates of MPs. Therefore, most of the reported recovery rates from the related literature are only relevant to MP particles (spheres, fragments, etc.), and thus systematically underestimating the pollution threat caused by MPs (Nuelle et al.
