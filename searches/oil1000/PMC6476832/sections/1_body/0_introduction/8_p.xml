<p id="Par9" class="p">In the first part, the recovery of spiked microplastics was investigated with influent and sludge samples with six methods, including filtration (Talvitie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>), wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) (Lares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2018</xref>), degradation with potassium hydroxide (KOH) (Karami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2017</xref>), oil extraction procedure (OEP) (Crichton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2017</xref>), density separation (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>) and a drying-based method (Murphy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2016</xref>; only with sludge samples). Seven different MPs were used in spiking. In the second part, two to three methods with highest recovery rates, one with chemical treatment and one or two chemical-free ones, were further adjusted for both wastewater and sludge with the aim of offering effective, environmentally friendly and inexpensive methods, which could serve other researchers involved in MP studies in WWTPs. In addition, staining with Rose Bengal was combined with most effective methods and the utility of staining was assessed. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy were used in order to assess the possible effects of the selected method on the spiked MPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare suitability of different treatment methods for wastewater and sludge samples collected from WWTP and including both particles and fibres on the recovery rate testing.
