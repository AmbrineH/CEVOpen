<p id="Par8" class="p">In this context, the objective of the current study was to assess and compare the suitability of frequently used methods for MPs extraction and identification with wastewater and sludge samples collected from a municipal WWTP. As the density (0.9 and 1.6 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and sensitivity to acidic treatments and high temperatures differ between polymers (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lusher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>), polymers with different properties were included in the current study. For example, PA and PET are one of the most sensitive polymers to aggressive or acidic treatments with e.g. hydrogen peroxide or sulphuric acid (Lusher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>). On the other hand, most commonly used polymers, including PP, PE, PVC, PET, PS and PA (PlasticsEurope
