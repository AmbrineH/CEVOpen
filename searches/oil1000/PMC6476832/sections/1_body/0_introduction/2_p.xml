<p id="Par3" class="p">As the research effort on MPs monitoring has been accelerating during recent decade, a great variety of sampling and treatment methods have been introduced (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>; Horton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2017</xref>; Lusher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>). Nonetheless, despite the great number of MPs-related studies, the efficiencies of the used method and effects of different thermal, chemical or physical treatments on MPs samples are rarely assessed and reported together with the MPs concentrations (Underwood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>). As for any pollutant investigations, without knowledge of the actual recovery rates, there is a risk of under- or overestimation of the reported MPs concentrations.
