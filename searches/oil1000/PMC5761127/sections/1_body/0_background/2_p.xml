<p id="Par24" class="p">To prevent the damage caused by ROS, living organisms have developed an antioxidant defense system that includes the presence of non-enzymatic antioxidants and enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. It has been anticipated that in addition to these natural antioxidants, other synthetic or natural ROS scavengers may reduce the incidence of free radical-mediated diseases. The use of antioxidants in the prevention and cure of various diseases is intensifying, and there is considerable interest in the study of the antioxidant activities of molecules such as plant polyphenolic and carotenoid components [
