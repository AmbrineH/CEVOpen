 <sub class="sub">4</sub> exposure is characterized by the elevated levels of serum hepatic marker enzymes indicating the cellular leakage and loss of functional integrity of hepatic membrane architecture. High levels of ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and Î³GT activities are sensitive indicators of liver cell injury and are most helpful in recognizing hepatic diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-treated rats show increased activities of these enzymes, reflecting damage to the liver cells or changes in the cell membrane permeability leading to leakage of enzymes from cells to the circulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. In the present study increased levels of serum hepatic markers suggested that an extensive liver injury was occasioned by CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> due to increased lipid peroxidation which had the ability to cause membrane damage. It is now generally accepted that CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> hepatotoxicity is the result of reductive dehalogenation, which is catalyzed by its specific isoenzyme of cytochrome P450 2E1, and which forms the highly reactive free radical. Hence, the suppression of P450 2E1 could result in reduced levels of reactive metabolites, and thus decreased tissue damage [
