 <p> Identification and classification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among samples. (A) Venn diagram of DEGs among four pairs of samples. (B) GO enrichment analysis of up- and down-regulated DEGs in H10 and H12 relative to L4 and L6. The top 30 enriched GO terms are shown. The asterisks indicate significantly enriched terms ( Padj &lt; 0.05). (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up- and down-regulated DEGs in H10 and H12 relative to L4 and L6. The top 20 enriched KEGG pathways are shown. </p>
