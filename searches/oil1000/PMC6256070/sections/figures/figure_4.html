 <p> Differential expression profiles and distribution of CYPs genes. (A) Heat map showing the differential expression profile of CYPs. (B) Distribution of the CYP family. The scale represents log2 fold changes in H10 and H12 relative to L4 and L6. Unigenes with an adjusted P-value ( padj) &lt; 0.05 were differentially expressed. </p>
