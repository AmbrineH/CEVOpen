 <p> Heat maps showing the different expression profiles of genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathway. The scale represents log2 fold changes in H10 and H12 relative to L4 and L6. Unigenes with an adjusted P-value ( padj) &lt; 0.05 were differentially expressed. AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; MDS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase; IDI, isopentenyl di-phosphate isomerase; GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesylpyrophosphate synthase; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; MTPS, monoterpene synthase; STPS, sesquiterpene synthase; DTPS, diterpene synthase. </p>
