 <p> Spatial expression patterns of key genes in the terpene synthesis pathway. Expression of genes from the leaf, young stem, phloem, xylem and root was examined by qRT-PCR. Abbreviations for genes are the same as in Figure 4. SgActin was used as an internal control. Data are presented as the mean Â± SE of triplicate samples. </p>
