<p class="p">Leaves of 4 weeks old 
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were used for agrobacterium-mediated infiltration as described by Wydro et al. (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). The ORF sequence of each gene was cloned into pCambia1301 vector and the GFP fusion constructs were used for transient expression. Infiltrated leaves were mounted on slides and imaged using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon C2-ER) with a standard filter set. The empty GFP vector was used as control.
