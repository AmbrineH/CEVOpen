<p class="p">The identified terpene synthase gene was cloned from 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> cDNA library and confirmed by sequencing. The gene was then subcloned into pET30a vector for prokaryote expression. The resulting expression constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. For functional expression, the constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. Cultures containing the recombinant constructs were grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium with antibiotics and inoculated into LB medium until OD600 reached to 0.8, then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 15°C. The induced cell pellets were collected for cell lysis and the supernatants containing soluble target proteins were used for protein purification by affinity chromatography on nickel-iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) resin (Qiagen, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method.
