The CDS prediction was performed by blast into nr and Swissprot protein database and the ORF protein coding sequences were extracted and translated into protein sequences according to standard codon. For those unmapped sequences or mapped but with no predicted sequences the sequences were subjected to prediction by estscan (3.0.3) software.
