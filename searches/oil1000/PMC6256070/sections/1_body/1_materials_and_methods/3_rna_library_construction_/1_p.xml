<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted from each sample using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method as described by Asif et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>), plus the Plant RNA isolation kit. Briefly, fine powder were extracted with the buffer containing 2% CTAB and chloroform was added to remove polyphenols and polysaccarides. The aqueous phase were then subject to RNA isolation according to manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen RNeasy kit). RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA assay kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, USA). A total of 1.5 Î¼g RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations. The total of 12 libraries were subject to sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and paired-end reads were generated.
