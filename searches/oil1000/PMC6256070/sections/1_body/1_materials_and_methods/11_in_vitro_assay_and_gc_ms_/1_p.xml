<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assay, the reactions were carried out in 500 μL assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl PH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) containing 5 μg purified protein and 50 μM GPP or FPP substrate. The contents were mixed in a 2 ml glass vial and incubated at 30°C for 5 h. Then the reaction products were extracted with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) system for 30 min and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system 7890B-5977A (Agilent Technologies) fitted with HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm). The injection temperature was 250°C with ionization energy 70 eV and mass scan range 30–300 amu. The GC was programmed with an initial temperature of 50°C for 1 min, then increasing at a rate 5°C/min until 80°C (1 min hold), and then at a rate of 10°C/min until 220°C (10 min hold). Identification of compounds were achieved by using the NIST14 mass spectral library database and by comparison of retention times and mass spectra with authentic standards if available.
