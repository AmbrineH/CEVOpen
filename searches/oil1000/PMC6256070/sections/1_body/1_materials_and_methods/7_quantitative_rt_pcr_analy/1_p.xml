<p class="p">For qRT-PCR validation, all RNA samples were reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Superscript III 1st strand RT-PCR reactions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, USA). Amplifications were carried out in triplicate in a total volume of 20 μL using SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ II kit (Takara). The specificity of the PCR amplicon was checked using a heat dissociation protocol (from 60 to 95°C) after the final PCR cycle. Three independent biological replicates and three technical replicates were performed. The primers used in the qPCR were shown in File
