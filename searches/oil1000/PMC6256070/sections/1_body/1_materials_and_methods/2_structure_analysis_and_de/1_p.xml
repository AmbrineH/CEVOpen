<p class="p">Samples were prepared for cryosectioning as described by Martin et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Sections were stained with 1% carmine and astra blue. Final sections were placed on the glass lamina and photographed with a light microscope Olympus BH-2. Extraction of terpene constituents were done as Lewinsohn et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). The extract was used for GC-MS analysis (Agilent 6890). Chemical compounds were identified based on comparison of the mass spectra with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard library. Relative percentage of the identified compounds were computed based on the peak area.
