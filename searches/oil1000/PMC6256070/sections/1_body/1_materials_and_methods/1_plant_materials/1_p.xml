<p class="p">Plants were grown from seeds from eight natural populations of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> distributed in Hainan Island in glasshouse with 16 h light photoperiods. After 1 year, seedlings were transferred to plantations located in the Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry in Pingxiang City, Guangxi, China (22°02′-22°19′N, 106°43′-106°52′E). Plants were maintained for 10 years before sampled. We selected two plants L4 and L6 (annual yield of 25 and 50 g) as low oil-yielding plants and two plants H10 and H12 (annual yield of 475 and 770 g) as high oil-yielding plants. Each tissue was collected from three individuals in the same family representing biological replicates. Fresh stem tissues were sampled after peeling and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for RNA extraction.
