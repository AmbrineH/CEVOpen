<p class="p">The trunk of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> can exude a large amount of oleoresin when drilled into or tapped. These oleoresin are stored in specific cells named secretory canals. Anatomical analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> stem tissue showed secretory canals exist in the secondary xylem of the trunk (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>). To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of oleoresin biosynthesis and excretion in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>, two high oil-yielding and two low oil-yielding plants were selected for oleoresin analysis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>). The annual oleoresin yield in H12 plants was ~30 times higher than that of L4 plants. The GC-MS profile showed that the chemical compounds of oleoresin in the four types of plants were very similar (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>). There were about 18 types of sesquiterpenes that had identifiable levels of &gt;0.1% of total compounds detected. The major sesquiterpenes were α-copaene and β-caryophyllene, followed by β-cubebene, δ-cadinene, and germacrene. The other 13 compounds accounted for &lt;3%. The relative amount of five compounds, namely, α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, aromadendrene, and amorpha-4,11-diene, showed a statistical difference among the four samples, while the other compounds were not statistically diverse.
