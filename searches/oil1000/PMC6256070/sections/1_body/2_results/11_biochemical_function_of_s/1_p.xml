<p class="p">To characterize the function of the sequiterpene synthases SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2, the recombinant proteins SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 were expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and purified proteins were used for activity assay. GC-MS analysis of the SgSTPS1 enzymatic products revealed the formation of predominantly β-caryophyllene (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9A</xref>, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S4A</xref>), along with a minor amount of isocaryophillene and humulene when utilizing FPP as a substrate. While using GPP as a substrate, there were trace amounts of linalool and geraniol produced at the retention times of 10.42 and 13.37 min, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S5</xref>). This indicated that SgSTPS1 is a sesquiterpene synthase with caryophyllene synthase activity that could be responsible for β-caryophyllene production in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>.
