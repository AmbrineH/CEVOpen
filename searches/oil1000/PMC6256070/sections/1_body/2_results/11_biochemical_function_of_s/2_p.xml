<p class="p">However, the recombinant SgSTPS2 protein was found to be a versatile enzyme that used FPP as a substrate to catalyze the synthesis of 12 sesquiterpene compounds, including elemene isomer, α-copaene, β-elemene, ylangene, β-copaene, isogermacrene D, γ-cadinene, γ-muurolene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, γ-amorphene, and cadina-1(10),4-diene (Figure

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S4B</xref>), all of which were also present in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> oleoresin except elemene (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the sesquiterpene products, elemene, ylangene, β-copaene, and germacrene D were the major products. When using GPP as a substrate, SgSTPS2 synthesized three acyclic monoterpenes, linalool, geranyl methyl ether, and geraniol, demonstrating MTPSs activity of SgSTPS2.
