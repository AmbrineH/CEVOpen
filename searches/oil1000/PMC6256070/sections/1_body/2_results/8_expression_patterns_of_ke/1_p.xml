<p class="p">In order to gain insight into the spatial expression patterns of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>, the expression levels of 16 key identified genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in different tissues, including the leaf, young stem, phloem and xylem from the trunk, and root. The putative rate-limiting genes 
 <italic class="italic">HMGR1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">HMGR2</italic> from MVA, and 
 <italic class="italic">DXR1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DXR2</italic> from the MEP pathways showed higher expression in the phloem and root with relatively low expression in the leaf, young stem, and xylem (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). The diterpene synthesis genes including 
 <italic class="italic">GGPPS1</italic> and diterpene synthases 
 <italic class="italic">DTPS1, DTPS2, DTPS3</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">DTPS4</italic> all exhibited preferential expression in the phloem and root. The putative transcription factors 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ARF</italic> were also mainly expressed in the phloem and root. The two sesquiterpene synthase genes 
 <italic class="italic">STPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">STPS2</italic> were differentially regulated in various tissues, among which 
 <italic class="italic">STPS1</italic> showed the highest expression in the root, and 
 <italic class="italic">STPS2</italic> was mainly expressed in the leaf, phloem, and root. These expression patterns of genes were consistent with the terpene profile that terpene compounds mainly accumulate in the trunk of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> plants.
