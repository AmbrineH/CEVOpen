<p class="p">According to mapping in reference to the canonical pathways in KEGG, a total of 90,343 unigenes were assigned to 130 pathways (Figure

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10" class="xref">S4</xref>). Among these, carbon metabolism was the most enriched, followed by the biosynthesis of amino acids. In addition, there were 1,838 unigenes involved in plant hormone signal transduction. These genes can be good candidates for investigating plant growth regulation and stress response. Moreover, there were 2,131 unigenes involved in the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketide pathways. This information is particularly important for the identification of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in
