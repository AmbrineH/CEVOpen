<p class="p">All of the unigenes were subjected to a search against the KOG database, resulting in the assignment of 63,438 unigenes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1D</xref>, File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9" class="xref">S3</xref>). These unigenes were classified into 26 different functional groups, with the largest cluster being groups O and R, followed by group J. It was noteworthy that there were 2,986 and 957 unigenes annotated in the lipid transport and metabolism group (group I) and the secondary metabolites biosynthesis group (group Q), respectively.
