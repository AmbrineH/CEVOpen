<p class="p">Based on nr annotation and the 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-value distribution, 75.59% of unigenes showed homology to annotated genes from 818 plant species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1B</xref>, File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7" class="xref">S1</xref>). Among these, the top five species were 
 <italic class="italic">Glycine max, Glycine soja, Cicer arietinum, Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Medicago truncatula</italic>, all of which belong to the Fabaceae family. GO annotation revealed that in total, 154,112 unigenes were classified into three GO categories (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1C</xref>, File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8" class="xref">S2</xref>). In the biological process category, large numbers of unigenes were classified into the cellular process and metabolic process groups, including 102 and 5,744 unigenes related to the fatty acid derivative metabolic process and the lipid metabolic process, respectively, which implied the identification of genes involved in specific metabolite biosynthesis pathways. In the molecular function category, genes related to binding and catalytic activity were highly abundant, indicating large amounts of enzymes in this particular state.
