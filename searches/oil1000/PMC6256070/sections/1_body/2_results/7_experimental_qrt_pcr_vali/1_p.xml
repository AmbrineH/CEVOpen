<p class="p">To validate the expression of putative genes in RNA-seq data, 13 genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathway, including 
 <italic class="italic">AACT, HMGS, HMGR, MVK, PMK, MVD, MCT, CMK, MDS, HDS, HDR, IDI</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">GGPS</italic>, were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The comparative analysis of these genes obtained by qRT-PCR revealed similar expression patterns as those obtained by transcriptome analysis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S3A</xref>). Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between the qRT-PCR results and the dataset obtained by RNA-seq; the correlation coefficient was 0.942 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S3B</xref>), suggesting that the data obtained by transcriptome sequencing are reliable for exploring the target genes and regulatory genes involved in terpene biosynthesis.
