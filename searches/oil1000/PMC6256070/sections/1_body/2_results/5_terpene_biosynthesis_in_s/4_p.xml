<p class="p">For monoterpene biosynthesis, GPP was catalyzed by monoterpene synthases (MTPSs), such as geraniol synthase and linalool synthase, to produce different forms of monoterpene. However, there were no unigenes that contained a complete ORF for MTPSs discovered in these transcriptomes. For sesquiterpene biosynthesis, two putative genes were found to encode germacrene synthase (GS) and valencene synthase (VS), respectively (Figure

In particular, Cluster-32860.192900, encoding STPS in H10, showed an FPKM value four-fold higher than that of L4, while Cluster-32860.116868, encoding STPS in H10 and H12, had an FPKM value six-fold higher than that of L4. These data indicated that the two identified STPSs in the terpene biosynthesis pathway may account for the variation in the terpene yield of
