<p class="p">Cytochrome P450 family enzymes participate in the downstream modification of the terpene skeleton by regiospecific oxygenation and also contribute to another level of terpene diversity. Data analysis revealed that 31 candidate CYP genes were up-regulated in H10 or H12 compared to L4 and L6, with a maximum seven-fold FPKM change (Figure

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM14" class="xref">S8</xref>). Depending on the phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequence of these CYPs, six groups were identified, including nine unigenes in CYP83, two in CYP76, six in CYP82, five in CYP71, three in CYP704, and six in the CYP90 family (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). Several CYPs, such as the CYP71 and CYP76 families, have been reported to catalyze the oxidation of sesquiterpenes in various plants (Diaz-Chavez et al.,
