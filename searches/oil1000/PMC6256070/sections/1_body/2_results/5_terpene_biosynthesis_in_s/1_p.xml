 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> produces oleoresin in particular tissues of stems known as secretory canals, where terpenes constitute a major component of oleoresin oil. Transcriptome analysis revealed sequences for a complete set of 60 genes in the terpene biosynthesis pathway in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). In the MVA pathway, transcriptome mining identified three, six and three putative genes for the initial three enzymes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), respectively (Figure

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13" class="xref">S7</xref>). Next, during the formation of IPP, the transcriptome analysis revealed two putative unigenes for mevalonate kinase (MVK), two for phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and two for mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD). Among these unique genes, Cluster-32860.96052, encoding HMGS, exhibited higher expression in both H10 and H12 plants as compared to those in L4 and L6 plants, suggesting a possible role of this unigene in determining the terpene amount in
