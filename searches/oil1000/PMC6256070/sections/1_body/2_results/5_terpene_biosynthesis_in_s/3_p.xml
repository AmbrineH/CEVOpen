<p class="p">The intermediate IPP can be isomerized into DMAPP by isopentenyl di-phosphate isomerase (IDI). The transcriptome analysis identified three representative unigenes for IDI (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>, File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13" class="xref">S7</xref>). Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation of IPP and DMPP to generate GPP, which is further utilized by farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) for the synthesis of FPP that is subsequently catalyzed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) for the production of GGPP. The transcriptional mining identified two unigenes for GPPS, six for FPPS, and three for GGPPS. The relatively higher expression of FPPS unigenes than those of GPPS and GGPPS is in agreement with sesquiterpenes being the predominant component of terpene oil in
