<p class="p">In the MEP pathway, generation of IPP or DMAPP involves seven enzymatic steps. Initially, a total of six and three putative genes were identified as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), respectively (Figure

Next, the transcriptome exploration identified three unigenes for 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT), two for 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK), two for 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS), three for (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase (HDS), and three for 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR). Furthermore, the identified genes involved in the MVA pathway exhibited relatively higher expression compared to the MEP pathway (File
