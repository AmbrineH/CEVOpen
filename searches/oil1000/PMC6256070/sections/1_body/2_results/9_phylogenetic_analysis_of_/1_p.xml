<p class="p">The TPSs family can be classified into six clades including TPS a-g (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). To clarify the function of TPS in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>, we selected putative TPS genes that contained a complete ORF sequence and encoded proteins larger than 500 amino acids. Two STPS transcripts, Cluster-32860.192900 (SgSTPS1, 549 aa), and Cluster-32860.116868 (SgSTPS2, 557 aa), and four DTPS transcripts, Cluster-32860.70817 (SgDTPS1, 597 aa), Cluster-32860.241723 (SgDTPS2, 789 aa), Cluster-32860.433 (SgDTPS3, 762 aa), and Cluster-24327.0 (SgDTPS4, 686 aa), were then identified. Blast search of SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 showed closest homology to CoTPS1 (AGW18154) (93%) and CoTPS4 (AGW18157) (89%) from 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera officinalis</italic>, respectively; both of them were functionally characterized as sesquiterpene synthase (Joyce 2013). SgDTPS1 was closely related to CoTPS5 (AGW18158) (88%) and TcCPS (EOX94746) (57%) from 
 <italic class="italic">Theobroma cacao</italic>, while SgDTPS2, SgDTPS3, and SgDTPS4 were most closely related to GsKS (KHN21375) (about 71%) from 
 <italic class="italic">G. soja</italic>. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 contained the RRX
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>W, EDXXD, DDXXD, and NSE/DTE motifs (File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM17" class="xref">S11</xref>). SgDTPS1 was aligned with other CPSs and was found to include the QXXDGGWG and DXDDTAM motifs, suggesting it as a class II terpene synthase. SgDTPS2, SgDTPS3, and SgDTPS4 were aligned with other KSs and were revealed to contain the QXXDGGWG, DDXXD, and NSE/DTE motifs. The six genes were further used to build phylogenetic relationships with other characterized TPSs. It was found that SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 were all clustered into the TPS-a subfamily, suggesting they were sesquiterpene synthases (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). SgDTPS1 was grouped together with CPS in TPS-c subfamily, suggesting this as a class II diterpene cyclase. SgDTPS2, SgDTPS3, and SgDTPS4 were grouped with KS in the TPS-e subfamily, indicating them to be diterpene synthase. These genes can serve as key candidates for investigating the biological function of terpene synthases in
