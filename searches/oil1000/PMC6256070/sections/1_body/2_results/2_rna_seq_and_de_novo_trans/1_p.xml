<p class="p">The stem tissue of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> was used for RNA-seq library construction. Transcriptome sequencing of 12 cDNA libraries generated an average of 55.51 million raw data reads (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" class="xref">S1</xref>). After filtering adapter, low quality, and short reads, an average of 9.2 G clean bases were obtained. The Q30 percentages (percentage of bases with phred value &gt;30) were above 93%, and the GC content was about 43.63%. Furthermore, the valid reads were 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembled to generate 409,106 transcripts, which were further clustered into 283,998 unigenes (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM70" class="xref">S2</xref>). The mean unigene length was 1,701 bp, and the N50 length was 2,541 bp. The largest number of unigenes was found for a size &gt;2,000 bp, followed by unigenes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 bp, and then unigenes between 500 and 1,000 bp. These data indicated high accuracy and good assembly of this transcriptome sequencing.
