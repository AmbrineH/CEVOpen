<p class="p">The transcripts assembled by Trinity were used as the reference transcriptome, and the clean reads from each sample were mapped to the reference sequences. The average mapping rate was 80.85%. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by comparing high oil-yielding plants with low oil-yielding plants: pair H10 and L4, H10 and L6, H12 and L4, and H12 and L6, respectively. There were 9,797 unigenes up-regulated in H10 and H12, and 9,393 unigenes were predominantly expressed in L4 and L6 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>). The greatest gene expression difference existed between H10 and L4, and between H12 and L4, followed by pair H12 and L6, and pair H10 and L6. It should be noted that there were 10, 9, 15, and 11 down-regulated and 40, 21, 3, and 14 up-regulated DEGs annotated in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway between pairs H10 and L4, H12 and L4, H12 and L6, and H10 and L6, respectively (File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11" class="xref">S5</xref>). These DEGs involved in the terpenoid pathway could serve as good candidates for functional validation. Moreover, when comparing the expression profiles of H10 and H12 to those of L4 and L6, a total of 273 unigenes were co-repressed, and 248 unigenes were co-induced, respectively (File 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12" class="xref">S6</xref>). These DEGs were involved in signaling, protein metabolism and processing, defense, transcription factors, and metabolism, suggesting that signaling pathways, transcription factors, and metabolism may be responsible for
