<p class="p">Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment of these DEGs resulted in the assignment of 121 metabolic pathways. The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was significantly enriched in H10 and H12 predominantly expressed DEGs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>). In addition, there were 43 and 13 up-regulated DEGs enriched in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, respectively, which were consistent with the GO enrichment results that terpene biosynthesis-related DEGs could increase the terpene content. In L4 and L6 predominantly expressed DEGs, five KEGG pathways were significantly enriched, among which the majority of DEGs were involved in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, further implying the potential influence of plant signal transduction-related DEGs in the down-regulation of terpene yield. Together, these data suggested that the terpene biosynthesis process and plant hormone signal transduction pathway may exert the most significant role in determining the terpene variation in
