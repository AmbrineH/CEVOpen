<p class="p">Based on the GO functional enrichment, the up-regulated DEGs in H10 and H12 were significantly enriched in 14 GO terms (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>adj &lt; 0.05, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>), among which the most enriched were related to ADP binding in the molecular function category. In particular, there were 34 DEGs significantly enriched in terpene synthase activity, which implied positive roles of these DEGs in the regulation of terpene synthesis. When analyzing the down-regulated DEGs in H10 and H12, there were 803 DEGs enriched in signal transduction in the biological process, suggesting possible negative regulation of these DEGs in oil yield.
