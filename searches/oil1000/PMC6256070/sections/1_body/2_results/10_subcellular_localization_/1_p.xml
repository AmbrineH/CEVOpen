<p class="p">Since the majority (85%) of compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> oleoresin belong to sesquiterpenes, the two identified sequiterpene synthases, SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2, were subject to further functional analysis. 
 <italic class="italic">In silico</italic> signal peptide prediction by SignalIP showed that the two SgSTPSs were cytosolic with no signal peptide detected, which correlated well with the prediction of SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 as sesqui-TPSs. To understand the biological function, the full-length sequences of 
 <italic class="italic">SgSTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgSTPS2</italic> genes were obtained by cloning using the cDNA library of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> stem as a template and were confirmed by sequencing to have the exact sequence as those identified by transcriptome sequencing. To test the subcellular localization, the two genes 
 <italic class="italic">SgSTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgSTPS2</italic> were fused in frame with the GFP reporter gene and were transformed into 
 <italic class="italic">N. benthamiana</italic>. Confocal analysis revealed the SgSTPS1-GFP and SgSTPS2-GFP proteins were localized in the cytoplasm (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>), suggesting that SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 are responsible for sesquiterpene production in the cytosol.
