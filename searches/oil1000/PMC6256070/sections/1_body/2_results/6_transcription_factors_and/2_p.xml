<p class="p">Phytohormones, including JA, salicyclic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA), have been identified as potential regulators of specialized metabolite biosynthesis (Zhou and Memelink, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In the transcriptome data, a total of 422 unigenes were annotated as related to different hormones. Among them, nine for ethylene, eight for auxin, seven for ABA, six for brassinositol, four for cytokinin, three for SA, and two for JA pathway associated genes were detected as DEGs among samples (Figure
