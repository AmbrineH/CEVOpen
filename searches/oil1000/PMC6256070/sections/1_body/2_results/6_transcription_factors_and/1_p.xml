<p class="p">Transcription factors (TFs) have been characterized for regulating biosynthesis of terpene specialized metabolites in different plants, including AaWRKY, AaERF1, AaMYB1, AabZIP1, HbEREBP1, AsMYC2, and MsYABBY5 (Matías-Hernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Transcriptome data identified abundant transcripts for putative TFs, among which MYB families were the most abundant (493), followed by MYC (283), NAC (272), WRKY (268), and ERF (256). There were 44 MYB, 41 ERF, 37 NAC, 32 EREBP, 31 MYC, 23 WRKY, and 11 bZIP unigenes identified as DEGs (Figure

 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>. In particular, Cluster-32860.28516 annotated as WRKY (
 <italic class="italic">SgWRKY</italic>) was found to be up-regulated in both H10 and H12 compared to L4 and L6, indicating it as a possible positive regulator of terpene metabolism in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>. Co-expression pattern analysis revealed that 10 and 5 WRKY genes were co-expressed with 
 <italic class="italic">STPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">STPS2</italic>, respectively (Figures
