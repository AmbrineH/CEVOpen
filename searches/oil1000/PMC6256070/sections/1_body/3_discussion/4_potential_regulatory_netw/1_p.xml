<p class="p">TFs play a predominant role in regulating the expression of genes in various metabolic pathways. Identification of those TFs could be important for understanding the regulatory mechanism of terpene biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>. Most of the identified TFs for regulating terpene metabolites belong to the WRKY family, including 
 <italic class="italic">TcWRKY1</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus chinensis</italic> (Li S. et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">AaWRKY1</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic> (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">GaWRKY1</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">Gossypium arboreum</italic> (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">HbWRKY1</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">Hevea brasiliensis</italic> (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), which activate the expression of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the metabolite pathway. Here, we suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">SgWRKY</italic> may be a positive regulator in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> terpene biosynthesis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5A</xref>), which is consistent with the role of WRKY in other plants based on previous research. However, the regulatory role and downstream target of 
 <italic class="italic">SgWRKY</italic> in terpene biosynthesis need to be further explored and confirmed by functional analysis. More transcriptome and experimental data are needed to elucidate the metabolic regulatory network. How transcription factors are connected to the signaling pathway and how their action is integrated with other regulatory circuits await further investigation in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>.
