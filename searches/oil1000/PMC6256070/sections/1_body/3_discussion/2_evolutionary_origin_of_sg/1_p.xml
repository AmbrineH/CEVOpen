<p class="p">Based on the reaction mechanism and products formed, plant TPSs can be classified as class I, class II, or class I/II enzymes. Class I TPSs contain the DDXXD and NSE/DTE motifs that coordinate with Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> on their C-terminus. Class II TPSs include the DXDD motif for protonation-initiated cyclization of the substrate. The bifunctional class I/II diTPS harbors both functional active sites (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>, the sesquiterpene synthases, SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2, and the diterpene synthases, SgDTPS2, SgDTPS3, and SgDTPS4, contain the DDXXD and NSE/DTE motifs, suggesting that they are class I TPSs that require Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> as a cofactor. The sequence annotation, homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that both SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases. However, both SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 contain an additional EDXXD motif at the N-terminus, which in its active form contributes to class II diterpene synthase activity (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Bifunctional class I/II diterpene synthases are only known in non-vascular plants and gymnosperms. In angiosperms, all of the diterpene synthases that have been characterized to date are monofunctional, with loss of activity in one domain or the other. All of the sesquiterpene synthases are monofunctional, having retained only one active site. TPSs containing the EDXXD domain are members of the TPS-d, -c, -e, -f clades (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Furthermore, an additional RRX
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>W motif was also found at the N-terminus of the two SgSTPS genes, but it was not present in the four SgDTPS genes. The RRX
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>W motif is essential for cleavage of the transit peptide in mono- and di-terpene synthases (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Subcellular localization confirmed that the two SgSTPSs were localized in the cytosol (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> terpene synthase gene motifs may suggest the evolutionary origin of terpene synthase through domain loss or subfunctionalization from a common ancestor, which has been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Magnolia</italic> sesquiterpene synthase (Lee and Chappell, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera</italic> sesquiterpene synthases (Joyce, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This hypothesis was further supported by the enzymatic activity of the two SgSTPSs. Although SgSTPS1 mainly catalyzed the formation of sesquiterpene caryophyllene when using FPP as substrate, there were trace amounts of linalool and geraniol produced at the retention times of 10.42 and 13.37 min, respectively, when using GPP as the substrate (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S5</xref>). SgSTPS2 was confirmed to have bi-substrate capability that could catalyze both GPP and FPP to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9B</xref>). These results indicated that SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 still retain partial MTPSs activity. Multi-substrate capability was found to be usual in MTPSs and STPSs (Pazouki and Niinemets, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, there was no monoterpene discovered in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> oleoresin and no chloroplastic signal peptide could be detected in SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2. As monoterpenes are usually produced in chloroplasts through the MEP pathway, these results indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> sesquiterpene synthases may evolve through the loss of the chloroplast signal peptide. Further functional and structural characterizations are needed to decipher the evolutionary shift from mono- and di-terpene-rich oleoresin in gymnosperms to sesquiterpene-abundant oleoresin in angiosperms.
