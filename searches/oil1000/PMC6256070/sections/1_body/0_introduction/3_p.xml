<p class="p">Factors affecting terpene biosynthesis are quite complex and could include the plant developmental stage, biotic factors, such as insects and pathogens, and abiotic factors, such as light, temperature, and humidity. In 
 <italic class="italic">Picea</italic> spp., stem resin accumulates constitutively in the cortex, while it appears within the developing xylem after mechanical wounding, insect feeding, or fungal elicitation (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Some transcription factors, including the MYB, ERF, YABBY, and NAC families, have been found to regulate the biosynthesis of terpene secondary metabolites (Nieuwenhuizen et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Matías-Hernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Plant signaling molecules, especially jasmonic acid (JA), have great potential to elicit the production of terpenes in gymnosperms, herbs and crops (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ghasemzadeh et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Herbivore-induced diterpene resin in conifer trees were discovered to serve important defense functions (Keeling and Bohlmann, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hall et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">Sitka spruce</italic>, traumatic resin and terpene synthase transcripts were induced following attack by white pine weevils, and the defense response was more complex than that associated with methyl jasmonate (Miller et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>).
