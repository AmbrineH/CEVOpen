<p class="p">The angiosperm Caesalpinioideae subfamily includes the important genera 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera</italic> Linn., 
 <italic class="italic">Hymenaea</italic> Linn., and 
 <italic class="italic">Sindora</italic> Miq., which are traditionally referred to as “diesel trees” by local people (Langenheim, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). These diesel trees produce a sesquiterpene-rich oleoresin that is routinely collected when the plant trunk is drilled into and tapped.Oleoresin has been widely utilized in pharmaceuticals, fuel, essential oils and food (Peltier et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gershenzon and Dudareva, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Harvey et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, the focus of oleoresin production research in plants has been predominantly limited to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera</italic>, which is distributed in tropical America and Africa (Souza Barbosa et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Amorim et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Sindora</italic>, naturally distributed in the tropical forests of Asia and Africa, contains the species 
 <italic class="italic">Sindora glabra</italic>, which is indigenous to Hainan Island, China. The 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> tree exudes yellowish oleoresin or an amber liquid oil when wounded that has been conventionally used as kerosene. Due to its endangered state this species has been included in the second-class national protection plants of China. Studies have shown that the annual oleoresin yield of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> varies from 0.01 to 3.00 L among different individuals and the major components of the resin oil are sesquiterpenes (about 85%) and abietic acid (about 13%) (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which is a unique feature of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> oleoresin. Variation in the oil composition is present across the natural distribution range of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic>.
