<p class="p">Terpenes are one of the largest and most diverse class of plant metabolites and serve essential functions in plant growth, development, and defense. Moreover, many terpenes of specialized metabolites, such as artemisinin from 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia annua</italic> and paclitaxel from 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus baccata</italic>, have high medical value (Klayman, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1985</xref>; Sandler et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, the amount and composition of terpenes differ greatly among plant species and tissues. The gymnosperm 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> stores oleoresin in specialized resin canals and produces higher yields in spring (0.65 kg) and summer (0.55 kg) compared to autumn and winter (Lombardero et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Rodrigues and Fett-Neto, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, gymnosperm oleoresin is almost universally composed of mono- and di-terpenes. Paclitaxel are mainly extracted from tree bark, while tanshinone from 
 <italic class="italic">Saliva miltiorrhiza</italic> is extracted from roots (Ge and Wu, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis have been thoroughly studied (Tholl, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Degenhardt et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Terpenes are polymers of isoprene and are derived from the five carbon units of isopentyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are generated from the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway or the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Condensation of IPP and DMAPP by prenyltransferase contribute to the three linear intermediates, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are then catalyzed by terpene synthases (TPSs) to form monoterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">15</sub>), and diterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>) (Lichtenthaler, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Generally, the MEP pathway generates monoterpenes and diterpenes, whereas the MVA pathway produces sesquiterpenes and triterpenes. There is also some cross-talk between these two pathways, for example, the non-MVA pathway synthesizes both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in roots and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus carota</italic> (Hampel et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Products of various TPSs are further subject to structural modification through oxidation, reduction, isomerization, hydration, and conjugation to give rise to the chemical diversity of terpenes (McGarvey and Croteau, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). Many TPSs can utilize the same substrate to produce multiple products and the variation of even a single amino acid mutation in conserved domains of TPSs can alter product profiles (Li J. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Plant genomes typically contain families of many TPSs with similar sequences but that are functionally diverse, with gene numbers ranging from ~20 to 150 (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Variation in the genome and expression levels of TPSs may explain some of the variation in terpenes present in natural 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> populations. Substantial progress has been achieved in the discovery and elucidation of TPSs involved in terpene biosynthesis in tree species, including the gymnosperms 
 <italic class="italic">Abies grandis, Picea abies</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</italic>, and the angiosperms 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia, Santalum spicatum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Populus trichocarpa</italic> (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Bustos-Segura et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
