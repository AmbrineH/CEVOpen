<p class="p">Elucidation of terpene biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> provides a basis to understand oil composition and variability. With a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanism of metabolic pathways in this species, we could improve our understanding of the developmental and physiological conditions that are responsible for the production of the resin oil. This in turn may support breeding efforts toward tree improvement for oil yield and quality in sustainable 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> plantations and can afford opportunities for biotechnological 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> oil production (Bustos-Segura et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Some important genes can be identified for enhanced production of a particular terpene in either microorganisms or other plant species. In this study, comprehensive 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome analysis of high and low oil-yielding 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> was carried out. Key genes related to terpene biosynthesis were mined, and the expression patterns were validated in experiments. The function of 
 <italic class="italic">S. glabra</italic> sesquiterpene synthase was further characterized.
