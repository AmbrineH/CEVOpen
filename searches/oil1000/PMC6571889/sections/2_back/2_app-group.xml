  <p class="p">Figures S1–S24 and Tables S1–S22 are provided. Figures S1 and S13 are GC-MS chromatogram of P. cubeba and P. nigrum EOs. Tables S1–S12 are GC-MS fragmentation pattern, Figures S2a–S13a are GC-MS mass spectra, and Figures S2b–S13b are LC-ESI-MS spectra by H+ ion adduction for terpinen-4-ol, trans-chrysanthenyl acetate, δ-eIemene, α-cubebene, α-copaene, d-germacrene, γ-elemene, δ-cadinene, α-elemol, spathulenol, cubenol, and β-eudesmol detected in P. cubeba EO, respectively. Tables S13–S22 are GC-MS fragmentation pattern, Figures S14a–S24a are GC-MS mass spectra, and Figures S14b–S24b are LC-ESI-MS spectra by H+ ion adduction for β-thujene, terpinen-4-ol, δ-eIemene, α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, humulene, β-selinene, δ-cadinene, caryophyllene oxide, and cubenol detected in P. nigrum EO.</p>
