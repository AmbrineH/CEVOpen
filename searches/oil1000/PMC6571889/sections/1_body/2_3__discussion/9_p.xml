<p class="p">During stress, plants release secondary metabolites such as phenolics and flavonoids compounds. In our results, total phenolics and flavonoids contents were increased significantly in 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> when treated by 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs compared with control. Similar to our results, Ladhari et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported that lettuce enhanced accumulation of total phenolic and flavonoid contents as an adaptive response to allelochemicals from
