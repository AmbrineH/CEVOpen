<p class="p">In the antioxidant assay, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO had more anti-radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>. However, compared with BHT as positive control, both of the EOs exhibited lower antioxidant capacities. The GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS analyses indicated that terpinen-4-ol (42.41%), α-copaene (20.04%), and γ-elemene (17.68%) were the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO. In line with our results, terpinen-4-ol has been reported to have antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Whilst for 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO, β-caryophyllene (51.12%) and β-thujene (20.58%) accounted as the main components. β-caryophyllene is a compound belongs to sesquiterpenes group. This compound has also been reported to possess antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> has been reported for its methanol, ethanol, and water extracts, and essential oil [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, for 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic>, to the best of our knowledge only methanol, ethanol, and water extracts have been reported [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], while antioxidant activity of its essential is remain unknown. Antioxidant properties of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EOs in this study may be attribute to the presence of terpinen-4-ol and β-caryophyllene, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs may be useful for anti-oxidative stress treatment.
