<p class="p">Allelochemicals from EOs generally affected chlorophyll synthesis. In our study, both of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO reduced pigments contents by 41.76 to 49.43% stronger than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> at concentration 1.93 mg/mL. These pigments reduction suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs inhibited photosynthesis, due the loss of chlorophylls concentration in two of indicator plants. These results are similar with previous studies which reported that EOs reduced chlorophylls and carotenoid contents [
