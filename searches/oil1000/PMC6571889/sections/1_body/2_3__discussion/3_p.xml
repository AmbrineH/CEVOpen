<p class="p">In the antihyperuricemic activitiy, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs possessed ability to inhibit xanthine oxidase. However, the inhibitory effects of the two EOs were lower than allopurinol (20.45 µg/ mL) as positive control of xanthine inhibitory assay. Compared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 54.87 µg/mL) had more inhibitory effect. Inhibitory effects of EOs on xanthine oxidase have been reported from several plants for example

 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In line with our study, Tu and Tawata [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] reported the presence of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes may be responsible to antyhiperuricemic property of EOs.
