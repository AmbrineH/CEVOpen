<p class="p">The GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS analyses revealed that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs. Bos et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported the main components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO extracted from its berries were β-elemene (9.4%) and sabinene (9.1%). In contrast, we detected terpinen-4-ol (42.41%), α-copaene (20.04%), and γ-elemene (17.68) as the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO. γ-Elemene is isomere of β-elemene, whereas sabinene was also detected in our study as trace element (&lt;0.02%) (data not shown). In case 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO, β-caryophyllene (51.12%) was the dominant compound detected. Similarly, Morshed et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and Bagheri et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] reported β-caryophyllene was the main compound of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO. The changes of chemical components of EOs may have resulted from several factors such as environmental (climatic, geographic or seasonal) and genetic differences.
