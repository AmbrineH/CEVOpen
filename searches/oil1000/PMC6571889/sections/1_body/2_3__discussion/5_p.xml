<p class="p">In the herbicidal assay, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, two of the most problematic weeds, were employed as indicator plants. 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO exhibited more inhibitory effects. In agreement with our results, several herbicidal activities of EOs have been attributed to the presence of flavonoids, saponins [
