<p class="p">The present study evaluated antioxidant, antihyperuricemic, and herbicidal activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs, and examined their chemical compositions. Xanthine oxidase, the key enzyme played vital roles to cause hyperuricemia and gout, was employed to evaluate inhibitory capacity of these EOs. Two noxious weeds, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, were selected as indicator plants in herbicidal assays. Physiological and biochemical responses of the two indicator plants to 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs were also evaluated.
