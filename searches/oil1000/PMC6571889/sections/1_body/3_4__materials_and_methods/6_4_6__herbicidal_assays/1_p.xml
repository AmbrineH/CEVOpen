<p class="p">The herbicidal assays were conducted according to the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs were dispersed in Tween 20 and subsequently diluted with distilled water to obtain several concentrations of samples (final concentration of Tween 20 &lt; 0.02%). A volume of 300 µL of sample was pipetted in a 12-well plate (22.1 mm diameter × 35 mm) lined with filter paper. The seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and E. 
 <italic class="italic">crus-galli</italic> were sterilized with sodium hypochlorite (5%) for 5 min, rinsed by distilled water, and placed in the well plate. The well plates were then kept in a growth chamber (Biotron NC system, Nippon Medical &amp; Chemical Instrument, Co. Ltd.; Osaka, Japan) and additional volume of 50 µL distilled water was added subsequently at 2 to 5 days. Photoperiod was set up 12/12 h day/night with temperature 28/25 °C. After five days, germination percentages, and root and shoot lengths over the controls were recorded and expressed as the percentage of inhibition. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value presented the concentration required to inhibit 50% of germination, shoot height, and root length was also calculated.
