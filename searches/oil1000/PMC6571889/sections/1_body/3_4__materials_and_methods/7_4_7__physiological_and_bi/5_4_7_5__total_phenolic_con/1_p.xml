A volume of 20 µL of either sample solution (1.0 mg/mL), or gallic acid standard solution (5–25 µg/mL) was pipetted into separate wells of a 96-well microplate. A volume of 100 µL of the FC reagent (10%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> in water) was added to each well, thoroughly mixed, and an aliquot of 80 µL sodium carbonate (5%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> in water) was then added. The reaction mixture was then incubated at ambient condition for 30 min and the absorbance was read at 765 nm by using a microplate reader. The total phenolic contents were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of fresh weight (r
