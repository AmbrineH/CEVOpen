 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The column used for the LC system was a JASCO J-Pak Symphonia C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm). Two solvents for the mobile phase were 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The proportion of these solvents was 30:70 (A:B), flowrate was 0.4 mL/min, volume of sample injection was 5 µL, and operation time was 30 min. For ESI-MS, the flow rate of sheath gas was 60, while auxiliary gas was 20 arbitrary units of sheath gas. The spray voltage was 4.5 kV. The measurements were performed in the positive mode. For positive polarity, Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS)/orbitrap with 60,000 resolutions, and scan ranged from 100–1000 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> was applied for mass analysis. For negative polarity, ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS)/linear ion trap with scan range 115–1000

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> was employed [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Peak processing was conducted using Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser software (ThermoScientific
