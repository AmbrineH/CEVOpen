<p class="p">A volume of 1 µL of each sample was injected into a GC-MS system (JMS-T100 GCV, JEOL Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan). The column was DB-5MS with 30 m in length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 µm in thickness (Agilent Technologies, J &amp; W Scientific Products, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was chosen as a carrier gas, and the split ratio was 5.0/1.0. The operating condition of GC oven temperature was maintained as follows: the initial temperature was set up at 50 °C without hold time, the temperature was increased at a rate of 10 °C/min up to a final temperature of 300 °C (hold for 20 min). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 300 °C and 320 °C, respectively. The mass range scanned from 29–800 amu. The obtained peak was analyzed using JEOL’s GC-MS Mass Center System version 2.65a.</p>
