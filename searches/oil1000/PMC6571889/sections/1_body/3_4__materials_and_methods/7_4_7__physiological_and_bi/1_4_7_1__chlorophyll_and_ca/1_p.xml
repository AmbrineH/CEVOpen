<p class="p">The chlorophylls (a, b, and total chlorophylls) and carotenoids were determined following the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. An amount of 100 mg fresh weight leaves of 5-days old 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> seedlings was placed in a microtube, ground, and added 1.5 mL of 80% acetone. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant of the mixture was recorded at 663, 645 nm and 440 nm using a microplate reader (Multiskan
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Microplate Spectrophotometer). The pigment contents were expressed as Âµg/mg fresh weight and calculated following the equations:
