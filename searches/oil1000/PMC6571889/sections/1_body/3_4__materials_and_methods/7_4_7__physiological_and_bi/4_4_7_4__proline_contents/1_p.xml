 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Initially, 10 mg of powder of dry roots and aerial parts from the two indicator plants were homogenized with 1.5 mL of 3% sulfosalicylic acid. The homogenate solution was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (250 µL) from each homogenate was mixed with 250 µL glacial acetic acid and 250 µL ninhydrin reagent (1.25 g ninhydrin in 30 mL glacial acetic and 20 mL 6 M H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) in a fresh tube. After, the tubes were incubated at 100 °C for 1 h in a water bath and they rapidly cooled in an ice bath to stop the reaction. Finally, 500 µL mL of toluene was added to each tube. The absorbance of the pink-red upper phase was recorded at 520 nm against toluene blank. L-Proline (2.5 to 50 µg/mL) was used as a standard.
