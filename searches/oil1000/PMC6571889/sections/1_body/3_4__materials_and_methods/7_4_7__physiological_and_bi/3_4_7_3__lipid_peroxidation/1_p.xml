<p class="p">The lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Fresh samples of roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> (100 mg) were ground and homogenized in 1.5 mL of 0.1% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Afterward, the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant (250 µL) was transferred to a microtube and added 750 µL 0.5% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in 20% TCA. The mixture was then incubated at 90 °C for 10 min in a dry bath incubator (MS-100 Thermo Shaker Incubator, On Wing Tat Co. Ltd.; Kowloon, Hong Kong) and cooled in an ice bath for five min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min, the absorbance of supernatant was recorded at 532 and 600 nm by using a microplate reader (Multiskan
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Microplate Spectrophotometer). The MDA accumulation was calculated using the Δ (A532 − A600) equation and an extinction coefficient (ε = 155 m/M/cm). The results were expressed as nmol MDA/g fresh weight by following the equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">MDA (mM/L) = (A
  <sub class="sub">532</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">600</sub>)/ε
  <label class="label">(9)</label>
 </disp-formula>
