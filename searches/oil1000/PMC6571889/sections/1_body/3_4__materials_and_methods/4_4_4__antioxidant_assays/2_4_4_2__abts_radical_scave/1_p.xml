<p class="p">A solution of 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS) was employed to evaluate the radical scavenging activity of EOs according to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] with minor adjustments. The ABTS working solution was generated by a reaction of 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate solution after incubation at room temperature in the dark for 16 h. The mixture was then diluted with methanol until obtain an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.05 at 734 nm. Initially, the ABTS working solution (120 µL) was added to samples (24 µL) or standard containing different concentration. Finally, the mixture was incubated in the dark at ambient condition for 30 min. The absorbance was recorded at 734 nm using microplate a reader (Multiskan
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Microplate Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Osaka, Japan). BHT standard (5–125 µg/mL) was used as a positive control. The calculation of ABTS radical scavenging activity was the same with DPPH method.
