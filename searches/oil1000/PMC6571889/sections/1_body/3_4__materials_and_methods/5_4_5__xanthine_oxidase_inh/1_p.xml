<p class="p">The xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity was assayed spectrophotometrically in vitro under aerobic condition according to the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01876" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Briefly, a volume of 50 µL sample or standard was mixed with 35 µL of 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5), and 30 µL of fresh xanthine oxidase solution (0.01 units/mL in 70 mM phosphate buffer, pH = 7.5) in a 96-well microplate. After pre-incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, the reaction was then initiated by adding 60 µL of substrate solution (150 µM xanthine in the same buffer) and incubated in the same temperature for 30 min. To stop the reaction, a volume of 25 µL HCl (1 M) was added. The absorbance was recorded at 290 nm with a microplate reader. For the blank, the assay mixture was prepared in its present condition, but the enzyme solution was pipetted after adding HCl. One unit of XO was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce one µmol of uric acid/min at 25 °C. The XO inhibitory activity was calculated as follows:
