 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs are the volatile oils contented rich bioactive sources and healthy values. In this study, we found that these EOs possessed antioxidant, antihyperuricemic, and herbicidal activities. Compared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO indicated stronger of antioxidant, antihyperuricemic, and herbicidal activities. In the herbicidal assay, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> decreased chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophylls, and carotenoids contents of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, but induced electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, total phenolic, total flavonoid, and proline contents. GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS analyses revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs had complex mixture of compounds that consisted of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Terpinen-4-ol (42.41%), followed by α-copaene (20.04%) and γ-elemene (17.68%) were accounted as the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO. Whereas, β-caryophyllene (51.12%) and β-thujene (20.58%) were the dominant components of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO. Findings of this study suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs are promising source to treat oxidative stress and antihyperuricemia diseases as well as natural herbicide against 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>.
