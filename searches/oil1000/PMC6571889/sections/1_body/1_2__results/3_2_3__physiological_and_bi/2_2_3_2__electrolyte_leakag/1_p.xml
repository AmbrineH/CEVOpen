<p class="p">The variation of electrolyte leakage (EL) from the roots and aerial parts of treated and untreated 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> by EOs were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01876-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Generally, EOs treatments increased EL percentage compared with control. Compared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO gave more effects in increasing of electrolyte leakage percentage in the roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> after 24 h and 48 h treatments. The leakages were greater after 48 h, compared with 24 h.
