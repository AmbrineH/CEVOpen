<p class="p">Total flavonoid contents (TFC) in the roots and aerial parts between treated and untreated of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> were showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01876-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. Both in the roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, TFC were increased significantly when treated by EOs compared with control. The aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> showed the maximum response in total flavonoids accumulations. 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO gave more stimulation of total phenol accumulation for 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> by 68.04 and 56.46% in the roots and 39.67 and 39.19% in the aerial parts respectively than
