<p class="p">The responses of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs treatments in lipid peroxidation accumulations were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01876-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Lipid peroxidation, expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, were increased significantly in both EOs treatments compared with control. Accumulation of MDA in 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> was the highest as responses of EOs treatments. Compared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO gave more stimulation effects in MDA accumulation both in 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. cruss-galli</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO induced MDA accumulation both in 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> by 37.46 and 50.18% in the roots and 11.26 and 10.82% in the aerial parts respectively.
