<p class="p">Antioxidant and antihyperuricemic activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs were presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01876-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO showed higher inhibitory effects on both antioxidant and antihyperuricemic activities. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO in DPPH and ABTS assays were 0.28 and 0.24-folds stronger than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>. In line with antioxidant capacity, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO also exhibited more inhibitory effect on xanthine oxidase than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>. However, compared with BHT and allopurinol as positive controls of antioxidant and XOI activities, both of EOs presented lower inhibitory effects.
