<p class="p">The inhibitory effects (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EOs on germination and growth of two noxious weeds, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, were indicated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01876-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The values of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the two EOs on germination and growth of indicator plants were varied. Inhibitory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO on the roots and shoots elongation of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pilosa</italic> were 4.16 and 37.74% stronger than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> respectively. Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO gave more 18.72% inhibition effects on the shoot growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. cruss-gali</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO. It appears that 
 <italic class="italic">P. cubeba</italic> EO may contain more growth inhibitors than 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> EO.
