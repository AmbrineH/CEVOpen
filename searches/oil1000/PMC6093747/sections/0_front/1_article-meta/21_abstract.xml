 <p class="p">Beta-keratin in poultry feathers is a structural protein that is resistant to degradation due to disulfide and hydrogen bonds. Feather meal can be a valuable feed compound if the digestibility can be increased. The objective of the present study was to analyze the effects of chemical, enzymatic, and pressure-thermic treatments for chicken feathers on solubility, in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), and amino acid composition of solubilized and residual fractions. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, models for solubility and IVPD were developed including the above factors applying a central composite face-centered design. Addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfite (Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub>), and autoclaving time affected solubility and IVPD of the feather hydrolysates, but not addition of keratinolytic enzyme. In experiment 2, 7 combinations of the hydrolysis factors NaOH, Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and autoclaving time with a predicted IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM, calculated for the sum of solubilized and residual feather fractions, were included to measure effects on IVPD and amino acid composition in each fraction. The IVPD values were higher for solubilized than residual fractions when treated with NaOH and autoclaving, but no differences were found when treated with Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> and autoclaving. Losses of cystine were substantial for all treatments, but lower for Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> than for NaOH. Furthermore, use of lower Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration and longer autoclaving time reduced losses of cystine. Compared with NaOH treatments, Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> gave lower losses of threonine, arginine, serine, and tyrosine. With reference to the ideal protein profile for Atlantic salmon (
  <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic> L.), the treatments with 60 or 90 min autoclaving and 0.36 or 0.21% Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> had the highest chemical scores. The scores were generally higher for amino acids in residual than solubilized fractions, but with 90 min autoclaving and 0.21% Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> differences were small. In conclusion, hydrolysis of chicken feathers with low concentrations of Na
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> combined with autoclaving results in feather meal with high nutritional value for Atlantic salmon; separation of solubilized and residual fractions is not necessary.
