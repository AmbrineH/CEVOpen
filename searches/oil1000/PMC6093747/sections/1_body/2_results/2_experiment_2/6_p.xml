<p class="p">The chemical scores showed that lysine and histidine were the first and second limiting essential AA in combined soluble and residual fractions, assessed as feed for Atlantic salmon in the growth interval from 1.4 to 2.8 kg body weight (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>). For treatments 5 and 6 only lysine and histidine had scores below 100, which was also the case for the commercial feather meal. For the treatments 3 to 5 AA had a chemical score below 100. The chemical scores of the separated fractions showed that the residual fractions of treatment 5 and 6 had only 2 scores below 100; however, the solubilized fractions of treatments 6 and 7 had chemical scores close to 100 for tryptophan and are therefore similar to the residual fractions of treatments 5 and 6 (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table" class="xref">9</xref>).
