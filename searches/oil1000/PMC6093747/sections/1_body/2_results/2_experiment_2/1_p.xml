<p class="p">The average total IVPD across all treatments was 863 g/kg of DM (SEM 16.8, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.18), which was slightly lower than predicted, and considerably higher than the IVPD of the untreated feathers and the commercial feather meal (Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). The solubility of DM was considerably higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt;0.001) for treatments including NaOH alone (on average 817 g/kg of DM) than for Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> alone (on average 198 g/kg of DM). A similar effect was found for the solubilities of N (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt;0.001) and C (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt;0.001). An interaction between hydrolysis treatment and fractionation was observed for IVPD. For treatments including only NaOH the IVPD values were higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt;0.001) in solubilized than in residual fractions, whereas no differences were found between fractions of the Na
