<p class="p">Untreated feathers had a total AA concentration of 971 g/kg of DM with the prevailing AA being serine, glutamic acid + glutamine, leucine, proline, valine, and cystine (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The AA composition of commercial feather meal was comparable to that of the untreated feathers except for the proportion of cystine, which was considerably lower. Calculated for combined solubilized and residual fractions, the treatments with only NaOH had higher proportions of leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, asparagine/aspartic acid, glutamine/glutamic acid, hydroxylysine, and proline compared to the treatments with only Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. For threonine, arginine, cystine, serine, taurine, and tyrosine the proportions were higher for the Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> treatments. Proportions of cystine were low compared to untreated feathers, but also compared to the commercial feather meal. The highest proportion of cystine was found in treatment 6, but even there the recovery of cystine was only 377 g/kg (Supplementary Table S1). Decreasing Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration and at the same time increasing autoclaving time increased the recovery of cystine. Substantial losses were found for lysine (mean recovery: 722 g/kg) and for threonine, serine, tyrosine, and arginine when treated with NaOH (mean recovery: 596 g/kg), but losses were small when treated with Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> treatments (908 g/kg). Recovery rates close to 100% were found for glutamine/glutamic acid, proline, and glycine. For 30-min autoclaving, the proportions of cystine, glutamine/glutamic acid, proline, and serine were higher than for 90 min. Total AA concentrations were higher (
