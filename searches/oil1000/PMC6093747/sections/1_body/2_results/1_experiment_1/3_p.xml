<p class="p">Total IVPD increased with increasing concentrations of both NaOH and Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. For autoclaving time the model indicated increase in total IVPD between 80 and 100 min, but a rapid reduction of IVPD for longer autoclaving times. None of the studied factors alone was enough to achieve a total IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM, but the model indicates that this could be achieved by combining the factors NaOH, Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and autoclaving time. The predicted solubility varied significantly among the treatments with a predicted total IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM. The model for total IVPD was used to design experiment 2.
