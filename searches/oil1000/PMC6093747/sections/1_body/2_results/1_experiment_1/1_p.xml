<p class="p">Dry matter solubility and pH of feathers were affected by NaOH and autoclaving time (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Enzyme or Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> had no effect. The enzyme activity of Cibenza IDN900 measured with casein in a 10-min incubation at 30°C gave 170 nkat/g at pH 7.5, 310 nkat/g at pH 9.0, and 220 nkat/g at pH 12.8, which was low compared to a minimum of 1.1 mkat/g stated by the producer.
