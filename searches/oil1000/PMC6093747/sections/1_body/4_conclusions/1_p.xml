<p class="p">The present study confirmed that NaOH, Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and autoclaving time affect solubility, IVPD, and AA composition in chicken feather hydrolysates. Under the conditions in experiment 1, the tested proteolytic enzymes alone or in combination with the above treatments did not have any effects on these response variables. A total IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM can be achieved by different combinations of NaOH, Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and autoclaving. Adding low concentrations of Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> combined with an autoclaving time of 60 to 90 min results in hydrolysates with high IVPD and low losses of AA. For this hydrolysis treatment, lysine and histidine are the only limiting essential AA compared to ideal protein for Atlantic salmon. Separation of solubilized and residual fractions is most likely not feasible due to small differences between the fractions in chemical scores for the most relevant treatments (treatments 5 and 6) studied here. A limiting factor for the use of hydrolyzed chicken feathers as a feed component is the high concentration of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and ash. Fractionation can be used in treatments with low solubility to keep ash concentration of the residual fraction low. If fractionation is not an option, treatments resulting in slightly lower IVPD may be considered to further improve AA composition and lower salt content.
