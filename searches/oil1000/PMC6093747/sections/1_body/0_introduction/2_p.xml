<p class="p">According to EU regulations, hydrolyzed proteins derived from parts of non-ruminants such as feather meal may be used as feed for non-ruminant farmed animals and aquaculture animals (EC, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In 2013, 109 million tonnes of poultry meat were produced worldwide (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Assuming a meat yield of 460 g/kg body weight and a feather proportion 75 g/kg of body weight (Owens et al., 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) in the live birds, the estimated potential yield of poultry feathers accounted for 17.8 million tonnes worldwide in 2013. However, only a small proportion of poultry feather are processed to feather meal in Europe and the USA, about 175,000 and 600,000 tonnes of feather meal are produced annually, respectively (Swisher, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Feather meal produced by pressure-thermic treatment has a typical protein content of over 800 g/kg of DM with a large variation in true AA digestibility depending on the processing method (Wang and Parsons, 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). In the study of Moritz and Latshaw (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>), increased pressure from 2.1 to 5.2 bar for 36 min at 149°C increased in vitro pepsin (0.2%) digestible protein from 704 to 938 g/kg, but true available AA content, determined in White Leghorn cockerels, was reduced for most AA. In the same study, the content of cystine decreased with increased pressure during cooking and was converted to lanthionine, whereas other AA were less affected.
