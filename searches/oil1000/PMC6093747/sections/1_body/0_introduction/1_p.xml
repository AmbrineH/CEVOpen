<p class="p">Poultry feathers are animal by-products with a high protein content. Approximately 900Â g/kg of the feather dry matter (
 <bold class="bold">DM</bold>) consists of beta-keratin, a structure protein rich in the essential amino acids (
 <bold class="bold">AA</bold>) leucine, valine, arginine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and threonine, but with smaller proportions of lysine, methionine, histidine, and tryptophan (Yokote et al., 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Bandegan et al., 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The sulfur-containing cysteine and methionine (Glem-Hansen, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>), together with threonine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, are important for the synthesis of hair and feather keratin; arginine plays an important role in the urea cycle of cats (Morris and Rogers, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1978</xref>). However, a surplus of AA such as valine and isoleucine in feed can be toxic for some animals. In some countries, feather meal is used as a feed component for animals such as pigs, pets, fish, poultry, and ruminants, but due to the unbalanced AA composition, feather meal can only be a complementary feedstuff in diets for monogastrics (Papadopoulos et al., 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1986</xref>) and supplementation with lysine, histidine, and other AA may be required. Because of disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions between AA, feather keratin is insoluble in water and has a low digestibility with enzymes such as pepsin (Papadopoulos et al., 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1986</xref>). The digestibility of feathers can be improved and AA made biologically available through cleaving the bonds by pressure-thermic treatments, chemical hydrolysis, and steam explosion (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), and by action of keratinolytic microorganisms and keratinolytic enzymes (Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Lasekan et al., 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Degradation of keratin, as a result of pressure-thermic treatment, which is typically applied in commercial production of feather meal, is often accompanied by a decrease in cystine content and processing may also decrease the digestibility or availability of AA in general (Moritz and Latshaw, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). A growing volume of studies suggests improved digestibility, lower AA losses, and decreased energy requirements for cooking if enzymatic hydrolysis is included in the process (Gupta and Ramnani, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Pedersen et al., 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Applying more gentle treatments to feathers has a potential to decrease losses of valuable AA and increase the digestibility of feather meal.
