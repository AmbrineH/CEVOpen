<p class="p">Feathers from white broiler chicken (
 <italic class="italic">Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>, breed Ross 308) were collected at a slaughterhouse in Eidsberg municipality in Norway (Nortura SA, Oslo, Norway). Chicken slaughtered at Nortura are typically 50 d old at slaughtering and feathers are removed mechanically, transported in a water bath, and collected after the water is removed mechanically. Feathers were stored frozen (–20°C) until experimental use. In experiment 1, the feathers were washed (by hand in tap water), sterilized in an autoclave (2 bar, 121°C, 15 min), dried (at 45°C for 48 h), and kept frozen (–20°C). In experiment 2, the feathers were washed, dried, and kept frozen. Prior to experiment 1, the feathers were milled in an ultrafine friction grinder (MKCA6–2, Masuko Sangyo Co. Ltd, Japan). The grinder was equipped with MKC type stainless steel fillings. During grinding the feathers were fed into the hopper and forced through a gap between rotary and stator grinding plates. Feathers were ground successively with gap widths of 7, 2, and 1 mm. Dry matter content of the milled feathers was 947 g/kg. In experiment 2, whole feathers with a DM content of 957 g/kg and a fat content of 22.6 g/kg of DM were used. These feathers were not autoclaved or ground in order to have a more realistic approach. Commercial feather meal, GoldMehl FM (GePro, Diepholz, Germany) was used as a reference in the digestibility studies. Two commercial enzymes, both described by the producers to be efficient in hydrolyzing feathers, were compared in experiment 1. Cibenza IDN900 was kindly donated by Novus International, Inc. (St. Charles, MO). The product contains sodium sulfate, dried 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> fermentation solubles, mineral oil, and natural flavor. The producer stated a minimum enzyme activity of 1.1 mkat/g. NovoProD was kindly donated by Novozymes, Bagsværd, Denmark. This product is a non-specific protease, and contains subtilisin initially obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>. We found an activity of 12.6 μkat/g at pH 7.5 with casein. Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was obtained from BDH Prolabo (VWR International, Pty Ltd., Tingalpa, Australia) and porcine pepsin (activity 167 μkat/g with casein) was obtained from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., St. Louis, MO).
