<p class="p">The model for total IVPD achieved in experiment 1 was used to design treatments with predicted total IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). We aimed to develop feather meals with high digestibility compared to commercial feather meals. However, maximizing the total IVPD implies a risk of degrading AA. Solubility, IVPD, and concentrations of N, C, Na, S, and ash were measured in solubilized and residual material with the aim to detect the fraction with highest feed value.
