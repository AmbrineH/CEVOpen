<p class="p">Response surface methodology was used to map the effects of a set of hydrolysis factor levels (NaOH, Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, enzymes, pressure-thermic treatment time) on solubility and IVPD of the products. A central composite face-centered design with 4 factors and 3 levels of each factor was applied to study second-order response surfaces (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). A total of 27 runs were conducted in 2 replicates. The measured effects included solubility, IVPD in solubilized and residual fractions, and total IVPD was calculated. The treatments were performed on 3 subsequent days, where day 1 comprised the runs with boiling for 30 min, day 2 autoclaving (2.4 bar, 133°C) for 60 min, and day 3 autoclaving (2.4 bar, 133°C) for 120 min.
