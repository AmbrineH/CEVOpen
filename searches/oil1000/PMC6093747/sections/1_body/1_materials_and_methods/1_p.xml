<p class="p">Two experiments were conducted to study the effects of hydrolysis treatments on IVPD and AA composition of solubilized and residual feather fractions. Experiment 1 was designed to model the effects of chemical, enzymatic, and pressure-thermic hydrolysis on solubility and IVPD. Sodium hydroxide and Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were selected as chemical agents, and 2 commercial enzymes were tested. Experiment 2 was designed to verify the model, which was established from data achieved in experiment 1, and to study effects on IVPD and AA composition in a series of treatments predicted to produce constant IVPD values for the sum of solubilized and residual fractions of hydrolyzed feathers (hereafter referred to as total IVPD).
