<p class="p">In both experiments, solubilized and residual fractions were separated by centrifugation (Sorvall RC 12BP, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA; 3,963 × g for 15 min, ambient temperature) and the liquid phase was poured into separate containers. The pH in the liquid fraction was measured (Knick pH-Meter 766, Calimatic, Knick Elektronische Messgeräte GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) and both fractions were freeze dried (Christ Epsilon 2–25 DS, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) and weighed. The solubilized fraction was crushed with a spoon and stored in tight plastic bags at –20°C until analysis. The residual fraction was ground through a 0.5-mm screen (Fritsch Pulverisette 14, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) and stored in tight plastic bags at –20°C until analysis. Separation of soluble and non-soluble fractions is denoted fractionation in the following.</p>
