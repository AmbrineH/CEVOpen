<p class="p">Dry matter solubility was calculated as DM yield of solubilized feather hydrolysates divided by the initial sample weight (DM). For calculation of N and C solubility, the weights were multiplied with the concentrations of N or C. The IVPD was calculated as weight of the initial sample subtracted the weight of the residual fraction after dissolution in pepsin and HCl, divided by weight of the initial feather sample. Total IVPD was calculated as sum of IVPD for the solubilized and the residual fractions from feather hydrolysis, weighted by the proportions of solubilized and residual fractions measured in the hydrolysis step. Recovery of a specific AA was calculated as: Yield of solubilized feather hydrolysates multiplied with concentration of the AA in the solubilized fraction added the yield of residual feather hydrolysates multiplied with the concentration of the AA in the residual fraction, divided by initial feather weight multiplied with the concentration of total AA. Dietary protein quality was assessed by determining its chemical score, i.e., the ratio of the limiting AA in the tested feed (g/16 g of N) divided by the AA in ideal protein for the specific animal (g/16 g of N), multiplied with 100.</p>
