<p class="p">Aiming for a total IVPD lower than 90% in experiment 2 would have resulted in more gentle treatments with lower inclusion level of additives and shorter autoclaving time and thus processing with lower costs. Applying more gentle treatments may affect AA composition and most likely lower losses of AA may occur. According to the model in experiment 1, a total IVPD of 750 g/kg of DM could have been obtained by autoclaving for 80 min without any addition of additives. In a commercial process, the use of water must be lowered significantly to reduce processing and drying expenses. This requires further investigation. Lower inclusion levels of sodium salts would also decrease levels of undesired Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> in the hydrolysates. Despite the association of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> with the solubilized fractions, the concentrations in residual fractions were also high and significantly higher than in the commercial feather meal. Addition of salts may have led to slightly overestimated IVPD values, because it can be assumed that Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2−</sup> were associated with the soluble fraction in the IVPD analysis. The IVPD of all treatments was considerably higher compared to the commercial feather meal, and correction for added salts alone can most likely not explain the increase in digestibility. The feed industry requests feedstuffs with a digestibility over 700 g/kg of DM and thus the experimental treatments may result in an added value compared to the tested commercial feather meal. However, in vivo measurements are necessary for a more reliable evaluation of the digestibility. Na and S from the added salts contributed heavily to the ash content in the hydrolysates. With regard to Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and ash concentrations the residual fractions are preferred as a feed component. Higher Na concentration can be easily accepted in salmon feed compared with feed for terrestrial animals, but increased salt content will in any case lower the feed value due to dilution of the feed.
