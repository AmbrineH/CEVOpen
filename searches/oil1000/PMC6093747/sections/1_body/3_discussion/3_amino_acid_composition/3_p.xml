<p class="p">Separating solubilized from residual fractions allows for production of fractions with different AA composition, depending on hydrolysis treatment. The residual fractions from Na

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> treatments (treatments 4, 5, and 6) had a higher nutritional value when high contents of cystine and lysine are requested. The solubilized fractions with higher proportions of histidine, isoleucine, and methionine may be interesting for cat feed, with high requirements of these AA. The chemical scores for Atlantic salmon of the combined fractions confirm that treatments 5 and 6 are the best treatments where the residual fractions have slightly higher scores than the solubilized fractions. However, differences between combined fractions and separated fractions were insignificant, and therefore the AA composition alone does not warrant separation.
