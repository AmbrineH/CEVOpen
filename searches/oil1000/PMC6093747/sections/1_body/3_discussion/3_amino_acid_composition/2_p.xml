 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from the treatment required inclusion of NaOH (over 0.25%) and autoclaving with the corresponding autoclaving time to reach a total IVPD of 900 g/kg of DM. Treatment 6, with no NaOH and the longest autoclaving time, had the best recovery rate of cystine and sum of all AA. This indicates that the way of action differs for the applied reagents. Hence, high digestibility and low losses of AA may be achieved by application of Na
