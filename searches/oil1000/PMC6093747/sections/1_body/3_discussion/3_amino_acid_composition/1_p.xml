<p class="p">The low recovery rates of cystine were most likely caused by cleavage of disulfide bonds resulting in the formation of cysteine and cysteic acid, which were not analyzed. However, oxidation of dipeptide cystine may also have occurred during sample preparation prior to analysis, and may have led to an underestimation of cysteine proportions. Cystine was also the AA with the highest losses in the study of Moritz and Latshaw (
