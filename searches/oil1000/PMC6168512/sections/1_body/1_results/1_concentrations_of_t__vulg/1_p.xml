<p id="Par7" class="p">Nectar and pollen terpene content differed from each other by more than two orders of magnitude, with pollen showing highest concentrations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Carvacrol, thymol, geraniol, linalool, α-terpineol and trans-sabinene hydrate were detectable at 0.24 to 7.67 ppm in nectar samples collected from distinct chemotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the acetates, only α-terpinyl acetate was present in nectar with 1.69 ppm. Data for pollen samples were only available for the A-, G-, and L-chemotype with values ranging from 17.11 ppm for geranyl acetate (G-type) to 742.06 ppm for linalool (L-type). The ratio between major terpene and the corresponding acetate differed from 2.5-times (G-type) to 8.5-times (L-type), with the exception that the acetate was more present (4.2-times) than the non-acetate for the A-type pollen (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
