<p id="Par14" class="p">The EAG responses differed strongly between the two different groups of bees (GLM:

 <sub class="sub">1,114</sub> = 25.17,

 <sub class="sub">8,114</sub> = 29.22,

 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. forager), on the level of single substance comparison, was observed for geranyl acetate where forager bees responded much more strongly than the others (Bonferroni post-hoc test,
