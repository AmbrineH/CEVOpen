<p id="Par15" class="p">Among the tested substances, the EAG responses can be clustered in three major groups: (1) low response (mean ± SD: 0.16 ± 0.23 mV, min-max: −0.43–0.64 mV) - carvacrol and thymol, (2) medium response (0.80 ± 0.52 mV, −0.35–1.97 mV) - linalyl acetate, α-terpineol, and α-terpinyl acetate, and (3) high response (1.47 ± 0.51 mV, 0.49–2.31 mV) - geraniol, geranyl acetate, linalool, trans-sabinene hydrate (Fig.
