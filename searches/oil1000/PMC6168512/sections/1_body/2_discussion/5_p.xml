<p id="Par20" class="p">Acute and chronic terpene consumption not only influences toxicity for the host but also effectivity against its parasites and pathogens. Chronic thymol feeding (0.2 ppm for 10 days) had no effect on the trypanosome 
 <italic class="italic">Lotmaria passim</italic>, the microsporidium 
 <italic class="italic">Nosema ceranae</italic> and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), though a single dose reduced DWV loads

 </sup>. This shows that not only must the above mentioned criteria be taken into account for estimating antibiotic activities, but also host genotype, age, and parasite strain. Lastly, a recent study showed that repeated experiments led to variable EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (5–50 ppm)

 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies are urgently needed for bacterial bee diseases and brood diseases. Most of the aforementioned facts result from adult bee infections with viruses or eukaryotes that live intracellularly or in the gut system. The trypanosomes (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Crithidia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lotmaria</italic>) are single cell eukaryote organisms attached to the gut epithelium, whereas bacteria like 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">plutonius</italic> are single cell prokaryotes that also live in the gut but might cluster together to better survive the hosts’ defence system
