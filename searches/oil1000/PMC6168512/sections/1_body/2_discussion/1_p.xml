<p id="Par16" class="p">One aspect of this study was the quantification of nectar and pollen terpenes as representative of plant secondary metabolites that may have a central role in plant-pathogen-pollinator interaction with bees foraging for biologically active plant products

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Quantification revealed that terpene concentration varies by several orders of magnitude for nectar and pollen samples of the different 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> chemotypes. However, in-hive concentrations might be lower or possibly higher due to the bees’ handling of nectar and pollen. Once the forager bees collect nectar and offered it to the in-hive bees, nectar will be modified (mostly an increase in viscosity and the addition of bee enzymes) during the process of ripening and finally stored as honey
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup>. This process will significantly affect the final concentration of nectar volatiles (essential oils) in the stored product, which has a highly reduced water content (approx. 19% or less) in comparison to nectar
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>
 </sup>. On the one hand, ripening and thickening will concentrate nectar metabolites, but on the other hand, highly volatile essential oils might evaporate by increased fanning activity before cell sealing

 </sup>. The complete process of honey ripening
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup>, especially substance in- or decreasing is not well investigated 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>, and in particular not for thyme nectar. Only a few studies estimated terpene content of thyme honey and found values in concentrations that are known to reduce pathogen loads
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup> (thymol: 0.27 ppm for thyme honey, 0.12–0.36 ppm for non-thyme honeys)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup> or with very low values: carvacrol (0.9%), linalool (0.1%), α-terpineol (0.1%), and thymol (0.1%)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup>. More informative values, not only given in percentage against the total peak area
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup>, also showed very low concentrations for carvacrol (max. 0.017 ppm), linalool (max. 0.12 ppm), α-terpineol (max. 0.043 ppm), and thymol (max. 0.018 ppm) for different honeys including thyme honey
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup>. A plausible explanation for the high variance are differences in storage conditions (e.g. storage time, temperature, or light) by the beekeeper, time of honey harvest and delay of subsequent compound analysis. If honey is not harvested freshly after being collected by the bees and stored in a freezer, volatiles will begin to evaporate and can consequently be detected only in very low quantities.
