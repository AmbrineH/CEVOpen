 </sup>. However, all thyme-specific chemical communication and signal transmission steps from the bees’ antennae to the brain, as well as downstream neuronal signalling, leading to the behavioural response of the bee, are currently a huge black box and have to be investigated in future studies. Recently, Bonnafé and colleagues

 </sup> made the first step towards understanding the molecular processes initiated by topical application of thyme terpenes. Within the honey bees’ brain, thymol exposure rapidly up- and down-regulated genes coding cellular targets (e.g. octopamine receptor OA1 and transient receptor potential-like channel). The same authors claimed that thymol exposure may modify foraging capabilities by altering memory and learning
