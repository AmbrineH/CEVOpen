<p id="Par17" class="p">In comparison to honey, nectar terpene concentrations are usually measured from fresh material and give a more precise picture of nectar quality. For the six different chemotypes analysed in this study, terpene concentrations do not differ much for each substance and are potentially characteristic for each chemotype. The thymol concentration (7.67 ppm), at least, is well in the range of a previous study (2.22â€“8.2 ppm)

 </sup>, even though a different extraction method and plant material (cultivars) were used. For pollen, more data are needed to conclude if the detected values are representative for the distinct chemotypes. The thymol content of pollen could not be determined in this study since no male flowers were available. Nevertheless, data from hive pollen samples for the U.S.A. National Survey showed that thymol concentrations can vary from 0.0263 to 55.8 ppm

The concentration of leaf volatiles are orders of magnitude higher than for nectar and honey, and may not contribute directly to the health status of honey bee colonies. However, leaf-cutter bees (
