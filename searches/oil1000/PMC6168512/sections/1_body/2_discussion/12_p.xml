<p id="Par30" class="p">In conclusion, thyme (

 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic>) nectar and pollen terpenes, in particular thymol and carvacrol, are suitable antibiotic plant secondary metabolites with variable efficiency in inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive (bee pathogens) and Gram-negative bacteria. The acetylation of several terpenes resulted in nearly complete inactivation of their antibacterial activity (e.g. geraniol, linalool, and Î±-terpineol). What it means exactly for pollinator-plant interactions is currently unknown. Determination of compound quantities in nectar and pollen revealed that for some substances the terpene concentration, detected in pollen, is sufficient to reduce pathogen growth, although not fully for most of the bacteria. Forager bees are able to discriminate between different terpenes, though with a lower response to phenolic than to non-phenolic substances. This indicates that plant secondary metabolites may be relevant for prophylactic and therapeutic medication of managed honey bees to cure harming diseases with natural compounds. However, this has not been addressed here directly and must be tested in future studies, as the used terpenes may act as honey bee attractant or repellent.
