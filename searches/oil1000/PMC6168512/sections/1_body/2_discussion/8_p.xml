<p id="Par23" class="p">Nectar and pollen are resources for antibiotic plant terpenes. However, it is not clear if and how bees respond differently to different thyme terpenes and how chemical modification (acetylation) might modify antennal response. This specific response might be of high relevance for the coloniesâ€™ foraging decision and the larvae feeding decision, realised on the single individual level. From previous studies it is know that during foraging flights honey bees can discriminate between odour blends of leaves and flowers of different plant chemotypes, for example the carvacrol or thymol chemotype of

 </sup>, which might help decision making for effective foraging. Unlike flowers of different chemotypes, flowers of the same cultivar cannot be separated. Only the floral scent of different cultivars can be discerned as a function of intensity and chemical distance among scents
