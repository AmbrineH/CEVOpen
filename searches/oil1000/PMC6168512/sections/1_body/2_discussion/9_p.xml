 </sup>. However, for most plant species we are lacking experimental evidence for whether bees use the whole chemical bouquet or only single key compounds to discriminate between chemotypes. Moreover, we have to ask if honey bees can detect all substances characteristic of plant-specific floral nectar or pollen to make a foraging decision. Laboratory experiments already showed that bees can learn to discriminate very similar odours
