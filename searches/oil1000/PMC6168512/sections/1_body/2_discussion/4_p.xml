<p id="Par19" class="p">From the beekeepers’ biosecurity perspective, nectar, pollen or honey terpenes not only have to be highly specific and efficient in their activity against parasites and pathogens, they also have to be safe for the host organism at concentrations applied for pathogen treatment. In all bacteria-terpene combinations, the observed antimicrobial activity (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values) of the six active terpenes was far below the well documented toxic concentration of

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup> reported a LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 8900 ppm for thyme essential oils ingestion. Both studies cannot be compared due to the lack of details in experimental set-up including exposure time and age of the tested bees. For individual compounds, toxicity data are available only for thymol. It was shown to be not toxic at the tested concentrations towards adult bees in cage experiments

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>
 </sup>. Short term thymol exposure (48 h, 2

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 2010 ppm, while chronic toxicity was estimated with 703 ppm (LD

 </sup>. However, larval stages differ between short term and chronic toxicity. From these previous studies we can conclude that carvacrol and thymol can be tested 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> for their self-medication potential on honey bee larvae without harming the host, whereas more detailed toxicity studies are needed for geraniol, linalool, α-terpineol and trans-sabinene hydrate. Further, it should be noted that LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for short term application are usually much higher than for chronic exposure. This means that the higher antibiotic activity values for geraniol, linalool, α-terpineol and trans-sabinene hydrate are theoretically usable for the short term without harming bee larvae.
