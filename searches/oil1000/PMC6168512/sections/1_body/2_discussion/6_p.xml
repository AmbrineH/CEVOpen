<p id="Par21" class="p">Nectar and pollen essential oils are always a mix of several terpenes and they might interact with each other causing additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects. Several studies proved synergistic effects for thymol and nicotine

 </sup>. However, it is noteworthy that the effectivity of essential oil compound mixtures strongly depends on the tested bacteria species and strain, as well as on assay conditions. The very same mix can act additively, synergistically, or antagonistically, as recently summarised by Bassol√© and Juliani
