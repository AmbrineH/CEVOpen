<p id="Par2" class="p">Bees of the subfamily Apinae (mainly 
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera</italic>,

 </sup>. However, bees are not defenceless against parasites and diseases. In addition to their innate immune system they developed several behavioural defence mechanisms, called ‘social immunity’

 </sup>. Plant nectar, which is processed by honey bees to storable honey, is particularly full of secondary metabolites and the self-medication potential of honey (inhibiting pathogen growth and/or reducing pathogen loads) has been shown repeatedly

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>. The central active compounds of foraged plant products are volatile (essential oils) and non-volatile plant secondary metabolites that most probably have evolved to prevent nectar spoilage, attract pollinators or deter nectar robbers
