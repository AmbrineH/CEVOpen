<p id="Par4" class="p">Nowadays, more than 360 different essential oil volatile components of 162 taxa of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> have been chemically characterised, with more than 90% of the total oil content being composed of monoterpenes, among which thymol and carvacrol are the most abundant

 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> six different chemotypes are known: thymol (T-type), carvacrol (C-type), geraniol (G-type), linalool (L-type), α-terpineol (A-type) and trans-sabinene hydrate (U-type)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. These chemotypes are characterised by their dominant monoterpene alcohol which provides more than 50% of the respective essential oil. In addition to the major monoterpenes, other characteristic compounds can be found in each of the chemotypes. These are the corresponding acetates of the monoterpenes (geranyl acetate in the G-type; α-terpinyl acetate in the A-type and linalyl acetate in the L-type). So far, only a single study tested the antimicrobial potential of some chemotype essential oils, without any profound analysis on the origin of variance between chemotypes
