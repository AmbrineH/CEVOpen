<p id="Par6" class="p">Nevertheless, for most of the monoterpenes and their corresponding acetates, no specific function has been reported regarding herbivore defence, pollinator attraction, nectar conservation or antibiotic activity for the host organism. Here, we want to quantify the amount of each compound in nectar and pollen of several 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> chemotypes, and test and compare the antimicrobial potential of all six major monoterpenes and the three acetates on the European foulbrood causing agent 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">plutonius</italic> and disease-associated bacteria. If plant secondary metabolites have a central role for plant-pathogen-pollinator interaction, at least one of theÂ two plant products need to exhibit terpenes at concentrations relevant to, at least partially, inhibit bacterial growth. In the last step, foraging bees have to perceive the different plant terpenes for a potential selective foraging decision. Differences in olfactory responses in newly emerged worker and forager honey bees were used to assess whether bees can discriminate between different substance classes and chemical modifications of single substances. By combining compound quantification, estimation of their antibiotic potential and putative impact on foraging, this study gives an insight into plant-pathogen-pollinator interactions and the role of plant secondary metabolites, which might be highly important for the evolution of social immunity.
