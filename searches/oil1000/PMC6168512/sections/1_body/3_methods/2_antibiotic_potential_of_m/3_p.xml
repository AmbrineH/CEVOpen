<p id="Par40" class="p">The nine terpenes (thymol, carvacrol, geraniol, linalool, α-terpineol, trans-sabinene hydrate, geranyl acetate, α-terpinyl acetate and linalyl acetate) were all supplied from Sigma-Aldrich. All substances were solved or diluted with 100% DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) (Sigma-Aldrich) to 600 mg/ml (60%) stock solutions, and diluted further (with 100% DMSO) to reach final concentrations of 0.02, 0.04, 0.2, 0.4, 2, 4, 20 and 40%. These solutions were stored at −20 °C to prevent evaporation. In the final growth inhibition assay, the latter solutions were diluted 40-times, which means that the final concentration per well (200 µl) was 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 and 15000 ppm. Final DMSO concentrations in the reaction volume used to estimate the antibacterial activity of each substance ranged from 1 to 2.5% (v/v). Consequently, controls with 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5% DMSO were included as well. From previous studies it was known that the maximum non-inhibitory concentration of DMSO is 5% (v/v)

 </sup>. pH shifts caused by the terpenes and their acetates may potentially inhibit the bacteria growth as well. To preclude this, the highest and lowest substrate and DMSO concentrations were tested using pH control strips (Macherey-Nagel, pH-Fix 2.0–9.0) and showed a pH of 7.0 to 7.5 for all tested substances and concentrations.
