 <italic class="italic">plutonius</italic> was the only strain where we could determine IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values only, but not MIC or IC
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. Slope of the growth curves were determined using a linear regression (between 2 days, one without and one with detectable bacteria, usually between days 2 and 3) and standard spreadsheet software. All following steps were the same as described above. Due to high variance among replicates, the median among replicates was used to estimate IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values.
