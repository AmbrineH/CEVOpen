<p id="Par49" class="p">Geometric means of each substance (across the 5–7 technical replicates) were normalised to their respective DMSO controls (geometric means), measured after four substances tested per antennae. The response value data set was first tested for extreme outliers (box-plots). Extreme values were defined as data points which are outside the three box length range from the upper and lower value of the box (25–75% percentile range). This led to the complete exclusion of bee number 6 in the newly emerged bee data set, and 2 values for linalyl acetate and 1 value for trans-sabinene hydrate in the forager bee data set. After correction for extremes, data sets of forager and newly emerged bees (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) were combined to estimate the general impact of ‘age’ (newly emerged workers 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. forager), ‘substance’ and the interaction of both, using a general linear model with Bonferroni post-hoc tests. In a second step, antennal response between substances, but within newly emerged worker or forager bees, was compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVAs, with post-hoc multiple comparisons of mean ranks of all pairs of groups, to verify grouping of response patterns related to chemical structure (e.g. acetates 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. non-acetates, phenolic 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. non-phenolic). All statistical tests were conducted using STATISTICA 8.0 (StatSoft; Tulsa, OK, USA).
