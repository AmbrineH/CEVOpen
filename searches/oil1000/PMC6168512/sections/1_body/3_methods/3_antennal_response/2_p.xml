<p id="Par48" class="p">Antennal response (in mV) was recorded for seven bees per group (newly emerged, forager), with a Syntech IDAC-232 system and automatic base line control. Test odorants were applied on single antennae (entire antennae with cut tip - two segments, and cut as close as possible to the bees’ head) inserted into two glass capillaries filled with bee-Ringer

 </sup>. The bees’ antennae were tested for background EAG response using two background stimuli: (1) air stimulus and (2) air stimulus that contained DMSO. For testing odorant response, odorants were delivered successively 5–7-times as discrete stimuli with 0.5 s in duration and minimum 3–10 s intervals between stimulations. The order of presentation of the different substances was randomised with DMSO background controls after half of the test odorants were measured and at the end of each antennae assay. Throughout all measurements, constant humidified air flow was guaranteed with 7 ml/s. Antennae response data were analysed using EAGPro V2.0 (Syntech, Hilversum) software.
