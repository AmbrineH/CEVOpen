<p id="Par37" class="p">Terpene quantification was implemented with high accuracy of method inter-day repeatability for substance detection (mean retention time SD of 0.2 sec) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Substance recovery for each dilution, in relation to the internal standard, was on average 83.7%, by excluding the last dilution (0.049) which was below the LOD (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Nevertheless, high correlation between substance concentration and geraniol peak area was observed (n = 15, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.9998). The limit of detection (0.059 ppm) and limit of quantification (0.072 ppm) for geraniol were an order of magnitude lower than the lowest value detected in all thyme samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
