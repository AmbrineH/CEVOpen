<p id="Par36" class="p">In a final step, sensitivity of the GC-FID method was verified by determining method precision, substance recovery, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for geraniol, exemplary for all nine thyme terpenes, even though we are aware that each substance might differ slightly for detector response. The same protocol as for substance determination from thyme nectar and 1 µl injection volume were used. In detail, three serial dilutions of geraniol (in hexane) were repeatedly quantified (1000, 750, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.563, 0.781, 0.391, 0.195, 0.098, 0.049 ppm). Background noise (base line amplitude) was measured for the last 7 dilutions (with highest correlation of substance concertation and normalised peak height,
