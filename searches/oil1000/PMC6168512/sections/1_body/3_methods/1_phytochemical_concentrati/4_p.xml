 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> chemotypes were ground to fine powder with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. The powder (4–13 mg per sample) was mixed with 600 µl hexane (added internal standard: 10 µg/ml nonyl acetate) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with short interval mixing. Afterwards, the extract was centrifuged at 120 g for 1 min, following hexane removal from the leaf pellet. GC-MS and GC-FID analysis of leaf volatiles were performed as described for nectar and pollen volatiles by using 1 µl hexane extract. Extraction was repeated for 3–4 plants of each chemotype as biological replicates.
