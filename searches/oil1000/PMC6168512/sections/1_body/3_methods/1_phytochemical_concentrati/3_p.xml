<p id="Par34" class="p">Nonyl acetate was used as internal standard and added to hexane before extraction (10 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Five to ten µl of each nectar sample were extracted in 20 µl hexane by vortexing for 2 min in glass micro tubes (100 µl). For extraction of pollen volatiles, 16–18 mg of pollen per sample were incubated in 200 µl hexane for 45 min at room temperature in glass vials with short interval mixing. For the nectar samples, extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and hexane removed from the solid phase. Pollen-extracts were centrifuged at 120 g for 1 min, followed by hexane removal from the pollen pellet. Nectar and pollen volatiles were identified with a gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu) coupled to a mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP 2010 Plus, Shimadzu), using hydrogen as GC-MS carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min

 </sup>. Quantification was performed by means of a flame ionization detector (FID-2010 Plus, Shimadzu). In both cases, 2 µl hexane extract were injected with an injector temperature of 220 °C in splitless mode. Separation and identification of all volatiles were performed as described earlier
