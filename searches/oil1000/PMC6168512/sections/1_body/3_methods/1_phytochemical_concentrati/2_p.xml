<p id="Par33" class="p">Pollen, more precisely anthers containing pollen producing microsporangia (from now on called pollen), was collected in glass vials by pinching the pollen sac with clean forceps together with as little amount of the filament as possible. Pollen grain sampling was not possible for the amounts needed to quantify terpenes. Each pollen sample consisted of a pool of one chemotype. The G-chemotype did not offer enough pollen to analyse multiple samples, it was however sufficient for a single extraction and quantification. During harvest, pollen was kept and stored under the same conditions as the nectar.</p>
