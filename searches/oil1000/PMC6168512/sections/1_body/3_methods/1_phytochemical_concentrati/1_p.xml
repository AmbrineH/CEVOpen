<p id="Par32" class="p">Nectar and pollen samples of thyme were harvested in spring (May 2017) during flowering season. All thyme chemotypes originate from Southern France at CNRS (Montpellier, France) and were planted in 2013 (Halle (Saale), Germany). 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> plants (vegetative clones) of most chemotypes (C, T, G, A, and U) had enough nectar to produce 2–3 replicates per chemotype. Nectar samples were harvested with 1 µl micro-capillaries (Brand, Wertheim, Germany), and pooled among all individual plants of one chemotype. During harvesting, nectar was kept in glass vials on ice and then stored at −20 °C until measurement. Each pool consisted of 10 to 40 µl nectar. The L-chemotype provided only a very low amount of nectar which was sufficient for a single extraction and quantification. Pollen samples could only be harvested from the G-, A-, and L-chemotype as the C, T and U chemotypes only had female flowers which do not produce anthers with a pollen sac.
