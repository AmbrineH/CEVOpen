<p class="p">To combat this, it is common practice to formulate hybrid composite materials, which combine the attractive properties of fluorinated materials, with a reinforcing or stabilizing material that offers mechanical robustness and better adhesion. Reinforcing materials that have been utilized in the past with fluorinated materials include ceramics [

 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These agents can be incorporated into the fluorinated material or polymer as a physically blended composite or through covalent attachment via reactive end groups. Either way, the filler component must be compatible and dispersible within the fluorinated component, in order to capitalize on the desired properties, while limiting or preventing aggregation.
