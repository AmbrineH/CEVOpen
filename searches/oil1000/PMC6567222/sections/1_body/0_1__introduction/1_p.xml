 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. This can be directly attributed to the unique properties fluorine atoms impart on the resulting functional materials. Fluorine is a well-known electronegative atom, with a value of 4.00 on the Pauling scale, making the C–F bond highly polarizable and quite stable [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Additionally, fluorine is considered a poor leaving group in most cases [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. As a result of these factors, fluorinated materials generally exhibit unprecedented thermal and chemical stabilities. Although significantly weaker than hydrogen bonds formed between well-recognized hydrogen-bond acceptors (N, O, F), it is known that organofluorine compounds (containing C–F bonds) can interact with various aliphatic compounds (containing H–C bonds) in a similar fashion, as a very weak hydrogen-bond acceptor [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This plays an important role in the structural arrangement and properties of these materials. Fluorine also has a high ionization energy and one of the lowest polarizability values, giving fluorinated materials increased hydrophobicity, lipophilicity, and low refractive indexes [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Despite these attractive qualities, fluorinated materials and polymers are often plagued by inferior mechanical properties and poor adhesion, limiting the scope of their applications [
