<p class="p">Fluorinated silica nanometer sized particles are an exceptional class of functional materials. The incorporation of fluorine into a nanometer-sized silica particle yields a hybrid material with inherent low surface energy and enhanced surface roughness. As a result, the use of F-SiNPs, for advanced coatings and membranes, is still quite saturated. However, as the technology has matured, more advanced applications, including those in the biomedical arena, are becoming more prevalent. The vast majority of known synthetic reports utilize the versatile sol-gel technique for obtaining F-SiNPs, with only brief mention of lesser employed methods. This technique is well studied and established, so the ease in which consistent and uniform particles can be obtained is virtually unmatched. Although there are commercially available fluorinated reactive silanes that can be used in the sol-gel method, they are mostly limited to linear per-fluorinated carbon chains, which restricts the chemical variation, and potentially the scope, of the F-SiNPs. Of greater consequence and possibly one reason F-SiNPs have yet to break into the commercial market, are the environmental concerns surrounding long per-fluorinated carbon chains [
