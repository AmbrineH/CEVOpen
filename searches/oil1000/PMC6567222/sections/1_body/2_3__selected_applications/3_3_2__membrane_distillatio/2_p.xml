<p class="p">Recently, Jiang and co-workers prepared a superhydrophobic membrane utilizing F-SiNPs and demonstrated its use in vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) for the treatment of high salinity water [
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Initially, the authors prepared a SiNPs/polypropylene (PP) composite film by the in-situ sol-gel reaction of TEOS with a PP thin film. The SiNPs were then fluorinated with PFTES in a top-down fashion to obtain the superhydrophobic (F-SiNPs/PP) membrane. An analysis of the films by attenuated total reflection (ATR)-IR and XPS showed successful incorporation of the SiNPs in the films and subsequent fluorination. The surface morphology and surface energy of the F-SiNPs/PP membrane was investigated by SEM, AFM, and WCA analysis. The F-SiNPs/PP membrane was determined to be superhydrophobic with a WCA of 159.0Â°. The film was evaluated in VMD and found to maintain the desired anti-wetting and anti-fouling properties when a 3.5 wt % sodium chloride (NaCl) feed solution was used, under both continuous and batch operation. At higher concentrations (15 wt %) of NaCl, the film maintained high salt rejection under continuous treatment, with a 20% reduction in the fouling rate.
