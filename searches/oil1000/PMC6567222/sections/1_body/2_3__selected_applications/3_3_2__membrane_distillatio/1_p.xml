<p class="p">The same chemical and physical properties of F-SiNPs, that make them attractive candidates for advanced surface coatings, have also led to their use in membrane distillation (MD) and other membrane separation techniques. These processes have shown a use in the desalinization of water, treatment of waste water, separation of oil and water, and many others. Membrane distillation is a thermal process that is driven by changes in vapor pressure [

In order to effectively implement MD, the membrane must exhibit certain properties, such as high thermal stability, low fouling, increased surface roughness and porosity, increased chemical stability, and good permeability [

 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Membrane separation is similar to MD, in that it is a purification/separation technique employed for many of the same applications; however, its working principle relies on concentration gradients, changes in absolute pressure, or electrical potential gradients [

 <xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. As a result, many of the same properties are still required.
