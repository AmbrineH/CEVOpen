<p class="p">In another example, Pang and Zhang prepared a hydrophobic thin film nanocomposite reverse osmosis (TFN RO) membranes, utilizing F-SiNPs [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The F-SiNPs were prepared in a bottom-up fashion, with the co-hydrolysis/condensation of TEOS and PFTES. The F-SiNPs were characterized by SEM and found to be 150â€“200 nm in diameter. The incorporation of fluorine into the particles was confirmed by ATR-IR and FE-SEM. Polyamide TFN RO membranes, containing the F-SiNPs, were prepared using an interfacial polymerization (IP) technique using trimesoyl chloride (TCl) and
