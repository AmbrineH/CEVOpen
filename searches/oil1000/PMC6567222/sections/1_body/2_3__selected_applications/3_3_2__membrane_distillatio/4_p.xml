Through WCA and oil contact angle (OCA) measurements, it was found that the CA-PI-F-SiNPs nanofibers were superhydrophobic, with WCA as high as 166°C, and superoleophilic, with very low OCA. The WCA and OCA were dependent on concentration of BAF-tfa and the SiNPs used in the functionalization, thus the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity could be tuned,

The ability to use the membrane in the gravity driven separation of oil-water was evaluated using mixtures of dichloromethane/oil/water. The measured flux of the membrane was significantly higher than commercial filtration membranes and showed efficient separation of water from oil. The membranes were also stable over a wide pH range, mechanically robust, thermally stable, and showed increased surface roughness.
