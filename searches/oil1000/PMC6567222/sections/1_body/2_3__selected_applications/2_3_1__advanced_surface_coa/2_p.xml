<p class="p">In a recent example presented by He et al., the authors utilized F-SiNPs to prepare hydrophobic adhesive coatings [
 <xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In a top-down method, F-SiNPs were prepared by first functionalizing bare silica nanoparticles with APTES. Next, fluorinated glycidyl copolymers were grafted to the particles after attachment of an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00684-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b, the functionalized particles had an average diameter of 120 +/− 10 nm. The F-SiNPs were cast onto glass to investigate the hydrophobicity, surface energy, and adhesive strength of the coatings. The authors determined the surface coatings prepared from the F-SiNPs had increased hydrophobicity by showing higher WCA (114–119° vs. 90° for the control) and more resistance to water absorption. This was directly attributed to the surface migration of the fluorine, as well as, the increased surface roughness from the SiNPs.
