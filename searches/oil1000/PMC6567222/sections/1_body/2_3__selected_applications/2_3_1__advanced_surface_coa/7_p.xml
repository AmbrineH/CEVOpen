<p class="p">Additionally, Lee et al. used F-SiNPs to prepare superamphiphobic (SPO)-superamphiphilic (SPI) patterned substrates for use as in a colorimetric bioassays [

Subsequent treatment of the spray coated material using a mask and oxygen plasma treatment yielded a SPO-SPI patterned film,

The substrate was characterized by SEM and XPS and demonstrated that the film had been successfully fluorinated by the F-SiNPs and patterned with the oxygen plasma treatment. Furthermore, drop analysis with various liquids showed that the SPO region had high contact angles, while the SPI region was nearly zero,
