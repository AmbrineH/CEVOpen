<p class="p">Recently, Jang and co-workers utilized F-SiNPs as an anti-soiling coating for solar mirrors [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In this example, the authors coated solar mirrors with a SiNPs suspension using a draw down coater. Once bound to the surface, the SiNPs were functionalized using the thermal vapor deposition of (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2,-tetrahudrodecyl)trichlorosilane. The coated mirrors were determined to be superhydrophobic with WCA of 165Â°,
