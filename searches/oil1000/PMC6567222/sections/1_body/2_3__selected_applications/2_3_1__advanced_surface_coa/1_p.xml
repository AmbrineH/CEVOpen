<p class="p">The most heavily reported application for the utilization of F-SiNPs is by far for advanced surface coatings. These types of hybrid materials are often employed for self-cleaning, non-fouling, abrasion resistant, or stain-resistant coatings as a result of their unique and distinctive wetting properties. In order to determine the wettability of a surface, contact angle measurements and contact angle hysteresis, with a variety of different liquids, are often investigated [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The wetting of these specialized coatings can range from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, oleophobic to oleophilic, or omniphobic to omniphilic [

 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Furthermore, a surface can display extreme or super-repellency towards a liquid, for example superhydrophobicity, if the contact angle is greater than 150° and the hysteresis is lower than 5° [
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Factors affecting the wettability include the surface energy and the structural morphology of the surface [

 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The surface energy can be tailored by utilizing the chemistry or functional groups present on the surface of the coating. In the case of F-SiNPs, the incorporation of the fluorine atoms results in the generation of materials with very low surface energies. Additionally, fluorine has been shown to migrate towards the surface [

 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. As a result of these factors, the production of super-repellent surfaces can be achieved [
