<p class="p">The evaluation of optical uniformity of the specular reflectance indicated no impact on the functionality of the solar mirror as a result of the coating. The soiling rate towards the dust of the F-SiNPs-coated solar mirrors were assessed by using a falling sand apparatus at various inclines. It was determined that the coated solar mirrors had better anti-soiling properties when compared to non-coated mirrors. This was assigned to a reduction in the adhesion forces as a result of the superhydrophobicity and surface roughness. Furthermore, the sand was easily removed with air brushing, allowing the mirrors to maintain the desired specular reflectance. Field testing also demonstrated that the coated solar mirrors outperformed the uncoated mirrors.</p>
