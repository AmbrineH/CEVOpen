<p class="p">Furthermore, the adhesive strength of the agglutinated film, with the highest fluorine content (by wt %) and surface roughness, was evaluated under humid thermal aging conditions with respect to the control, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00684-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c. Although the control had better adhesive strength initially than the F-SiNPs film (1.92 MPa vs. 1.82 MPa), under the humid thermal aging conditions, the F-SiNPs film was found to maintain its adhesive properties after 30 cycles; whereas the control had decreased by nearly 20%. This was directly attributed to the aging resistance of the fluorine in the F-SiNPs.
