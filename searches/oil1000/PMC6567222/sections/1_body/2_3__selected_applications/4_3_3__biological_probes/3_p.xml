<p class="p">In another recent example, Fortin et al. prepared F-SiNPs using a top-down method from SiNPs that were 140 nm in diameter [
 <xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Two different fluorinated moieties were used producing two different F-SiNPs, dimethoxy-methyl(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane and poly(methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsiloxane). The particles functionalized with the polyfluorosiloxane also included PEG to aid in dispersion. Each F-SiNPs was further functionalized with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPA), and gadolinium,

The incorporation of the fluorinated compounds, DTPA and PEG, were confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis, XPS, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The analysis supported that the polyfluorosiloxane functionalized particles had more fluorine content. Both types of particles also showed no flocculation or agglomeration while suspended in aqueous solutions and were stable for at least 1 week. With the polyfluorosiloxane F-SiNPs having more fluorine content, it was determined to have a greater enhancing effect on the
