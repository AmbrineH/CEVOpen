<p class="p">As already mentioned, the most commonly reported synthetic method utilized to obtain F-SiNPs is by far the versatile sol-gel technique. Although rarely employed, there are a few additional techniques worth mentioning. For example, Marichal and co-workers were able to fluorinate SiNPs, with a diameter of 16 nm, by stirring them for 24 h in aqueous ammonium fluoride (NH
