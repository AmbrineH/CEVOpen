<p class="p">More recently, Ilharco and Lopes prepared F-SiNPs using a reverse emulsion method; a mixture of cyclohexane, Triton X-100, hexanol, and aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF), with the sol-gel reactions of TEOS and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This yielded hollow F-SiNPs, with an external diameter of 37 nm. An analysis of the particles by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy showed successful fluorination of the particles by aqueous HF. In addition, the authors used similar procedures to post-synthetically fluorinate bulk SiNPs. An analysis of the particles by DRIFT spectroscopy showed similar results to the hollow spheres, that aqueous HF could be used to fluorinate the SiNPs, with a strong Si-F band at 741 cm
