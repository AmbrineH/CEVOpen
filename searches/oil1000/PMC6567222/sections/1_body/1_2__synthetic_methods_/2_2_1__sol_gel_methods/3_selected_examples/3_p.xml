<p class="p">Once synthesized, the fluorinated polymer containing the reactive triethoxysilane groups was used to functionalize commercially acquired SiNPs with a diameter of 22 nm, via acid catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. The functionalization of the SiNPs was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The authors then utilized the F-SiNPs to prepare superhydrophobic films. The films had WCA of 151.5Â°,
