<p class="p">Recently, our research group prepared a reactive silane monomer, containing perfluorocyclopentene (PFCP) [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The fluorinated reactive silane reagent prepared was unique in that, with the PFCP ring containing a vinylic fluorine, it not only serves as a means for the incorporation of fluorine, but also a latent reactive end group. Thus, we were able to use the monomer to functionalize SiNPs (prepared in house) that were 342 nm in diameter, by a top-down method. Since the vinylic fluorine atom within the PFCP group remains intact during the functionalization, it could be utilized to post-synthetically modify the particles with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIPA, HOCH(CF

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) in order to incorporate more fluorine and change the surface energy of the functionalized particles,
