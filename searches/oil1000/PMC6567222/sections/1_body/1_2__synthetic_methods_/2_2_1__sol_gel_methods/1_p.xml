<p class="p">The foundation for employing sol-gel chemistry to obtain F-SiNPs is rooted in the knowledge that reactive silanes, including alkoxysilanes, halosilanes, and silanols will easily undergo hydrolysis and condensation [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Hydrolysis can be achieved in a number of ways, including heat, excess water, and acid or base catalysis. Sol-gel techniques can be used in a “top-down” or “bottom-up” fashion. 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="nanomaterials-09-00684-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref> shows a general top-down and bottom-up method for the preparation of F-SiNPs from alkoxysilanes.
