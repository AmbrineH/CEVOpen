 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="nanomaterials-09-00684-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>), or a reactive end group that the fluorinated component can be attached to or synthesized from, will be hydrolyzed. Hydrolysis results in the formation of silanol groups that will readily undergo condensation with other reactive silanes and the silicon nanoparticles, which are also known to contain surface silanols. If the fluorinated component will be incorporated through a reactive end-group, it is essential to ensure that the end group is latently reactive, i.e., it remains in tack and is unaffected by the sol-gel conditions employed in the functionalization step. Complimentary to this approach is the bottom-up technique. In this method, the fluorinated component is contained in a reactive silane and is typically co-hydrolyzed/condensed with a different reactive silane. The example shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="nanomaterials-09-00684-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref> is the co-hydrolysis/condensation of a fluorinated (R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>) triethoxysilane, with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). It should be noted that other reactive silanes, besides TEOS and a functionalized triethoxysilane, can be employed. By tailoring the reaction conditions, F-SiNPs can be obtained.
