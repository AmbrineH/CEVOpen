 <p class="p">Since initially being reported, fluorinated silica nanometer-sized particles (F-SiNPs) have gained much interest in the scientific community, due to their unique properties. These properties, include, low surface energies, increased mechanical strength, thermal robustness, and chemical resistance, and are a direct result of the incorporation of fluorine with a nanometer-sized silica network. This review aims to summarize the synthetic methods that have, and are still, being utilized to prepare these specialized materials. Following this, applications for F-SiNPs, with an emphasis on recent examples, will be presented in further detail.</p>
