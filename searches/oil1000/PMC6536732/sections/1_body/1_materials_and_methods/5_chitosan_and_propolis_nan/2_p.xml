 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Correa-Pacheco et al. (2017)</xref>. Medium molecular chitosan solution at a concentration of 0.05% (w/v) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (1% v/v) and distilled water. 2.5 ml of this chitosan solution was dissolved in methanol (40 ml) by using a peristaltic pump (Bio-Rad, EP-1 Econo Pump) under moderate stirring. The obtained solution was placed in a rotary evaporator (Rotary Evaporator RE 300, BM 500 Water Bath, Yamato CF 300) at 40 °C and 50 rpm. The final volume of nanoparticles was 2 ml.
