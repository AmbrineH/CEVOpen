Waring, CT, USA) for 1 min with methanol and water (80/20 v/v). The mixture was filtered through a Whatman 100 filter paper grade and a portion of 10 mL was diluted with 20 mL of distilled water. The diluted preparation was filtered through a micro-fiber filter, and 10 mL were passed through the IACs (Afla B, VICAM Science Technology, Watertown, MA, USA). Subsequently, the column was washed with 10 mL of distilled water and dried with sterile air flow. The toxins were then eluted with 1 mL of HPLC grade methanol and quantified in a fluorometer VICAM Series-4EX (VICAM Source Scientific, Irvine, CA, USA) after reaction with 1 mL of 0.002% aqueous bromine. The detection limit for aflatoxins via fluorescence measurement was approximately 0.5 ng/g (
