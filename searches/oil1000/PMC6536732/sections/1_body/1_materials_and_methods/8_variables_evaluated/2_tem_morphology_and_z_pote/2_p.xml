<p id="p0090" class="p">The morphology was observed by Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-JEM 2010) only on the following formulations: nanoparticles of chitosan used as control (C1), nanoparticles of chitosan solution + nanoparticles of propolis 40% (C2) and nanoparticles of chitosan solution + nanoparticles of chitosan 40% (C3). The particle average size (nm) was calculated using the ImageJ software. The stability of the emulsion was measured by Z potential with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (Malvern Instruments).</p>
