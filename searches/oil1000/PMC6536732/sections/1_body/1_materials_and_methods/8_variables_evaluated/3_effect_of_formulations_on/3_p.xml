<p id="p0100" class="p">For conidia germination, 10 ml of sterile water were added to four Petri dishes that belonged to the previous treatments, then conidia were harvested by scraping off the agar of each treatment. The number of spores ml
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of the filtrate was adjusted to 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>. Aliquots of 30 μl of the above spore suspension were placed onto six PDA disks of 20-mm diameter. Germination was stopped by adding lactophenol-safranin. One hundred observations were conducted per treatment using a Nikon ALPHAPHOT-2YS2–H optical microscope with a 40X objective. Evaluations were carried out during a given 0, 2, 4 6, 8 and 10 h incubation period and shown as percentage spore germination.
