 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Juárez-Morales et al. (2017)</xref> since they also demonstrated experimentally that chitosan is able to adsorb the aflatoxin AfB1 by interacting the positive charges of the amino group of chitosan, with the negative charges of the oxygen atoms of the aflatoxins. These authors also confirmed that chitosan is a candidate to detect aflatoxins AfB1 and AfM1. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Klich (2007)</xref> mentioned that chitosan acts by chelation of zinc in the inhibition of aflatoxins, which agrees with that reported by 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barkai-Golan (2008)</xref> where they mention that the zinc present in the medium stimulates the production of aflatoxins in
