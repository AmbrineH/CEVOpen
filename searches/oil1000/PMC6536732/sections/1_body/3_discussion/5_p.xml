 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grange and Davey, 1990</xref>). In general, activity against microorganisms is related to the synergistic effect of flavonoids rather than to the action of each separately like galangina and pinocembrina; the action of these compounds can disorganize the cytoplasm, wall, and cell membrane of the microorganisms and inhibit their protein synthesis, moreover, it could be acting on the inhibition of DNA replication (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cushnie and Lamb (2005)</xref> investigated the effect of galangin on cytoplasmic integrity in 
 <italic class="italic">S.Â aureus</italic> by measuring internal potassium loss and survival, obtaining loss of up to 20% of this element and a decrease of up to 60 times of CFU. They suggest that galangin is the compound that affected the membrane, directly and indirectly, causing damage to the cell wall and osmotic lysis.
