<p id="p0150" class="p">In this study, the results showed a very notable fungal growth decrease with the combination of the nanoparticles of chitosan, and nanoparticles of propolis at 30%, and the aforementioned treatments with propolis extract at 40% concentration, which clearly indicates the synergic effect among the components of the formulation. In previous reports, the synergistic activity of the combination of chitosan and propolis extract has been highlighted. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Torlak and Sert (2013)</xref> reported that the antimicrobial activity of chitosan-based formulations improved when the propolis extract was added. When applying them, the growth of the bacteria was 3 log CFU, while when combined with propolis at a concentration of 10%, it was 1 log CFU. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mattiuz et al. (2015)</xref> reported that propolis (7:3 v/v) reduced up to 75% the development of the phytopathogenic fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Diplodia seriata</italic>, but when using the combination of chitosan and propolis (1/1 w/v) the inhibition was 100%.
