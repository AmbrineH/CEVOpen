 <italic class="italic">A. parasiticus</italic> by applying the same 0.6% concentration of propolis extract, although in this case, the origin of the extract was from Saudi Arabia. These authors mentioned that the mechanism of propolis activity depends on the synergy between the flavonoids, the phenolic acids in propolis and their interference with aflatoxin biosynthesis, and they explained that there is a genetic correlation between the production of conidia and the secondary metabolites.
