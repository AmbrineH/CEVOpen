<p id="p0145" class="p">In relation to the Z potential, the obtained values for the chitosan nanoparticles coincide with 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shukla et al. (2013)</xref> which reported that the Z potential of the chitosan nanoparticles made with sodium polyanion tripolyphosphate was between +20mV and +60mV. In this investigation, the propolis nanoparticles presented a lower value compared to chitosan nanoparticles 40%; which agrees with that reported by 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sotelo-Boyás et al. (2015)</xref> who obtained a Z potential of +20.2 mV for the chitosan nanoparticles and +10.0 mV for the chitosan nanoparticles with lime essential oil; they argue that this could be due to the fact that propolis and lime essential oil are biologically active materials, which decrease the amount of -NH3 + ions present in chitosan in its protonated form, due to a possible interaction between chitosan and the material biologically active.
