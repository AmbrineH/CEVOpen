<p id="p0140" class="p">It was observed that the nanoparticles were distributed uniformly, observing a spherical morphology. Likewise, the nanoparticles of chitosan (1.0% and 40%), presented the same size which decreased in the nanoparticles of propolis, unlike that reported by 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Afrouzan et al. (2012)</xref> where the size of the propolis nanoparticles was from 51 to 86 nm. This could be due to the fact that the method of making the nanoparticles was different, for example, the one used by these authors was top-down (grinding) unlike the one used in this investigation (bottom-up).

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valle (2016)</xref> reported the size of chitosan nanoparticles of 4.5 nm and 5.9 nm, respectively.
