<p id="p0125" class="p">It was observed that as the value of the Z potential increased, the electrostatic repulsion between the particles was greater and the colloidal dispersion was more stable. The values of the Z potential were as follows: C1 = 21.3mV ± 0.06, C2 = 18.5mV ± 1.8 and C3 = 116.2mV ± 16.4. In the case of the propolis nanoparticles formulation (C2), the resin did not allow the passage of the laser beam, therefore, dilutions were done for Z potential determination.</p>
