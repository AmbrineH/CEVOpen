 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>a,b,c). The nanoparticles of chitosan (1.0%) evaluated as control (C1) had an average size of 3.00 ± 0.70 nm, as well as the nanoparticles of chitosan at 40% (C3) (3.00 ± 1.01 nm), while the nanoparticles of propolis at 40% (C2) had an average size of 2.33 ± 0.36 nm. In the images can be seen, that the propolis nanoparticles are well dispersed, whereas, for the nanoparticles of chitosan at 40% and control, some agglomerations were observed.
