<p id="p0135" class="p">With regard to the determination of total aflatoxins, all treatments dramatically inhibited its production (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For example, with chitosan alone at 1% (C1) no aflatoxin production was observed, followed by the treatments containing nanoparticles of chitosan (C3) (1.5 μg/L) and propolis extract (C4) (2.0 μg/L). The control treatment showed no inhibition, with corresponding values of 25.0 μg/L.
