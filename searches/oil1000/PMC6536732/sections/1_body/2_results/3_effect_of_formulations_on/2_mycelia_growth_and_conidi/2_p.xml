<p id="p0130" class="p">In this investigation, mycelia growth and spore germination took place during each of the given incubation times (7 days and 10 h, respectively); however, with respect to the control, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> was delayed (Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a,b,c and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a,b,c) and significantly reduced (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) with most of the tested formulations at the end of the given incubation periods (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). There was not a clear pattern treatment-inhibition; however, the formulations containing nanoparticles of chitosan and propolis at concentrations of 30% and 40% (B2, B5, B6, and C2, respectively) showed a greater inhibition on the mycelial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> compared with the rest of the treatments, including the chitosan and propolis separately. In the case of the germination of spores, the combination of nanoparticles of chitosan, propolis and/or the extract of propolis at 40% concentration (C6, C7), presented the highest inhibition compared with the rest of the treatments.
