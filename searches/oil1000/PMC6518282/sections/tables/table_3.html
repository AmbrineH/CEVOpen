During this evaluation, the choice of strategies useful in developing innovative plants represented the transition from TRL 0 to TRL 2. Starting from the development of the idea (TRL 0) and examining the principles postulated and observed without any experimental proof available (TRL 1), the potential of a group of emerging technologies (ultrasound, microwaves, and pulsed electric fields) was analyzed in order to improve the virgin olive oil extraction process. The end part of these first steps was concluded with the formulation of a hypothesis of the application of ultrasound technology to the virgin olive oil extraction process (TRL 2).</td>

This is the “end user validation” of an industrial ultrasound application in the extra-virgin olive oil extraction process. The principle that led the experimentation was the total sharing of plant management with the olive millers. Test validation (TRL 7) is crucial to the successful development and technology readiness level escalation of any new food technology. Sharing the experimentation with the miller company allowed for gathering feedback useful in improving the technology and optimizing the results, which were still shared with the stakeholders, establishing a virtuous circle of trust and collaboration. The close collaboration with the olive millers allowed an extremely technical approach to the system and highlighted the problems that had to be resolved to make the machine suitable for the market. At the end of the validation tests, each criticality was successfully resolved (TRL 8).</td>
