   <p class="p">Publish the results of the research (not disclosable throughout the patent investigation period), describing all of the design, construction, and experimental conditions in order to make the experiment reproducible by third parties (principle of reproducibility). This is the realization of an open intellectual property strategy and represents the path to foster a transition to more effective, efficient, and sustainable technologies.</p>
