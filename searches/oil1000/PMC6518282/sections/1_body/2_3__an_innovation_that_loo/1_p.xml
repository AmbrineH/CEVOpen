<p class="p">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity. It is articulated in 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets. Regarding the planet, the agenda aims to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations. The document designs the road toward a world in which consumption and production patterns and the use of all natural resources—from air to land, and from rivers, lakes, and aquifers to oceans and seas—are sustainable. Environmental protection requires the development and application of technology that is climate-sensitive, respects biodiversity, and is resilient in order to favor humanity living in harmony with nature. The document recommends making fundamental changes in the way that our societies produce and consume goods and services. In particular, Goal 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture) fixes this objective: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production and that help maintain ecosystems. Moreover, Goal 8 promotes the objective of improving progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavoring to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programs on sustainable consumption and production. Goal 12 fixes an objective that, by 2020, the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycles be achieved in accordance with agreed international frameworks, significantly reducing their release into the air, water, and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.</p>
