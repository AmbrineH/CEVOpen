<p class="p">The possibility of converting long malaxing times into a complete thermal and ultrasonic exchange that requires only a few minutes (or seconds depending on flow rates) has beneficial effects also on the amount of secondary metabolites (such as polyphenol and tocopherols characterized by heathy effects approved by the European Food Safety Authority) extracted from the olive paste. In fact, the long malaxing time required in the traditional olive oil extraction process represents a critical control point in the Nutrient Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Process (NACCP). Renzo et al., in 2015, developed a new procedure for the optimization of nutritional levels based on four general principles: (i) Guaranteeing health maintenance; (ii) evaluating and assuring the nutritional quality of food and total quality management; (iii) giving correct information to consumers; and (iv) ensuring an ethical profit. In light of this procedure, during malaxation a large number of technological parameters are beyond the control of the operator. In particular, it is difficult to have complete control of the factors (oxygen concentration, temperature, etc.) that affect the activation of desirable enzymatic reactions (synthesis of volatile compounds by the pathway of lipoxygenase) and the inhibition of undesired enzymatic reactions (oxidation of polyphenols by peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) [

Considering the experimental evidence that showed that the innovative technology developed did not compromise the synthesis of aromas, and in light of the different enzymatic kinetics that see the pathway of lipoxygenase favored in terms of time compared to oxidative enzymes that in the process conditions require long activation times, it is possible to conclude that, contrary to what happens in other food industries, no degradation reaction could be attributed to the use of ultrasounds [
