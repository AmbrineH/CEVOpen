<p class="p">Sizing the power of an industrial plant is a function of the work capacity of the entire plant (the ultrasound device size has to be compatible with the capacity of the machines upstream and downstream), and it is a crucial element in obtaining a desired result in a sustainable manner, which depends on the specific energy transferred to the olive paste. Thus, the correct way to size the total power of the plant consists of an assessment of specific energy corresponding to the level of maximum effectiveness and efficiency, starting from a lab-scale experiment and reproducing the same conditions in a continuous plant.</p>
