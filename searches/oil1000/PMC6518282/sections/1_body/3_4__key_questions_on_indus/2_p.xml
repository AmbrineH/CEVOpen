<p class="p">The ultrasound frequency range extends from 20 kHz (low-frequency ultrasound) to almost 10 GHz (high-frequency ultrasound). The ultrasounds are produced by transducers that convert the energy obtained by applying a high potential difference in an ultrasonic wave, essentially a mechanical vibration, thanks to the piezoelectric effect of quartz, discovered by Curie in 1880. The phenomenon of cavitation, that is the creation of microscopic gaseous bubbles that implode, breaking the cell walls, can only take place in an aqueous medium below 200â€“300 kHz, since as the frequency increases, the attenuation induced by the inertia of the medium dampens the waves, nullifying the mechanical effect. The useful field of application to olive paste, which for density, viscosity, and structure (solid + two liquids immiscible among them) shows high attenuation actions on the wave able to dampen the vibrations induced by the transducer, is below 50 kHz. So-called megasounds (with frequencies of 400 and 600 kHz) are not able to induce the formation of cavities when traveling through a medium [
