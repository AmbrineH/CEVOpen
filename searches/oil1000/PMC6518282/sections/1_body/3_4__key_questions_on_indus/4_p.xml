<p class="p">In fact, by observing the curves correlating the time of sonication (fixed frequency and power) with the concentration of the minor compounds passing from olive paste to oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00121-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), it is possible to notice that as the sonication time increases, the quantity of extracted compounds increases. However, the curve presents first a linear section, followed by an elbow and a reduction in the slope of the curve. This graph clearly shows that within a certain interval of time, there is a direct correlation between the administered energy and the expected result. At a certain interval of time, at the elbow, when the administered energy is increased, the achievable result does not increase proportionally. Thus, the elbow represents the point of maximum extractive efficiency and energy efficiency.
