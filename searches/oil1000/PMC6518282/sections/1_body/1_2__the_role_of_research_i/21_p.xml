<p class="p">The realization of the prototype that combined ultrasound for the first time with a heat exchange was the result of a planned technology development roadmap emerging from a research path. The path forward started from a lab-scale observation and finished with a full-scale device ready for the market that passed through all the research and development tasks needed to increase the levels of maturity of ultrasound applications in the virgin olive oil extraction process. Tasks have included modeling, testing, bench-scale demonstrations, pilot-scale demonstrations, and fully integrated prototype demonstrations.</p>
