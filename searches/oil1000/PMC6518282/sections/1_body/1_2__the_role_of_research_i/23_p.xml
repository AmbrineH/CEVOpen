<p class="p">The first paper (in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]), an overview on the application of emerging techniques in the virgin olive oil extraction process, describes the strategies useful in developing innovative plants and demonstrated the transition from TRL 0 to TRL 2. This was a review that started from the development of an idea (TRL 0: Unproven concept, no testing has been performed) examining the principles postulated and observed without any experimental proof available (TRL 1: Basic research). The paper analyzed the potentials of a group of emerging technologies (ultrasound, microwaves, and pulsed electric fields) to improve the virgin olive oil extraction process and concluded the overview with the formulation of a hypothesis of application of ultrasound technology to the virgin olive oil extraction process (TRL 2: Technology formulation).
