 <xref rid="B30-foods-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The use of low-frequency ultrasound (20 kHz) is a strategy to reinforce the weak link in the process of continuous extraction of extra-virgin olive oil thanks to the mechanical effects that the sound waves induce within the olive paste. The ultrasound propagating in a liquid determines the alternation of positive and negative pressures inside it. When the negative pressure values are below the vapor pressure of the fluid itself, it undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas, forming cavities containing steam and giving rise to the phenomenon of cavitation. Cavitation is a physical phenomenon consisting of the formation of cold vapor bubbles inside a fluid that then implode, producing shock waves, i.e., pressure waves that can be extremely intense. If implosion occurs near the cell wall of the olive fruit (cells passed intact through the crusher), it generates a liquid microjet that breaks the wall, freeing the cell contents, all within a few microseconds. The mechanical effect of the acoustic cavitation breaking the intact olive cells frees further portions of oil and minor compounds. In addition, whirling motions impressed on the olive paste by the pressure transients determine the coalescence of the lipid droplets [
