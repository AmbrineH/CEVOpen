<p class="p">In order to better describe the research and development strategies and the milestones that have marked the road from the first observations in the laboratory to the full-scale industrial plant, a technology maturity assessment system (TRL: Technology readiness assessment) is used. The TRL process originated with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) to evaluate the deployment readiness of a technology and its readiness to function in an integrated environment. A technology readiness (TRL) is assigned to each evaluated technology based on its relative level of development toward deployment. TRL definitions are shown in
