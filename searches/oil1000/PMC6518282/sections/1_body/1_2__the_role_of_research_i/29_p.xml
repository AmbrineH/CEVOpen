<p class="p">The transdisciplinary approach allowed for exploring opportunities and threats simultaneously in order to verify how advantageous it was to implement a radical innovation (ultrasound) in a traditional sector (olive oil sector), reducing risks and overcoming obstacles exacerbated by the intrinsic characteristics of the oil supply chain. In fact, one of the major problems linked to the development of innovations in the oil sector is due to the fact that the harvesting season lasts only three months each year. Moreover, the climatic variability of different years [

This condition implies that it is necessary to introduce useful technologies to overcome the limits of the empirical approach.
