<p class="p">From an engineering point of view, bottleneck is a phenomenon that occurs when the performance of a system or its capabilities is strongly constrained by a single component. Bottlenecks occur when the incoming workload reaches the machine at a faster rate than it can handle, thus limiting the overall speed of the entire process. Having a bottleneck in the process therefore tends to create a queue and increase the overall cycle time. Bottlenecks cause stalls and slowdowns in the production flow. Therefore, with equal resources, production is slower, and fewer quantities are realized respect to the optimum process. Efficient bottleneck management in the olive oil extraction phase can lead to huge benefits in terms of the effectiveness (more oil yields, more phenol compounds, and a pleasant and harmonic sensory profile) and efficiency of the process (less time, fewer costs, less energy).</p>
