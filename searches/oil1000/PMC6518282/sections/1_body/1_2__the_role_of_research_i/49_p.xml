<p class="p">Both of these fronts can bring innovation to the threshold of the so-called “Death Valley”. The main cause of loss of a technology in “Death Valley” is given by reduced financial resources and limited public support. In the financing scenario, the public sector does not intervene if the level of technological maturity is between TRL 6 and TRL 8, as it would constitute an intervention in favor of the private sector. On the other hand, for the private sector, this level of technological maturity, despite being tied to a potential profit, still has a high risk of commercial failure, and many technological obstacles can separate it from the market. “Death Valley” refers precisely to this intermediate moment of financial support between the public and private sectors. In this way, a promising technology may not progress along the demonstration and development phases necessary to achieve its full spread. In this condition the innovation cannot give a contribute to improve the competitiveness in the concerned sector. This is the point of no return from which many new ideas that go through the process of innovation cannot progress.</p>
