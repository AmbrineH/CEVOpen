<p class="p">The first obstacle to overcome certainly concerns the availability of economic resources to support TRL escalation. In a financing scenario, the public sector generally intervenes at the beginning of the innovation process, financing basic research (starting from the laboratory) that generally has not yet identified a specific end product and is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Two different public funds EAFRD (the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development), with which the EU cofinances the RDP (Rural Development Program), and ESF (the European Social Fund) enabled the creation of the first and second industrial prototypes [
