<p class="p">The limits of the application of the first prototype were related to aspects of functionality. The combination of the ultrasound wave transducer with the geometry of the triple tube heat exchanger caused problems with the continuity of the flow of olive paste in contact with the probe. When the layer of olive paste in contact with the probe was not uniform (effect of the pump upstream of the heat exchanger), and pockets of air disaggregated the fluid, the propagation of the sound wave could not take place and the probe set itself automatically in protection mode and switched off.</p>
