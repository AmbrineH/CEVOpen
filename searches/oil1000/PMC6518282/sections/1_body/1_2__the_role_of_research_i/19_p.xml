<p class="p">Thanks to a transdisciplinary approach, it has been possible to realize the first industrial-scale prototype (a sono-heat exchanger) able to eliminate virgin olive oil process bottlenecks and break the historical paradigm between yield and quality of virgin olive oil. In fact, a sono-heat exchanger placed between the crusher and the decanter is able to realize an effective and efficient continuous process, obtaining a simultaneous increment of both oil yield and quality.</p>
