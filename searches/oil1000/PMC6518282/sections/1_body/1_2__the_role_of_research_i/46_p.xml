<p class="p">Olive paste flowed into the external annular section, while water flowed into the internal annular section to control the temperature inside the olive paste. Outside the external annular flow section, a transducer for each side of the octagonal shape section was set up to provide ultrasounds. The energy per kilogram of olive paste was the result of the power of each transducer combined with the flow rate flowing inside the sono-heat exchanger.</p>
