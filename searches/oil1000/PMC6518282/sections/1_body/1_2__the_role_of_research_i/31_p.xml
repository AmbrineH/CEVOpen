<p class="p">The first design step required a strategy that would combine a device already operating in the olive mill with the models of ultrasound equipment available on the market. The first approach then followed the philosophy of incremental innovation (a series of small improvements to an existing product). The ultrasound market made available two types of different devices: Probe-shaped transducers and plate-shaped transducers. The first dilemma to be solved was to understand which machine could be equipped with ultrasound to create a sustainable plant solution, both from an economic and an energetic point of view. The choice fell to a triple tube heat exchanger (already widely used in the market to shorten malaxing times) combined with ultrasonic probe-shaped transducers.</p>
