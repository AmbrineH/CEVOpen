<p class="p">In the aim to cover the last mile, there is a last step to climb to conclude the technology readiness level scale: TRL 9 (full commercial application, technology available for consumers). Among the European programs, such as Horizon 2020, the program “Fast Track to Innovation” (FTI), in particular, can support companies in assessing the potential feasibility and value of their idea and can provide information and advice on the best way forward and the needed financial support to reach TRL 9. In 2018, five partners from three European countries received from the European trough the program “Fast Track to Innovation” financial support to develop an ultrasound reactor, the solution for realize an effective continuous olive oil extraction process.The Fast Track to Innovation (FTI) program is a pilot project within the Horizon 2020 program that aims to support the market entry of innovative ideas, providing funding opportunities through a bottom-up approach. This means that the European Commission does not set out in detail the objectives of the call for proposals, but rather indicates the areas eligible for funding: The proposals submitted must indeed be linked to an area within the specific "leadership in enabling and industrial technologies "(KETs: Key enabling technologies) and/or one of the specific objectives of the" social challenges" pillar. FTI supports innovative projects from the demonstration phase to the commercialization of the product, including prototyping, testing, achievement of the necessary certifications, validation of business models, pre-normative research, and standardization. FTI is aimed at new market-oriented technologies, concepts, processes, and business models that need a last phase of development before they can be marketed (TRL 9).</p>
