<p class="p">The need to coordinate research activity with the production needs of the olive millers. In fact, the experimental tests require to slow down the usual rate of processes due to the complex measurement operations, and the need to clearly separate the individual olive batches for each experimental test. Adding these difficulties in a period of frenetic activity, also conditioned by contracts with farmers that confer the olives to the oil mill, requires large efforts by the millers. The tests conducted for the validation of the technology showed that the innovative system, which combined the mechanical energy of ultrasound with the possibility of modulating the thermal exchange of the olive paste (heating or cooling), enabled the following:
