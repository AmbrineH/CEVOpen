<p class="p">The contemporary miller, thanks to the technological progress of machines and acquired scientific knowledge, has become an 
 <italic class="italic">artifex</italic>, an artificer, or one who exercises an 
 <italic class="italic">ars</italic> (art in Latin), which is intended as an activity that requires complex technical knowledge at the service of a particular attitude. In conclusion, an artifex is an olive miller able to use machines in order to "modulate" the enzymatic activities that take place in the olive paste, consciously modifying the chemical, organoleptic, and health characteristics of the resulting virgin oil. Modular is a term borrowed from the world of music. In the musical field, this verb indicates the ability to vary a sound or a tone in order to obtain a harmonious effect. It is, therefore, an indispensable term in describing the activities of the contemporary olive miller. In a very short period, he has to make a series of decisive choices to obtain extra-virgin olive oil with an overall pleasant sensation, due to the perception of its components, phenolic and volatile compounds, which act as olfactoryâ€“gustatory, tactile, and kinesthetic stimuli perfectly balanced between them.
