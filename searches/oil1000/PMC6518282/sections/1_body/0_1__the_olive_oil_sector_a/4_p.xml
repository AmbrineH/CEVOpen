<p class="p">The modern olive miller has to understand the potential of technology and has to be able to contextualize it in the geographical area in which he operates. Extra-virgin olive oil is a well-defined project of an olive miller, and it is the result of interactions between machines that constitute an industrial plant and raw material characteristics. This result should never be a surprise. This is because from olive orchard management to the bottling phase, there are hundreds of decisions to be made consciously. It is important to know the consequences of these decisions. At each crossroads, it is necessary to know which is the road that moves away or approaches the initial project. The olive oil project, of each olive miller, has to be a marketing project tailored to a specific target market to which the olive miller has decided to direct production and sales. In fact, during all operations, ranging from crushing, to malaxation and to the centrifugal separation [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], complex phenomena of a physical, chemical, and biochemical nature are established. These simultaneous reactions make virgin olive oils different from other vegetable lipid matrices through their composition, sensory, and health properties, thanks to a transfer from olive olive paste to the oil of minor compounds (both constitutive of the fruit) and neoformation [

In fact, it is possible to modulate, by activation or inhibition, these complex phenomena of a physical, chemical, and biochemical nature occurring on a microscopic scale through the control of operating macroscopic parameters such as specific energy (J/kg of olive paste), temperature (Â°C), processing time (s), and composition of the atmosphere in contact with the olive paste ([O
