<p class="p">In the last 50 years, the olive oil sector has undergone a process of transformation not dissimilar to other productive contexts. Thanks to an increase in the level of education and training of olive millers, from agricultural and food science to economy and marketing, coupled with technological improvements in production processes, the key roles of knowledge and human capital in determining the competitive growth of the olive oil sector are increasingly clear. Clarifying the value of skill creation, the technology progress, and continuous learning in determining the performance of an olive mill is a key point in promoting "knowledge" as the primary engine of productivity and growth of the entire olive oil sector.</p>
