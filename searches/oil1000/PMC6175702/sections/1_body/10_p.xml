<p id="par0055" class="p">There is a general agreement that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phylum, dominate all by-products, although some differences were observed in the number of reads, and they occurred in a greater number. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in all the samples and accounted for 30.42% of the total bacterial sequences. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the second and third most abundant, corresponding to 10.87 and 3.94% of the reads, respectively. The predominance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria was not surprising because these phyla have been found in other regions, including organic-rich black shales

 </xref> The dominance of the these three phyla was suggested as due to their adaptability to living in the metal-rich and extremely acidic shale environment when compared with other 30 different phyla found in a group of nine black shale samples in a depositional unit at Chengkou County, Southwest China.
