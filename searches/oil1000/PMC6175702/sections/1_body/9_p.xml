<p id="par0050" class="p">This study presents the first 16S rRNA gene massive sequence analysis of shale by-products from Brazil. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA from organisms which are not detected in plating method has provided an invaluable insight into our understanding of the community structure, particularly of communities inhabiting this environments, whose growth conditions may be difficult to mimic in the laboratory.

 </xref> The FSII show the smallest number of identified phyla, including Actinobacteria, Aquificae, Bacteroidetes, Dictyoglomi, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria and Synergistetes. FSI contained the phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Aquificae, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Dictyoglomi, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Planctomyces, Proteobacteria and Synergistetes. From the FSI and II samples, 19 and 18% of the total sequences remained unclassified (derived from bacteria), respectively. Thirteen phyla were identified from RSI, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Aquificae, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Dictyoglomi, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Thermotogae, and from RSII, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Aquificae, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Planctomyces, Proteobacteria, Synergistetes and Thermotogae. On average, 18% and 20% of the total sequences from RSI and II were unclassified (derived from bacteria), respectively. When we compared our data obtained from Brazilian shale by-products with those from Li et al.
