<p id="par0005" class="p">Oil shale is defined as fine-grained sedimentary rock containing high amounts of organic matter that is predominantly kerogen, which will yield oil and combustible gas upon destructive distillation.

 </xref> Oil shale resources are abundant and distributed in several countries around the world. The most important Brazilian oil shale reserve, the Permian Irati Formation located in São Mateus do Sul, Paraná, has the greatest potential for economic development because of its accessibility, grade, and wide-spread distribution.

 </xref> The mining and processing of shale generate solid by-products that occur in two distinct stages the fine shale particles (FS) and retorted shale (RS). The FS are small fragments of shale rock measuring less than 0.25 in. with an oil content of approximately 15% and are 20% of mined rock; thus, FS are not usable in oil and gas processing.

 </xref> Retorted shale (RS) is a waste by-product obtained from pyrolysis (550 °C) of oil shale processing.
