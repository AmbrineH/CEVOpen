<p id="par0060" class="p">The taxonomic profiles of microbial communities when compared by cluster analysis based on a heatmap showed a clear separation between the phylum groups, confirming the differences in the by-products microbial communities (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The heatmap has two dendrograms, one indicating the similarity/dissimilarity among metagenomic samples, 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis dendrogram, the horizontal orange (sampling in 2011) and blue (sampling in 2008) bars showing that when compared sampling there were differences only for RS and another indicating the similarity/dissimilarity among phyla, the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis dendrogram, where 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> and unclassified bacteria group are separated from others phyla. We also observed that the FS bacterial communities are similar in their sampling times, while samples of RSI differ in their bacteria community composition.
