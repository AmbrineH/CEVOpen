<p id="par0040" class="p">We employed STAMP software to examine the taxonomic profiles of enriched samples from the two RS and FS communities sampled from the mining area using a PCA plot and clustering analysis (heatmap) to compare the relative differences and/or similarities between by-products. The results showed that FS and RS by-products enriched communities are significantly different, which is represented by the upper and lower PCAs. The PCA plot indicated a robust distinction between the two communities from shale by-products. We observed a clear separation of groups in PCA1 and PCA2, where the two first principal components account for approximately 97.6% of the variation in the phylum group distribution. PCA take out a widely predominant component (PC1), accounting for 87.8% and of the variability in the data and clearly related to overall bacterial phyla communities from RS while PC2 that explained only 9.8% comprise FS community (
