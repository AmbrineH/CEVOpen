 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref> At times, relatively limited diversity has been observed, such as in the work performed by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis to study bacteria distributed across the shale-sandstone at Cerro Negro, New Mexico, where the community was comprised of γ and δ-Proteobacteria, Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides, sulfate-reducing bacteria and members of the Geobacteraceae family.

 </xref> For instance, indigenous bacteria play a prominent role in the weathering of black shale and in the biogeochemical cycles of elements in this rock.
