 </xref> The data corresponding to phylum distribution were submitted to ANOVA statistical and a multiple groups comparison test by Tukey-Kramer test (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) to construct a principal component analysis (PCA) plot and a similarity dendrogram (heatmap) using the UPGMA algorithm (Unweight Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean). The mean proportion between the phylum level samples was analyzed by Fisher's statistical test, with Newcombe-Wilson confidence intervals (
