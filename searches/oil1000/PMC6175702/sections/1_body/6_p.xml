<p id="par0035" class="p">The results showed that 90% of the sequences were assigned to the domain bacteria. Of the 17 phyla detected in the shale by-products Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant (

The FS had the lowest alpha diversity index with FSI at 6.26 and FSII at 6.86, while the Î±-diversity indices from RS (I and II) phylum were 24.34 and 15.87, respectively, showing that high bacterial diversity in the RS samples. The differences found between the two by-products could be partially explained by chemical composition or due to the microbial colonization after the pyrolysis process, since it involves high temperature treatment seems like this could be a sterilizing step with regards to the extant microorganisms. In areas surrounding the oil shale industry in the north-eastern part of Estonia were found that, even after 10 years, a few dominant populations and low diversity characterized the microbial community in this area.
