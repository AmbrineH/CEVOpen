<p id="par0045" class="p">As indicated by the PCA plot, there were significant differences in the bacterial diversity found in the shale by-products, which can be due to differences in chemical characteristics resulting from the pyrolysis process suffered by RS to extract oil from rock. We consider those microorganisms present in RS samples are re-colonizers because, after oil extraction and cooling, this by-product is high in silicon content and also containing organic matter, micronutrients, hydrocarbons and other elements such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. According to our previous studies with cultivable microorganisms there are higher diversity of fungi
