<p id="par0070" class="p">Our study provides the first 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis data about the microbial community present in oil shale by-products from Irati Formation, which will contribute to a better understanding of bacterial community present in this environment. Among the bacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominate FS and RS at the phylum level. Deinococcus-Thermus, Gemmatimonadetes, Spirochaetes and Thermotogae were found only in RS samples. These results provide tools for studies and/or search of specific microorganisms to future applications.</p>
