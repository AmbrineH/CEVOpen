<p id="par0010" class="p">Although the interaction of oil shale with the microbial community is an interesting topic, until now, this subject has not been well examined. Due to the lack of information regarding the occurrence of microorganisms in the shale by-products from the Irati Formation, knowledge of the microbial community composition can generate important data and suggests how bacteria can act in providing complex nutrients, thus adding value to by-products as agricultural inputs. In this perspective, the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of microbial communities from enriched FS and RS using sequencing of V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene.</p>
