<p class="p">250g dried and powdered fruits from both samples were separately extracted with meth anol (5× 1.5L) to afford total methanol extracts. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator at 40 °C, and subsequently lyophilized by freeze dryer at −40 °C for 24h (Lyotrap Ultra, LTE Scientific Ltd., Oldham, UK). Fractionation of total extracts was performed with sufficient volumes of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and methanol. The fractions were then concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation.</p>
