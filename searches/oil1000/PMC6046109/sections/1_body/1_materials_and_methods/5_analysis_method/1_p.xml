<p class="p">The mortality percentages were calculated and corrected relative to the associated controls using Abbottâ€™s formula (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). The concentration-mortality data were subjected to Probit analysis (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>) and lethal concentrations (LC 
 <sub class="sub"> 50 </sub> and LC 
 <sub class="sub"> 90 </sub>) were determined with 95% confidence intervals from the regression lines.
