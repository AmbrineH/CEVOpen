<p class="p">Larvicidal activity of total extracts, fractions and essential oils were evaluated according to the procedure recommended by WHO (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). The larvae were exposed to different concentrations of samples for 24 hours. Tests were carried out in four replicates. One ml of solvents (DMSO for essential oil and petroleum ether fraction, DMSO2: water 3 for total extract and ethanol for methanol fraction) were added separately into control bakers. Mortality was scored 24 hours post exposure.
