 <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum</italic> is a perennial plant belonging to Apiaceae family, growing wild in Iran (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). The fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> is used as spice, antiseptic and carminative agent (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Several studies have analyzed essential oil composition of the fruits and mostly reported γ-terpinene, cuminaldehyde and ρ-cymene as main components (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Kaempferol, caffeic and pcoumaric acid have been isolated from polar fraction of the fruits as major antioxidant constituents (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>) but according to our knowledge no other comprehensive study has been organized to identify other phytochemicals in the extract. Overexploitation and unscientific harvesting of 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> as well as climate changes, has threatened its existence in wild (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Cultivation of endangered species could preserve their genetic resources (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). In recent years, 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> is cultivated in limited areas in Iran especially in Khorasan Razavi Province. As a part of our ongoing studies on larvicidal activity of plants extracts and essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>), in the present study, we have studied larvicidal activity of the essential oil, extract and fractions from 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> fruits against late third instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>. Moreover, we have compared the activities of a wild and a cultivated type.
