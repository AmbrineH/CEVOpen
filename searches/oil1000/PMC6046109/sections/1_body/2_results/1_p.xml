<p class="p">Hydro distillation of wild and cultivated 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> fruits yielded 2.5% and 2.25% (w/w) essential oil respectively. Both essential oils had a lot of commonalities in composition. γ-Terpinene (30.77% and 27.57%), cuminaldehyde (20.49% and 21.1%), ρ-cymene (20.1% and 18.32%) and γ-terpinen-7-al (8.29% and 7.84%) constituted main components in the wild and cultivated oils respectively (
