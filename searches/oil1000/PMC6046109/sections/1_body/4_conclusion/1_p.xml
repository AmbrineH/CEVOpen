<p class="p">The extract and fractions from 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> fruits, ie, petroleum ether fraction and total extract, beside the essential oil, have shown significant larvicidal effects on 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>, and can be a great candidate to develop an eco-friendly insecticide to combat malaria vector breeding. More precise investigation will require revealing phytochemical composition of extract. Since cultivated type showed comparable results as wild grown, cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic>, as a solution to preserve its wild resources, is highly recommended. There are several studies on larvicidal activities of different plants against malaria vectors in Iran (
