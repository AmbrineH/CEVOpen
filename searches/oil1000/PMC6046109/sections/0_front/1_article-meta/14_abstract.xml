  <title class="title">Background:</title>
  <p class="p">Malaria, a mosquito-transmitted disease, is still a major human health problem all over the world. Larviciding is a component of comprehensive control program to overcome the disease. Negative aspects of synthetic insecticides application, such as environmental safety concerns, have favored use of natural insecticides.</p>

  <title class="title">Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">Larvicidal activity of essential oil, extracts and fractions of a wild grown and a cultivated type of 
   <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum</italic> fruits against malaria vector 
   <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</italic> was assessed according to the method described by WHO.

  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum</italic> showed remarkable potency against 
   <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> larvae. LC 
   <sub class="sub"> 50 </sub> values for essential oil, total extract, petroleum ether fraction and methanol fraction were 27.4284, 64.9933, 85.9933 and 255.7486ppm for wild type, and 21.3823, 63.2580, 62.7814 and 152.6357ppm for cultivated one.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">The results of this study suggest 
   <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> as a valuable source of natural insecticides against malaria vector
