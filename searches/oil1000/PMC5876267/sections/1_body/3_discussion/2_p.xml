<p id="Par20" class="p">In our experiments, 
 <italic class="italic">O. compactum</italic> essential oil showed anthelmintic effects against 
 <italic class="italic">A. simplex</italic> L3 larvae as well as inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Levamisole is used as an antiparasitic agent in veterinary, so we tried the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml as a control substance. One microlitre per millilitre of 
 <italic class="italic">O. compactum</italic> essential oil is equivalent to 1 mg/ml approximately, so levamisole was more potent. However, this treatment is not available for humans and is used only in veterinary.
