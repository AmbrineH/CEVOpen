<p class="p">The present study proved that the highly active phytochemicals containing sesquiterpenes, present in the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">E. dysenterica</italic> leaves, may serve as a potent natural wound healing compound with an important role in human health and the toxicological evaluation of oEd. Our data demonstrated that oEd provides stimulation for the migration in epithelial cells. This action is probably due to the presence of terpene compounds in its composition. In addition, it affords anti-inflammatory protection by suppressing the production of excess intracellular nitric oxide. Moreover, toxicological evaluation of oEd provides us with crucial information, which is helpful in understanding its effect(s) in an in vivo system. The results not only suggested that oEd has the potential to be used in complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of skin injuries, they also support its feasibility to obtain effective and safe dermatological products for the topical treatment of skin injuries. Our results provide a starting point for further studies aimed at elucidating the molecular processes and signaling pathways underlying fibroblast proliferation and migration induced by 
 <italic class="italic">Eugenia dysenterica</italic> preparations.
