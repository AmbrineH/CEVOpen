<p class="p">Wound healing is a multiphase process involving the interaction of a complex cascade of cellular and biochemical stages, leading to the restoration of structural and functional integrity of damaged tissues. This process involves continuous cell-cell interaction of soluble mediators and extracellular matrix interactions that allow the process to proceed in different overlapping phases. The healing process includes inflammation, wound contraction, re-epithelialization, tissue remodeling, and granulation tissue formation with angiogenesis. Therefore, the primary goals of wound treatments are rapid closure, together with a functional and aesthetically satisfactory scar [
