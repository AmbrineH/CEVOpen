<p class="p">Compared with other studies, the reported results confirm that terpenes show low toxicity in human fibroblasts and in macrophages [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. β-caryophyllene also found in 
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> oil did not show cytotoxicity to skin cells [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] α-humulene was also significantly less cytotoxic against human fibroblasts than against tumor cell lines (12). Terpenes are the main constituents of essential oils and have a ‘Generally Regarded as Safe’ (GRAS) status with the Federal Drug Administration of the United States of America. Furthermore, they have low systemic toxicity and skin irritancy, not to mention good percutaneous absorption [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The data above shows that sesquiterpenes are abundant in oEd, corroborating results present in the literature regarding classes of terpenes. Furthermore, a Phototoxicity Test (OECD N° 432, 2004) using 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake cells showed that hydroalcoholic leaf extract from
