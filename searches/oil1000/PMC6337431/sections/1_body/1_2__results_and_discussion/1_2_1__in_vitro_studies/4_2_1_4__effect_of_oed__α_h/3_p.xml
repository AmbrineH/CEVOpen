 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Oxidative stress and inflammation are common features of many chronic diseases and their complications. They have also been linked to inflammatory disease processes. Previous studies have shown that plants possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help counter disease processes. Fernandes et al. (2007), reported that both compounds reduced prostaglandin E

Another possibility for the anti-inflammatory action may be linked to the ability of β-caryophyllene to act as a functional CB2 receptor anti-inflammatory ligand, reducing cytokine levels in a culture of macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide [
