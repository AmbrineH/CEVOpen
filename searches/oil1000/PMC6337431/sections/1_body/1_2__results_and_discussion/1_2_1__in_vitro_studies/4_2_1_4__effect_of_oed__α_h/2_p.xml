 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00002-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, in stimulated RAW 264.7 cells upon LPS treatment was treated with oEd at two different concentrations (292.6 µg/mL and 146.3 µg/mL) and was observed the nitrite concentrations production in the medium decreased. The different concentrations of oEd inhibited NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7, while different concentration of dexamethasone inhibited less than 50% of NO production, used as a positive control. In addition, NO production was also significantly inhibited by α-humulene, when compared to the dexamethasone at all tested concentrations (
