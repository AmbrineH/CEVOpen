<p class="p">Innate immune system cells play a central role in the inflammatory response following tissue injury. Macrophages play a critical role in the response to perturbations of tissue homeostasis and participate in the onset of the inflammatory event. These cells are also crucial for the development of subsequent events, especially the resolution of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria cell walls, can produce several inflammatory mediators, among them nitric oxide (NO), the most important mediator in human health and disease. However, excessive NO levels are toxic as they form free radical groups, such as superoxide, resulting in the production of toxic peroxynitrite, which can in turn trigger consequences such as inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, NO production may provide a measure to assess the effects of compounds on the inflammatory process. The present study examined the potential for oEd to reduce inflammation effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages in vitro.
