<p class="p">Khorshid et al. (2010) have highlighted the wound healing effects of some secondary metabolites stimulating fibroblasts. The essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus tenuiflorus</italic> leaves stimulates the growth of fibroblasts in vitro, similarly to this study [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. These findings imply that the terpenes present in the leaf oil of 
 <italic class="italic">E. dysenterica</italic> could be responsible for promoting wound healing activity by acting at the proliferative stage via: angiogenesis, collagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction. Sesquiterpenes are reported to facilitate wound healing. Investigation of the in vivo anti-inflammatory action of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Cordia verbenacea</italic> has suggested that the active compounds α-humulene and β-caryophyllene that act with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), could be an interesting target, since this molecule is involved in the induction of inflammation and many cutaneous and systemic inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Evidence suggests that α-humulene might constitute a relevant alternative for the control of B1-receptor upregulation [
