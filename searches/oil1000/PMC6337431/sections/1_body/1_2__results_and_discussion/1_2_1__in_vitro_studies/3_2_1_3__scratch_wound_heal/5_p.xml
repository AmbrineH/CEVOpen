<p class="p">Tsala et al. (2013) reported that numerous crude natural preparations and purified compounds have been tested for their effect(s) on skin cell migration or proliferation. Of the aforementioned, the terpenoids accelerated re-epithelialization and fibrosis in an artificial dermal surgical wound and suggested the possibility of their use as topical agent modulators of skin cells: Fibroblasts and keratinocytes [

Recently, the photoprotective effects of leaf hydroalcoholic extract were demonstrated in HFF-1 human foreskin fibroblasts. A vegetable derivative was found to promote cell regeneration after ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure [
