<p class="p">Pharmacological studies carried out with the oEd showed a pronounced topical healing action of this natural product. The results of the oEd and α-humulene application in the scratch assay model showed that oEd at the dose of 542.2 µg/mL (IC50) promoted fibroblast migration in mechanically induced wounds, an effect that was significantly different from the control (
