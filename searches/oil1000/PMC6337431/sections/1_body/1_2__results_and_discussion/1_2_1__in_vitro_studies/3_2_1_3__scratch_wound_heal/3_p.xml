<p class="p">Dermal wound healing involves a cascade of complex events including angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This mitogenic effect is a positive event for the wound healing process because fibroblasts are important cells involved in wound contraction, fibroplasias, extracellular matrix production, and the attenuation of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The activity of oEd can be the result of the synergistic effects of associated compounds present [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], such as β -caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene, which is reported in the literature as possessing potential anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Research has shown the anti-inflammatory in vivo effects of β -caryophyllene and α-humulene with their ability to inhibit histamine, in a similar way to dexamethasone [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In addition, β-caryophyllene inhibited both interleukin IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines, suggesting that these terpenoid compounds also have an anti-inflammatory potential through the inhibition of T-cell immune responses, ratifying its immunomodulatory potential [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that β-caryophyllene binds to the CB2 subtype of the cannabinoid receptors, suggesting that β-caryophyllene may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of oEd, by means of CB2 activation, and that this sesquiterpene could potentially be modulating the inflammatory response via the endocannabinoid system [
