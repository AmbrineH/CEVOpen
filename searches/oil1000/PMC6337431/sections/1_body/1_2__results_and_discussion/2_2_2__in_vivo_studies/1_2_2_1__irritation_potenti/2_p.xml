<p class="p">The safety of oEd, with regards to the irritation parameters, was shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00002-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. When different concentrations of oEd were tested in chorioallantoic membrane, in order to determine irritancy endpoints, such as lysis, hemorrhage, and coagulation, have no adverse effects were observed indicating a minor irritant potential. However, above IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> exposure, concentrations of 584 and 1168 Âµg/mL triggered irritancy effects such as slight and moderate vascular damage, respectively. It was observed that the positive 0.1 M NaOH control induced hyperplasia and hemorrhage in 0.5 min and coagulation in two min. The IS value of NaOH was 21, suggesting that it could induce severe irritation.
