<p class="p">The results of CAM assay revealed that oil-treated CAMs branched out into more multi-stage capillaries and more abundant neo-vasculatures, as shown in

Together, our results in the present report suggests that oEd promoted the angiogenic processes as it increased the number of blood vessels for all treatments with oEd (scoring three) equivalent to the positive control (scoring 3) in comparison to the negative control (olive oil scoring zero), which maintained the similar blood vessels number and vessel wall thickness during the experiment [

This effective anti-inflammatory capacity of glucocorticoid is due to the fact that drug to decrease angiogenesis is associated with significant reductions in the levels of prostaglandin E
