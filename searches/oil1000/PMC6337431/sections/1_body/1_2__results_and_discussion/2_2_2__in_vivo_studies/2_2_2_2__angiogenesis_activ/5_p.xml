This result showed higher topical effectiveness, probably due to its involvement with the increase angiogenesis and dermal remodeling imputed to the α-humulene and activation of growth factor VEGF [

Innumerable angiogenic factors such as VEGF, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 are activated by inflammatory cells and the VEGF family members are the major mediators of the regulatory machinery that controls angiogenesis during development and in pathological conditions [
