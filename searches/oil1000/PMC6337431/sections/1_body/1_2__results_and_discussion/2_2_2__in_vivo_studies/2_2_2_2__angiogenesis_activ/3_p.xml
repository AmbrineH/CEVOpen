<p class="p">Tissue repair concerns many cellular events including: Coagulation, inflammation, epithelialization, granulation tissue formation (a complex process characterized by angiogenesis), and matrix and tissue remodeling [

Skin repair condition is a complex reaction in the vascularized tissue associated with multifactorial origins, internal or external stimuli or both can cause the cell damage. The ultimate goal of this protective response is to rid the organism of both the initial cause of cell injury, the consequences of which can result in structural damage. However, an exaggerated or unregulated prolonged inflammatory process can also induce tissue damage and is in fact the cause of many chronic diseases [

Therefore, in recent years, natural compounds are being employed in wound treatments because of their ability to promote blood clotting, fight infection, and accelerate wound healing. These bioactive agents usually modulate one or more phases of the healing process [
