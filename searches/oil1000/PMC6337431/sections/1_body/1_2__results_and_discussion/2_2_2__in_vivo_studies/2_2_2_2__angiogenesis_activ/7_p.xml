<p class="p">Based on the aforementioned bioactivities, it might partially explain why this oil can exhibit the anti-inflammatory effect in the LPS-stimulated RAW246.7 macrophages and the scratch-induced wounds. Our results suggest that this native Brazilian species is capable of neutralizing cytokines and exhibits good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, a fact that seems to relate to mediator modulation by phytochemicals. Our analyses showed that this species contains high concentrations of bioactive sesquiterpene compounds, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humelene, thus suggesting that these compounds may be responsible for their activities. The results indicate that essential oils from
