<p class="p">A wound healing assay was performed to observe the effect of the oED on the migration ability of the epithelial cells. The L929 cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/well into fibronectin-coated six-well plates. The cells monolayer was manually scratched with a yellow PBS-rinsed plastic pipette tip and treated with 542.2 µg/mL solution of oil plus DMEM, or only with DMEM (control) as well as α-humulene (biological standard). Each evaluated sample was plated in triplicate. An inverted microscope (Zeiss Primo Vert, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss ERc 5s, Göttingen, Germany) was used to obtain images of the wound healing at different timepoints of each treatment under magnification (×10). Wound closure was monitored at 24 h, until the borders of the wound could no longer be identified. The closure was measured by wound area in each period and expressed as a percentage of the initial wound area at 0 h. Statistical tests were considered as significance at the level of 5% (
