<p class="p">Analysis of the intracellular nitric oxide production by macrophages was performed using a protocol based on Griess’s method [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Firstly, the MTT assay was undertaken to determine the non-cytotoxic concentrations of oil that maintained cell viability ≥ 50% (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). Briefly, the cells (0.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL) in 10% FBS–DMEM with phenol red were seeded into 12-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were subsequently exposed to two different oil concentrations (146.3 and 291 μg/mL), α-humulene (155.58 and 311.15 μg/mL) or culture medium only (control cells) for 3 h at 37 °C and stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 48 h. The cell free culture medium was collected and analyzed for nitrite accumulation as an indicator of NO production by the Griess reagent [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] as follows: 100 μL of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthyl ethylenediamine and 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution) were added to 100 μL of each supernatant from the sample-treated cells. The plates were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently read at 540 nm. The quantity of nitrite in the supernatant samples was estimated by measuring the absorbance of a standard solution of sodium nitrite salt treated under the same conditions with Griess reagent. The percentage of inhibition was expressed as 100 × [1-(NO release with sample-spontaneous release)/(NO release without sample-spontaneous release)].
