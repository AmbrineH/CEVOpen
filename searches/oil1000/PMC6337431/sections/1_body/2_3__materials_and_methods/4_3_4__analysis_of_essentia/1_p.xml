<p class="p">The GC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph-model QP2010 Ultra (Kyoto, Japan). The oil was separated on a Rtx-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Restek, Lisses, France). The column temperature program was: 50 °C/1.5 min, followed by a rate of 4 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 200 °C, then a rate of 10 °C to 300 °C, and finally 300 °C/5 min. The injector temperature was 280 °C. The sample (1.0 μL in ethyl acetate) was injected with a 1:30 split ratio. The carrier gas was helium at 1.0 mL/min. Data processing of the obtained mass spectra was carried out with the GC-MS Solution Ver. 4.45 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The identification of essential oil compounds was assigned by comparison of their retention time using caryophyllene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA and a-humulene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) used as a reference standard, as well as by comparison of the mass spectra fragmentation patterns with the NIST—Mass Spectral Database, version 2.2, 2014 (NIST Standard Reference Data, USA).
