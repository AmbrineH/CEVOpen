<p class="p">A mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and macrophages cell line (RAW 264.7) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). Samples were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere for 72 h. Fibroblast cell lines were detached with trypsin (0.25%) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; 1 mM) solution and RAW 264.7 with a cell scraper. The cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the mitochondrial viability of L-929 and Raw cell lines after treatment with the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The L-929 cell suspension was prepared from confluent monolayer cultures and plated at a density of 1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells, while the RAW cell line (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells) were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well microtitre plate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator. Cells were subsequently treated with 200 µL of the appropriate dilutions of the previously prepared oil in growth medium with 0.5% DMSO in concentrations ranging from 32.656 to 4180 µg/mL for oil, or 34.727 to 4445 µg/mL to α-humulene. DMEM only, or with 0.5% DMSO, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All samples were incubated in parallel with the test cultures for 24 h. After incubation, the supernatant was aspirated and 50 µL of MTT solution at 1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for a further 4 h. Acidified isopropanol (150 µL) was then added to solubilize the formazan crystals produced by mitochondrial activity. Cell survival was quantified by an absorbance measurement at 570 nm in a Beckman Coulter Microplate reader (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value represents the sample concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell survival.
