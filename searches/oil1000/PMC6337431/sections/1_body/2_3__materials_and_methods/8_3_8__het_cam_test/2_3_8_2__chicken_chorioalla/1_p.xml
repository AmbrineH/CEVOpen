 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. After incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (60–70% relative humidity) with appropriate rotation, fertilized eggs were opened, and the shell membrane removed to expose the CAM. On day five of incubation, a circular window was opened in the large end of the eggshell and the membrane removed. The window was resealed with adhesive tape and eggs were returned to the incubator until day eight. Filter paper disks soaked with 20 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">E. dysenterica</italic> oil solutions at different dilutions (ranging from 73–1168 µg/disk) were placed on top of the growing CAM at day 13 of incubation under sterile conditions. Positive (Regederm, Pele nova Biotecnologia, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil) 20 μL of an aqueous solution of 1000 mg/mL (20 mg/disk), negative (20 μL olive oil), and inhibitor (80 μg/disk dexamethasone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) controls were included. All windows were sealed with transparent adhesive tape and the eggs were incubated at 37 °C for three days. The angiogenic response was evaluated 72 h after the treatments. On the 16th day of fertilization, the sealing tape was removed and the representative images of the control groups and or treated with the above concentrations of each of the compounds were captured by an Axiovert Light Microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany), with the aid of the AxioVision Imaging System (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Göttingen, Germany) at a magnification of 0.5 × 1.25. Blood vessels were quantified by macroscopic evaluation of the angiogenic response by analyzing variations in the distribution and density of CAM vessels adjacent to the graft site. Based on the semiquantitative scoring method by Reference [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], the arbitrary scale of zero–five values is as follows—0 describes a condition of the vascular network that is unchanged with respect to the time of grafting; 1 marks a slight increment in vessel density associated with occasional changes in the course of vessels converging toward the graft site; and 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to a gradual increase in vessel density associated with increased irregularity in their course; while a rating of
