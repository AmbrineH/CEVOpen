<p class="p">The Hen’s Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM), was used to determine the essential oil irritation potential, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The SPF (specific pathogen free) eggs were incubated for 10 days at a temperature of 38.0 ± 0.5 °C and a relative humidity of approximately 60–70%. A 300 μL aliquot of each sample at different concentrations (a range of 73–1168 µg/mL) eluted in olive oil was applied to five different fertilized eggs per group. After 20 s of contact time, the sample was removed, and the membrane washed with an isotonic saline solution at 37 °C. The CAM reactions were observed for 300 s. At 0.5, 2, and 5 min, the following phenomena were observed: Hyperplasia, hemorrhage, and coagulation (maximum value of 21). Regarding the irritation score (IS), 0–0.9 represents no irritation, 1–4.9 represents slight irritation, 5–8.9 is considered as moderate irritation, and 8–21 constitutes serious irritation [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The membrane was examined over a five-minute period. All reactions observed were scored according to the time of their appearance and were analyzed for hemorrhage, lysis and coagulation of blood vessels. The products were classified according to their irritancy potential using the HET-CAM test and the final classification. The final result was expressed as the mean value of five egg tests. The positive control was 0.1 M NaOH. The negative control was 0.9% NaCl and olive oil. The HET-CAM test was performed using five eggs per sample.
