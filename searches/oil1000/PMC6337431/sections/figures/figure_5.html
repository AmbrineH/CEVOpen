 <p> Effects of essential oil from E. dysenterica leaves on LPS-induced NO in RAW 264.7 using the Griess assay. Macrophages were incubated in the presence of oEd, α-humulene or dexamethasone in combination with 1 µg/mL LPS for 48 h. The significant differences related to the concentration values of essential oil (oEd); α-humulene (α-humu) and dexamethasone (Dexa) from the inhibition of nitric oxide production of following LPS-stimulation. Values in three experiments were calculated by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test ( a p &lt; 0.05 vs. Dexa 125. b p &lt; 0.05 vs. Dexa 62.5. c p &lt; 0.05 vs. LPS). </p>
