  <p class="p">Effects of essential oil from 
   <italic class="italic">E. dysenterica</italic> leaves on migration changes in L929 fibroblast cells after treatment monitored by phase contrast microscopy. A scratch wound healing assay was performed on L929 cells treated with 542.2 µg/mL of oEd to determine cell migration ability. Showing scratch wounds in L929 cells at time 0 h and representing wound status 24 h after the initiation of the scratch when the cells were treated with the vehicle control and concentration of oEd. Wounds were created and oEd was added immediately. Wounds were evaluated at 6, 12, and 24 h after oEd administration. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>). Wound healing area was measured by calculating the wound area in each period and expressed as a percentage of the initial wound area at time zero, with extract compared to the control (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>). The statistical analysis (One way ANOVA with Tukey’s test) compares treatment with control (
