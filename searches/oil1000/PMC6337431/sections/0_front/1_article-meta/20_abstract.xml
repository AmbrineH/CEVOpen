 <p class="p">The use of natural oils in topical pharmaceutical preparations has usually presented safe agents for the improvement of human health. Based on research into the immense potential of wound management and healing, we aimed to validate the use of topical natural products by studying the ability of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Eugenia dysenterica</italic> DC leaves (oEd) to stimulate in vitro skin cell migration. Skin cytotoxicity was evaluated using a fibroblast cell line (L929) by MTT assay. The oil chemical profile was investigated by GC-MS. Moreover, the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced nitric oxide (NO) production in the macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) tested. The Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay was used to evaluate the angiogenic activity and irritating potential of the oil. The oEd induces skin cell migration in a scratch assay at a concentration of 542.2 µg/mL. α-humulene and β-caryophyllene, the major compounds of this oil, as determined by GC-MS, may partly explain the migration effect. The inhibition of nitric oxide by oEd and α-humulene suggested an anti-inflammatory effect. The CAM assay showed that treatment with oEd ≤ 292 µg/mL did not cause skin injury, and that it can promote angiogenesis in vivo. Hence, these results indicate the feasibility of the essential oil of
