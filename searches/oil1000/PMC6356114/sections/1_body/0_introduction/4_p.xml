<p id="p0020" class="p">A common alternative to the use of GC-MS is to use fluorescence, a quicker and less expensive method to estimate oil concentrations in near real time, but these techniques provide no detail on oil composition. A basic fluorescence method was developed in the 1980's for MARPOLMON: Marine Pollution Monitoring of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission as IOC Manuals and Guides 13 (
