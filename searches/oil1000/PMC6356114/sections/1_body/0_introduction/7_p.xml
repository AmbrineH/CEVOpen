<p id="p0035" class="p">The Aggregation and Degradation of Dispersants and Oil by Microbial Exopolymers (ADDOMEx) consortium was funded by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI) to investigate the mechanism of marine oil snow formation (MOS), as it was discovered that marine snow was an effective transport vehicle for oil to the seafloor (

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quigg et al., 2016</xref>) for review), the ADDOMEx team conducted a diverse series of experiments. As different experimental methods were ranging from large (&gt;100 L) glass mesocosms (

Thus, an inter-laboratory inter-comparison exercise was designed and performed with the goals to 1) develop a method that allows EOE measurement using the different fluorometers and 2) ensure that these EOE measurements were inter-comparable.
