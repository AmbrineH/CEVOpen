<p id="p0025" class="p">To replicate field conditions below the oil-slick at the surface, during experiments, it is common to use the water-accommodated fraction of oil (WAF) as the exposure medium (

WAF replicates the physical state (dissolved, dispersed oil droplets) of the oil-water system under the sea surface during a spill. In order to mimic the application of dispersant to an oil slick, and the consequent increase of oil droplets abundance in the underlying water, chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) is used. Different procedures to produce WAF and CEWAF have been published, and standardized procedures to produce WAF and CEWAF with different chemical characteristics are available, though these are dependent on the type of oil and dispersant (e.g.
