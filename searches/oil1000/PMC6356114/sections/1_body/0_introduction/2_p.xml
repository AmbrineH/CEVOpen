<p id="p0010" class="p">A large research effort in the aftermath of the spill from the Macondo 252 well resulted in a number of journal articles that studied the fate and the effects of the oil under natural and laboratory conditions. Laboratory experiments and field studies were conducted at different levels of organization (molecular, individual, community, etc.) and on different scales (mL's to 100's of liters). One challenge which frequently plagues laboratory studies is the use of experimental conditions that are realistic and relevant to conditions in the field (
