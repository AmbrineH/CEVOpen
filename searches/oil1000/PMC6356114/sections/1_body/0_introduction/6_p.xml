<p id="p0030" class="p">If WAF is made with natural, unfiltered seawater, the presence of plankton, bacteria, and detritus complicates oil determinations. The presence of particles and droplets complicates fluorescence measurements, because particles and droplets create a heterogeneous medium that obstructs the light paths in the fluorescence cell. A simple solution to this problem is the use of organic extracts. The fluorescent method mentioned above (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IOC, 1984</xref>) has been standardized via a single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, chrysene, a four-benzene ring PAH to make measurements comparable world-wide (
