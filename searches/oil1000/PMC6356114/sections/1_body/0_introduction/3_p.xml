 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). These GC/MS or GC/MS/MS methods are essential for the characterization of the components of oils but are not rapid, as they require extraction with a solvent, chromatographic clean up techniques to remove interferences, and analyses using expensive instruments. Many experiments are conducted over short time periods (a few days at the most), and oil analysis using GC-MS makes it very difficult to provide the immediate feedback that allows the modifications of experimental conditions in real-time (
