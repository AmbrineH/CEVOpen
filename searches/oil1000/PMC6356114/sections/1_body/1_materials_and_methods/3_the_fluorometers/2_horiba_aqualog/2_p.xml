<p id="p0065" class="p">The measurement of EOE on the Horiba Aqualog was carried out in two steps. First, the optimal wavelengths was determined by performing a scan from 200 to 800 nm on a mid-range calibration standard (either 2 or 5 mg/L). The maximum signal intensity was observed at an excitation of 260 nm and an emission of 372 nm for the Macondo Surrogate oil (

Samples were measured at the same wavelengths and the calibration curve was used to determine EOE concentrations in mg L
