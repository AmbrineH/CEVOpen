<p id="p0070" class="p">During the first intercalibration exercise the Turner Trilogy was used with the crude oil module 7200-063, which has a 365 nm excitation and a 410–600 nm emission wavelength. As the maximum signal for the Macondo oil, as determined via the Horiba Aqualog, lay at an excitation of about 260 nm and an emission wavelength of 372, chlorophyll a and accessory pigments and colored dissolved organic matter, when present, interfered with the signal. By subtracting the “EOE” of the control mesocosm or blank, measured EOE were corrected for such interferences. During the second intercalibration exercise samples were measured using two different modules of the Turner Triology; the crude oil module 7200-063 described above, and a custom made module with an excitation filter at 260 ± 10 nm and an emission filter at 370 ± 10 nm.</p>
