<p id="p0050" class="p">A third set of intercalibration samples were collected during another mesocosm study (mesocosm VI). WAF and CEWAF samples were prepared in the BRT as in the first experiment and a total of ten samples (5 WAF and 5 CEWAF) were measured in both, the Horiba Aqualog and Shimadzu. In this mesocosm study, five replicate WAF and five replicate CEWAF mesocosms were set up and EOE in each measured by both instruments. Five mL of the samples were diluted with 5, 10 or 15 mL dichloromethane to extract the oil before measurement. A calibration curve (see above) was prepared and used to convert fluorescence units to EOE concentrations.</p>
