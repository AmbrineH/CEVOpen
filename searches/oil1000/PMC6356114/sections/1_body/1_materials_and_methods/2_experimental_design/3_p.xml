<p id="p0045" class="p">A second set of intercalibration samples (exercise 2) were prepared by making WAF and CEWAF in deionized water (DI) as well as in freshly collected natural seawater from the Gulf of Mexico. WAFs were made with 0.4–4 mL of Macondo Surrogate oil added to 1.8 L of water in a 2 L aspirator bottle and mixed at 300 rpm for 24 hours (

CEWAFs were made in a similar process except that Corexit (dispersant) was premixed with Macondo oil at a ratio of 1:20 (V/V). Two concentrations of WAF (WAF1 and WAF2) each in triplicates, and two concentrations of CEWAF (CEWAF1 and CEWAF2) in triplicate each were prepared in DI. One concentration of WAF (WAF3 with triplicates) and one concentration of CEWAF (CEWAF3 with triplicates) were prepared in seawater. All samples were extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL water sample extracted with 10 mL dichloromethane). This second intercalibration exercise was run as a blind test, meaning the nature of the samples were not known to the people measuring the samples. Only the Horiba Aqualog and Turner Trilogy participated in this second intercalibration exercise. Samples were measured immediately after extraction on the Horiba Aqualog whereas extracted samples were shipped overnight, and measured within a week in the Turner Trilogy. A calibration curve with Macondo Oil (MC 252) extracted in dichloromethane was also prepared on each instrument and used to convert the relative fluorescence units (RFU) of each instrument into EOE oil concentrations. The seven calibration points ranged from 0.1 mg/L to 10 mg/L of oil.
