<p id="p0040" class="p">A total of three intercalibration exercises were conducted. The first experiment was in association with a mesocosm experiment (mesocosm I). The production of WAF for the mesocosms study is described in 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wade etÂ al. (2017)</xref>. In summary, 24 mL Macondo surrogate oil was mixed with 130 L of seawater in a Baffled Recirculating Tank (BRT) and mixed for 14 hours before WAF was transferred to the mesocosm tanks. CEWAF was prepared with the same procedure except that Corexit (dispersant) was premixed with oil at a ratio of 1:20 (V/V) before addition to the BRT. Samples for the intercalibration were collected immediately after WAF and CEWAF production and measured directly i.e. without extraction. A second set of measurements were done on the same source water samples but this time, samples were extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL water sample extracted with 20 mL dichloromethane). The comparison was meant to determine if extraction of samples before fluorescence measurements was a necessary step. A total of eight unextracted and eight extracted samples were measured, each including four oil calibration standards, two replicates of the WAF and two replicates of CEWAF. The fluorescence emissions of each of these samples was measured on all three instruments; a Horiba Aqualog-UV-800, a Turner Trilogy, and a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-1501 (see below).
