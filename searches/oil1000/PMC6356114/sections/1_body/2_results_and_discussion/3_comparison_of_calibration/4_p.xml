<p id="p0105" class="p">However, absolute values made it evident that Corexit (dispersant) does not work in DI water. Measured EOE concentrations in CEWAF made in deionized water (zero salinity) did not lead to increased dispersion of oil (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Addition of Corexit (dispersant) to oil was expected to disperse the oil, forming more, smaller droplets and also increase the dissolved concentration of oil. The solutions of WAF1 and CEWAF1 were both made with DI and contained the same amount of oil. The measured EOE value for CEWAF1 (0.97 mg/L) was only slightly higher than that for WAF1 (0.47 mg/L), indicating very limited dispersion of oil into the water. The CEWAF3 solution, made in natural seawater with the same amount of oil as WAF1 and CEWAF1, had much higher EOE values (32.88 mg/L), confirming that in seawater Corexit (dispersant) is very effective in dispersing oil. An additional experiment with a single hydrocarbon (phenanthrene), where 30 Î¼L of Corexit (dispersant) was added to a 1 ppm phenanthrene solution in DI or seawater, also confirmed that dispersability of Corexit (dispersant) is greatly reduced in fresh water. EOE values in fresh water were half of those in seawater.
