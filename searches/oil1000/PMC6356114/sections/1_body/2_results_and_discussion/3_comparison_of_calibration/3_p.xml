<p id="p0100" class="p">A comparison of the EOE concentrations obtained with the Horiba Aqualog and Turner Trilogy fluorometers of the WAF and CEWAF samples of intercalibration 2 is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The RFU and EOE values measured with the custom module of the Turner correlated well with those measured with the standard crude oil module of the Turner (Pearson, rˆ2 = 0.9992, n = 6). The agreement in data measured with both the Turner Trilogy and the Horiba Aqualog is excellent (Pearson correlation = 0.9999), with no significant differences between the means [t(6) = 1.15; p = 0.30].
