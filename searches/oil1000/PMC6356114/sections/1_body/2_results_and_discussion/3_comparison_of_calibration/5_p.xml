<p id="p0110" class="p">Intercalibration experiment 3, that compared EOE concentrations obtained with Horiba Aqualog and Shimadzu fluorometers is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Similar to the previous dataset, agreement between EOE concentrations obtained with the Horiba Aqualog and Shimadzu fluorometers is excellent (Pearson correlation = 0.995), with no significant difference [t(9) = 0.87; p = 0.406] between the mean concentrations of the two instruments. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of all sample measurements are below 1% for Shimadzu.
