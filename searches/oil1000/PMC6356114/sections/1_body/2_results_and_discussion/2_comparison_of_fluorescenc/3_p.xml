 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Spearman correlation coefficients were &gt;0.96 between the Turner and the other instruments and 1.00 between the Shimadzu and the Horiba and p values were always &lt;0.001 (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Presumably, the improved results were due to the extraction with DCM, which combines both particulate (droplets) and dissolved oil in a solution eliminating problems caused by oil droplets and particles in a fluorometer cuvette. Presence of oil droplets in WAF and CEWAF was also confirmed by 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singer et al. (2000)</xref> that showed WAF and CEWAF can have oil droplets of different sizes. Usually CEWAF contains smaller, but more abundant droplets than WAF (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wade et al., 2017</xref>). Various organic solvents have been used, but DCM has been shown to be a better solvent than hexane in the presence of particulate material (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Law et al., 1987</xref>). Extracts in DCM are normally homogenous solutions, and light scattering by particles including microbes is not a problem. Extraction with DCM works efficiently for most types of the water and sediment environmental samples. However, extraction (DCM) of samples with high organic matter content (including Corexit) or samples from wastewater treatment plant can cause emulsion problems during extraction. For small volume samples (1–4 L), repeated (3–4 times) extraction with DCM, adding salt to the water and filtering the extract through sodium sulphate generally works. However, some petroleum products where oils need to be separated from emulsfiers, different treatments to eliminate these emulsions (e.g. high concentrations of dispersant) may be required (
