<p id="p0080" class="p">The results of the first inter-calibration, where the importance of sample extraction was tested are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. A comparison between instruments when samples were measured directly, without extraction, are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 1</xref>, as relative fluorescence units (RFU) of each instrument. Scatter of the determined concentrations is high, which is reflected in the relatively low Spearman correlation coefficients that nevertheless are statistically significant (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). There was slightly better agreement (spearman correlation coefficient 0.98) between the Turner and Shimadzu fluorometers than between Shimadzu and Horiba (0.81) or Turner and Horiba (0.83).
