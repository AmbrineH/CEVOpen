<p id="p0115" class="p">Analysis of WAF and CEWAF samples by fluorescence is a rapid method for obtaining semi-quantitative results of oil concentrations in seawater when calibrated with the correct oil. This method loses reliability if water samples are analyzed directly, rather than extracted, because of increased light scattering due to of oil droplets and other particles such micro-organisms (phytoplankton and bacteria). Extraction in dichloromethane eliminates these problems and provides vey comparable results using different instruments. The strength of the method are that it is rapid, easy and cheap. Even a small Turner Triology instrument can give reliable results. EOE fluorescence provides a good screening technique with good inter-comparability. The use of this technique for rapid feedback during experiments, where the oil added is known and can be used for the calibration is especially useful. Overall, this study shows that EOE is a quick and reliable estimation oil concentration in water samples and can be easily measured by different spectrofluorometer in most laboratories.</p>
