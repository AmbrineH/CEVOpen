<p class="p">Preliminary TLC test revealed the presence of flavonoids in both
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> AE and EE, which was previously described by other researches [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The main identified volatile principle, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, is a nonaromatic oxygenated hydrocarbon (ketone) and has a slightly fatty aroma with reported antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] properties. Other main identified compounds were 
 <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-ionone (13.74%) and dodecanoic acid (6.00%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes account for almost 27% of the identified oil. Different compositions of the EO from different
 <italic class="italic"> Tamarix</italic> species were also reported in literature. As described by Orfali [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one was found to be the major compound (46.09%) in
 <italic class="italic"> T. nilotica</italic> of Saudi Arabia. Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester was reported as the major principle in
 <italic class="italic"> T. chinensis</italic> fruit [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Hexadecanoic acid (in aerial parts and stems), 2,4-nonadienal (in flowers), and germacrene D (in leaves) were, however, reported as majors of
 <italic class="italic"> T. boveana </italic>[
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Like in
 <italic class="italic"> T. chinensis</italic>, nonaromatic hydrocarbons resembled the abundant group of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> aerial parts, while fatty acids and fatty esters are the majors in
 <italic class="italic"> T. boveana</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. On the other hand, among terpenes, oxygenated and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes are prevalent in
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> T. boveana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], respectively.
