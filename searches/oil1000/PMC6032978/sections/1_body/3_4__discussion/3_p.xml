<p class="p">On the other hand, recent study on methanol extract of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> had investigated its potential cytotoxicity using brine shrimp method and revealed 70% mortality rate at concentration of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In other studies, different extract of
 <italic class="italic"> T. nilotica</italic> was tested against mouse lymphoma, rat hepatoma, and rat glioma cell lines. Interestingly, it was the presence of potent anticancer agents in the alcohol extract that could result in a powerful cytotoxic effect with % survival of 58.9 at 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Also,
 <italic class="italic"> T. africana</italic> shoot extract inhibited the growth of A-549 lung carcinoma cells, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 34 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Previous reports of phytochemical screening of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> revealed its high content of flavonoids, polyphenols, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Several phenolic compounds isolated from Tamaricaceae were tested for their cytotoxic effects against different cancer cell lines and were shown to exhibit cytotoxic potentials [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Of these compounds are ferulic acid derivatives. Aphyllin, the isolated glycosylated isoferulic acid, exhibited a distinct radical scavenging activity and was found to improve the viability of human keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Ellagitannins were also reported to exhibit significant host-mediated antitumor and remarkable antiangiogenic activities [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Tamarixetin was also found to be cytotoxic against leukemia cells [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. This latter compound inhibited proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, induced apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle progression. Syringic acid, a natural phenolic compound with selective antimitogenic activity on human malignant melanoma cells, was recently isolated from the methanol extract of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aucheriana </italic>[
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Methyl ferulate from
 <italic class="italic"> T. aucheriana</italic> demonstrated cytotoxic and chemo-sensitizing effects [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], while glucuronosylated flavonoids from
 <italic class="italic"> T. gallica </italic>aerial part were shown to prevent amyloid aggregation [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The potent cytotoxic activity observed for the tested extracts of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> under study is potentially attributed to presence of such compounds belonging principally to the phenolic fraction and other secondary metabolites as revealed by the TLC tests (
