<p class="p">Biologically, several previous studies were also performed on the different species of
 <italic class="italic"> Tamarix</italic>. In the current study, both the AE and EE of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> showed an interesting cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 cells. According to NCI guidelines [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the selective cytotoxicity of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> AE (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 2.17 ± 0.10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) against MCF-7 cells proved to be comparable to that of cisplatin (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 1.17 ± 0.13 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) and even with higher safety as revealed by their relative IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values on fibroblast cells (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL): 79.99 ± 4.90 for AE versus 9.08 ± 0.29 for cisplatin). Despite the higher IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values on fibroblast cells compared with doxorubicin and cisplatin, both extracts unfortunately lacked cytotoxic potential against Panc-1 or Caco-2 cell lines in the tested concentration range.
