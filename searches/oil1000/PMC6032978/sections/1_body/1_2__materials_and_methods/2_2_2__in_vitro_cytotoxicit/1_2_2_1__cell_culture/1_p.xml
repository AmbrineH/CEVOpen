<p class="p">Three different adherent cancer cell lines, named MCF-7 (ATCC: HTB-22™), Caco-2 (ATCC: HTB-37™), and Panc-1 (ATCC: CRL-1469™) cells, were used for testing the antiproliferative activity. Normal periodontal fibroblast cell line (provided from School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Jordan) was used for testing selective toxicity of reference drugs and the different extracts. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Caisson Laboratories Inc., USA) at 37°C. Cells dilution with medium to give optimal plating densities (determined by the supplier for each cell line) was carried out before they were plated in 96-well plates.</p>
