<p class="p">Increasing concentrations of extracts and control drugs were added to the plated cells. Each concentration was added in 3 replicates for each test material and the test was repeated 3 times independently. The different concentrations used for EtOH extracts contain no more than 2% of solvent DMSO. As indicated in previous studies [
