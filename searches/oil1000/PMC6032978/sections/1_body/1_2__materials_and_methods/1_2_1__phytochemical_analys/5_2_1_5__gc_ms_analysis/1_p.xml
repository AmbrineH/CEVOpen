<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of EO was performed in duplicate after appropriate dilution of the hydrodistilled oil in GC grade n-hexane. Around 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L aliquot of the diluted oil was injected into a split-splitless injector of a Varian Chrompack CP_3800 GC/MS/MS-200 (Saturn, Netherlands) GC-MS outfitted with DB-5 (5% diphenyl, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane) capillary column (30 m length x 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness). The injector temperature was kept at 250°C with a split ratio of 1:10 and Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute. The column temperature was programmed to be initially isothermal at 60°C for 1 minute and then to increase up to 246°C at a rate of 3°C/minute and then to be kept isothermal at 246°C for 3 minutes for a total run time of about 66 min. The MS ionization source temperature was 180°C with an ionization voltage of 70 eV.
