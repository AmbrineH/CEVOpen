<p class="p">Quantitative analysis of the hydrodistilled oil (performed in duplicate) was carried out using a Focus GC (Thermo Electron Corporation) gas chromatograph equipped with fused silica capillary column OPTIMA-5 (5% diphenyl 95% dimethyl polysiloxane; 30 m length × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness). The column was coupled to an injector (split-splitless type) and flame-ionization detector (FID). The same temperature program was used as mentioned above in GC-MS analysis section. Injector temperature was maintained at 250°C with split ratio of 1:50, while FID temperature was held at 300°C. Percent content (% w/w) of each component was calculated using its corresponding normalized relative area obtained by FID and assuming a unity response by all components [
