<p class="p">Qualitatively, identification of volatile components was carried out using built-in libraries (e.g., Wiley, Terpenes, NIST, and Adams' libraries). A comparison of the calculated Arithmetic Retention Index (RI) of each identified component with literature reference value measured with a column of identical polarity alongside MS spectrum matching helped to confirm the identification [
