<p class="p">Both the aqueous and ethanol extracts of the dried plant aerial parts were prepared by maceration. Separately, a powdered 100 g quantity was placed in round-bottomed flask and either a 1 L of 70% ethanol (EtOH) or 1 L distilled water was added in a ratio of 1:10. Flasks were kept for one week in a cool place; the filtrates were collected and then dried using rotary evaporator at 40°C. The dried extracts were kept in tightly closed flasks, at 4°C, for subsequent analysis.</p>
