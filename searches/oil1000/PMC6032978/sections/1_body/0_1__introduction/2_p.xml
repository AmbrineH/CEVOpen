 <italic class="italic">Tamarix aphylla</italic> (L.), which is known as ‘Tamarisk' or ‘Athel' in Jordan, is an evergreen tree with tiny, triangular, and scale-like leaves. It grows in dense groves and it flourishes in high alkalinity-salinity soils. Tamarisk is native throughout the Middle East across East, North, and Central Africa and to a little extent into parts of Western and Southern Asia [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Many communities have used
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> in traditional medicine. Its leaves were used for wounds and abscess healing, as astringent, and for rheumatism and joint pain [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Several studies have recognized the various types of secondary metabolites present in
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic>. Reports had identified the presence of flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], phenolics [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], hydrolysable tannins [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] in the plant various extracts. Earlier investigations on the effects of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> on biological systems had revealed its insect growth inhibitory activity due to presence of ellagic acid [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The isolated isoferulic acid derivative, aphyllin, was also shown to exhibit a distinct radical scavenging activity and to improve the viability of human keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, alcohol extract from leaves of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> was shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing activities. The authors suggested that the presence of known active phytochemicals like flavonoids and polyphenols explains these reported effects [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The plant was also reported to exhibit analgesic and antipyretic activities [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>].
