In this present study, the EO hydrodistilled from aerial parts of wild grown Jordanian species of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for purpose of chemical composition analysis.
 <italic class="italic"> In vitro</italic> cytotoxic activities of the aqueous extract (AE) and ethanol extract (EE) against human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and pancreatic carcinoma (Panc-1) cancer cell lines alongside normal human fibroblasts were also assessed. Interestingly, this is the first time that the EO composition and the cytotoxic activities of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> aerial parts are evaluated.
