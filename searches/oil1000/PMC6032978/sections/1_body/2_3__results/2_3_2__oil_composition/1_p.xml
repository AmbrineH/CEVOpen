<p class="p">The GC-MS chromatogram of the hydrodistilled EO from
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> aerial parts alongside the main identified components is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Many volatile principles that have been identified are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. As shown, the GC-MS analysis of
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> EO resulted in the identification of 33 components predominated mainly by 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone as the principal component (32.39%) and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ionone (13.74%) and dodecanoic acid (6.00%) as major ones. The majority of the volatile constituents which are classified as oxygenated nonterpenoid nonaromatic hydrocarbons (52.39%) were mainly containing, in addition to the principal component, dodecanoic acid (6.00%), tetradecanoic acid (3.35%), and tridecanal (2.39%). The prevalence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes is quite high (26.53%), with predominance of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ionone (13.74%), 5E,9E-farnesyl acetone (2.82%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-muurolen-15-al (2.27%), and 14-OH-9-epi-E-caryophyllene (2.16%). On the other hand, neryl acetone (2.82%) represented the main monoterpenes identified in
 <italic class="italic"> T. aphylla</italic> essential oil.
