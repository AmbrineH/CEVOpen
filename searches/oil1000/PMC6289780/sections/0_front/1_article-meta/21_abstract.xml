 <p class="p">Many terpenoid compounds have been extracted from different tissues of 
  <italic class="italic">Salvia guaranitica.</italic> However, the molecular genetic basis of terpene biosynthesis pathways is virtually unknown. In this study, approximately 4â€‰Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of 
  <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 32 million, comprising 186 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. A total of 61,400 unigenes were assembled 
  <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified 267 unigenes that are putatively involved in terpenoid metabolism (including, 198 mevalonate and methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes and 69 terpene synthases genes). Moreover, three terpene synthase genes were studied for their functions in terpenoid biosynthesis by using transgenic Arabidopsis; most transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing these terpene synthetic genes produced increased amounts of terpenoids compared with wild-type control. The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich blue anise sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in 
  <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>.
