 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> line (three leaf from each plant) were homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, after which the plant material powder was directly soaked in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane as a solvent in Amber storage bottles, 30 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids (

Afterward, the solvent was transferred using a glass pipette to a 10-ml glass centrifuge tube with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove plant debris. The supernatant was pipetted into glass vials with a screw cap and oil was concentrated until remaining 1.5 ml of concentrated oils under a stream of nitrogen gas with a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation) and water bath at room temperature (Toption-China-WD-12). The concentrated oils transferred to a fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids were used to reduce a loss of volatiles to the headspace. For absolute oil recovery, the remaining film crude oil in the internal surface of concentrated glass vials was dissolved in the minimum volume of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, thoroughly mixed and transferred to the same fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml. And the crimp vial was placed on the auto-sampler of the GC-MS system for GC-MS analysis, or each tube was covered with parafilm after closed with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and stored at −20 °C until GC-MS analysis. The same programme and standard conditions that were used for GC-MS analysis with 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> essential oil components were applied.
