<p class="p">Total RNAs from the three biological leaf replicates were extracted for RNA-Seq. Moreover, total RNAs from three biological replicates from each of the plant parts (old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots) were extracted for qRT-PCR. Additionally, total RNAs from three biological replicates of 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> were extracted for semiquantitative RT-PCR using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and treated with DNase I (Takara). RNA quality was examined on 1% agarose gels, and the purity was analysed using a Nano-Photometer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA pools were prepared for cDNA libraries by mixing equal volumes from the three RNAs replications in one tube.
