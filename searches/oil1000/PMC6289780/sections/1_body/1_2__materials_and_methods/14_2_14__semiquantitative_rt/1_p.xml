<p class="p">Semiquantitative real-time PCR was performed on an Eppendorf PCR (Eppendorf Mastercycler-Nexus GSX1, POCD Scientific, Australia) system with a total reaction volume of 25 µl. A gene-specific primer for 
 <italic class="italic">AT-B-actin</italic> was used as a reference gene, and the other three gene-specific primers for 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SoLINS</italic> which are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes, were designed using the primer designing tools of IDTdna (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The semiquantitative RT-PCR conditions were as follows: predenaturation step at 95 °C for 4 min, 35 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 30 s, 60or 59 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min), and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel, and the expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">AT-BActin</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgLINS</italic> genes were detected.
