<p class="p">Three micrograms of RNA per sample were used for generating a sequencing library. cDNA was synthesized using an RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (NEB, USA) for generated sequencing libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized in the presence of random hexamer primers and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H), and the second strand of cDNA was synthesized in the presence of DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. The remaining cDNA was converted into blunt ends in the presence of exonuclease/polymerase activities. After the adenylation of three ends of DNA fragments, NEB Next, an adaptor with a hairpin loop structure, was ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150∼200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified using an AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then, 3 μl of USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 95 °C for 5 min. Afterward, PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. Finally, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system), and the library quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Novogene Experimental Department). After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and paired-end (PE) reads were generated.
