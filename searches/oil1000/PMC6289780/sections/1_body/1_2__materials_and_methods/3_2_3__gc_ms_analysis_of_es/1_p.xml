<p class="p">GC analysis was performed using a Shimadzu model GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Tokyo, Japan) system. An approximately 1 µl aliquot of each sample was injected (split ratios of 15: 1) into a GC-MS equipped with an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thicknesses). And we used Helium as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 ml min

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 240 °C, held isothermal at 240 °C for 2 min and finally held isothermal for 10 min at 350 °C. The identification of the volatile constituents were determined by parallel comparison of their recorded mass spectra with the data stored in the Wiley GC/MS Library (10th edition) (Wiley, New York, NY, USA), the volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis S/W software and the NIST Library (2014 edition). The relative % amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total areas, as well as retention time index. All of the experiments were performed simultaneously three times under the same conditions for each isolation technique with total GC running time was 80 min.
