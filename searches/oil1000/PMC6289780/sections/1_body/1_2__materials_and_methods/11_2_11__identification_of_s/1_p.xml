<p class="p">All of the transcripts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> were analysed with the MISA program version 1.0 (

In addition, primers for each SSR were designed using Primer3 version 2.3.5 (

The minimum number of SSR repeat units during analysis was â‰¥24 for mono- and dinucleotides and was 8, 7, 7 and 9 for tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats, respectively. The default parameters corresponding to each unit size of the minimum number of repetitions were 1-10, 2-6, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5 and 6-5 for Unigene SSR detection.
