<p class="p">Seedlings of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia guaranitica</italic> L. were collected from the Wuhan Botanical Garden, China, and grown at National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement farm of Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. Different tissues were sampled from one-year-old 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> plants. For RNA-Seq, three biological replicates from leaves were sampled and handled. Each replicate consisted of two young and two old leaves from the same plant. For qRT-PCR, three biological replicates were collected from the following six parts (old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots). All samples were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Furthermore, another three biological replicates from the individual six fresh parts were collected for isolation of the essential oil.
