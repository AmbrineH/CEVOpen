<p class="p">Full-length cDNAs for 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgLINS</italic> were obtained by PCR amplification using short and long gene-specific primers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>) based on RNA-Seq sequence information from the transcriptome sequencing of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> leaves. Leaf cDNA was used as a template for the initial PCR amplification and performed using short primers with the KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Novagen) under the following PCR conditions: 3 min at 94 °C followed by 10 s at 98 °C; 30 s at 60, 60 and 59 °C (different annealing temperatures), 1.30 min at 68 °C, and then 10 min at 68 °C. This process was repeated for 35 cycles. The first PCR products was used as a template for PCR cloning using long primers with the KOD-Plus DNA polymerase for the Gateway pDONR221 vector. The amplified PCR products were purified and cloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR221 using BP Clonase (Invitrogen, USA). The resulting pDONR221 constructs harbouring target genes were sequenced, and Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen, USA) was used for recombination into the destination vector pB2GW7 for 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> transformation. All final constructs containing 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgLINS</italic> were confirmed by sequencing.
