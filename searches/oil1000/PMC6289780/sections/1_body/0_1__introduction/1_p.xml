<p class="p">Blue Anise Sage (
 <italic class="italic">Salvia guaranitica</italic> L.), belongs to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic>, which is one of the economically best-known genera due to its vast medicinal properties and rich aromatic oils. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> (tribe Mentheae) is the largest of the Lamiaceae family, which comprises nearly 1,000 species. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> plants are widely distributed in three regions around the world but mainly exist in Central and South America (~500 species), West Asia (~200 species) and East Asia (~100 species), while the other 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species are spread throughout the world.

 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species exhibit significant bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antimutagenic, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, choleretic and antimicrobial activities. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> essential oils contain more than 100 active compounds with pharmacological effects, and they can be categorized into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and triterpenes.

 </xref> During their biosynthesis, these terpenoids are sequentially built up from the isoprene units (C5) building block, isopentyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These components are condensed in a sequential manner by prenyltransferases, resulting in the formation of prenyl diphosphates, such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP).

 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>, the genes that are related to the biosynthesis of these compounds have not yet been fully identified or understood. Plant secondary metabolites have significant use in the food and pharmaceutical industries, such as in fine chemicals, and cosmetics. The biosynthesis, regulation and metabolic engineering of useful secondary metabolites have been extensively studied.

 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic>; (iv) qRT-PCR of highly expressed genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids; (v) and the combination of data from the transcriptome, qRT-PCR and metabolome with GC-MS for revealing the functions of metabolic genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of valuable terpenoids.
