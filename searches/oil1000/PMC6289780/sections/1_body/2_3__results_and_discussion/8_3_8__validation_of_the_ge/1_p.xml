<p class="p">To determinate the reliability of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis, 15 candidate genes with a higher differential expression were selected, and their expression profiles were compared within young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was used to determine the ‘transcriptional control’ which indicates the number of mRNA copies of the enzyme that complements the end-product quantity. Therefore, the correlation between the TPS mRNAs with their products and the end-products showed a relationship between the chosen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), monoterpene synthase (

 <italic class="italic">SgACTIN</italic> was used as an internal reference gene (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The expression patterns of the 15 selected DEGs in the young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples were examined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the results from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis. At the current stage, we may be able to answer the question which terpenoid compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> accumulated mostly in which tissue. From our results, we found that the next gene, geranyl diphosphate synthase (
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic>) gene showed the highest expression levels in the young leaves, followed by roots, stems, old leaves, bud flowers and flowers. These results were nearly compatible with our GC-MS analysis data indicating that the main group of terpenes in roots, bud flowers and young leaves consisted of monoterpene. According to the findings of the GC-MS analysis, we found eight monoterpene compound are accumulated in the root, two monoterpene compounds in bud flowers and one monoterpene compound are accumulated in young leaves (
 <xref rid="dsy028-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>).Therefore, we suggest that the roots are the primer site for monoterpene biosynthesis and accumulation, followed by, bud flower, and young leave. These results are not in agreement with

 </xref> that found that the main monoterpenes in some salvia plant species are formed and accumulated in very young leaves epidermal glands. Because, the formation of most epidermal glands and the accumulation of the monoterpenes, take very short time in young leave tissues. And our 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> plant has limited number from epidermal gland trichomes on old leave, young leaves and stem. Moreover, Sesquiterpene synthase (FPPS) gene recorded the highest expression levels in the root followed by flower, bud flower, young leave, old leave and stem. On the other hand, these results were not similar with GC-MS analysis data that showed that the main group of sesquiterpenes was mostly accumulated in young leaves. Which have five compounds followed by old leaves have 12 compounds, roots have four compounds, flowers have two and bud flower has one compound (
 <xref rid="dsy028-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Besides, from our study, we found a correlation and linkage between the β-Caryophyllene product and β-Caryophyllene synthase genes expression level in different tissues. For instance, the highest of the β-Caryophyllene synthase gene product and expression level presented in the young leaves followed by old leaves, roots then flowers (
 <xref rid="dsy028-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Also, we found a correlation and linkage between the (-)-Germacrene D, Germacrene-A product and Germacrene-D synthase (TPS-6), Germacrene-A synthase (TPS-1) genes expression level in different tissues. Such as the highest of (-)-Germacrene-D, Germacrene-A gene product and expression level present in the young leave followed by old leave. Some of our results are in agreement with those of the previous studies

(+)-Neomenthol dehydrogenase-1,-2,-3, TPS-3-Selinene synthase, Linalool synthase-1,-2, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase, Geraniol isomerase synthase, TPS-Valencene synthase and Farnesol dehydrogenase genes that were detected in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads and QRT-PCR but was not detected in the GC-MS analysis data. We suggest that this could be due to the cyclic expression of terpene synthases is under circadian control. Although, changes in transcript levels may not directly determine protein levels or enzyme activities due to possible posttranscriptional, post-translational or enzyme-regulatory mechanisms, the positive correlation between transcript levels and volatile emission suggests that changes in transcript level are an important determinant of scent production. Furthermore, the different rates of protein synthesis and proteolytic turnover and/or differences in protein modifications. And the secondary modification of monoterpene olefins (e.g. oxidation/glycosylation) or sequestration also could contribute to the monoterpene emission profile.
