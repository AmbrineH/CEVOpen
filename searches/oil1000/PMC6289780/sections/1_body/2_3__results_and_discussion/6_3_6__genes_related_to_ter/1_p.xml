 </xref> Multiple terpenoids are synthesized in plants by the expression of many terpene syntheses (TPSs) genes. Moreover, some TPS genes have the ability to catalyse the production of multiple products. Thus, the TPS genes family was classified according to phylogenetic relationships into eight subfamilies (TPS a, b, c, d, e/f, g and h), which comprises mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpene synthases.

 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> against the Lamiaceae family and Arabidopsis revealed many terpene synthases involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, e.g. myrcene, (+)-neomenthol, 1, 8-cineole, (3S)-linalool, (E, E)-geranyl linalool, geraniol isomerase, farnesol, α-humulene, valencene, germacrene-A, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-muuroladiene, selinene, gamma-cadinene, bicyclogermacrene, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate, ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenoic acid, 9 beta-pimara-7, 15-diene, ent-isokaurene C2-, gibberellin 20-, beta-amyrin, squalene, farnesyl- pyrophosphate and camelliol C. From the dataset, 69 TPS unigenes were identified and determined based on sequence similarities with a TPS sequence in the canonical annotation reference database. Twenty unigenes were annotated as being involved in monoterpene biosynthesis, including myrcene/ocimene synthase, (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, 1,8-cineole synthase, (3S)-linalool synthase, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase and geraniol isomerase synthase, and 12 other unigenes were annotated as being involved in sesquiterpene biosyntheses, including farnesol dehydrogenase, α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase, valencene synthase, germacrene-A synthase, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-muuroladiene synthase, germacrene-D synthase, selinene synthase, gamma-cadinene synthase and bicyclo-germacrene synthase. Additionally, 30 unigenes were annotated as being involved in diterpene biosynthesis, including momilactone-A synthase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase, 9beta-pimara-7, 15-diene oxidase, ent-iso kaurene C2-hydroxylase and gibberellin 20-oxidase. Finally, seven unigenes were annotated as being involved in triterpene biosyntheses, including beta-amyrin synthase, camelliol C synthase, squalene monooxygenase and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase, but some of these previous genes showed high abundance in leaves and higher FPKM values (

 </xref> Sesquiterpenoids are similar to triterpenoids as both share the same origin and originate from FPP. Triterpenoid compounds originate from the conversion of FDP into squalene by squalene synthase (SQS) and then to (S)-2, 3-epoxysqualene by squalene monooxygenase (SQE). Subsequently, (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene is converted to beta-amyrin and camelliol C in the presence of multifunctional (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclase via beta-amyrin synthase and camelliol C synthase, respectively. Similar reports about triterpenoid biosynthesis from (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclases are available for
