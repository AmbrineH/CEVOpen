<p class="p">For GC-MS analysis, 204 compounds were identified using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane extracts from six fresh parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>. The numbers of obtained compounds from old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots were 71 (98.73%), 29 (74.58%), 21 (83.87%), 45 (93.51%), 32 (80.06%) and 45 (96.79%), respectively. The results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses of all compounds from the essential oils are reported in (
 <xref rid="dsy028-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The identified compounds are listed based on the retention time, compounds mass and percentage of peak area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). In old leaves, one triterpene was shown as the main compound (32.31%), followed by the group of diterpene (21.16%) and sesquiterpenes group (16.7%). In young leaves, the sesquiterpenes compounds were observed to be the main group (25.78%), followed by one diterpene and one monoterpene compounds represented (11.45 and 0.19%), respectively. The main compound in the stem was one triterpene (0.15%). Furthermore, in flowers the sesquiterpenes compounds were observed to be the main group (0.42%), followed by one diterpene compound (0.01%).
