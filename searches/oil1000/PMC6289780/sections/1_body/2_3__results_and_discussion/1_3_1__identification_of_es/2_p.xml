<p class="p">On the other hand, in bud flowers, the monoterpenes compounds were shown as the main group (1.11%), followed by one diterpene and one sesquiterpene compound represented (0.48 and 0.03%), respectively. Finally, Monoterpenes from the main group of compounds (7.81%) found in the roots, followed by sesquiterpene group represented 4.0%. Moreover, the six hexane extracts from the different tissue essential oils have unique, common and major compounds. For example, the extracts of old leaf essential oils (A) had 57 unique compounds, three common compounds shared with extracts from young leaf essential oils, one common compound shared with extracts from stem essential oils, three common compounds shared with extracts from flower essential oils and two common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Furthermore, the young leaf essential oils (B) contained 19 unique compounds. While the stem essential oils (C) contained 11 unique compounds and two common compounds shared with extracts from flower essential oils and three common compounds shared with extracts from root essential oils. Also, the extracts from flower essential oils (D) had 30 unique compounds, four common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Moreover, the extracts from bud flower essential oils (E) and the root essential oils (F) had 24 and 37 unique compounds, respectively (

Additionally, we found some other common compounds shared among all six plant parts, such as (trans-phytol, 2-methyloctacosane, β-caryophyllene, cyclohexasiloxane, dodecanethiol-, cycloheptasiloxane, tetradecane- methyl- and cyclononasiloxane, octa deca methyl-) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>). Regarding the major compounds, squalene (32.31%) was the major compound in the essential oils extracts of old leaves, followed by trans-phytol (21.11%), (-)-germacrene D (5.43%), 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-octadecanal (5.15%), 8-isopropenyl-1, 5-dimethyl-1, 5-cyclodecadiene (4.88%) and β-caryophyllene (1.33%), whereas the essential oil of young leaves was also characterized by trans-phytol (11.45%), followed by (-)-germacrene D (10.7%), 8-isopropenyl-1, 5-dimethyl-1, 5-cyclodecadiene (8.8%), caryophyllene oxide (4.16%), 3-methyl-cis-3a, 4, 7, 7a-tetrahydroindan (3.49%) and β-caryophyllene (1.98%). N-octadecanal was characterized as the major compound in stem extracts (38.78%), followed by undecane, 2-methyl (1.27%), and then squalene (0.15%). Furthermore, the essential oils of flowers was also characterized by 2-methyloctacosane (5.34%), followed by 10-methyleicosane (1.9%), and tetracosane, 2-methyl (1.7%). Moreover, the essential oil of bud flowers was also characterized by peppermint camphor (0.83%) as a major compound, followed by trans-phytol (0.48%), angelicoidenol (0.28%) and longi borneol (0.03%). Finally, the root essential oil was characterized by 1,8-cineol (2.61) as a major compound, followed by caryophyllene oxide (1.91), ledol (1.56), (-)-camphor (1.14), laevo-β-pinene (0.97) and α-pinene (0.96) (

 </xref> From the previous GC-MS data, an important question has been raised, why do the triterpenes, sesquiterpenes and monoterpene compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> mostly accumulated in old leaves, young leaves and roots, respectively? This question was difficult to answer before conducting the present work because there was a lack of information at the genetic level regarding the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and how these compounds are synthesized in 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>.
