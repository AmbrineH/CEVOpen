<p class="p">The Illumina HiSeq 2000 system offers the opportunity to analyse molecular markers such as SSRs that are related to terpenoid pathway genes. SSR molecular markers have proven to be a powerful method for understanding genetic variation. Moreover, polymorphic SSR markers are very important for the investigation of related comparative genomics, genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, gene-based association studies and relatedness. Even though SNP markers have become promising, especially for studying complex genetic traits and high-throughput mapping, SSRs provide many advantages compared with other marker systems. Hence, SSRs have become the preferable codominant molecular marker for a construction of linkage maps.

 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> plants could be a valuable tool for breeding studies and genetic applications. Therefore, SSR markers were identified from transcriptome sequencing data using MISA (MIcroSAtellite) (

 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>, 5,262 transcripts were observed to have SSRs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). The total number of SSR-containing sequences in 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> was 5,931, following stringent selection criteria used to identify these SSRs. The analysis data showed that dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant motif type in 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> (2,787; 45.25%), followed by trinucleotide (1,555; 23.58%), mononucleotide (1,452; 23.58%), tetranucleotide (92; 1.493%), and hexanucleotide (28; 0.454%) types, while the pentanucleotide type was the least abundant motif (17; 0.276%) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). Except for the absence of mononucleotide, these results were similar to the previous results obtained from the transcriptome of 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> (members of the same family), which have dinucleotide repeats as the most abundant motif type, followed by tri-, tetra-, hexa- and pentanucleotide types as the least abundant motif.

 </xref> After analysing the data from mono- to hexanucleotide motifs to obtain the number of repeat units, we found that the highest repeat unit of potential SSRs was 10, which accounted for 1,376 SSRs (27.08%), followed by 5 SSRs (1,049; 20.65%), 7 (728; 14.33%), and 6 (573; 11.28%), and the smallest repeat unit of potential SSRs was ≥24 (3; 0.0 5%) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2" class="xref">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). The AG/CT dinucleotide repeat was the most prevalent motif detected in all SSRs (1,893; 30.73%), followed by A/T as a mononucleotide repeat (1,408; 22.86%). In contrast, the least abundant motif in all SSRs (3; 0.048%) was detected in (AAAAC/GTTTT/AAAAG/CTTTT/AAACC/GGTTT) as pentanucleotide repeat and in (AAACAC/GTGTTT/AAACGG/CCGTTT/AAAGAC/CTTTGT) as hexanucleotide repeat. Finally, several SSR motifs were associated with many unique sequences that encode enzymes (e.g.
