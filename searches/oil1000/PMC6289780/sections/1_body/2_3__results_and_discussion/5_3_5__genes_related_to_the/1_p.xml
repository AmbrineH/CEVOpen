<p class="p">Various types of terpenoids were found in the essential oil extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica.</italic> The mixture contained mainly α-pinene, camphene, laevo-β-pinene, beta-pinene, 1,8-cineol, thujone, (-)-camphor, (+)-borneol, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-α-terpineol, farnesan, (-)-beta-bourbonene, (E)-β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, humulene, (-)-germacrene D, pi-α-muurolene, δ-cadinene, germacrene-A, ledol, α-cadinol, trans-longipinocarveol, trans-phytol, phytan, kauran-18-al, 17-(acetyloxy)-, (4.beta.)- and squalene. Precursor molecules for terpenoid biosynthesis are derived from the cytosolic mevalonate (Ac-MVA) and plastidial MEP pathways. Therefore, queries against the Lamiaceae family transcriptome libraries were applied to identify and to determine the genes that encode the enzymes involved in the different steps of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, such as, IPPS (isopentyl diphosphate isomerase), DMAPPS (dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase), GPPS (geranyl diphosphate synthases), FPPS (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthases) and GGPS (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases).

 </xref> Furthermore, we identified and estimated the expression levels of isoprenoid genes by using uniprot annotations against the transcriptome libraries (
 <xref rid="dsy028-T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). From the annotation data analyses, we found many transcript genes related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MEP pathway with higher expression levels, including gene transcripts such as 
 <italic class="italic">SgDXS1</italic>, 4 and 5 (1-deoxy-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1, 4 and 5), 
 <italic class="italic">SgDXR1</italic> (1-deoxy-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase 1), 
 <italic class="italic">SgMCT</italic> (2-C-methyl-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase), 
 <italic class="italic">SgCMK</italic> (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-erythritol kinase), 
 <italic class="italic">SgHDS 2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">4</italic> ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase 2 and 4) 
 <italic class="italic">SgHDR 4</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">6</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic> (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase 4, 6 and 9), 
 <italic class="italic">SgIDI 2</italic> (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase 2). Additionally, we obtained some gene transcripts that were related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MVA pathway with higher expression levels, such as, 
 <italic class="italic">SgAACT 1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">4</italic> (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase 1 and 4), 
 <italic class="italic">SgHMGS</italic> (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA synthase), 
 <italic class="italic">SgHMGR 3</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">4</italic> (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) 3 and 4), 
 <italic class="italic">SgMVK</italic> (mevalonate kinase), 
 <italic class="italic">SgPMK</italic> (phosphomevalonate kinase). Moreover, the transcriptome dataset of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> presented other genes, such as 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">SgGGPSΙΙ2</italic> that are the immediate precursor of the mono-, sesqui- and di-terpene biosynthesis pathway. The 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgGGPSΙΙ2</italic> genes were highly abundant in leaves and had higher values of fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped fragments (FPKM), which were 47.81, 80.21 and 74.07, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="dsy028-T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Our results were similar to previously obtained results from the transcriptomes of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, which are members of the same family and have a higher number of transcripts for the isoprenoid biosynthesis genes related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway.
