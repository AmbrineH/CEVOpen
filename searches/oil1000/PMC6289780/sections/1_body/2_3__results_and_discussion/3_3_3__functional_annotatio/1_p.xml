 </xref>The international standardized gene functional annotation system (GO Annotation) provides a powerful way to recognize the functions and properties of sequences that have not been characterized for an organism.

 </xref> The BLAST2 GO program was used to categorize the functions of these annotated unigenes, and a total of 23,198 unigenes (37.78% of all of the assembled unigenes) were mapped to at least one GO term. Based on sequence homology, the unigene sequences from 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> were categorized into 47 functional groups under three general sections: 60,139 were assigned to the BP, 42,494 were assigned to the CC and 29,574 were assigned to the MF sections. As a result, cellular process (13,830) and metabolic process (13,253) were the most enriched GO terms in the BP section. Regarding the CC section, the cell (8,590) and cell part (8,553) were the most enriched. Within the MF section, binding (13,723) and catalytic activities (11,368) were highly enriched (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F2" class="xref">Fig.Â 2</xref>). These results revealed that the main GO classifications in the annotated unigenes were responsible for metabolism and fundamental biological regulation. These results were similar to previous results with the 
 <italic class="italic">S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> transcriptome, and with the transcriptome of 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> (members of the same family), which have the highest percentages of metabolic process, cellular process, cell, cell part, binding and catalytic activity.
