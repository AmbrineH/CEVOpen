 </xref> To identify active biological functional pathways in the leaf tissues of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>, all 61,400 unigenes sequences were mapped in reference to the canonical pathways of KEGG, but 9,163 (14.92%) unigene sequence were assigned to 260 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, all transcripts were classified into five larger pathways categories, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F3" class="xref">Fig.Â 3</xref>). The highest number of transcripts from 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> could be assigned to the metabolism category, followed by genetic information processing, organismal systems and cellular processes, whereas the lowest number of transcripts was related to the category environmental information processing. Interestingly, 570 transcripts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> were related to the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolite pathways, which were sorted into 26 subcategories, with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ko00900) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) representing the largest subcategories (

 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic>, which are members of the same family, and from 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome sequencing from 
 <italic class="italic">R. sativus</italic>, the transcriptome of which had the highest percentages of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis.
