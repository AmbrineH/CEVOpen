<p class="p">To test 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> in a transgenic expression system for the production of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> terpenes, the following genes were selected from 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>: farnesyl pyrophosphate synthases (FPPS), geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPS) and (3S)-linalool synthase (LINS) encoded by 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SgLINS</italic>, respectively. Transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> was carried out by using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method of 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> flowers using 
 <italic class="italic">A. tumefaciens</italic> strain EHA105 carrying pB2GW7-FPPS, pB2GW7-GPPS and pB2GW7-LINS under the control of 35S promoter vector. Fully mature leaves from fifteen 35-day-old putative transgenic plants and wild type plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F6" class="xref">Fig. 6A</xref>), were collected for semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyse the positive transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> and assessed the expression levels of terpene genes from the different samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy028-F6" class="xref">Fig. 6B</xref>). The terpenes were extracted with hexane and analysed by GC-MS. The mono-, sesqui- and di-terpene peaks were clearly detected, and the type and amount of compounds represented by the percentage of peak area (% peak area). Compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra the compounds with mass spectra libraries. The detected components were also confirmed by comparing them with the published references and extracts of wild-type Arabidopsis which produce different types and amounts of terpenes. Overexpression of the 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">SoLINS</italic> genes produced different amounts from mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes and other terpenoids. Moreover, from the results shown in 
 <xref rid="dsy028-T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>, we found that the transient expression of the different TPS genes from Salvia produced different types and amounts of mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes and other terpenoid compounds.
