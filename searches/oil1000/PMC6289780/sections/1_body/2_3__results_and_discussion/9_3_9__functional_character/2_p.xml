 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> protein with a 418-aa length has a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 74-418 aa; inside this domain are two motifs: both are DDxxD motif (DDVLD) one motif starting at 177 aa, and the other one is starting at 304 aa. Additionally, the 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic> protein is 349-aa length has a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 6-349 aa; inside this domain are two motifs: both are DDxxD motif one is (DDIMD) starting at 100 aa, and the other one is a (DDYLD) starting at 239 aa. On the other hand, the 
 <italic class="italic">SgLINS</italic> protein is 541-aa in length, this protein has an N-terminal domain (IPR001906) from 69-279 aa and a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 270-540 aa, and inside the latter domain are DDxxD conserved motifs (DDIFD) starting at 347 aa
