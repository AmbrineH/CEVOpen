<p class="p">Furthermore, Croteau and coworkers shed light on the carbocationic reaction mechanism for all monoterpene synthases by reporting that the reaction was initiated by the divalent metal ion-dependent ionization of the substrate. The resulting cationic intermediate undergoes a series of hydride shifts or other rearrangements and cyclizations until the reaction was terminated by the addition of a nucleophile or proton loss. Croteau and coworkers illustrated this reaction mechanism by studying the native enzymes with substrate inhibitors, analogues and intermediates.

 </xref> Moreover, Rodney Croteau et al.
 <sup class="sup">56</sup> elucidated the preliminary conversion of the geranyl cation to the tertiary linalyl cation to facilitate cyclization to a six-membered ring. Afterward, the linalyl cation provides the cyclic α-terpinyl cation; this is an important branching point intermediate in the formation of all cyclic monoterpenes because multiple terpene products can be obtained through electrophilic attack of C1 on the C6–C7 linalyl cation double bond and from the α-terpinyl cation. From the previous discussion, the reaction mechanisms of monoterpene synthases are highly reticulate. The individual intermediate may have multiple fates, which suggests the explanation for the ability of terpene enzymes to make various terpene products.

 </xref> On the other hand, the carbocationic reaction mechanism that uses sesquiterpene synthase to form sesquiterpenes by catalysing FPP recycling is similar to the reaction mechanism by those monoterpene synthases. Moreover, the larger carbon skeleton of FPP and the presence of three double bonds instead of two suggest a rationale for increases of the structural diversity of the sesquiterpene products. Furthermore, the initial cyclization reactions for sesquiterpene synthases can be divided into two types. Type one involves cyclization of the initially formed farnesyl cation to yield 11-membered ((E)-humulyl cation) rings of large size and a C2–C3 double bond (this type has no barrier to cyclization). The second type involves cyclization that proceeds after the tertiary nerolidyl cation produced from preliminary isomerization of the C2–C3 double bond. This isomerization mechanism is directly analogous to the isomerization of GPP to yield a linalyl cation in monoterpene synthesis. The nerolidyl cation is considered an intermediate in the sesquiterpene synthase mechanism.

 </xref> Collectively, we can state that the ability of TPS genes to convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products during different reaction cycles is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. As described above, this property is found in the majority of all characterized monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases. However, some monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases can catalyse substrates into a single product, and the proteins may have specific methods for multiple product formations. For example, γ-humulene synthase from 
 <italic class="italic">A. grandis</italic> has two DDxxD motifs located on opposite sides and can generate 52 different sesquiterpenes. This protein is able to bind substrates with two different conformations and resulting in different sets of products.
