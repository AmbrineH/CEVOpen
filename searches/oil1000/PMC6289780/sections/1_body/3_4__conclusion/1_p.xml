<p class="p">In this study, a large, high-quality transcriptome database was established for 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> leaves using NGS technology to characterize and identify genes that are related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Using 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> sequencing and analysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> transcriptome data via the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system, we identified many genes that encode enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. The purpose of identifying these genes is not only to facilitate functional studies but also to develop biotechnology for improving the production of medicinal ingredients through metabolic engineering. We profiled terpenoids from six tissues of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> and used qRT-PCR to determine the correlation between the expression levels of TPS genes and the end-products. By combining the transcriptome and metabolome analysis with RNA-Seq or qRT-PCR with GC-MS approaches, this study paves the way for understanding the complex metabolic genes for the production of the diverse terpene compounds in blue anise sage. The results from our study will allow us to understand the specific activities of TPS in 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> for the production of interesting compounds and to develop new technology for utilization.
