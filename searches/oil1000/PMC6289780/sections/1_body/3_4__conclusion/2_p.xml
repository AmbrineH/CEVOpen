<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first study used Illumina HiSeq 2000 PE sequencing technology to investigate the global transcriptome of 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic>. The valuable genetic resource in 
 <italic class="italic">salvia</italic> will provide the foundation for future genetic and functional genomic research on 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> or closely related species. We further studied the functions of various 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> TPS genes, including 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SoLINS</italic>, by expressing these genes in 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> transgenic plants. 
 <italic class="italic">SgFPPS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">SgGPPS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SoLINS</italic> were successfully expressed in the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic>, and these transgenes altered the levels of terpenoids, as confirmed by GC-MS analysis of extracted transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> leaves. The GC-MS analysis revealed that these 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> terpenoid synthases isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">S. guaranitica</italic> can convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products, which is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. Our study provides new insights into our understanding of plant terpenoid biosynthesis and the potential for biotechnology application.
