  <p class="p">Mentha × piperita essential oil modulated 
   <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> transition from blastospore to hyphal form. 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was cultured with and without 10 μL/mL of EO or its vapor for 6 h at 37 °C in Sabouraud supplemented medium with 10% fetal calf serum to promote 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> transition. The cultures were observed under an inverted microscope and photographed. Panel (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) shows morphological changes at 6 h. The number of blastospore and hyphal forms were then counted. The percentage of hyphae was obtained by dividing the number of hyphae by the total number of cells (blastospores and hyphae) in each culture. Panel (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) shows the means + SD relative values. The levels of significance were obtained by comparing the percentages of blastospore-to-hyphae transition in the presence/absence of EO; ***
