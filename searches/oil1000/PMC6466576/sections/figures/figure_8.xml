   <italic class="italic">SAP10</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">HWP1</italic> gene expression. Following 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> culture in the presence or absence of 10 μL/mL of EO or its vapor, or AmB (1 μg/mL) for 6 h at 30 °C, total RNA was extracted from each cell culture and qRT-PCR was performed using specific primers for 
   <italic class="italic">SAP10</italic> or 
   <italic class="italic">HWP1</italic>. ACT-1 was used as the housekeeping gene for internal control. The plotted values refer to the ratio Gene of interest /ACT-1. The changes in mRNA levels are presented as the fold expression of the gene in the test sample compared with this gene’s expression in the control (without EO). Results are expressed as the means ± SD, 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3. *** 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The free asterisks refer to the statistical difference when comparing EO effects to control. The bars with asterisks showed the comparison of EO vapor to the EO liquid, and to the AmB.
