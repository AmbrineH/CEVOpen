 <p> Mentha × piperita essential oil inhibited C. albicans growth. The yeast was cultured in Sabouraud supplemented medium with and without Mentha × piperita EO at various concentrations. The cultures were maintained for 24 h at 37 °C and an MTT assay was performed. The growth was plotted as the means ± SD of the absorbance at 550 nm. ( A) C. albicans growth in the presence of whole EO added to the culture medium; ( B) C. albicans growth in the presence of EO vapor suspended 4 cm away from the culture surface. The levels of significance for C. albicans growth in the presence or absence of EO or AmB (5 μg/mL) were calculated; *** p &lt; 0.001, ** p &lt; 0.01. The free asterisks refer to the statistical difference when comparing EO effects to control. The bars with asterisks showed the comparison of the different concentrations of EO. </p>
