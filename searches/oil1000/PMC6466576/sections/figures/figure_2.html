 <p> Mentha × piperita essential oil modulated Candida transition from blastospore to hyphal form. C. albicans was cultured with and without 10 μL/mL of EO or its vapor for 6 h at 37 °C in Sabouraud supplemented medium with 10% fetal calf serum to promote C. albicans transition. The cultures were observed under an inverted microscope and photographed. Panel ( A) shows morphological changes at 6 h. The number of blastospore and hyphal forms were then counted. The percentage of hyphae was obtained by dividing the number of hyphae by the total number of cells (blastospores and hyphae) in each culture. Panel ( B) shows the means + SD relative values. The levels of significance were obtained by comparing the percentages of blastospore-to-hyphae transition in the presence/absence of EO; *** p &lt; 0.001. ( a) Untreated C. albicans; ( b) treated with 10 μL/mL of EO vapor; ( c) treated with 10 μL/mL of whole EO added to the culture medium. Scale bar = 50 μm. The free asterisks refer to the statistical difference when comparing EO effects to control. The bars with asterisks showed the comparison of EO vapor to the EO liquid. </p>
