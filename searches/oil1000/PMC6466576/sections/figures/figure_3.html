 <p> Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of C. albicans following treatment with Mentha × piperita EO . (A) Untreated Candida; ( B) treated with the vapor of 10 μL/mL of EO; ( C) treated with 10 μL/mL of EO added to the culture medium; or ( D) treated with AmB for 24 h then subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Each experiment was repeated three times. Note the cell size and cell shape changes following contact with the EO, which was comparable to that observed with AmB. </p>
