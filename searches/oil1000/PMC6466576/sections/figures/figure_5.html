 <p> Mentha × piperita essential oil decreased biofilm mass. C. albicans was cultured in a 3D porous scaffold in Sabouraud medium for 3 days to promote biofilm formation and maturation. The resulting biofilms were exposed or not to either 10 μL/mL of EO or 5 μg/mL of AmB for 24 h. Following incubation, the samples were subjected to an MTT assay. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured, with the results presented as the means ± SD of four separate experiments. The levels of significance for biofilm degradation in the presence or absence of the EO or AmB were calculated; *** p &lt; 0.001. The free asterisks refer to the statistical difference when comparing EO effects to control. The bars with asterisks showed the comparison of EO vapor to the EO liquid, and to the AmB. </p>
