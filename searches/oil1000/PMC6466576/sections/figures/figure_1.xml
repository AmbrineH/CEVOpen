  <p class="p">Mentha × piperita essential oil inhibited 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth. The yeast was cultured in Sabouraud supplemented medium with and without Mentha × piperita EO at various concentrations. The cultures were maintained for 24 h at 37 °C and an MTT assay was performed. The growth was plotted as the means ± SD of the absorbance at 550 nm. (
