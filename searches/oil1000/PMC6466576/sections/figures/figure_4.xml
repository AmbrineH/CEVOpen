  <p class="p">Mentha × piperita essential oil inhibited 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (10
   <sup class="sup">5</sup>) was seeded in a 3D porous scaffold in Sabouraud medium supplemented or not with 10 μL/mL of Mentha × piperita EO in either liquid or vapor form and cultured thereafter at 30 °C under agitation. The medium with and without the EO was changed every 24 h for three days, after which time the 
   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>-populated scaffolds were subjected to an MTT assay. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured, with the results presented as the means ± SD of five separate experiments. The levels of significance of the inhibition of biofilm formation in the presence or absence of EO or AmB (5 μg/mL) were calculated; *** 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The free asterisks refer to the statistical difference when comparing EO effects to control. The bars with asterisks showed the comparison of EO vapor to the EO liquid, and EO to the AmB.
