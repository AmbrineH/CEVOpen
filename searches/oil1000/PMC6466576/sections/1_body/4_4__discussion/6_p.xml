<p class="p">On contact with 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, the EO could act on the cell cytoplasmic membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), but also on intracellular targets, as has been shown with other molecules [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and with EO from other plants [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The effect of Mentha × piperita EO against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> may involve certain genes involved in yeast growth, form changing, and biofilm formation. Indeed, our study showed that Mentha × piperita EO was capable of decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">SAP1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">10</italic> mRNA expressions in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans,</italic> which may lead to reducing 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> virulence, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>].
