 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth and transition, it may downregulate the formation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm. Our findings confirm that Mentha × piperita EO decrease biofilm formation similar to antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B. The inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved with a low amount of EO (10 μL/mL). Our findings are supportive to those showing that plant-derived EOs decrease microbial biofilm formation [

 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Therefore, in light of its significant impact in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation, Mentha × piperita EO may have potential for several novel applications in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Further investigations will elucidate this potential.
