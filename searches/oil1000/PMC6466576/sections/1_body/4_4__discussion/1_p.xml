<p class="p">We demonstrated that Mentha × piperita EO was effective in significantly decreasing the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and that this downregulating effect was also achieved with EO vapor. Although the growth inhibition produced with the EO vapor was less than that obtained with whole EO added to the culture medium, the effects of the vapor are nevertheless significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Both the EO and its vapor limited 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the effect of EO at 5 μL/mL and 10 μL/mL added to the culture medium was comparable to that observed with AmB at 5 μg/mL. Thus, even at a low concentration, Mentha × piperita EO was effective in inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth. The C. albicans growth inhibition obtained could be attributed to the high levels of monoterpenes such as menthol, menthone and 1,8-cineole in the Mentha × piperita EO we used. These monoterpenes were reported having antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [
