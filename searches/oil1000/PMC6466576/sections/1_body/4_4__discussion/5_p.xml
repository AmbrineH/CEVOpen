<p class="p">Effective antimicrobial molecules should prevent biofilm formation and disruption. We therefore investigated the capacity of Mentha Ã— piperita EO to disrupt mature 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm. We observed a significant disruption of these biofilms following contact with EO, thus suggesting the possible use of this antimicrobial EO to reduce/eliminate mature biofilms. Further studies should confirm these observations and provide new knowledge on how EO reduces or disrupts 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms.
