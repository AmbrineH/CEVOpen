<p class="p">We also demonstrated that the EO was able to decrease the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HWP1</italic>, being known to promote the formation of biofilms [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HWP1</italic> decreased in the presence of EO added to the medium or in vapor form. This study establishes, for the first time, a clear link between Menth Ã— piperita EO, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth/transition, and the repression of different genes (
 <italic class="italic">SAP1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">10</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">HWP1</italic>). That said, the precise interactions between EO and these genes during 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis must be further explored.
