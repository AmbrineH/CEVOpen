 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis may take place through form changing [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. We showed that EO, either in direct contact with the medium or as a vapor, significantly inhibited the form-changing of the yeast from blastospore to hyphae. These data are the first to show a significant effect of EO on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> transition. This study is consistent with other works on naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides such as dermaseptin, which have been shown to be effective in blocking the morphological shift of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> from yeast to hyphae [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Thus, Mentha Ã— piperita EO may possibly contribute to controlling 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> infection by reducing cell growth and transition.
