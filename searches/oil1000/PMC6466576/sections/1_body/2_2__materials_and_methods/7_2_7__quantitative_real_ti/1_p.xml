<p class="p">RNA (500 ng of each sample) was reverse transcribed into cDNA by means of the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The conditions for the preparation of the cDNA templates for PCR analysis. Primers (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-08-00010-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were added to the reaction mix at a final concentration of 250 nM. Five microliters of each cDNA sample were added to a 20-μL PCR mixture containing 12.5 μL of the iQ SYBR Green supermix, 0.5 μL of specific primers

Each reaction was performed in a Bio-Rad MyCycler thermal cycler. For the qPCR, the CT was automatically determined by the accompanying Bio-Rad CFX manager. The specificity of each primer pair was determined by the presence of a single melting temperature peak.
