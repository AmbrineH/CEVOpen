<p class="p">Each experiment was performed at least three times, with experimental values expressed as means ± SD. The statistical significance of the differences between the control (absence of EO), the test (presence of EO or its vapor), and the presence of AmB values was determined by ANOVA. Posteriori comparisons were performed using Tukey’s method. Normality and variance assumptions were verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Brown and Forsythe test, respectively. All of the assumptions were fulfilled. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values were declared significant at ≤ 0.05. The data were analyzed using the SAS version 8.2 statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
