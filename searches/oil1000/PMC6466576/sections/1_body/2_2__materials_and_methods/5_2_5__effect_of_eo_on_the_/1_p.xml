<p class="p">Mature 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms were obtained by culturing 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> on a porous 3D collagen scaffold for 3 days at 30 °C in Sabouraud liquid medium supplemented with 0.1% glucose at pH 5.6. At the end of the third day, the biofilms were treated with 10 µL/mL of whole Mentha × piperita EO either in contact with the medium or as a vapor. AmB-treated biofilms (5 μg/mL) represented the positive control. Non-treated biofilms were used as the negative control. The exposure to EO or its vapor was for 24 h, and then the biofilms were subjected to MTT assay, as described above.
