 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells) was cultured in the presence or absence of 10 µL/mL of EO (direct contact or vapor) at 30 °C for 6 h. Positive control (the use of 5 µg/mL of AmB) was also included in the study. Total RNA was extracted from each sample as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The concentration, purity, and quality of the extracted RNA were determined using the Experion system and the RNA StdSens analysis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Appropriate RNAs were used to perform quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
