 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells) was suspended in 3 mL of Sabouraud dextrose broth supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In the first set of experiments, the EO was added directly to the culture at 10 μL/mL of culture medium, while in the second set, the EO was added to an absorbent sterile filter which was then suspended at a distance of 4 cm from the surface of the culture medium. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C to promote hyphes formation. Following incubation for 6 h, the cultures were observed microscopically and photographed to record 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> morphology. Over 100 cells were counted from each photo, then the percentage of morphological changes was determined by dividing the hyphae/blastospores × 100, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5.
