 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms were obtained by culturing the yeast on a porous collagen scaffold (Zimmer Dental Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA), offering the cell an adequate environment of adhesion and growth [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Sterile scaffolds were seeded with 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C without shaking to allow for adherence. Fresh Sabouraud medium was added to each well in the presence of 10 µL/mL of EO either added to the medium or placed at a 4 cm distance releasing its vapor. Two controls were included in this study: the negative control was 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> seeded without EO, while the positive control was 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> seeded with AmB (5 μg/mL). The 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>-seeded scaffolds were subsequently incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. The medium, the EO, and the AmB were refreshed every 24 h. At the end of the third day of incubation, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation was assessed by MTT assay, as described above (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5). The lysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cells within the collagen scaffold, using 0.04 N HCl in isopropanol, did not affect the collagen scaffold, neither the absorbance. For confirmation, we did include non-infected collagen scaffold being subjected to MTT assay showing no changes with the optical density reading.
