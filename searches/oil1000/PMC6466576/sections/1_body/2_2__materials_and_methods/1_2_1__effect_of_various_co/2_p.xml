 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The Mentha × piperita EO was used undiluted in our experiments. 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (ATCC SC5314) was cultured for 24 h on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates (Becton Dickinson, Oakville, ON, Canada) at 37 °C. From this plate, one colony was suspended in 10 mL of Sabouraud liquid medium supplemented with 0.1% glucose, pH 5.6, then grown in a shaking water bath for 18 h at 37 °C, after which the yeast cells were collected, washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and counted by means of a hemocytometer.
