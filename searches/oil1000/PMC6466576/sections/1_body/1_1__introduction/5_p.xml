 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Indeed, in vitro and animal studies have shown the efficacy of Mentha × piperita EO as an antioxidant, antitumor, antiallergenic, and antimicrobial agent, among other possibilities [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Several studies have shown that EO extracted from Mentha × piperita exhibited strong inhibitory activity against several bacterial species, including 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis and C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,

 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Further investigations of the efficacy of this EO against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> are thus logical. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Mentha × piperita essential oil and its volatile compounds (vapor) on the growth and transition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. We also investigated the effect of this EO on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation/degradation and the expression of different genes involved in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis.
