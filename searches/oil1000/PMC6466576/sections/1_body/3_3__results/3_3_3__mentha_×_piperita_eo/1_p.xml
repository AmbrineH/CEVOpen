<p class="p">Following SEM analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), the aerobic growth of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cells revealed typical yeast cells displaying characteristic bud scars (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). No hyphal development was observed in the different cultures with or without EO or with Amph-B. Following the addition of EO or its vapor, the external morphology of the cells did not appear as smooth as that of the untreated cells, which indicates a possible loss of cytosolic volume. Indeed, EO and its vapor distorted the cell wall surface (
