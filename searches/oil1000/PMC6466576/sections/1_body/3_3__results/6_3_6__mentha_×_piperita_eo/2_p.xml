<p class="p">Secreted aspartyl proteinases are not the only genes involved in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> virulence. 
 <italic class="italic">HWP-1</italic> gene encodes the hyphal cell wall protein, which is a hyphal-specific adhesion essential to 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation and pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-08-00010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. We thus investigated the effect of this EO on 
 <italic class="italic">HWP-1</italic> gene expression. The results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> confirm that 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> Ã— 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO significantly inhibited the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HWP-1</italic> and that this inhibition was almost complete, compared to that in the control. EO vapor also significantly inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">HWP-1</italic> gene expression, although this inhibition was estimated to be approximately 20%, compared to that in the control.
