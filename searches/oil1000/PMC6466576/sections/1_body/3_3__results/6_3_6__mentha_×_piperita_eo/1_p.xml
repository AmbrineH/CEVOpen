<p class="p">Because we showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO had a significant downregulating effect on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth, transition, and biofilm formation/disruption, we sought to determine its involvement, if any, in regulating gene expression. For this purpose, we began by investigating the effect of the EO on the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SAP</italic>s’ genes.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> show that 
 <italic class="italic">SAP1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">10</italic> were significantly downregulated when the EO was added directly to the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> culture. Indeed, the inhibited expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SAP1–3</italic> was significant, compared to that observed in the control (non-treated 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>). The inhibitory effect of EO when added directly to the culture medium was comparable to AmB (5 μg/mL). The inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">SAP10</italic> was also very high, while that of 
 <italic class="italic">SAP9</italic> was approximately 50% of that observed in the negative control. The effect of EO on 
 <italic class="italic">SAP9</italic> was not as high as the one obtained with AmB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). We then analyzed 
 <italic class="italic">SAP</italic> gene expression when the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cultures were exposed to EO vapor.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> show that the 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO vapor significantly inhibited certain 
 <italic class="italic">SAP</italic> genes. 
 <italic class="italic">SAP2</italic> gene expression was inhibited at least three-fold, compared to that observed in the control, while the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SAP3</italic> was slightly yet significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibited. 
 <italic class="italic">SAP9</italic> gene expression was inhibited by 20%, compared to what was observed in the control. No effect was observed on 
 <italic class="italic">SAP1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SAP10</italic> expression.
