<p class="p">Because EO contributed to decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth and transition, we tested its potential to control 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. Using the MTT assay, we demonstrated that Mentha × piperita EO inhibited the formation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The results indeed show that after 3 days of culture, a high cell density was obtained in the non-treated biofilms, while low cell densities were obtained in the EO/vapor-treated cells, as well as in the AmB-treated cultures. These data demonstrated the efficacy of Mentha × piperita EO against the formation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms.
