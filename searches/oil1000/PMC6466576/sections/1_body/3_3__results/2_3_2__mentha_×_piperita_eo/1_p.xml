<p class="p">Because the EO contributed to inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth, we hypothesized that it would also downregulate the yeast’s transition from blastospore form to hyphal phenotype. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A, germ tube formation was indeed inhibited following the addition of Mentha × piperita EO to the culture medium, compared to the control cultures without EO. An inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> transition was also observed with the EO vapor. It is interesting to note that although the vapor significantly downregulated 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> transition, a higher effect was observed when whole EO was added directly to the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> culture. Quantitative analyses confirm the inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> transition when treated with Mentha × piperita EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). The density of the hyphae was reduced at as early as 6 h of contact with 10 μL/mL of EO.
