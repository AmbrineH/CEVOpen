<p class="p">After 3 days of culture, mature biofilms were generated, displaying highly dense populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> cells, as ascertained by the high optical density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Here, cell density was indeed significantly reduced due to a disruption of the preformed 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> biofilms following treatment with AmB (5 μg/mL). Similarly, Mentha × piperita EO at 10 μL/mL and its vapor also contributed to the disruption of mature biofilms. Interestingly, the effect of whole EO in contact with the culture medium was comparable to that produced by AmB (
