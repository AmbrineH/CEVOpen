<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the addition of whole Mentha × piperita EO to the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cell suspension significantly reduced the yeast’s proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A). It is important to note that even at a very low concentration (1 μL/mL), the EO was capable of significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth. With a concentration of 10 μL/mL of EO, the inhibitory effect was comparable to that with 5 μg/mL of AmB. Because Mentha × piperita EO contains volatile compounds that may affect 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth, we also measured this growth when the yeast was exposed to different concentrations of EO vapor. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-08-00010-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B shows that EO vapor was also capable of decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth. It should be noted that the higher the concentration of EO, the greater the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> growth inhibition. Overall data indicate that Mentha × piperita EO, either whole or in vapor form, significantly downregulated 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans’</italic> growth. The effect of the Mentha × piperita EO we used in this study could be due to the presence of different monoterpenes such as menthol (32.93%), menthone (24.41%), and 1,8-cineole (7.89%). It should be noted that the chemical analyses we performed showed that the Mentha × piperita EO contained several other chemicals, but at low levels. Based on these growth inhibition results, the 10 μL/mL concentration of Mentha × piperita EO was chosen for the following experiments.
