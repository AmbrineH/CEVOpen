<p class="p">Around 100 million tons of foods are wasted annually in the EU, nearly 30% of the agri-food supply chain (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>), which leads to huge environmental impacts (high carbon footprint and blue water footprint, vain land use, etc.) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). Food waste should rise to over 200 million tons by 2050 while an increase of 50% in food supplies will be needed globally (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Even if the relation between shelf-life and food waste is not straightforward, a large part of food wastage is related to the short shelf-life of a lot of fresh produce inherent to its biological origin. Moreover, inaccuracies in, or misunderstanding of, food date labels are estimated to cause over 20% of the avoidable disposal of still-edible food (
