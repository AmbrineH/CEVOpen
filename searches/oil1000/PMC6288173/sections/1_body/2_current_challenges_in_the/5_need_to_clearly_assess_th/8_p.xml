<p class="p">There is an urgent need to develop 
 <italic class="italic">early guidance tools</italic> for packaging users and producers that will help them to 
 <italic class="italic">fast track</italic> sustainable innovations up to market penetration. Based on 
 <italic class="italic">user-driven strategy</italic> able to fit packaging to foods and market diversity, complexity and requirements, these decision-supporting approaches and tools should be able to design and communicate, in a user-friendly format, eco-innovative packaging alternatives by setting up, for instance, scores of sustainability performance. These calculated indicators could be a basis for the setting up of front-of-package sustainability labels, to be further disseminated to all end-users, especially consumers.
