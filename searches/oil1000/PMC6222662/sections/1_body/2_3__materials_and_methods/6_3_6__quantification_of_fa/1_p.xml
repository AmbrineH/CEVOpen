<p class="p">The stock solution was produced by dissolving 1 mL of the 37-component FAME standard mixture in 9 mL of dichloromethane (CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). Individual fatty acids in the sample were identified by comparing their retention times with those of the 37-component FAME standard mixture. The fatty-acid content of each sample was calculated using the analytical method specified in the Food Code issued by the Korean Food Drug Administration, as follows:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Fatty acid (mg.g
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) = ((P
  <sub class="sub">ti</sub> × F
  <sub class="sub">i</sub> × F
  <sub class="sub">IS</sub> × Wt
  <sub class="sub">IS</sub>)/ Pt
  <sub class="sub">IS</sub> × R
  <sub class="sub">i</sub> × W
  <sub class="sub">spl</sub>) × 100
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">R
  <sub class="sub">i</sub> = Ps
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>/Ps
  <sub class="sub">IS</sub> × W
  <sub class="sub">IS</sub>/W
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Pt
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the peak area of fatty acid i, Pt
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> is the peak area of the internal standard, F
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the conversion factor of fatty acid i, F
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> is the conversion factor of the internal standard, Wt
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> is the amount of internal standard (mg), W
 <sub class="sub">spl</sub> is the amount of sample (g), R
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the response factor of fatty acid i, Ps
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the peak area of fatty acid i in the standard, Ps
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> is the peak area of the internal standard in the standard, W
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> is the amount of internal standard in the standard (mg), and W
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the amount of fatty acid i in the standard (mg).
