<p class="p">Transesterification was conducted to convert the fatty acids in the soybean flour to FAMEs prior to gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC–FID) analysis. Soybean flour samples (50 mg) were placed in amber vials and combined with pentadecanoic acid (0.2 mg) as the internal standard. For lipid extraction and transesterification, 400 μL of n-heptane and 640 μL of methylation solvents (MeOH, benzene, DMP, and H

The vials were then cooled to room temperature (20 °C) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm, for 1 min. The supernatant (containing FAMEs) was separated and transferred to a new container insert in the amber vial [
