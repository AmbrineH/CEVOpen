<p class="p">The fatty-acid composition was determined using a GC–FID (Agilent 7890B, Agilent Co. Ltd., Santa Clara, CA, USA) system. A capillary column (HP-INNOWAX 19091N, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm, Agilent Co. Ltd., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to separate the 37 FAMEs. The injection volume was 1 μL with 1:50 split mode. The carrier gas was helium set at a flow rate of 10 mL∙min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The flame gas consisted of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 35 mL∙min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and mixed gas at 300 mL∙min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The initial oven temperature was 100 °C for 2 min, later increased at the rate of 5 °C∙min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> from 150 °C to 240 °C, and then held isothermally. The inlet temperature was 230 °C and the FID temperature was 250 °C. The acquisition was done from 1 to 55 min for a total analysis time of 65 min [
