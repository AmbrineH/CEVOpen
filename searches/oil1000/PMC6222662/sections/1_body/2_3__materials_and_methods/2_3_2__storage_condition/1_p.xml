<p class="p">Raw and roasted soybean flour samples were subdivided into polypropylene film (PE; 10 × 15 cm, width × length; thickness 0.05 mm) and polyethylene film (PP; 15 × 22 cm, width × length; thickness 0.04 mm) packets and immediately sealed with vinyl adhesive. The subdivided soybean flour was stored in the dark at three different temperatures: refrigeration (4 °C), room temperature (20 °C), and high temperature (45 °C, as the accelerated condition). Three packets containing each type of soybean flour, stored under each condition, were opened and used for fatty-acid analysis after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks of storage [
