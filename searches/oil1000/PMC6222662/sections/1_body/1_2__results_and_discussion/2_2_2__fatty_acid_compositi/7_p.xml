<p class="p">Previous studies concluded that the stability of vegetable oil depends on the type of plastic film and oxygen permeability, the level of natural antioxidants in the oil, the type and initial physicochemical properties of oil, and the storage duration and temperature. In particular, the stability was shown to differ greatly in response to different storage durations and temperatures in all types of packing materials [
