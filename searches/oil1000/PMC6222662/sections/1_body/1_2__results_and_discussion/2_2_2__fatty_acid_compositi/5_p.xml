<p class="p">The total fatty-acid content of the roasted soybean flour stored at high temperature decreased gradually between eight and 24 weeks, regardless of soybean flour type and packing material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02713-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). At 12 weeks, the total fatty-acid content was lower than that of the initial roasted soybean flour. The decrease in fatty-acid content may be partly due to the heat treatment applied during the roasting process of the soybeans. In the autoxidation process, triplet oxygen reacts after radicals are formed by releasing hydrogen from lipid molecules. Therefore, as the temperature rises, oxidation of the roasted soybean flour, which was preheated, would be promoted, as the release of hydrogen is facilitated by the easy supply of energy to break the hydrogen bond in the lipid molecules [
