<p class="p">The findings represent the influence of storage duration and temperature on fatty acids. Drastic variations were observed between the initial and 48-week storage of C16:0, C17:0, C18:1c&amp;t, and C18:2c&amp;t in raw soybean flour, whereas, in roasted soybean flour, C14:0, C16:0, C17:0, C18:1c&amp;t, C18:2c&amp;t, and C18:3n3 were affected. Other fatty-acid content also produced changes during storage, albeit by a lesser amount. These results showcase the impact created on each fatty-acid content of raw and roasted soybean flour which, in turn, emphasizes the importance of storage conditions. Thus, controlled storage conditions are essential for the preservation of soybean quality [

By controlling the soybean flour type and storage temperature conditions, and by analyzing changes in fatty-acid composition and content during long-term storage, the findings of this study further the understanding of how fatty acids can be used as indicators of quality change and storage stability in soybean flour. Furthermore, the findings of the present study provide basic data that can be used to establish the shelf life and suitable storage conditions for raw and roasted soybean flour.
