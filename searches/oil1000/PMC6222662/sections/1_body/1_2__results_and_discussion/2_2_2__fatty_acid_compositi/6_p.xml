<p class="p">Autoxidation is dependent on the ease with which the alkyl radicals of fatty acids are produced. Linolenic acid (C18:3) has more methylene groups with two double bonds, from which hydrogen atoms can be cleaved, and a higher oxidation rate than linoleic acid (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02713" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Compared to roasted soybean flour prior to storage, the major unsaturated fatty acids of the flour, i.e., oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic acids (18:3) decreased by 30.0%, 94.4%, and 97.7%, and 38.0%, 94.8%, and 98.0% when stored in polyethylene and polypropylene film, respectively, for 48 weeks under high temperature. The secondary products of peroxide degradation of these fatty acids—hexanal, nonadienal, and 2,4-heptadienal—are used as indicator compounds for evaluating the oxidation of foods [
