<p class="p">In this study, we showed that the most impactful of the three main factors of storage conditions was storage duration, followed by storage temperature and then packing material, regardless of the type of soybean flour. The fatty-acid composition and content of raw and roasted soybean flour, detected as C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C20:0, C20:3n6&amp;21:0, and C22:0, showed considerable changes in both flour types. The fatty acids tend to change more when stored until 48 weeks than at initial storage. More changes were observed in storage duration, followed by storage temperature and packing material, as the latter two variables showed a lesser effect on fatty acids compared to storage duration. Differences were also observed in the fatty-acid composition and content sorted at different temperature based on individual components. Thus, variations between C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C20:0, C20:3n6&amp;21:0, and C22:0 composition and content stored in polyethylene and polypropylene showed the effect of packing materials on fatty acids. </p>
