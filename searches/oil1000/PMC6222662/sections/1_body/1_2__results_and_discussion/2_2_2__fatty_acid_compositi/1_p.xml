<p class="p">Before storage, the total fatty-acid contents of the raw soybean flour and the roasted soybean flour were 137.98 mg∙g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 135.56 mg∙g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. In both types of soybean flour, the fatty-acid content was the highest in the order of linoleic (C18:2), oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0), linolenic (18:3), and stearic acids (C18:0), which represented 47%, 26%, 12%, 9%, and 4% of the total fatty-acid content, respectively. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed that linoleic (C18:2), oleic (C18:1), and palmitic acids (C16:0) were the major fatty acids with relative contents of more than 10% in soybean flour. The findings of this study differed slightly from those of previous studies that analyzed the fatty-acid composition of recommended soybean varieties in Korea; however, the differences are expected to be due to the difference in variety, which showed a similar tendency [
