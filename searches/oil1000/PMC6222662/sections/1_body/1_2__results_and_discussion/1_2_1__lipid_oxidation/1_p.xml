<p class="p">Lipid oxidation is a complex process in which the rate and process are affected by various factors, such as the fatty-acid profile, positional distribution of fatty acids, lipid class, minor component, and environmental factors. Lipids are not only susceptible to oxidative change during storage, but also during processing (roasting and deep frying) of the lipid-containing foods. The oxidation sensitivity of lipids depends primarily on the fatty-acid composition, specifically, their degree of unsaturation. Unsaturated fatty acids are the main reactants which undergo significant compositional changes during oxidation and are, therefore, an indirect measure for the extent of oxidation. The oxidation rates of stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic acids (C18:3) were reported to be in the ratio of 1:100:1200:2500 [
