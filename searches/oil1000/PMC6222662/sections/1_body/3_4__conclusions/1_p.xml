<p class="p">This study determined the changes in fatty-acid content in raw and roasted soybean flour stored in different packaging materials at different temperatures for 48 weeks. Packaging material was found to have the least influence, and storage duration and temperature were found to have the greatest influence on the composition and content of fatty acids in both raw and roasted soybean flour. The present study shows the importance of selecting suitable storage temperature and duration to retain the nutritional value of soybean flour for human consumption.</p>
