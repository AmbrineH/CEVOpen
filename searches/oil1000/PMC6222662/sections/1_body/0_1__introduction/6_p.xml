<p class="p">Because lipid oxidation produces low-molecular off-flavor compounds and leads to the loss of essential fatty acids, it is a very important reaction that determines the nutritional, functional, and sensory characteristics of foods, as well as their storage stability. During the initial stages of the oxidation process, hydroperoxides accumulate as primary oxidation products, which thereafter decompose to secondary oxidation products, such as alcohols, aldehydes, free fatty acids, and ketones, resulting in rancidity [
