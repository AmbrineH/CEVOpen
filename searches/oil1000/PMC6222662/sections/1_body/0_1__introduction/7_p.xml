<p class="p">The main roles of food packaging are to contain and protect food from external influences and damages, and to provide ingredient and nutritional information to consumers. Food packaging can extend the shelf life and maintain or enhance the food quality and consistency. Polyethylene and polypropylene are the most widely used food packaging materials due to their suitable properties, such as flexibility, strength, stability, lightness, chemical resistance, and moisture prevention, and because these materials can easily be processed and, therefore, reused and recycled. Polyethylene is the simplest and most inexpensive plastic. There are two basic categories of polyethylene: high and low density. Low-density polyethylene is especially flexible, strong, tough, and resistant to moisture. Since low-density polyethylene is relatively transparent, it is often used when film application and heat sealing are required. Polypropylene is denser, harder, and more transparent than polyethylene, and has a high resistance to chemicals and moisture. Polypropylene also has a high melting point (160 Â°C), which makes it suitable for applications where thermal resistance is required [
