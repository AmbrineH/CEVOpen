<p class="p">Soybean oil and protein received great commercial interest before the recent attention on soybean protein. According to a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, soybean oil is the second largest vegetable oil produced worldwide after palm oil. Most beans are very low in fat, but soybeans have an exceptionally high fat content [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02713" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Soybean fat has a uniquely high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic (18-carbon chain with two double bonds; C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids. They also contain a substantial amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid (C18:1), and moderate amounts of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic (C16:0) and stearic acids (C18:0). The predominant fatty acid is linoleic acid, which accounts for ~53% of the total fatty-acid content of soybeans. It is also notable that linolenic-acid content is approximately only 7–8% [

Full-fat soybeans with high fat content can contribute significantly to the intake of α-linolenic acid which is considered an essential fatty acid for human nutrition [

The n-3 fatty acids such as α-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) inhibit the synthesis of triglycerides and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the liver, which were shown to have a major effect in lowering triglyceride levels in the blood [
