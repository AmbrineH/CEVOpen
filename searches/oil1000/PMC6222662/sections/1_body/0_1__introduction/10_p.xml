<p class="p">Thus, identifying the exact shelf life of soybean flour is crucial through identifying the proper storage conditions (i.e., temperature and humidity) and maximum storage duration of soybean flour. In this study, we aimed to evaluate storage stability and changes in soybean flour quality by monitoring changes in fatty-acid content of raw and roasted soybean flour under different storage conditions (i.e., temperature and duration). The effects of packing material and storage condition on the nutritional quality of soybean flour varieties were identified. This study will help in finding suitable conditions in order to retain the nutritional value of soybean flour even after storage. </p>
