<p class="p">Though many studies explaining the composition of soybean flour were carried out, very few studies were done to identify the exact storage conditions to enhance the shelf life of soybean flour during storage. Lipid oxidation is a major cause in affecting the nutritional quality of soybean during storage. Lipid oxidation is well known for the development of off-flavors and loss of nutrients leading to the formation of potentially toxic compounds ending in the deterioration of food. Lipids are susceptible to spontaneous oxidation (i.e., autoxidation) and oxidation in the presence of catalytic systems, such as heat, light, and enzymes, leading to complex processes of thermal oxidation, photooxidation, and enzymatic oxidation, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02713" class="xref">Supplementary Materials Figure S1</xref>) that leads to a series of complex chemical changes through free-radical chain mechanisms that undergo three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination.
