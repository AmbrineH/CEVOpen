 <p class="p">Soybeans are low in saturated fat and a rich source of protein, dietary fiber, and isoflavone; however, their nutritional shelf life is yet to be established. This study evaluated the change in the stability and quality of fatty acids in raw and roasted soybean flour under different storage temperatures and durations. In both types of soybean flour, the fatty-acid content was the highest in the order of linoleic acid (18-carbon chain with two double bonds; C18:2), oleic acid (C18:1), palmitic acid (C16:0), linolenic acid (18:3), and stearic acid (C18:0), which represented 47%, 26%, 12%, 9%, and 4% of the total fatty-acid content, respectively. The major unsaturated fatty acids of raw soybean flour—oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid—decreased by 30.0%, 94.4%, and 97.7%, and 38.0%, 94.8%, and 98.0% when stored in polyethylene and polypropylene film, respectively, after 48 weeks of storage under high-temperature conditions. These values were later increased due to hydrolysis. This study presents the changes in composition and content of two soybean flour types and the changes in quality and stability of fatty acids in response to storage temperature and duration. This study shows the influence of storage conditions and temperature on the nutritional quality which is least affected by packing material.</p>
