<p class="p">The second class of secondary metabolites found in 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> are the limonoids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2" class="xref">Scheme 2</xref>). The latter were considered as oxygenated triterpenoids as they contain relatively high numbers of oxygen atoms (7â€“11) in their structures. All components have a furan ring attached to the D-ring at C-17. Limonoids occur both in glucosidic and aglyconic form. Limonoid aglycones are water-insoluble and responsible for a bitter taste of the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits, while limonoid glucosides are water-soluble and tasteless [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Among limonoids, the most important one is limonin, known as 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> constituent since 1841. Limonoid glucosides are more abundant in juices and pulps, such as limonin glucoside, nomilin glucoside, obacunone glucoside, nomilinic acid glucoside, and deacetylnomilinic acid glucoside, because they are water-soluble, while limonoid aglycones such as limonin, nomilin, obacunone, ichangin, and deacetyl nomilin are water-insoluble and are present mainly in seeds and peels [
