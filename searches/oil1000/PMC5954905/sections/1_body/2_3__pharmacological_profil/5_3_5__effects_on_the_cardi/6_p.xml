Moreover, the relaxation induced by neroli was partially reversed by soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Neroli also inhibited extracellular Ca

All these data indicated that neroli-induced relaxation might be partly mediated by the nitric oxide-soluble guanylyl cyclase, and ryanodine receptor signaling pathway [
