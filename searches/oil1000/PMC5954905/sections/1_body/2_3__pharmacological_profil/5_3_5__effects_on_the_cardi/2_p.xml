<p class="p">Another study was carried out to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of different doses of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> and pure 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine in rats. 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> extract and pure 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine enhanced the heart rate and blood pressure. Higher activities were obtained with 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> extract than 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine, suggesting that other compounds in the extract can alter physiological parameters [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine on heart rate and blood pressure in female Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed. During 28 days, two types of extracts, one of which contained 6% and other 95% 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine, were administered daily by gavage at 10 or 50 mg/kg, doses for a 60 kg human equal to 600 and 3000 mg/kg. The outcome of the study showed that both 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-synephrine and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> extract resulted in clinically insignificant increases in heart rate and blood pressure at doses many times greater than used in humans. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-Synephrine and bitter orange extract exhibited little or no effect on the cardiovascular effects of caffeine [
