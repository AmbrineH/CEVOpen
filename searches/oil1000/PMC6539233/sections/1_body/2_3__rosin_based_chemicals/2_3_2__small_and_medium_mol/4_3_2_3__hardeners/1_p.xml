<p class="p">Rosin-based hardeners, i.e., curing agents, are compounds containing anhydride, carboxyl or hydroxyl groups, which allows one to apply them in epoxy or urethane resin systems. In comparison with petroleum-based hardeners they bring improved endurance and thermal properties to resin systems. Moreover, rosin-based anhydrides are non-toxic, as opposed to conventional anhydride curing agents. Their preparation is simple and well described, and usually does not require the use of solvents. These strengths cause the great interest in use of rosin based chemicals as hardeners of conventional and bio-based resins resulting in several commercializations of e.g., maleated rosins.</p>
