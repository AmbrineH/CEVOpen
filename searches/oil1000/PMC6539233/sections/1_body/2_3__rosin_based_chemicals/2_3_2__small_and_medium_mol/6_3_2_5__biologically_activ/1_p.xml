<p class="p">Pure abietic acid isolated from rosin and its derivatives exhibit many potential activities of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, for example, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antimycotic and anti-arteriosclerotic properties and uses in treating digestive canal, acute and chronic gastritis, and erosive gastritis, allergy, asthma, arthritis and psoriasis [
 <xref rid="B202-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>]. In this subsection rosin-based chemicals with main applications as biologically active compounds can be found. They include both medications and biocides. Their synthetic routes are usually characterized in detail and, from the chemical point of view, their TRLs are rather high. It is worth noting, that although the sustainability of their syntheses is usually worse than for other rosin derivatives (due to the necessity of using more dangerous chemicals), it is still better than their petrochemical counterparts (thanks to the use of bio-based rosin as a main substrate).
