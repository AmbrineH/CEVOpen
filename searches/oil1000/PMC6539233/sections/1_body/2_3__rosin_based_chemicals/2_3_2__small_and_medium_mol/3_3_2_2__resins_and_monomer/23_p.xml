<p class="p">Mono-allyl rosin derivatives have been also synthesized in recent years. Allyl rosinate can be prepared in aqueous [
 <xref rid="B181-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>] or ethanol [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>] medium from rosin, sodium hydroxide and allyl chloride according to

 <xref rid="B182-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>]. On the other hand, allyl maleopimarate can be prepared in THF from maleopimaric acid, oxalyl chloride and allyl alcohol according to 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-24-01651-sch019" class="xref">Scheme 19</xref>, and using such separation methods as vacuum distillation and column chromatography [
