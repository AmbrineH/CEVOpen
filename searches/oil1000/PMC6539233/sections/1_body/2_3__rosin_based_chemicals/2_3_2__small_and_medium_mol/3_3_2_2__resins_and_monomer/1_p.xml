<p class="p">Rosin-based resins and monomers are compounds which contain epoxy, acrylic, allyl, hydroxyl or oxazine reactive groups, that enable cross-linking, polymerization or building in the polymer matrix. Their preparations are usually well described and easy to perform. The syntheses are similar to conventional resins/monomers preparations, however the necessity of using organic solvents in several reactions is a disadvantage in the context of Green Chemistry rules. The high modification potential of rosin derivatives allows one to prepare resins and monomers showing diverse and designable properties. They can exhibit adjustable glass transition temperatures, low volume shrinkage, as well as improve elastic modulus, Youngâ€™s modulus, shape-memory, flame retardancy, corrosion protection features of final casts/polymers in comparison with petroleum-based compounds. Therefore, the best described recipes show high commercialization potential in the segment of resins, adhesives and paints, but in most cases, additional applied research should be performed to increase their technology readiness level (TRL).</p>
