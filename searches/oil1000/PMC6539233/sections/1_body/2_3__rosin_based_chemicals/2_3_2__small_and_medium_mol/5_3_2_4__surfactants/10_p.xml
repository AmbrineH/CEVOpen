As it can be seen, rosin bisquaternary ammonium chloride can be prepared from rosin, ethanol, fumaric acid and epoxy quaternary ammonium salt, and using such separation methods as washing and drying. Thus obtained gemini surfactant has good surface activity and antifungal activity against fungi responsible for wood decay [
