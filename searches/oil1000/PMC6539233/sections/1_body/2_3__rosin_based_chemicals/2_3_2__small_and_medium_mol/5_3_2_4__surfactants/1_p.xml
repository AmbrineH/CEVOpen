<p class="p">Small/medium molecule rosin-based surfactants are ionic or non-ionic compounds that lower surface tension between different substances. In comparison with petrochemical counterparts, they are characterized by designable surface activity, affinity to many chemicals (especially cycloaliphatic and aromatic), non-toxicity, mild biocidal properties and enhanced thermal stability. Unfortunately, their syntheses are less well described than rosin-based resins and hardeners, e.g., reaction yields are often unavailable. Moreover, the use of unsustainable chemicals in the mentioned reactions noticeably decreases the “green” aspect of these rosin derivatives. Therefore, it is an urgent need to undertake applied studies on these compounds, as well as to find more sustainable preparation processes in order to increase TRL of this group of rosin derivatives.</p>
