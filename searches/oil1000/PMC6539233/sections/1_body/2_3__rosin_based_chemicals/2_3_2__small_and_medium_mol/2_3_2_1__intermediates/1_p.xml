<p class="p">Intermediates are the products of simple rosin modifications, which are necessary for the preparation of many new compounds. They can be synthesized in very simple, well described ways with high yields. The sustainability of these processes is high: They usually use a biobased main substrate (rosin) in solvent-free processes. Some drawback can be the separation processes, that may not always be easy, because of the high viscosity, m.p. and stickiness of products. In view of the above, rosin-based intermediates have very high commercialization potential and some of them are commercially available in certain regions of the world.</p>
