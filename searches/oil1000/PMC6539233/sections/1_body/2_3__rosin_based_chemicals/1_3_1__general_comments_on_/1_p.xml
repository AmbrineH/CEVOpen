<p class="p">The review contains short, but exhaustive descriptions of rosin-derived compound syntheses published in the scientific literature from the JCR list since 2008. It does not include older achievements in the field of rosin, that were widely described in previous review literature [

Only products with declared or obvious practical applications have been chosen. The review is divided into two sections according to the general molecular structure of the prepared compounds, while each section is divided according to practical application and the structure similarity of the compounds. The collected data are given in the article text and in schemes. The following information are presented in the text: product name, product morphology, substrates name(s), separation techniques and practical applications. On the other hand, data such as reaction scheme, catalyst use, reaction media, temperature, pressure, time and yield are included in the schemes. There are situations where some data simply has not been reported by original authors, e.g., product morphology or yield. Such missing data could not be presented in this review. What does the above mean? The more data provided, the more advanced the research on a compound, and the more reliable the recipe. The lack of data should indicate that the research on a certain rosin derivative is probably at an early, basic stage. It has to be underlined that reaction schemes do not take into account advanced stereochemistry. Finally, almost all reactions were conducted under an inert atmosphere: nitrogen or argon, so reaction schemes do not include this information.
