<p class="p">This section describes rosin-derived macromolecular compounds with repeated units typical of macromolecules. It contains polymers, oligomers, macroinitiators and polymer functionalized materials. Additionally, some small/medium molecule compounds, which are not presented in the previous section, but necessary to obtain appropriate macromolecules, are described here. Non-toxicity, natural origin, low price, rigid structure, hydrophobicity, excellent thermal properties, anticorrosive performance, mild biocidal properties and stickiness are the most attractive reasons to use rosin derivatives in the preparation of polymer materials. A disadvantage of these processes in comparison with petrochemical counterparts is the relatively lower reactivity of rosin derivatives resulting from the steric hinderance of the diterpene skeleton and the usually lower purity of rosin-based intermediates, as discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot1-molecules-24-01651" class="xref">Section 3.2.1</xref>. As a result, rosin-based polymer materials are usually characterized by distinct polydispersity and molecular weights rather far from their theoretical values. Therefore, their TRL is lower than for small/medium molecule compounds of rosin. It is noteworthy, that compared to non-renewable counterparts, the use of rosin significantly increases the sustainability of preparation processes according to Green Chemistry rules, so there is still high demand for basic and applied research in this field.
