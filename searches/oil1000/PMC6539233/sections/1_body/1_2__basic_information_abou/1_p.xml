<p class="p">Rosin, or colophony, is a solid and brittle mixture of non-volatile conifer tree resin components. It can display colors ranging from almost colorless, through shades of yellow and brown to black. Depending on the origin, two industrially important types of rosin can be distinguished, i.e., gum rosin and tall oil rosin. Gum rosin is the non-volatile residue remaining after distillation of tree resin obtained by tapping of living trees. Tall oil rosin is a by-product of wood pulping in the kraft process. Gum rosin accounts for ca. 60% of world rosin production, whereas tall oil rosin is ca. 35%. In the past, rosin was widely obtained from the solvent extraction of harvested wood as so-called wood rosin, but nowadays, this technology is of little importance [

Annual world production of rosin is ca. 1.2 million tons and has remained stable in the last decades [
