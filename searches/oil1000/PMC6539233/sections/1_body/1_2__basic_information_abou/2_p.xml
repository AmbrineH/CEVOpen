<p class="p">Resin acids, with the general formula C
 <sub class="sub">19</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">29</sub>COOH, constitute up to 95 wt.% of rosin, while neutral compounds are present in amounts of a few percent. A number of resin acids based on a few diterpene carbon skeletons were identified so far [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The most abundant resin acids are built on abietane and pimarane skeletons. Their structural formulas are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01651-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. It should be emphasized, that abietane-structured acids are characterized by conjugated double bond systems, which makes them particularly susceptible to chemical modifications. It is noteworthy, that abietane-structured acids isomerize at elevated temperature to afford readily reactive levopimaric acid, according to 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-24-01651-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>. On the other hand, pimarane-type acids do not have conjugated double bond systems, which limits their chemical processability. The detailed chemical composition of rosin depends on its type (gum, tall oil or wood), thermal history, species of tree and geographical origin [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Compositions of gum rosin from various sources are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01651-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, where it can be seen that the content of abietane-type acids may vary between 64 and 87 wt.%. Such detailed composition of a rosin can be determined, e.g., by the capillary electrophoresis method [
