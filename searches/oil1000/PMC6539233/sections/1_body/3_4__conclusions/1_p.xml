<p class="p">Rosin is a highly modifiable raw material for both low molecular weight products and polymers. Its natural origin is accompanied with low price and a diterpene chemical nature, which is ready to introduce useful reactive chemical groups, and it exhibits a stiff constitution improving many thermal, physical, mechanical and functional properties of the final materials. In recent years rosin-based chemicals have attracted growing interest. They offer great opportunities to produce useful products: resins, curing agents, surfactants, medicines, biocides, materials for biomedical application, elastomers, coatings, adhesives, sorbents and catalysts. </p>
