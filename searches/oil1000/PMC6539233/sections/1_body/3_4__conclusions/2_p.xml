<p class="p">Taking into consideration the declared properties of the prepared chemicals they seem to be competitive alternatives to existing products on the market. This review presents well over 100 reproducible recipes. Sadly, some of the publications do not contain complete data, which makes it difficult to repeat the syntheses. According to our subjective opinion, the following information should be provided (or obvious) for a recipe to be considered as complete: product name, product morphology, substrate(s) names, reaction scheme, catalyst, media, temperature, pressure, time, yield and separation techniques. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01651-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the number of complete and incomplete recipes in the individual parts of this review. Interestingly, the highest number of complete recipes (both absolute and relative) can be found among hardeners, resins and monomers, and also biologically active compounds. The most common missing parameter is yield. A large number of incomplete recipes in macromolecular compounds section may result from the fact that polymerizations are often carried out in order to achieve appropriate material properties, not specific yields. The summary presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01651-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows that resins, monomers, hardeners and biologically active compounds are the most completely described rosin-based chemicals in the recent decade, which makes them the most promising subjects for scaling-up and commercialization. However, this does not change the fact that rosin chemistry is able to deliver a serious amount of new environmentally-friendly solutions in many fields of science, medicine and engineering. The current review confirms this, and encourages further intensive research on rosin in the near future.
