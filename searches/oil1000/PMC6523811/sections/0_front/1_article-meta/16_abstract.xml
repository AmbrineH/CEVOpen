 <p class="p">In this study, the curing kinetics of the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system were investigated by nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The model-free isoconversional method of Ozawa–Flynn–Wall reveals a dependence of

  <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles on the tensile properties and tensile fracture face morphology of nanocomposites show that the uniform dispersion of SiO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles plays an important role in promoting the tensile performance of nanocomposites. Additionally, increases of 184.1% and 217.2% were achieved by adding 1.5% weight parts of nano-SiO
