 <sub class="sub">α</sub> is highest at the beginning of curing, and then decreases with conversion throughout the entire curing process. The process of the curing reaction is autocatalytic because phenolic amine is an efficient hydrogen-bond donor molecule that promotes the ring opening of the epoxy group in the same way as the hydroxyl group of epoxy resin, leading to an auto-accelerating effect on the curing reaction and a decrease in apparent activation energy [

 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In the initial stages of reaction, the generated hydroxyl groups are less and the catalytic effect is not obvious, thus the reaction activation energy is higher. As the reaction continues, the generated hydroxyl groups increase to promote the catalytic reaction effectively, the activation energy will be decreased. In addition, the temperature of the curing system increases and viscosity is reduced during the process of the curing reaction. These also accelerate the diffusion rate and reduce the activation energy [
