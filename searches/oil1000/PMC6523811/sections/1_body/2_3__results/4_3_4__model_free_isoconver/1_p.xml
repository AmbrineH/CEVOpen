<p class="p">Epoxy resin curing is a complicated process due to the presence of gelation and vitrification, and therefore it is considered to be a multi-step reaction [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Isoconversional methods, which assume that the conversion is constant at the curing reaction DSC peak and independent of the several heating rates used, have been previously applied to the curing kinetics analysis of many other thermosetting systems and require no knowledge of the reaction model [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The above methods of Kissinger and Ozawa have the limitation of producing a single value of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> for the whole process, which is a sign of a single-step process [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Model-free isoconversional methods can help to observe variations in apparent activation energy at different degrees of curing. The isoconversional method, more importantly, is able to explain the curing reaction mechanism by observing the change of apparent activation energy with conversion.
