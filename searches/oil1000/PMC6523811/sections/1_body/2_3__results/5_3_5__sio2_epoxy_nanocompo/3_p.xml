<p class="p">The dispersion ability of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles in epoxy resin is believed to be responsible for the increase-then-decrease phenomenon in terms of its tensile properties [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles are shown to have a strong agglomerating trend, so that the homogeneous dispersion of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles has been considered to be a difficult and important process [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. A good dispersion, however, can be achieved by surface modification and appropriate processing conditions [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In this work, nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles were sufficiently premixed with NGDE and placed for more than 8 h at room temperature. Of course, a reasonably good distribution of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles can be achieved at a low content.
