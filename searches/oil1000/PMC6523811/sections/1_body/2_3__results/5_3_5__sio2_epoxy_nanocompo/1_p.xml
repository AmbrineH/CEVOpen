<p class="p">The tensile strength obtained for SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/epoxy nanocomposites with different weight parts of nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles in nanomaterials system is plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00680-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>. It shows that the tensile strength of nanocomposites increases with the addition of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles up to 1.5 weight parts, where the value of tensile strength reaches its maximum and then decreases with further additions. The tensile strength of nanocomposites with 1.5 weight parts of nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles increased remarkably up to 36.38 MPa in comparison with the pure epoxy resin with a tensile strength of 12.60 MPa.
