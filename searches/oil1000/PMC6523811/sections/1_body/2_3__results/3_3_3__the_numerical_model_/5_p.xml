<p class="p">Formula (11) reflects the relationship of curing degree α, curing temperature 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and curing time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>. Through this formula, the relationship between α and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> of phenolic amine/epoxy resin composites at different temperatures can be obtained. Therefore, the actual curing reaction process can be predicted. The curves of curing time and curing degree of phenolic amine/epoxy resin composites at different temperatures are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00680-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. It shows that extending reaction time and increasing reaction temperature are two effective methods to achieve the same curing degree. In order to shorten the curing time, 40 °C and 3 h were selected as curing parameters in this paper. In this condition, phenolic amine/epoxy resin composites are cured almost completely.
