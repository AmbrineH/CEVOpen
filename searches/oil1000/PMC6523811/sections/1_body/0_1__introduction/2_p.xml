<p class="p">Epoxy resins are very versatile materials with a wide range of applications based on their excellent chemical/corrosion resistance and mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. For the past few decades, epoxy resins have been successfully applied in emergency repair and sealing of oil–gas pipelines due to the advantages of no welding, no production stopping, high construction safety, and low cost [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Epoxy resins’ composition, comprising phenolic amine curing agents prepared by the Mannich reaction, shows good, obtainable surface properties, in particular for coating, adhesively bonding and enhancing metallic and mineral substrates as an adhesive and sealant, and for producing moldings and sheet-like structures [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. More importantly, this phenolic amine/epoxy resin system can be cured in a water-containing environment, thus it is considered to be a suitable material for underwater sealing and curing applications. It is well known that the physical properties of cured epoxy resins depend on the structure of their crosslinking network, curing extent, and the time and temperature of the curing reaction [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Such curing kinetics parameters related to network formation could provide substantial information concerning the final structure and properties of the epoxy resin network, and also the processability of epoxy resin. Therefore, the curing kinetics analysis of epoxy resin is essential to understand the structure–property–processing relationship for the preparation of high-performance composites [
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, there are few reports on the curing kinetics analysis of the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system until now.
