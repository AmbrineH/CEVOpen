<p class="p">As an important transportation equipment for offshore oil and gas exploitation, the safety of submarine oil–gas pipelines is related to the normal operation of offshore oil and gas exploitation system. Once the failure of submarine oil–gas pipelines occurs, it will not only cause the exploitation shutdown and the pollution of environment by crude oil, but also affect the normal production and life of an oil–gas supplier [

 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, the traditional techniques widely used in repairing onshore pipelines are difficult to implement under water due to the complex undersea environment, long construction period, low repair speed and complex operational procedures [

 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Thus, it is urgent to develop a rapid and effective underwater repair technique to reduce loss and damage once oil–gas pipeline leaks.
