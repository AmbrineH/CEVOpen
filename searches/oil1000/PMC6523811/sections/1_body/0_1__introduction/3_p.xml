<p class="p">In this work, dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the curing kinetics of the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system. Detailed curing kinetics analysis was performed using the model-free isoconversional method of Ozawa–Flynn–Wall. Moreover, there are many unsaturated residual bonds and hydroxyl groups in different bonding states on the surface of nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles, which is beneficial in improving interfacial bonding with the epoxy resin matrix in physical or chemical ways [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particle addition to epoxy resin on the tensile properties and fracture face morphology of the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system was also investigated. Based on the results, silica-filled phenolic amine/epoxy resin nanocomposites with good mechanical properties are a promising water-containing curing material for underwater speedy repair and sealing applications.
