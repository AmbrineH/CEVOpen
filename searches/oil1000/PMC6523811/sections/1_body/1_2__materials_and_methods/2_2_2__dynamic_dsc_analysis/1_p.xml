<p class="p">Studies on the curing kinetics of the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system were carried out using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, 204 F1, NETZSCH, Selb, Germany). DGEBA, NGDE and phenolic amine 810 were mixed at room temperature based on their determined stoichiometric ratio. Samples of 5–10 mg were sealed in aluminum pans in respect to dynamic DSC scans, and heated up to 200 °C from a room temperature of 20 °C at a series of heating rates of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C/min, respectively.</p>
