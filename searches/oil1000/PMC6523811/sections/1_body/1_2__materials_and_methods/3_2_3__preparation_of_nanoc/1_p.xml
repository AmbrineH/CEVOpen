 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles were placed into a vacuum oven and heated at 100 °C for 2 h until the mass remained stable. The level of phenolic amine curing agent incorporation was based on the epoxy value of DGEBA according to the empirical formula of 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic> = (1.3~1.4) × 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> × 43, where 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> are the amount of addition of phenolic amine curing agent per hundred of epoxy resin and the epoxy value, respectively [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-11-00680" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. According to this empirical formula, approximately 30 g of phenolic amine 810 was required for 100 g DGEBA. Epoxy-based reactive diluent NGDE can participate, together with DGEBA and phenolic amine 810, in polymerization and crosslinking reactions; therefore, 5 g more of NGDE was used in the phenolic amine/epoxy resin system.
