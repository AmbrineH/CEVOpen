<p class="p">In this paper, different formulations of DGEBA with phenolic amine 810 and NGDE were developed by varying the weight parts of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles. The formulas employed in this study are listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00680-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The resultant materials were completely mixed by a mechanical stirrer and degassed with a vacuum pump to eliminate air bubbles. The bubble-free mixtures were then poured into preheated steel molds in an oven following curing at 40 Â°C for 3 h. Besides this, tensile test specimens were developed according to ASTM D638 tensile sample specification.
