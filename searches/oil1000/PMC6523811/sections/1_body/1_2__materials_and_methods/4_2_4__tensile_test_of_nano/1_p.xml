<p class="p">A tensile test of all samples was carried out by a tensile tester (Instron 1196, Instron Corporation, Norwood, MA, USA) with a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min at room temperature. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of specimens were determined at the yield point and 0.5% strain, respectively. Five replicates were taken for each of the properties measured and the results given are the averages of five experimental values.</p>
