<p class="p">The fracture surface morphology analysis of nanocomposites was performed using a scanning electron microscope (Phenom Pure, Phenom Scientific Instrument (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) at a 5 kV accelerating voltage. All specimen surfaces for SEM observation were coated with a thin gold film to protect fracture surfaces from beam damage and to prevent charge build-up.</p>
