<p class="p">A diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A type epoxy resin (DGEBA) provided by Nantong Xingchen Synthetic Material Co., Ltd. (Nantong, China) with an epoxy value of 0.51 was used in this study. Phenolic amine 810 provided by Changsha Chemical Industry Research Institute (Changsha, China) was applied to the hardener, and the neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether (NGDE) supplied by Anhui Xinyuan Chemical Co., Ltd. (Huangshan, China) was added into the epoxy resin as a reactive diluent. Nano-SiO
