<p class="p">The effects of the nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles content on the tensile properties and fracture surface morphology of nanocomposites were also investigated. Studies of the morphology of fracture faces suggest that a uniform distribution of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles is essential in promoting tensile properties. The tensile performance of nanocomposites reached its optimum at 1.5 weight parts of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticle addition, where 184.1% and 217.2% increases were achieved for tensile strength and tensile modulus compared to the pure epoxy resin, respectively.
