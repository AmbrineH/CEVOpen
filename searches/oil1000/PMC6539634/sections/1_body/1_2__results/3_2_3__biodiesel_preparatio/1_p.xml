<p class="p">The determined biodiesel composition by GC-MS displayed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01786-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, can be used to infer the original canola oil. The chemical composition of the oils varies depending on several factors: climate, geographic position and soil. Therefore, it affects the composition of biodiesel, even using the same raw material. The results showed that over 90% of biodiesel was FAME, mostly five fatty acid methyl esters: oleic, linoleic, palmitic, stearic and gondoic, in descending order. Oleic acid methyl ester had the highest proportion of biodiesel with 46%, in addition to a mix of another 16 methyl esters, summing up to 4%. It means that there are more unsaturated fatty acids, which are typically more susceptible to oxidation than saturated fatty acids. The chemical composition of biodiesel is dependent on the raw material used in its production. For that reason, these FAME are suitable to analyze oxidative stability and obtain a way to improve it, considering the equations proposed by Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], the higher linoleic acid methyl ester concentration, the lower biodiesel stability in accelerated conditions using the Rancimat equipment. Additionally, these authors stated that oleic acid methyl ester contributes to the improvement of stability, although they did not propose any equations to measure the effect.
