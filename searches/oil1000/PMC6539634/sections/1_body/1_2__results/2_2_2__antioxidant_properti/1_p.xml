<p class="p">The assays showed significant antioxidant activity, according to 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01786-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In the ORAC assay, antioxidant activity was measured in more than 50,000 TEAC, which means that a gram of this extract is up to 12 times more efficient in protecting fluorescein than Trolox
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>. In the same way, the extract showed activity in DPPH and FRAP assays, which measured the radical scavenging and reducing capacities. The reducing capacity turned out to be 17 times higher in TEAC. The difference of results in each method can be explained according to the mechanisms intervening, both react mainly by electron transference; however, the DPPH method acts through a proton donation mechanism as well [
