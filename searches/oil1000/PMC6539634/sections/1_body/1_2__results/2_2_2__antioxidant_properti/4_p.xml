<p class="p">On the other side, the total phenols were 211.18 GAE. Phenolic compounds, in general, are described as the main responsible agents of antioxidant activity, yet they are not the only ones. It was asserted by Turner et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], who affirmed diverse compounds could be responsible for the antioxidant activity of the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">L. divaricata</italic>. These authors proved through the DPPH method that the aqueous extract of this plant has an antioxidant capacity higher than some pure phenolic acids. Its antioxidant capacity evidences some synergistic effect of these compounds with others present in extracts. Additionally, it highlights the capacity of the extract of preventing the oxidation of the linoleic acid through the DPPH method and others.
