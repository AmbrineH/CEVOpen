<p class="p">The AOM assay showed that biodiesel samples with over 250 mg/L of extract remained stable for more than 24 h, in conformity with PV monitoring, which did not exceed 20 meO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg. For this reason, the exponential phase of the formation of peroxide was not reached at that time. PV exceeded 100 meO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg, both in the blank solution and the 250 mg/mL concentration, taking 5.24 and 19.84 h, respectively. Results were obtained from the regression equations with high correlation coefficients, where t is the time in hours as is displayed in
