<p class="p">OSI is reduced as the absolute temperature increases, given that rate constant (k) increases too, as it is indicated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01786-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. The OSI trend vs. temperature is exponential, according to the Arrhenius equation, which is indicated in Equation (2), while the ln (k) chart against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature approaches the line in a satisfactory level, according to Equation (3). The slope of this line is the relation between Ea and R. These parameters are shown in
