<p class="p">Pure biodiesel (B100) had 36 MJ/kg before the AOM assay; after it, the HHV of the samples was measured in the presence and absence of the extract. The oxidized biodiesel (B100
 <italic class="italic">ox</italic>) showed an HHV decrease of 14% compared to the original value of HHV of biodiesel (B100). The samples with antioxidant added did not show any significant changes. The results are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01786-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. On the other hand, the pure extract had an HHV of 23.6 MJ/kg. There is a small quantity of extract in biodiesel (1 g/L at the most); consequently, the possibility of reducing biodiesel HHV through the addition of extract is dismissed.
