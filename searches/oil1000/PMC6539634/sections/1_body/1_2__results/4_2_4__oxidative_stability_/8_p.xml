<p class="p">Moreover, the biodiesel blended with 500 and 1000 mg/L of antioxidant behaved differently; thus OSI at 100 °C was not reached in continuous time of operation, even when the test lasted more than 24 h at 110 °C. An exponential regression equation was extrapolated by estimating three values, calculating an OSI time of 68 h at 100 °C. This data is higher than that reported by Karavalakis et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], who documented OSI of 21 and 9 h at 110 °C in biodiesel with 1000 mg/L TBHQ and BHQ, respectively. Similar results were obtained by other authors, as is exhibited in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01786-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Botella et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] reported that canola biodiesel raised its OSI up to 9.51 with the addition of 1000 mg/L of antioxidants. Roveda et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] reported an OSI of soybean biodiesel of 3.7 h, meanwhile with the addition of 500 mg/L of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or propyl gallate it increased. BHT was used in synergy with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] to increase the stability of raw oils. Mittelbach and Schober [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] used many commercial and synthetic antioxidants in canola biodiesel in a concentration of 1000 mg/L, increasing the OSI at 110 °C. The current authors report an OSI of 16.89 h with 500 mg/L of antioxidant and 32.27 h with 1000 mg/L at 110 °C.
