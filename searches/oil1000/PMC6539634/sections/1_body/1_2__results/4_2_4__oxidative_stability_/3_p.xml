<p class="p">PV was also monitored by other authors who aged biodiesel at 43 Â°C. They attested that when an antioxidant is added to biodiesel, in that situation tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), the PV increase has a linear correlation with time, which was measured in weeks of storage without air injection [
