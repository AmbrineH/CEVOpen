<p class="p">Samples of a 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> specimen were recollected from the aerial parts. The plant grows wildly in the Campeche Town, in Baja California, Mexico. It is a population located 14 km southern the border between California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) on the parallel 32° N, longitude 115° W, in the Valley of Mexicali within the Sonoran Desert. The plant material consisted of leaves, branches, and flowers from the bush; these were rinsed with tap water to remove the dust and placed to dry in dark room at room temperature for 96 h.
