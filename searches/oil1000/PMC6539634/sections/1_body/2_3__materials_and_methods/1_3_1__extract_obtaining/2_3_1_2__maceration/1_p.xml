<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> extract was obtained through cold maceration using methanol as a solvent in a 5:1 mass ratio for 4 h at 25 °C. Once this process was finished, the liquid was filtered through a Whatman Grade 4 filter paper at atmospheric pressure to be concentrated in a rotating evaporator afterward. Finally, the concentrated extract was placed on a stove at 70 °C to eliminate the solvent left. The extract was stored at 4 °C until its use.
