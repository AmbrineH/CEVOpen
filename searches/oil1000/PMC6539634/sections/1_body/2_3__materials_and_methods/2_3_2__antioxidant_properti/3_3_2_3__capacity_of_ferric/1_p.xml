<p class="p">The antioxidant capacity was determined through the technique described by Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This technique has a principle about absorbance change caused by ion reduction from Fe
 <sup class="sup">+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup class="sup">+2</sup>, which is present in the 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine-Fe(III) complex (TPTZ-Fe). The ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) reagent was prepared with a 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) dilution in HCl 40 mM, to TPTZ concentration to reach 10 µM. Then, that volume of FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> aqueous solution at 20 µM was added to it. Finally, a buffer solution of sodium acetate was added until a pH = 3.6 was reached. During the microplate assay, a sample of 15 µL of extract diluted with methanol, 15 µL of buffer solution and 270 µL of FRAP solution, along with a sample of blank solution were added. The reaction was performed for 30 min in the dark, later, the results were read at 590 nm on the Thermo Scientific Multiskan
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Spectrum (Thermo Scientific) plate reader. A higher absorbance means a higher reducing capacity. These results were expressed in µmol of Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> equivalent/g of dried extract (TEAC) by means of a calibration curve. The entire assay was performed with four replicate samples.
