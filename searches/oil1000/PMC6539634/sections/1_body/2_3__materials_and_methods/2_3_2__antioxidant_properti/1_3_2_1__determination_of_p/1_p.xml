<p class="p">A UFLC Shimadzu LC-20AD chromatograph (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a SIL-20AHT injector, a CNM-20A system controller, an SPD-M20A diode detector adjusted at 320 nm and an RP-18 Restek
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (4.6 × 250 mm ID, 5 µm) column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA) were used to determine phenolic acids. The mobile phase was methanol and water with the addition of 0.1% of acids (pH = 2.78) and a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The results were interpreted through calibration curves to determine chlorogenic, caffeic,
