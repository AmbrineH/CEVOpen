<p class="p">The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was performed through the method described by Ou et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], which consists in the measurement of 3 mL of fluorescence dilution containing the following: 21 µL from a 10 µM fluorescein dilution, 50 µL of 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) at 600 mM and 30 µL of the extract diluted with methanol. All of them were gauged to 3 mL with a buffer solution 75 µM of phosphate ion. The fluorescence was measured with a Perkin Elmer LS45
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The ORAC value was expressed as µmol of Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> equivalent/g of extract (TEAC) through a calibration curve employing different Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> concentrations.
