<p class="p">The antioxidant capacity was determined through the free radical scavenging method according to Brand-Williams [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] including some adaptations. The assay involved the reaction of 0.01 mL of extract dissolution with 0.99 mL of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) dissolution for 30 min at room temperature in the dark; then the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a Thermo Fisher Scientific
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Genesys 20 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA). The decrease of absorbance in respect to a DPPH reference (without antioxidant added) is related to the radical-reducing capacity of the extract. The results were expressed as a percentage of inhibition, %Inh, as in Equation (1), where A
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is DPPH absorbance after addition of an antioxidant, A
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of blank solution from the sample and A
 <sub class="sub">reference</sub> is the original absorbance of DPPH dissolution. Additionally, they are expressed in µmol of Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> equivalent/g of dried extract (TEAC) through a calibration curve. The entire assay was performed with one blank solution and four replicate samples. 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">%Inh = (1 − (A

  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>)/A
