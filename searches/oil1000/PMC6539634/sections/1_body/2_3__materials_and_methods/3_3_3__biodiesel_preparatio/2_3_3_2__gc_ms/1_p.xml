<p class="p">An Agilent 6890N
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> gas chromatographer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, USA) was used to characterize the FAME components of biodiesel, attached to it was a 5973N
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> selective mass detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA). This procedure was based on ASTM E 2997 [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Helium was used as carrier gas with an automatic splitless injection system and a 30-m long DB-1MS
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> column whose inner diameter measured 0.25 mm and had a film thickness of 0.25 µm. A 3 µL volume was injected. The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 and 300 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was settled at 70 °C for 2 min, and after that, it was heated on a temperature slope from 8 °C/min to 300 °C. The oven remained at 300 °C for 30 min. The chromatogram peaks were identified by means of the times of retention and atomic spectrum.
