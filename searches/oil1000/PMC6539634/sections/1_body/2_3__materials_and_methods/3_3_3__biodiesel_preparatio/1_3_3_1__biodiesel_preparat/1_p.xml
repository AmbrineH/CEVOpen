<p class="p">Biodiesel (B100) was prepared with commercial canola oil as raw product through alkaline catalysis with sodium methoxide 0.5 M and an oil:methoxide volumetric ratio 5:1. This method was selected due to its economic and technical advantages compared to acid and enzymatic catalysis. The canola oil was bought in a local supermarket in Medellin, Colombia in March 2018 and was immediately processed. Its composition was determined through the gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) analysis of the FAME as is described further. Transesterification was performed for 1 h with an agitation of 400 rpm at 60 °C. Once the reaction was finished, glycerol was separated by decantation and biodiesel was washed with deionized water in a volumetric ratio 3:1 of water to biodiesel. Biodiesel was dried at 100 °C and stored.</p>
