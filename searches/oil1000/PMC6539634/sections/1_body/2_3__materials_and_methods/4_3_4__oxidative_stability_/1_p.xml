<p class="p">Dilutions of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> extract in biodiesel were prepared in concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L. Additionally, a biodiesel sample without extract (B100) was set as blank. Samples of 30 mL were taken from each dissolution, and its oxidative stability was measured through the active oxygen method (AOM) with an aeration flow of 1150 mL/min at 100 ± 1 °C. The oxidation progress was monitored through peroxide value (PV) and higher heating value (HHV).
