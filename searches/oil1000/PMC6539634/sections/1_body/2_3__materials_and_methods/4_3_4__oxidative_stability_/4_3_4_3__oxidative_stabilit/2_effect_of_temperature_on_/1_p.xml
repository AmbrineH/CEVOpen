<p class="p">According to the Arrhenius equation, the formation of FAME degradation products is related to the inverse of the temperature, as shown in Equation (2):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">1/OSI = A × exp((−Ea)/RT),
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where OSI is the induction time in h, A is the Arrhenius constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, Ea is the activation energy, and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K).
