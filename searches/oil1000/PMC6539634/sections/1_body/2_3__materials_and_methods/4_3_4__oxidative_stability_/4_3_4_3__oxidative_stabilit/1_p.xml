<p class="p">The oxidative stability index (OSI) was determined using a Metrohm Rancimat 679
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). Four samples of 3 g of biodiesel were used: three samples with a concentration of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L of antioxidant and a blank solution, and each sample was deposited in the reaction vials. These underwent a bubbling airflow of 10 L/h. The exit stream dragging the volatile material was transported into tubes with deionized water, where the conductivity was monitored. The OSI was defined as the time in which FAME degradation products increase water conductivity, also called induction time. The assay was carried out at 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C.
