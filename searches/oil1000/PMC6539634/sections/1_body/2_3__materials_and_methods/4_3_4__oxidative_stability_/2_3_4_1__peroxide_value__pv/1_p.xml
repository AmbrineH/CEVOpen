An amount of 0.3 g of oil was taken from each of the oil samples; these were agitated in a vortex until diluted in 3.5 mL of a mix consisting of seven parts chloroform to three parts methanol. A 500 µL aliquot was taken from the resulting blend and added 25 µL of a dissolution containing 0.144 M of FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-7H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and BaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in HCl 0.4 M and 25 µL of NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>SCN 0.44 M. This solution was agitated afterward and allowed to stand for 10 min in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 500 nm with a Thermo Scientific, Multiskan Spectrum
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and was compared to a calibration curve which had known concentrations of Fe
 <sup class="sup">+3</sup>. A higher absorbance means a higher presence of Fe
 <sup class="sup">+3</sup>, therefore, a higher PV. Additionally, the change of color to red is evidence of a high PV. Peroxide value was expressed as milliequivalents of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg of sample (meO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg). The entire assay was performed by triplicate.
