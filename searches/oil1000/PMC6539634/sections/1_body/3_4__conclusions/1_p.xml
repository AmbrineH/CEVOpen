<p class="p">A vegetable extract was obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> by maceration using methanol. The results of the DPPH, FRAP and ORAC methods showed that the extract performs as an antioxidant in biodiesel. The antioxidant capacity through the ORAC method was higher than that obtained by the DPPH method. A probable cause of this is the oversize of many molecules located in extracts, such as phenolic acids, terpenes, and flavonoids, that does not allow them to scavenge small radicals like DPPH. The FAME of biodiesel were identified and quantified through a GC-MS, and they are suitable to perform oxidative stability assays because the unsaturated FAME are more prone to oxidation than saturated ones due to its chemical composition. On the AOM assay, the PV of biodiesel samples with 250 mg/L of antioxidant remained low after 20 h and extended 3.79 times the necessary time to reach a PV of 100 meO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg. It indicates that biodiesel did not start the exponential phase of peroxide generation with the antioxidant addition. Biodiesel OSI was measured, and although it did not accomplish the standard minimum, it was possible to overreach the requirements of the standards due to the addition of the antioxidant. The HHV was not affected for AOM assay conditions in the samples with antioxidant added. Despite in this work, the antioxidant was assessed only on canola oil biodiesel, it is expected a similar effect on the oxidative stability of biodiesel from other sources with a high concentration of unsaturated FAME. The most outstanding feature of this research is the fact that 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> extract is a natural and green alternative to synthetic antioxidants such as TBHQ and BHA. This extract is a useful, relatively abundant and renewable resource. The use of the methanolic 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> extract in biodiesel improves its low oxidative stability and extends its storage shelf life.
