 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01786-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> is a plant species whose extracts could be used as an antioxidant for biodiesel. It belongs to the Zygophyllales order and the Zygophillaceae family. It is a green bush of medium height with leaflets of 15 Ã— 8 mm and has brightly yellow-colored solitary flowers of up to 2.5 cm in diameter that bear oval white velvety fruits. 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> is located in the arid zones of northern Mexico and the southern U.S., at an altitude of up to 1800 m above mean sea level. Its most noted characteristics are its resistance to desiccation and intense odor, along with its ability to displace other species by aggressive competition and a nearly complete absence of natural enemies. It has been commonly named creosote bush and gobernadora in Spanish, due to its abundance in desert areas, mainly in Baja California, Mexico [
