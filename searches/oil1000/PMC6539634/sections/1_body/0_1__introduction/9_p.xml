<p class="p">Therefore, the antioxidant properties of the methanol extract from the 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> plant were evaluated in this work, picked up from the Valley of Mexicali, in the Colorado River Delta. The antioxidant properties of the extract were determined by the free radical scavenging method (DPPH), the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), together with its phenol content by Folinâ€“Ciocalteu procedure. Once it was finished, the extract was used as an antioxidant in low concentrations. The aim of this article was to assess the 
 <italic class="italic">L. tridentata</italic> methanolic extract as a green antioxidant in canola biodiesel. The antioxidant effect on biodiesel oxidative stability was evaluated by peroxide value (PV) monitoring, change in higher heating value (HHV) and the oxidative stability index (OSI). The tests performed in the current work are presented in
