<p class="p">Biofuels can be found in solid, liquid or gas form. Biodiesel is one of the most used liquid biofuels. It is a fuel composed of fatty acid alkyl esters mix, typically methyl (FAME) or ethyl esters. It is obtained from transesterification of fatty acids with short-chain alcohols in the presence of a catalyst, (usually an alkaline), with glycerol as a by-product.</p>
