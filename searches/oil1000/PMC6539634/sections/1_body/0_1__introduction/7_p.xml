 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. An antioxidant is described as a substance capable of inhibiting, delaying or interrupting any of the previously mentioned reactions [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight the use of green inhibitors and inhibitors from natural sources, such as caffeic acid to inhibit corrosion [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] or commercial rosemary extract to increase the oxidative stability of biodiesel or other oils [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Many of the substances present in extracts and essential oils can act as antioxidants. They have one or more aromatic rings, hydroxyl groups, electrons in resonance or ionizable protons within their molecular structure, each of them capable of interrupting the previously described reactions [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01786" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These allow the molecule of interest, in this case the biodiesel, to stay stable for a longer time.
