 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01786-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a), carbonyl radicals are made after a proton in the alkyl chain of biodiesel is removed by an initiator ion, a metallic catalyst, thermal stress or light. Generally, chains with one or more unsaturated bonds can be more susceptible to this process [
