Secondary oxidation can be performed after this stage, where those degradation products can be oxidized until they produce aldehydes, ketones and short-chain fatty acids, the ones responsible for biodiesel acidity increase. Additionally, the reactions of secondary polymerization affect the rheological properties of biodiesel. There are many analytic methods and standards for the measurement of the oxidative stability of biofuel. Some of the most noted are the Rancimat method, the thermogravimetric analysis and the measurement of different parameters that prove the production of biodiesel degradation products, among which peroxide value stands out [
