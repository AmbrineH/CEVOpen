<p class="p">Biodiesel is obtained from different materials such as vegetable oils or animal fats, e.g., canola oil, castor oil, jatropha, soybean, waste vegetable oil, lard, tallow, yellow grease, among others. The chemical composition of the biodiesel varies according to the feedstock used for its production. Biodiesel is produced often with non-edible raw oils because it does not compete with the food production, thereby it can be considered a non-toxic, sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to diesel. However, these beneficial qualities can also be a disadvantage for biodiesel itself. Besides its incompatibility with certain materials [
