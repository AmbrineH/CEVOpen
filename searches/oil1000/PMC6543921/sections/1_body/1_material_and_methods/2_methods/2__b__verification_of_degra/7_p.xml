<p class="p">The HF formation promotes such reactive changes due to its high enthalpy of formation (âˆ’271 kJ/mol). The HF molecule can serve as a marker for both reaction types. For the HF detection, it must be extracted from the PFO with purified water in the first step in the volume ratio 10 (PFO) to 1 (water) in order to detect it later in the aqueous phase by determining the pH change (qualitative measure) and determining the fluoride content using fluoride-sensitive electrodes (quantitative measure).</p>
