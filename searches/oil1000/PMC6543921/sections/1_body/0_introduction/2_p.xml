<p class="p">Serious toxic complications reported in 2015 after the intraocular use of PFO-batches produced by the Alamedics company (Dornstadt, Germany) were investigated and documented intensively.

The H-value is a quality parameter for fluorinated compounds in which, ideally, all hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms (PFCL). It indicates the concentration of the defective remaining hydrogen atoms. Its determination is carried out in two steps. Hydrogene fluoride (HF) is split off by a chemical transformation targeting precisely the residual protons. This is quantified potentiometrically in a subsequent analysis step. It should be performed as a limit test. The acceptance criterion should be “practically free from,” that means less than or equal to the detection limit (10 ppm).
