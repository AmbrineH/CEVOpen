However, the relation between OH content and the leachables' content to the cytotoxicity observed in vitro remained vague. Due to large differences in the type and concentration of impurities in the affected batches, the need arose for a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of all impurities in order to provide a scientifically sound basis for general specifications. Also note that the impurities are dissolved in PFO and must first pass the interface to the tissue to be able to penetrate and interact with the ocular tissue and thus develop their toxic effect. Therefore, the purpose of our investigations focused on analyzing exactly those Alamedics PFO-batches (Ala
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>octa) involved in the reported cases and available in their original condition. Our analyses were carried out in three steps: (1) characterization of impurities using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC/MS); (2) verification of the degradation of reactive underfluorinated impurities by testing HF content; and (3) extraction experiments to test in vivo the effect of conditions favoring tissue penetration on PFO impurity profiles.
