<p class="p">After decades using perfluorinated liquids (PFCL) successfully in vitreoretinal surgery, there have been repeated reports of retinal toxicity caused by individual batches and different manufacturers of these products since 2013. It is important to distinguish between acute toxicity and long-term tolerability. The reported symptoms describe acute toxic reactions that differ completely from the known side effects and tissue changes during long-term ophthalmological perfluorooctane (PFO) use.
