 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>octa batches we investigated differ significantly in terms of their individual impurity groups. It should be emphasized that the batches' impurity profiles may change during their shelf life due to reactions among the reactive underfluorinated compounds. Pharmaceutical processing steps involving the impact of energy can trigger such changes. This may be one reason for the significant differences between batches derived from the same raw materials.
