<p class="p">The time-dependent differences in the cytotoxic effect of the batches tested can be explained by differences in the amount of reactive underfluorinated impurities and varying HF content, as this ratio is unstable over time. Therefore, the detection of both acute and latently toxic impurities of this type, using the so-called H-value as the limit test, plays an important role when characterizing a safe PFO-endotamponade.
