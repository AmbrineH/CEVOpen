<p class="p">This raises the question of whether the current regulations and standards now in force are in fact being adequately and legally enforced. In this context, the current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and Conformité Européenne markings on medical devices in Europe are subject to particular criticism. In these discussions, however, there is often too little distinction drawn between the measures taken to set specific parameters and the steps necessary gaining approval based on fulfilling those parameters (determination of specifications) and for ensuring that the products conform to specifications, that is, that all batches being routinely produced are also in conformity with the specifications and fully comply with approval requirements. The relevant parameters and their determination are set out in the standards of the ISO series. The approval requirements themselves and the requirement for the products' compliance are currently regulated in the Medical Device Direction in Europe. From 2020, the much stricter Medical Device Regulations regulations will apply. One essential regulation is that new risks and findings be identified through continuous market observation, and that they be incorporated within the specifications and standards.</p>
