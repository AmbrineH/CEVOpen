<p class="p">We place this work in this context. There is strong evidence that all detected impurities can be plausibly traced back to the manufacturing of raw materials and their further processing. Applying a risk-based approach, this must be reflected in appropriate specifications with appropriate limits both for the PFO-specific impurities and for those impurities that may contaminate the product through the production of specific dosage forms. Only after separating all impurities, in particular those of reactive underfluorinated impurities, can the batches' stability be achieved and their toxicity (and all other unwanted side reactions) be completely avoided. Our revelation of the different chemical constitutions of individual impurity groups shows that this is only achievable by combining different purification steps that consider the impurities' various chemical properties and are adapted to them.</p>
