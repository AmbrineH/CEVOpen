 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-f05" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> illustrates our assignment of compounds to the group of reactive underfluorinated impurities. Identification is made by comparing the chromatograms before and after the chemical conversion of these impurities by reacting with strong bases, as required to measure the H-value (equation 1).
