<p class="p">Accordingly, for 1H-PFO, Perfluoro-2-n-butyltetrahydrofurane, ethylbenzene, dimethylbenzene, methyl-perfluorooctanoate, PFOA, and 1H,1H,7H dodecafluoro-1-heptanol we proved their contamination burden in the PFO samples by comparison with appropriate reference substances. Their concentrations were determined via an external standard method. Those findings are summarized in 
 <xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-t03" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. FT-IR measurements had to be used for the corresponding PFOA analysis. In addition to the absolute values, their relative ratios were also provided to enable a straightforward comparison with the semiquantitative values stated by Pastor et al.
 <xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b03" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> We confirmed that the majority of the batches investigated contained very similar PFOA levels of despite varying degrees of cell growth inhibition. No obvious dose-dependence was detected.
