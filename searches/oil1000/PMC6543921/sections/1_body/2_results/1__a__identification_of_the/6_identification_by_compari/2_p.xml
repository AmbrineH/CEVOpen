<p class="p">In the case of perfluoroalkanoic acid derivatives, note that three peaks with different retention times were assigned to that compound type. This is due to the fact that these are three representatives of the same compound class whose mass spectra all share the same characteristic fragments (key fragments). Only one of them was identifiable when relying on reference standards (methyl-perfluorooctanoate). Traces of PFOA itself are not detectable with GC/MS.</p>
