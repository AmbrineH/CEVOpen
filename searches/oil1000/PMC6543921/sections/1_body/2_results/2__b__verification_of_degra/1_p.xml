 <sup class="sup">®</sup>octa batches. HF as a marker of reactive underfluorinated impurities was detected by determining ionic fluoride (F
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) in extracts and their pH values. Note that the free acid PFOA also contributes significantly to the pH value, but no free fluoride is formed by the extraction of the acid with water.
