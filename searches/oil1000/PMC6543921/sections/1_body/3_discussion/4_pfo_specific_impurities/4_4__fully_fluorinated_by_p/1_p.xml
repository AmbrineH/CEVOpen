<p class="p">For the sake of completeness, the fully fluorinated by-products of PFO production should also be mentioned; their chemical structure is so closely related to PFO and their properties so similar that they are difficult to separate from one another. This type of impurity is practically unavoidable in perfluorination reactions. Gervits stated in the 1990s that such by-products pose no risk to medical applications.
