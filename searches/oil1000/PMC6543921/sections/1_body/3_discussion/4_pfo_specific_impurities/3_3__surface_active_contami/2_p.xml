<p class="p">They may belong to both the group of reactive underfluorinated compounds and the group of nonreactive underfluorinated compounds. An essential characteristic of this impurity group is its amphiphilic character, that is, the impurities interact with media of different polarity and hydrophilicity/lipophilicity. The surface activity may vary from surface-modifying action (1-H-perfluoroalkanes) to real surfactant behaviors (derivatives of perfluoroalkanoic acids).</p>
