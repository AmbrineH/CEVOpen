<p class="p">The perfluoroalkanoic acid derivatives, including the acids themselves, play a special role. On the one hand, their effect as a strong surface-modifying substance must be taken into account and assigned accordingly to this group of impurities. On the other hand, they have a perfluorinated molecule part that can contain incompletely fluorinated positions in the fluorine chain due to the production process. Therefore, corresponding impurities must also be classified in the group of reactive, incompletely fluorinated impurities, and the reactions described above involving HF formation must be expected. In addition, in the case of free acids, the immediate corrosive action of the acid group must be taken into account. In contrast to HF, these acids must be classified as strong acids. The undesirable side effects of this class of substances are that they lower the interfacial tension against water, leading to an associated increase in interaction with tissue and enhanced penetration of lipophilic molecules; they also function as an adhesion promoter by interaction between the silicone oil and retinal surface (stickiness) during a subsequent silicone oil tamponade.
