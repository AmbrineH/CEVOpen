<p class="p">There is a dependency between the detected concentration of fluoride (F
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’</sup>, detected with fluoride sensitive electrodes) in the extracts and the cell growth inhibition induced by these batches. HF is dissolved in PFO undissociated as a lipophilic molecule. While the transition of HF from the PFO into the eye's aqueous environment is associated with dissociation and is thus limited by the dissociation equilibrium, its transition into lipophilic media (demonstrated here with olive oil) takes place rapidly and nearly completely already in a single extraction step. As a result, the small HF molecule can quickly penetrate tissue. This HF property has long been known, and it is the worst effect in case of skin contact.

On the one hand, these compounds are a source for the resulting HF; on the other hand, they exert a toxic effect themselves.
