<p class="p">In this context, the corrosive effect of the impurities presents as acids (HF, PFOA) must be particularly considered. The concentrations found in the individual batches are different, and the measured pH values are due to the contribution of both acids. Although the corrosive effect or dose-dependent damage to tissue
