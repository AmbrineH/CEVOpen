<p class="p">The damaging mechanisms, such as inhibition of the enzymatic system by HF, its long-lasting penetration into deeper tissue layers, and damage along vascular and neuronal structures seem to be of particular interest in view of the symptoms of retinal toxicity reported after the use of contaminated PFO batches.
