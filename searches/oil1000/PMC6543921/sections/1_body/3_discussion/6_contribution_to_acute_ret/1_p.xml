<p class="p">Due to their different chemical composition and content (see 
 <xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-t03" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-t05" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), the risks and side effects of the contamination groups differ. This is particularly relevant for their toxic potential. The reactive underfluorinated compounds (1) cause acute cytotoxic reactions due to their own toxic effect (especially when they contain double bonds) and the formation of HF already in the ppm range. An additional particular hazard potential lies in the fact that they can show both immediate and delayed (latent, depot) effects, depending on their reactivity.
