<p class="p">The cavitation number, computed according to Equation (1) and the method mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-foods-08-00065" class="xref">Section 2.1</xref>, was in the range of 0.3 to 1.1 in both tests SFN_T1 and SFN_T2, thus falling in the range of developed cavitation, as defined in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-foods-08-00065" class="xref">Section 2.1</xref>. Based on the estimated average flow (330 L/min), and the water volume (120 L), the average frequency of passages through the cavitation reactor was about 2.75 per min.
