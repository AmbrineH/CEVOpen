<p class="p">Later on, in SFN_T1, with the further unconditioned heating to 47 °C (45 min of process time), the respective TPC increased abruptly by nearly 100%, up to 0.12 mgGAE/mL, then oscillating between 0.10 and 0.14 mgGAE/mL up to the temperature of 67.5 °C, reached after 90 min of process time. In SFN_T2, during the 30 min of isothermal step at the temperature of 43°C, TPC increased further, up to the level of 0.13 mgGAE/mL, achieved after 60 min of total process time.</p>
