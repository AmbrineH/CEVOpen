<p class="p">In SFN_T2, the evolution of the total phenolic content exhibited a rapidly growing trend during the unconditioned heating step during the first 30 min, doubling to 0.10 mgGAE/mL with temperature rising from 33 °C (after 5 min of process time) up to 43 °C. In SFN_T2, the growth in TPC was insignificant up to the temperature of 40 °C. This result could be due to slightly higher working temperatures in SFN_T2.</p>
