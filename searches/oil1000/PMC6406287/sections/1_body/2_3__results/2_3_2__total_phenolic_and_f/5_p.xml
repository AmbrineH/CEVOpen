<p class="p">The evolution of the total flavonoids content exhibits very similar, strong and significant growing trends during the unconditioned heating step in the first 30 min, up to the temperature of 40 °C for SFN_T1 (with 0.30 mgCE/mL), and 43 °C for SFN_T2 (with 0.32 mgCE/mL). Later on, in SFN_T2, during the 30 min of isothermal step at the temperature of 43 °C, TFC kept on growing almost linearly in time, up to 0.43 mgCE/mL (60 min of process time), and no evidence of peak arose. In SFN_T1, the TFC growth paused when temperature increased from 40 °C to 47 °C, then grew again, almost linearly in time, up to the level of 0.55 mgCE/mL, achieved at the temperature of 67.5 °C (90 min of total process time), again without an apparent peak.</p>
