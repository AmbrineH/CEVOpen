<p class="p">Based on the above, the aqueous extracts produced by means of the hydrodynamic cavitation process, absent any preservative additives, fully retained the antioxidant activity towards lipid oxidation, at least up to nine days after processing, and its decay is relatively moderate even after 48 days. Conversely, the ability to scavenge peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals dropped very quickly, though it was still observable after 48 days.</p>
