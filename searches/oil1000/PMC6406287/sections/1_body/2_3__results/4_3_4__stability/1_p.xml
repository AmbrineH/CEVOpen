<p class="p">Aimed at assessing the time stability of the silver fir needles aqueous solutions, the TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ORAC levels were measured again, for both tests SFN_T1 and SFN_T2, 47 days and eight days later, respectively. Although other choices would have been possible, the samples collected after 60 min of process time, in each test, were selected for the stability assessment, because they corresponded to the maximum antioxidant activity, both DPPH and ORAC, in SFN_T2; the second peak level of the ORAC, and moderate DPPH in SFN_T1. Moreover, those samples shared the same process time. It is recalled that the operational temperatures after 60 min of process time were 54 °C in SFN_T1, and 43 °C in SFN_T2.</p>
