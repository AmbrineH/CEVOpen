<p class="p">With regard to the antioxidant activity, two striking and contrasting features arose. The antioxidant activity measured by the ORAC assay decreased to less than 30% of its level in day 1 in SFN_T1, and to less than 20% in SFN_T2, despite the shorter time lapse between the observations in the latter case. The IC50 dose for the DPPH assay increased by 50% compared to its level in day 1 in SFN_T1 and did not change in SFN_T2.</p>
