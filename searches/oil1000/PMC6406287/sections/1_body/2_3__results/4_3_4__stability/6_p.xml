<p class="p">With regard to total phenolics and total flavonoids, the results are relatively uniform across the two tests, showing comparable relative drops in the respective concentrations, once the different time lapses are considered, as well as a continuous decay in time after samples production. Apparently, the HC process did dot damage or denature the compounds responsible for the DPPH antioxidant activity, either polyphenols, flavonoids, or others, such as essential oils, at the condition of limiting the process temperatures, a safe level for the latter being somewhere between 43 and 47 Â°C.</p>
