<p class="p">The preliminary conclusion can be drawn, that ORAC levels were very sensitive to the temperature, yet differently from DPPH. Indeed, ORAC levels increased with temperature in the approximate range 40 to 60 °C, suddenly dropping with further heating. The ORAC levels also showed a stronger increase with cavitation time at the temperature of 43 °C; the investigation of such dependence on cavitation time at other temperature levels in the aforementioned range should be a subject for further research. Moreover, limited to SFN_T2, the concentration of total phenolics and total flavonoids showed accurate correlations with the ORAC levels, in the temperature range 31.5 to 43 °C, as well as during the isothermal step at the latter temperature level.</p>
