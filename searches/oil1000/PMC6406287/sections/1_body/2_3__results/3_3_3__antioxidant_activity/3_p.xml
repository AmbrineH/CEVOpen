 <xref rid="foods-08-00065-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), the DPPH assay showed a decrease of the respective IC50 level (increase of the antioxidant activity) from the temperature of 40 °C to 47 °C (45 min of process time), down to the lowest level of 10.1 μg/mL. Since then, the DPPH antioxidant activity collapsed exponentially, with the respective IC50 level rising to about 351 μg/mL at the temperature of 67.5 °C (90 min of process time). Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00065-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, the evolution of the DPPH antioxidant activity seemed to reflect the TPC trend up to the temperature of 47 °C, then it decoupled from the latter at higher temperatures. No relationships arose with the flavonoids concentration shown in
