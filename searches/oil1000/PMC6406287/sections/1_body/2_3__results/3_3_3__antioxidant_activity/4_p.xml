<p class="p">In SFN_T2 (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00065-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), the DPPH assay showed a relatively low value of the IC50 level after just 5 min of process time, followed by a moderate decrease (increase of antioxidant activity), but only up to the temperature of 37.5 °C. During the isothermal step at the temperature of 43 °C, a further decrease of the IC50 level occurred during the first 15 min, later stabilizing below 15 μg/mL. Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00065-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b, the evolution of the DPPH antioxidant activity did not seem to reflect strictly either the TPC or TFC trends, beyond the fact that all three quantities showed a sustained increase (except for DPPH’s IC50 level during the latter part of the process).
