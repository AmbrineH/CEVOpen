<p class="p">Moreover, the concentration of total phenolics showed a moderate correlation with the DPPH antioxidant activity, which is not simple to elucidate. Some authors claimed that phenolic compounds are not the only factors responsible for the antioxidant activity, with other phytochemicals (e.g., carotenoids, terpenes, reducing carbohydrates, and essential oils) potentially affecting the total antioxidant activity. As well, other factors could affect the antioxidant properties of a compound, such as possible synergistic and antagonistic effects among additional components, interactions between the physical environment of the sample and the phenolic compounds, or the activity of specific phenolic compounds that were not suitably determined [
