 <xref rid="foods-08-00065-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), the ORAC assay showed stable levels from 5 to 15 min of process time (temperature increase from 33 to 37.5 °C), followed by a sharp increase (more than doubling) in the next 15 min (up to the temperature of 43 °C). Then, in the isothermal step at the temperature of 43 °C, a further remarkable growth of the antioxidant activity occurred, with no apparent peak. At the end of the process, the level of the ORAC antioxidant activity was much greater than the peak level observed in SFN_T1 (about 840 vs. 585 μMTE/L). Based on
