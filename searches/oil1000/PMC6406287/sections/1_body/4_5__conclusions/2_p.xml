<p class="p">This study could open a new field of application for controlled HC processes, with potential for practical developments, due to high efficacy, energy and resource use efficiency, as well as straightforward scalability. These properties were the main drivers of several recent and successful implementations of HC processes at the pilot and industrial scale, e.g., in the fields of water heating [
