<p class="p">Last, in this study, both DPPH and ORAC antioxidant activities were measured in vitro. Further research should address the in vivo effectivity of the aqueous solutions of fir needles, produced by means of HC processes, e.g., towards the prevention of lipid oxidation in storage foods, stimulation of plant growth, and fortification of beverages, the latter along with the investigation of the effects on the human health, including the bioavailability issue. In this regard, innovative assays could be considered, to measure the antioxidant activity of food extracts, based on the generation of physiological radical species [
