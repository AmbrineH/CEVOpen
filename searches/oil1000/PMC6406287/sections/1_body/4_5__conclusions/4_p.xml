<p class="p">The DPPH antioxidant activity of aqueous solutions was shown to be remarkably dependent on solution pH (higher in less acidic media), and on the nature and concentration of metal ions [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. A similar dependence can be expected for silver fir needles water extracts, including dependence on the properties of further liquids in which it should be diluted (e.g., in the case of fortification of mineral waters or other beverages, including alcoholic ones). Further research along this direction is therefore recommended. As well, the dose-dependency of the aqueous solution properties should be investigated (only one concentration level was used in this study).
