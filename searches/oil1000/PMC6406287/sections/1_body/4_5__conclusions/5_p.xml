<p class="p">As pointed out in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-foods-08-00065" class="xref">Section 3.4</xref>., it is likely that ORAC-related compounds are much more unstable in time than DPPH-related compounds; more generally, the relationship between antioxidant activity, either DPPH or ORAC, and the functional compounds extracted from silver fir needles, needs further investigation. Such recommendation has already been suggested, limited to the ORAC antioxidant activity, in relation to the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00065-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Thus, further research is urged, about the accurate, quantitative analysis of the composition of the aqueous solutions, e.g., polyphenols, flavonoids, and essential oils, extracted by means of the method proposed in this study.
