<p class="p">Another direction for further research could concern the additivation of silver fir needles water extracts with preservative agents, such as citric acid or related formulations [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], aimed at the stabilization in time of the antioxidant activity. The additivation with pectin from natural sources could also be useful, due to its emulsifying properties, potentially leading to stable encapsulation of essential oils [
