<p class="p">Most of the studies focused on essential oils extracted from parts of fir plants by means of different techniques, such as steam distillation (the dominant technique), maceration, solvent extraction, cold pressing, supercritical fluids, rectification, enfleurage (use of odourless animal or vegetable fats), solid phase extraction, etc. [

On the other hand, the extraction of phenolic compounds made use of solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate, which are potentially hazardous for the human health, often mixed with different proportions of water [

Beyond the inherent complexity, and the use (and subsequent removal) of potentially harmful chemicals, such selective extraction techniques need high processing temperatures, and long process times. Few phytochemical and biological studies focused also on aqueous extracts, showing interesting findings, which are especially relevant to this study.
