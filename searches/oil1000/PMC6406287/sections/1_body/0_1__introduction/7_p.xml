<p class="p">In this study, for the first time, a solvent-free, fast, unselective, scalable extraction process was tested for its potential to produce aqueous solutions based on silver fir (

Beyond the resulting biologically relevant properties, the manufacturing process of the aqueous solutions is very important, in particular the respective scalability and cost, conditioning the overall feasibility, as well as the affordability of the final product.
