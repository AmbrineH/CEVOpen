<p class="p">In most of the studies shortly discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-foods-08-00065" class="xref">Appendix B</xref>, the aqueous solutions including fir parts were manufactured by means of relatively complex processes. They included pulverization of the raw material, extraction in water (also tap water) by means of different techniques, concentration by drying (e.g., vacuum drying), sometimes filtering and/or lyophilisation, and finally, dispersion of the resulting material in tap or distilled water.
