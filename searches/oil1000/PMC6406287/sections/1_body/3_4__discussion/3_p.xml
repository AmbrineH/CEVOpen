<p class="p">The ORAC antioxidant activity levels for the aqueous solutions obtained in this study, from HC processing of 
 <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> needles, were hard to compare with data obtained from other studies, due to scarce literature. In particular, very few data exist about the ORAC levels of aqueous solutions, such as beverages, while plenty of data are available, referred to the unit mass of several functional substances.
