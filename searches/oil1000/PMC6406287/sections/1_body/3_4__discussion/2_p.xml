 <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> twigs and needles, and aqueous extracts from coniferous trees. Despite the relatively wide variability in the published levels of DPPH IC50, even for the same reference substances [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], the respective lowest level of DPPH IC50, achieved in the performed HC-driven tests, competed even with the lower values reported for ascorbic acid, quercetin, and catechin. It was also significantly lower than any other results, including the considered synthetic antioxidant, the essential oils, and other extracts.
