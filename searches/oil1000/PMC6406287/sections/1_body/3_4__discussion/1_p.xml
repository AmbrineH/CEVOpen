<p class="p">The observed levels of the in vitro antioxidant activity of the samples extracted during the performed tests highlight the very good potential of the HC process for the creation of aqueous solutions, endowed with bioactive compounds extracted from silver fir needles. In test SFN_T1, the activity towards DPPH radicals, measured the day after the test (
