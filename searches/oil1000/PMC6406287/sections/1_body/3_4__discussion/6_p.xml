 <xref rid="foods-08-00065-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, including the propagation of the respective uncertainties. These data tell an interesting story, with key points summarized as follows:
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The ORAC to TPC levels found in this study increased with cavitation time, with the SFN_T2 sample collected after 60 min exhibiting both the highest ORAC level and the highest ORAC to TPC level, which could suggest the HC ability to extract more and more functional polyphenols, likely bound in the raw material, during the process.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The highest ORAC to TPC level found in this study was comparable with most of the respective levels found for the considered commercial beverages, and it is likely to increase further with longer and/or optimized cavitation process.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The ORAC levels achieved in this study are likely to increase also after increasing the concentration of the raw material added to water, which was very low in this study; however, the dose-dependency over the ORAC antioxidant activity needs specific investigation.</p>
