<p class="p">The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay measures the scavenging of peroxyl as well as of hydroxyl radicals, and has been successfully applied to the assessment of antioxidant species in human plasma [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The ORAC measurement method was adapted from a previous work [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The instrument was a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Cary Eclipse, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The sample (150 μL) was added to a free-radical generator (AAPH, 2, 2′-azobis (2-aminopropane) dihydrochloride) (75 μL), and the inhibition of the free radicals was measured. Fluorescein (2.74 mL) was used as a target for free-radical attack. The exciting wavelength was 490 nm and the emission wavelength was 512 nm. Total antioxidant capacity, as measured by ORAC, was obtained using Equation (3):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">ORAC = 20·k·(S
  <sub class="sub">s</sub> − S
  <sub class="sub">b</sub>)/(S
  <sub class="sub">Trolox</sub>−S
  <sub class="sub">b</sub>)
  <label class="label">(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where k is the dilution factor, S
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> is the area under curve area of the sample, S
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> is the area of the blank under the curve, and S
 <sub class="sub">Trolox</sub> is the area of the standard (Trolox, 1 μM, 150 μL) under the curve. ORAC values were expressed as μM Trolox equivalents per Liter of aqueous solution (µMTE/L), using the standard curve established previously. Each analysis was performed in triplicate.
