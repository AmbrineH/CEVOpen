<p class="p">TPC was expressed as mg of Gallic acid equivalent per mL of aqueous solution (mgGAE/mL). A reference curve was prepared with Gallic acid concentration ranging from 0.1 mg/mL to 0.5 mg/mL, and the solutions read at the wavelengths of 715, 730, and 760 nm. Three curves were built, and the best fitting one, with R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9995, was the one corresponding to 730 nm, which was therefore assumed as the standard curve.
