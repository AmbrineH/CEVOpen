<p class="p">The radical scavenging activity was calculated by the percentage of DPPH that was scavenged, using Equation (2):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">% Reduction = [(AB − AE)/AB]·100
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where AB is the absorbance of the blank sample, while AE is the absorbance of the water extracts. The Effective Concentration values (IC50), defined as the amount of antioxidant required to scavenge DPPH radicals by 50%, were calculated from the results, and expressed as μg per mL of aqueous solution (µg/mL). Each analysis was performed in triplicate.
