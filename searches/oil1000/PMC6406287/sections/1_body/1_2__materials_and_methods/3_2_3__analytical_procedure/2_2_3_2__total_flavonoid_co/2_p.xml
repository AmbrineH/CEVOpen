<p class="p">TFC was expressed as mg of catechin equivalent (CE) per mL of aqueous solution (mgCE/mL), using an equation obtained by standard calibration graph with (+)-catechin. A reference curve was prepared with catechin concentration ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 mg/mL, and solutions were read at the wavelengths of 500, 510, and 530 nm. Three curves were built, and the best one with R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9998 was the one corresponding to 510 nm, which was therefore assumed as the standard curve.
