<p class="p">Two tests were performed, hereinafter referred to as Silver Fir Needles—Test 1 (SFN_T1) and Silver Fir Needles—Test 2 (SFN_T2), both using 120 L of tap water as the only solvent, as well as carried out under atmospheric pressure. The test SFN_T1 used the first needles sample, while the test SFN_T2 used the second sample, therefore the silver fir needles were mixed with tap water in concentrations of 0.44% (
