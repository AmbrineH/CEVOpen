<p class="p">The first needles sample was extracted the day after the harvesting, with a water content of 30%; since its mass was 0.756 kg, the dry weight was 0.529 kg. The second needles sample was extracted from the same homogenous batch, 40 days after the harvesting, during which the batch was kept at a constant temperature of 30 ± 1 °C, resulting in a water content of 2%. The mass of the second needles sample was 0.540 kg, resulting in the same dry weight as the first sample, i.e., 0.529 kg.</p>
