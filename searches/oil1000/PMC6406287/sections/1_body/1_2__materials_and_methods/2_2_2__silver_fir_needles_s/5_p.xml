<p class="p">The whole needles were mixed with water in the HC device from the beginning of each test, with SFN_T1 undergoing unconditioned heating from 27 °C to 67.5 °C during 90 min, resulting from the balance between the mechanical energy supplied by the pump impeller and the heat loss through the uninsulated walls of the hydraulic circuit. In SFN_T2, the heating was unconditioned from 31.5 °C up to the temperature of 43 °C, during 30 min, then a further isothermal step was carried out at 43 °C during 30 min, with cooling water flowing in a jacket surrounding the HC device to remove the excess heat.</p>
