<p class="p">The main metric of HC processes, i.e., the cavitation number (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), was defined long ago [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It is a dimensionless parameter, derived from Bernoulli’s equation, and representing the ratio between the pressure drop needed to achieve vaporization, and the specific kinetic energy at the cavitation inception section, as per Equation (1):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">σ = (P
  <sub class="sub">0</sub> − P
  <sub class="sub">v</sub>)/(0.5·ρ·u
  <sup class="sup">2</sup>)
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where P
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (Nm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) is the average recovered pressure downstream of a cavitation reactor, such as a Venturi tube or an orifice plate, where cavitation bubbles collapse. Since the fluid was not pressurized, P
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> was assumed equal to the atmospheric pressure. P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub> (Nm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) is the liquid vapor pressure (a function of the average temperature for any given liquid). ρ (kgm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) is the liquid density, and u (ms
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) is the flow velocity through the nozzle of the cavitation reactor, the latter also depending on the pump’s inlet pressure. In this study, the values of the cavitation number during the processes were computed according to the available data, such as temperature and pump discharge; the latter were retrieved based on the consumed power, as explained in a previous study [
