However, under certain conditions, easily achievable with Venturi-shaped reactors, developed cavitation, with strong and frequent collapses of the cavitation bubbles, arises whenever the cavitation number falls within the range 0.1 to 1, and even at greater values in the presence of solid particles or dissolved gases [
