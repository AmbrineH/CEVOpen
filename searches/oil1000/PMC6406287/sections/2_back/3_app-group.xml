  <p class="p">The large variability observed in the bioactive properties of extracts from 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> can be ascribed to the corresponding variability of the compounds and chemical properties, in turn related to the collection period, the stage of growth, the geographical location, the environmental conditions and ecological factors, as well as to the genetic diversity. For example, silver firs growing in Southern Europe revealed higher genetic diversity than other European regions [
   <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>].
  </p>
  <p class="p">The composition of essential oils (EOs) extracted from silver fir needles exhibits a remarkable variability through the growing regions, environmental conditions, plant age and season, as well as genetic variability. 
   <xref rid="foods-08-00065-t0A1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table A1</xref> shows the range of concentrations of the main constituents of the EOs, drawn from few studies [
   <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
   <xref rid="B62-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
   <xref rid="B63-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
   <xref rid="B64-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]; based on the same studies, EOs represent between 0.77 and 0.92% 
   <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
   <italic class="italic">w</italic> (dry matter) of silver fir needles total biomass.
  </p>
  <p class="p">Although most of EOs constituents show bioactive properties, limonene (PubChem CID: 440917), a monoterpene, was likely the most studied. Limonene is endowed with a wide-spectrum of antimicrobial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, finding countless applications in the cosmetic and food industries, in the latter ones for both nutraceutical and anti-spoiling purposes [
   <xref rid="B65-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>].
  </p>
  <p class="p">It was first used in the 1950s as a bio-solvent, alternative to solvents derived from fossil fuels, as well as an insecticide, and two decades later as an antibacterial [
   <xref rid="B66-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. In the early 1990s, its plant anti- fungal and antibacterial properties were first identified [
   <xref rid="B67-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], and further scientific insight about the use of limonene as a bio-pesticide was supplied starting in the mid-2000s [
   <xref rid="B68-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. At the same time, limonene was proved to be an effective adjuvant in preventive therapies against asthma [
   <xref rid="B69-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>].
  </p>
  <p class="p">It is worth noting that the antimicrobial action of limonene was found to markedly increase when applied as an oil-in-water nanoemulsion, for example reducing the thermal resistance of 
   <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> by 100 times, against only two to five times when added directly [
   <xref rid="B70-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. On the other hand, EOs from different raw materials are volatile under environmental conditions; in particular, limonene is chemically unstable in the presence of air, light, moisture, and high temperatures, hindering the respective application as flavorings in the food industry and affecting the shelf-life. The same holds for EOs applications as biopesticides, due to rapid oxidative degradation and evaporation in the open environment, leading to the need for high application rate, and stimulating research on the respective encapsulation allowing controlled and prolonged release [
   <xref rid="B71-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>].
  </p>
  <p class="p">Based on the aforementioned shortfalls, methods have been proposed to reduce volatility and control the release of such compounds. For example, a recent study suggested nanoencapsulation of limonene in oil-in-water nanoemulsions created by means of ultrasonic irradiation, sustaining cavitation processes, and stabilized with a mixture of pectin and whey proteins [
   <xref rid="B72-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>].

  <p class="p">Essential oil extracted by steam distillation from needles and twigs of 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> plants in Korea showed strong activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals, while only little antibacterial properties [
   <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In particular, the concentration required for 50% reduction against DPPH radicals was measured at the level of 27 ± 6.3 μg/mL, statistically indistinguishable from ascorbic acid (20 ± 1.3 μg/mL), slightly lower (higher activity) than for butylated hydroxyanisole, and much lower than for butylated hydroxytoluene, which are reference substances; such strong activity was attributed mainly to limonene (7.5% of total essential oil). Moreover, a mild antibacterial activity was observed against 
   <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram-positive bacteria), and insignificant activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as 
   <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Vibrio parahaemolyticcus</italic>, as well as against Gram-positive bacteria such as 
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>.
  </p>
  <p class="p">In a recent study, 21 plant-extracted essential oils were tested with regards to their antibacterial activity, i.e., growth inhibition of pathogenic and spoilage species of 
   <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp., and antioxidant activity, on samples of freshwater fish [
   <xref rid="B64-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In contrast to previous results, 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> essential oil, extracted from the respective needles, showed the highest antibacterial activity (lowest inhibitory concentration) towards few bacterial species; however, its antioxidant activity, measured by the DPPH assay, was the smallest over the considered essential oils.
  </p>
  <p class="p">The results from the latter two studies suggest that the level of antioxidant activity could be related to the specific composition of the 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> essential oils (for example, limonene was not even detected in the latter study), while the antibacterial activity is strongly dependent also on the considered bacterial strain. The analysis of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from twigs and needles of nine 
   <italic class="italic">Abies</italic> species in Turkey, including 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> Mill., confirmed the strong dependence on both the source of essential oils and the microorganism strain [
   <xref rid="B73-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. While, overall, 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> showed a moderate activity, no essential oils acted against 
   <italic class="italic">Escherichia Coli</italic>; as well, the activity was higher against yeast strains than against bacteria.
  </p>
  <p class="p">The aqueous preparations from different parts of 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic>, and its mistletoe 
   <italic class="italic">Viscum album se abies</italic>, exhibited antiproliferative effects on the malignant L-1210 cell line, and anticarcinogenic effects on rats treated with benzo(α)pyrene, significantly reducing the tumour growth and prolonging their life [
   <xref rid="B74-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. The antiproliferative effects were attributed, among the others, to the monoterpenes contained in 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic>. The raw materials, among which different parts of 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic>, were extracted in tap water by successive boiling and condensations, according to a patented technique.

  <p class="p">Aqueous extracts from bark of silver fir in Slovenia were tested for in vitro antioxidant activity towards DPPH radicals, in a comparative study with analogous extracts from maritime pine [
   <xref rid="B75-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Silver fir extracts showed 91% higher activity than the ones from maritime pine; such result was attributed to as much as 13 natural antioxidant compounds, comprising essential oils, flavonoids, and lignans. In a more recent study carried out by the same research group in Slovenia, a dried aqueous extract based on wood from branches of silver fir plants was analysed in terms of its in vitro antioxidant activity measured according to a few assays, among which DPPH, as well as the scavenging of the powerful, broad spectrum hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) [
   <xref rid="B12-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. While the DPPH assay showed lower activity in comparison to a few well-known antioxidant molecules, such as ascorbic acid and resveratrol, and, coherently, lower inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation, the ⋅OH radical scavenging activity showed comparatively much higher levels than all other considered substances. Most of the antioxidant activity was attributed to lignans, and found to occur as well in vivo, lowering the glycaemic response, and contributing to control the blood glucose levels, thus showing a high bioactive potential.
  </p>
  <p class="p">Higher in vitro antioxidant activity towards hydroxyl radicals, in comparison with few reference substances, such as resveratrol, Butylated hydroxytoluene, vitamin E, and epigallocatechin gallate, was shown for aqueous extracts of silver fir trunk [
   <xref rid="B76-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Moreover, the same aqueous extracts, added to an atherogenic diet of guinea pigs, improved the relaxation response and prevented the development of atherosclerotic plaques in aorta, thus confirming an important bioactivity. In a more recent study from the same research group, an aqueous extract of silver fir trunk dose-dependently reduced ischemic-reperfusion heart damage in rats [
   <xref rid="B77-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. As an important conclusion, the whole extract performed much better than its single constituents, suggesting a synergetic effect of multiple bioactive compounds.
  </p>
  <p class="p">In a recent study, silver fir wood and bark extracts were shown powerful activity in controlling blood glucose level, by means of the effective inhibition of specific enzymes, such as α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4, mainly attributed to lignans, as well as by means of the extracts antioxidant activity [
   <xref rid="B78-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. In addition, due to the higher effect in comparison with non-coniferous sweet chestnut wood extract, and standardized maritime pine bark extract, those results supported the use of the considered silver fir extracts as food supplements and functional foods aimed at preventing diabetes diseases. Another important finding concerned the dose-dependency of the blood glucose regulatory effect, which was remarkably non-linear, with a rather puzzling, yet significant, dropping of the efficiency at high extract concentrations.

  <p class="p">Recently, specific triterpenes extracted from the mature bark of 
   <italic class="italic">Abies procera</italic>, a species widespread in western North America, were tested against two flatworm parasites, responsible for fasciolosis and schistosomiasis, two endemic tropical diseases affecting both cattle and sheep, and humans [
   <xref rid="B79-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Especially one of such triterpenes revealed a potent and selective anthelmintic activity, opening the way to further research into effective drugs.
  </p>
  <p class="p">Synthetic phenolic antioxidants were reported to produce negative effects on human health, when used as food additives to prevent lipid oxidation processes, thereby stimulating the search for natural antioxidant products [
   <xref rid="B80-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The observation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of extracts from needles, and other parts, of coniferous trees led to the respective application to food preservation, with particular reference to the prevention of lipid peroxidation, and microbiological safety. In particular, extracts of fir needles and twigs from several 
   <italic class="italic">Abies</italic> species, such as 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> Mill., 
   <italic class="italic">Abies sibirica</italic> Ledeb., 
   <italic class="italic">Abies sachalinensis</italic> Masters, 
   <italic class="italic">Abies mayriana</italic> Miyabe et Kudo, and 
   <italic class="italic">Abies balsamea</italic> (L.) Mill., were recently suggested for their use as natural antioxidants for poultry and meat products in the U.S. [
   <xref rid="B81-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. While the respective antioxidant activity could be ascribed to essential oils (terpenes), and flavonoids, extracts from the aforementioned products should be labelled as ‘natural flavouring’ or the like.
  </p>
  <p class="p">In a real-scale experiment, broiler chicken thigh muscles produced by a poultry station were dipped in a solution of essential oil extracted from 
   <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic>, in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2% 
   <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
   <italic class="italic">w</italic>, in order to investigate the respective oxidative stability during chilling storage [
   <xref rid="B82-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The observed lipid oxidation up to 16 days of storage was significantly lower in comparison with not only air-packaged control samples, but also with vacuum-packaged samples, and vacuum-packaged samples treated with a well-known synthetic preservative substance. The dependence on concentration was mild, so much that the respective results were statistically indistinguishable.
  </p>
  <p class="p">A commercial extract from 
   <italic class="italic">Abies Sibirica</italic> (1% 
   <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
   <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was tested for the control of storage decay of strawberry (development of grey mould, Rhizopus rot, and blue mould), in comparison with various chitosan formulations and other synthetic and natural resistance inducers [
   <xref rid="B83-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. The 
   <italic class="italic">Abies Sibirica</italic> extract showed good antimicrobial activity, attributed to its triterpene acids, generally comparable to the other substances.
  </p>
  <p class="p">A decade before the latter study, the triterpene acids themselves, again extracted from 
   <italic class="italic">Abies Sibirica</italic>, and in particular from its needles, showed significant and remarkable in vitro and in vivo plant-growth regulator activity, leading to accelerated and increased sprouting of wheat seeds, as well as stimulating the growth of roots and shoots [
   <xref rid="B84-foods-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. The extraction of triterpenes in water-soluble form was carried out by means of a mechanochemical method, that has been widely applied since the 1990s, including needles’ drying, grinding, and centrifugation, followed by the use of ether as a solvent, along with other chemicals.
