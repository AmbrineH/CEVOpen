<p class="p">In general, MG molecules arrange as inverse lamellas in oil with hydrophilic groups of the glycerol head toward the insides of the MG bilayers forming a two‐dimensional close pack known as 2D hexagonal lattice (Lopez‐Martinez, Charó‐Alonso, Marangoni, &amp; Toro‐Vazquez, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the hydrophobic chains of hydrocarbons connected with the oil (Ojijo, Neeman, Eger, &amp; Shimoni, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). A high amount of a third lipophilic component, such as oil, is entrapped by the shell made of the mentioned MG lamellar bilayers (Valoppi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This arrangement of the MGs creates organogels in vegetable oils, which are stabilized by the hydrogen bonds (between the secondary and primary ‐OH groups all over the bilayers): This results in crystallization of the aliphatic tails in the MGs expanding more stable polymorphs (Lopez‐Martinez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Temperature fall to below 75°C may result in hexagonally packed α‐forms of MGs during the crystallization process. When the temperature drops to below ~50 and ~30°C, thermally reversible polymorphic phase transitions occur and the α‐form undergoes changes in two different sub‐α phases. The α phase and these two sub‐α phases are thermodynamically unstable and gently transform into a triclinic packed β phase, with an elevated melting temperature of about 80°C (Wang,

 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). For instance, partial replacement of animal fat in frankfurter sausages by OGs prepared with MGs and phytosterols has been performed (Kouzounis &amp; Lazaridou, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Also, olive oil OG can be structured with monopalmitin and monostearin, creating a spreadable food product (Ojijo, Neeman, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Further, Ogutcu and Yilmaz (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) suggested that OGs of MGs can be applied as spreadable, breakfast margarine‐like products and augment consumption habits for this healthy oil.
