<p class="p">The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of OG produced from amaranth oil. To the authors' knowledge, this was the first time that amaranth oil OG was prepared for use in foodstuffs. Also, cocoa butter (CB) was chosen as control sample because the experience of previous studies shows that CB replaced with vegetables oil presents problems of quality and is unsuccessful as a practical product. Therefore, the present study has been planned to mimic CB properties and establishment of a solid structure such as 3‐D networks in liquid oil with desirable nutritional characteristics by only oleogelators and without hydrogenation or raising the trans‐fatty acids.</p>
