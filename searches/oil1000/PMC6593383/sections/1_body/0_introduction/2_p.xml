<p class="p">Vegetable oil fats have an important role in foods' nutritional quality, shelf‐life, flavor, and texture (Ogutcu, Arifoglu, &amp; Yilmaz, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, it should be noted that vegetable oils are more susceptible to oxidation, which might result in rancidity when stored. In addition, they do not perform well in food processing due to their low viscosity (Kim, Lim, Lee, Hwang, &amp; Lee, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Overall, medical guidelines mostly recommend people throughout the world to reduce consuming saturated fats (&lt;10% calories per day). Therefore, it has recently been suggested that oleogels (OGs) be replaced by solid‐like materials which are made of lipids rich in unsaturated fatty acids (O'Sullivan, Barbut, &amp; Marangoni, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). OGs are in fact generated from the entrapment of liquid oils in a three‐dimensional network without any alterations in the chemical features of the oil. Although oleogelation is a novel topic, oils as the materials that can be structured into self‐standing solids have been highly attractive during the last decade and have been suggested as hydrogenated or saturated fat replacers, oil binders, inhibitors of oil migration, and oxidation protection systems (Manzocco et al.,
