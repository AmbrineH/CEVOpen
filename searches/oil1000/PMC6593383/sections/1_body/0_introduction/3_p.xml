<p class="p">Oleogels are classified based on the methods of processing, molecular nature, and number or chemical type of the organogelators used (Doan et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A compound should have certain physicochemical properties to be considered as an oleogelator, including the affinity for oil known as lipophilicity, self‐assembling properties, surface activity, capacity for higher structural arrangement, and exhibiting thermoreversible properties (Patel, Schatteman, Vos, Lesaffer, &amp; Dewettinck, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Emulsifiers could be the most successful group of structuring agents in future and are able to self‐assemble in different environments due to their “schizophrenic” character (Valoppi, Calligaris, Barba, &amp; Nicoli, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In addition, OGs can be categorized based on their oil‐gelling molecules' size. The most common converters are lyotropic liquid crystallines made of monoglycerides (MGs), which are low‐molecular‐weight gelators (Cegla Nemirovsky, Aserin, &amp; Garti,
