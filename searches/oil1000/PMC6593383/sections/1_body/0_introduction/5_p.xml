<p class="p">Amaranth, also known as Amaranthus, is among the oldest crops in the world (Czaplicki, Ogrodowska, Zadernowski, &amp; Derewiaka, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Compared to cereals like rice, amaranth grains contain about 30% more protein and are comparable to common grains such as wheat germ regarding minerals such as calcium and manganese. Reduction in blood pressure and cholesterol levels in addition to improvement in the antioxidant status and immunity might also be observed following regular amaranth consumption (Inglett, Chen, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). On the other hand, multiple reported biological effects (Martirosyan, Miroshnichenko, Kulakova, Pogojeva, &amp; Zoloedov,

 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Additionally, amaranth seed oil may have some benefits for those with cardiovascular and hypertension diseases (Inglett et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Moreover, the biologically active composition of amaranth is a part of unsaponifiable oil substances (squalene, tocopherols, and tocotrienols) (Czaplicki et al.,
