<p class="p">This study aims to investigate the characteristics of OG produced from highly unsaturated amaranth oil and MG as an oleogelator. The mentioned OG is made in order to offer a solid‐like oil without nutritional disadvantages of saturated and trans‐fatty acids. As compared to the oils, the results show a slight increase in the PV of the OG samples and comparatively higher oxidative stability without adding antioxidants. Furthermore, adding oleogelator creates a favorable crystalline network in oil and does not allow it to be released. Moreover, OG formation also leads to a solid structure without augmenting the solid fat content of the oil. On the other hand, OG generation causes the melting point of the oil to improve and similar crystals of CB to form. Evaluation of fatty acids by gas chromatography demonstrates 5%–12% and 2%–6% reduction in oleic and linoleic acids, respectively. As a conclusion, the OG made from amaranth oil and MG can be proposed as a solid‐like oil without trans‐fatty acids.</p>
