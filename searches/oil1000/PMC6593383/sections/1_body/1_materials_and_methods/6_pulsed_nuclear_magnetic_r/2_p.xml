<p class="p">The solid fat content (SFC), which is regarded as a factor for evaluating melting behavior, was assessed by pNMR using a Bruker Minispec mq20 (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) at various temperatures. Following complete melting at 60°C for 5 min and chilling at 0°C for 60 min, the samples were placed in pNMR tubes and submitted to the IUPAC 2.150 serial tempering method. The SFCs were measured at temperature intervals of 5°C in the range of 5–40°C (Zarringhalami, Sahari, Barzegar, &amp; Hamidi‐Esfehani,
