<p class="p">One microliter of methyl ester‐converted fatty acid solution (according to the AOCS methods, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) was injected into a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7890A), which was fitted with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column of Hp‐88 (100 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.2 µm film thickness). Helium was applied as the ultrapure carrier gas with a 3 ml/min flow rate and 1/100 split injection ratio. Temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 and 280°C, respectively. The initial column temperature was fixed to 120°C and kept at this level for 1 min, followed by a heating rate of 10°C/min to a temperature of 170°C for 10 min: Finally, it raised again from 170 to 210°C at a rate of 5°C/min which was maintained for 27 min. Comparison of the retention times with the standards (Sigma, USA) was the approach for recognizing the fatty acid methyl esters. The yield of fatty acids was calculated as follows: area of the fatty acid/area of total fatty acids in the sample of oil × 100 (%) (Zoue, Bedikou, Faulet, Gonnety, &amp; Niamke,
