<p class="p">X'Pert PRO MPD X‐ray diffraction (PANalytical Company, Poland) fitted with Cu‐Kα radiation (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = 1.5406 Å, current of 40 mA and voltage of 40 kV) was used to identify the polymorphic transformations of the samples at room temperature. To melt all the existing crystals and nuclei before the measurement, the samples were heated at 70°C for 5 min. Next, they were analyzed at 2
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> angles of 1–30° with a scan rate of 5°C/min. HighScore Plus software was applied to analyze the X‐ray diffraction patterns. Assignment of polymorphs was based on the following short spacing properties of CB: α form (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 4.15 Å), β′ forms (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 3.8–4.3 Å), and β forms (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 4.5–4.6 Å). Prior to measurements, the samples were kept at 35°C for 24 hr in order to prevent any polymorphism transition during the analysis (Zarringhalami et al.,
