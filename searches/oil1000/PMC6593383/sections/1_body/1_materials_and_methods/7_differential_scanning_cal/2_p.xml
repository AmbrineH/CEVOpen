<p class="p">Thermal properties such as crystallization and melting profiles were determined using Netzsch 200F3 differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Nitrogen was used as the purging gas at flow of 100 ml/min. Ten mg of the sample was first placed in an aluminum pan and then sealed hermetically with a sample press (the reference was an empty pan to acquire the baseline settings). Afterward, it was heated at 130°C for 3 min to warrant homogeneity and eliminate any previously shaped crystals. The sample was then cooled at 10°C/min to –30°C and held for 3 min, followed by heating at 10°C/min to 130°C: This was maintained for 3 min. The peak temperatures, melting point, crystallization onset, and enthalpies were calculated for each peak by the Netzsch software (Sonwai, Podchong, &amp; Rousseau,
