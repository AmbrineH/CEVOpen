 <xref rid="fsn31018-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> demonstrates the crystalline structure of OGs, MGs, and CB via a X‐ray diffraction device. Wide‐angle region peaks from 3.12 to 4.59 Å; small‐angle region diffraction peaks at around 5.15–42.26 Å for the MG olegels which were measured: Similar peaks were determined for 5% and 7% MG in cod liver oil organogels (Da Pieve et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Da Pieve, Calligaris, Panozzo, Arrighetti, &amp; Nicoli, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Pure oil is free of crystals, and MG has a highly intense peak at transverse distance of 4.55 Å: This is related to the presence of β crystals. Moreover, the unique melting properties and thermal behavior of CB is also due to the presence of a specific type of β crystals at a transverse distance of about 4.6 Å: The α and β′ crystals are formed at 3.8 and 4.2 Å. Therefore, comparing this short spacing with the higher peak at points near 4.6 Å in OGs, the similarity of these gels with CB can be concluded. Perez‐Monterroza et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported that peaks at 3.7, 3.9, 4.1, and 4.2 Å are characteristic of the polymorphic form β′ or that sub‐α were found. Moreover, the signal around 4.55 and 4.6 Å presented the transformation of the β′ polymorph to β polymorphic form. However, it has been established in several researches that the formation of β polymorph is induced by MGs (Basso et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ribeiro et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Saberi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The same behavior is observed in commercial MG organogels at concentrations more than 1.5% (Lopez‐Martinez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). On the other hand, an increase in enthalpy is also observed (results not shown): This might be due to the presence of β polymorph in the mixtures of glycerol monostearate and miglyol oil. Alternatively, the incorporation of the alkyl chain of GMS into the alkyl chain of miglyol oil can be lead to increased enthalpy. A similar effect is observed for the mixtures of GMS and palm oil, where the GMS50 P sample has higher crystallization enthalpy in comparison with pure oil (Alfutimie, Al‐Janabi, Curtis, &amp; Tiddy, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Further DSC experiments suggest that the β polymorph could crystallize at temperatures of 8–8.5 and 5°C directly from the inverse lamellar α state phase and through a fast polymorphic transition from the sub‐α phase, respectively (Lopez‐Martinez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Smaller d‐spacings diffracted by the β phase or the coagel phase show the triclinic structure of MG molecules, where they are more densely packed as compared to the hexagonally packed α phase (Wang, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, these crystals increase in OGs as the result of augmented oleogelator amounts and get closer to CB. Intensity of the peaks increases at higher concentrations of gelators, and alteration of d‐spacing can be explained by structure modification following the elevation in gelator concentration (Cerqueira et al.,
