<p class="p">The oxidative stability of the OG samples was measured by monitoring PV for 2 months stored at 4 and 25°C, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). These findings can be of remarkable importance in commercial production of organogels (Yilmaz &amp; Ogutcu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Among all OG samples, the lowest (0.8 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg) and the highest PV (2.1 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg) was obtained in the oil stored at 4°C for 0 days and at 25°C for 60 days, respectively. On the other hand, the range of PV values was from 0.8 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg for the sample at the beginning of the storage at 4°C to 1.1 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg at the end of it: There was no significant change in PV during the storage time at refrigeration temperature (4°C). However, the samples stored at room temperature had greater PV as compared to the refrigerated samples. Yilmaz and Ogutcu (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported the same results for hazelnut oil and beeswax OGs. Also, PV values of samples at room temperature were statistically different, especially between oil and OGs: Specifically, OG10 and OG12 had lowest values (1.6 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg). On the other hand, a gradual elevation in the PVs was observed at both temperatures throughout the storage time. Interestingly, an increase in the PV of fresh oil was significantly faster during storage as compared to the OGs: These findings are in line with Lim, Hwang, and Lee (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Moreover, the PV decreased by increasing the concentration of OGs. This suggests that delayed oil oxidation during storage might result from limited oil mobility due to organogelation (Lim et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The PVs of all OGs were shown to be below 2.1 mEq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg, which is demonstrative of good oxidative stability in the samples. Since no antioxidant was added to the samples, this stability could be attributed to the natural antioxidant compounds (tocopherols, tocotrienols, and sterols) of the oil. Therefore, oleogelation has not led to degradation of these components, which can be counted as another advantage of this technology (Ogutcu &amp; Yilmaz, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
