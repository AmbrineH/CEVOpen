<p class="p">It was observed that gelation occurs at the ≥6% w/w concentration of MG, and that lower MG percentages were insufficient for full entrapment of the liquid amaranth oil. At these low concentrations, integrity could not be maintained when the tubes were inverted which is the primary requirement for a gel (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Augmented MG levels resulted in enhanced gel properties, such as formation, consistency, and smoothness. Therefore, the gelled system improved remarkably and no signs of oiling out or crystalline phase sedimentation were observed over 4–8 weeks of storage. Similar behavior was observed for OG of sunflower oil, phytosterols, and MG by increasing the MG proportion (Sintang, Rimaux, De Walle, Dewettinck, &amp; Patel, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Consequently, the four percentages of 7, 9, 10, and 12 were selected as the optimal ones for other characteristics. On the other hand, the texture hardness and melting point, as compared to CB, could be considered limitations at concentrations higher than 12%.
