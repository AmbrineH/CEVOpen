<p class="p">Percentages of the predominant fatty acids in oil, OG7‐12, and CB measured by gas chromatography are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. As expected, by adding MG, the quantity of unsaturated increases while that of saturated fatty acids decreases. The amount of unsaturated oleic and linoleic fatty acids diminishes to 12% and 6%, respectively, in OG as compared to the oil, while the saturated palmitic and stearic fatty acids reach 14.51% and 8.71%, respectively, in OG12 from 6.55% and 3.37% in oil. MG‐induced changes can lead to a balance among fatty acids and make their proportion closer to that of the CB. MGs mainly consist of palmitic and stearic acid, the longer chains of which show stronger Van der Waals interactions (Blake et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, the saturated fatty acid content of CB is much higher than OG; however, OGs with a stearic acid content of 7.38%–8.71%, as compared to 36.36% in CB, have produced similar solid structures. In addition, the value of essential and unsaturated fatty acids in the OG is close to the original oil and much higher than that of the CB.
