<p class="p">Solid fat content is of significance in hard fat stocks from both the technological and the nutritional standpoints (Ogutcu &amp; Yilmaz,

 <xref rid="fsn31018-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows its values for amaranth oil, OGs, and CB. It should be mentioned that SFC was lower than the addition levels of the organogelators in OG samples. Ogutcu and Yilmaz (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) also claimed that some of the organogelators are liquid at some specified temperatures. As expected, amaranth oil has the biggest difference (statistically) with CB and OG12 has the least. In fact, amaranth oil remained liquid at temperatures of 0–40°C with SFC of about zero: Si, Cheong, Huang, Wang, and Zhang (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported the same results for soybean oil. Nonetheless, this percentage is enhanced and a three‐dimensional structure is formed in the oil by adding some MGs with saturated fatty acids to the oil: The final result is generation of solid fats. Lack of trans fat production in this process can be regarded as one of the most remarkable advantages of using oleogelators. Furthermore, Niiya, Imamura, Okada, and Matsumoto (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>) stated that adding saturated MGs to palm kernel oil raises melting point, induces crystallization, and improves solid fat content. However, low temperatures cause CB to be more reach in solid fat. On the other hand, CB has a higher solid fat content at 0–35°C. At 5 and 10°C, SFC for CB was ~82.1% and 80.5%, respectively. This is mainly due to the presence of higher saturated fatty acid content in CB. While CB contained 70.5% SFC at 20°C, the organogels had 5.5%–8.8% SFC. OGs are capable of entrapping oil with lower solid content, leading to gel‐like property at low temperatures (Si et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). It has been proved that organogelation does not increase oil SFC significantly, evidencing that no chemical change takes place in during fatty acid saturation or isometry: This could be considered the main advantage of organogels (Yilmaz &amp; Ogutcu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, a rapid decline in solid fat content is observed at 20–35°C, which is indicative of solid structure maintenance at lower temperatures and melting occurrence by temperature elevation responsible for the favorable feeling in mouth induced by these specimens. The amount of solid fat depends on the fatty acids and temperature: This percent is expected to decrease by augmentation in the temperature. The SFC of all samples diminished to &lt;0.5% at 40°C. Lack of waxiness and complete melting during consumption were warranted by low SFC at body temperature: Si et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) showed the same behavior in soybean oil OG.
