<p class="p">On the other hand, an increase in gelator concentration promotes reorganization of the crystals leading to different microscopy images according to the concentration of gelator used; similar results were observed by Cerqueira et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) in their study on the effect of oil on organogelator structures. Generally, most organogelators organize mesoscale asymmetric structures and do not grow similarly across the three dimensions (Palla et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). With an increase in gelator concentration, gelation (based on a continuous network, achieved by cross‐linking of the crystals and trapping of the oil) continues until organization of a 3‐D structure immobilizing the oil phase (Cerqueira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Notably, the MG oleogel concentration of 7 had a microstructure with the lowest mass of crystals and the structure became more compact by increasing the concentration to 12% regardless of the storage time.
