<p class="p">Cooling of the mixture gave rise to the crystal phase and caused a polydomain crystal network to form. Organogel formation process occurs in three steps: crystal nucleation, crystalline branching, and crystal growth (Cerqueira et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) mentioned that MGs cluster as crystal aggregates along with one‐dimensional needle crystals and spherulite crystallites in OGs can be obtained by using different sources such as structurants at 10% concentration. The spherulites result from aggregation of the needle‐like crystals, grown from a nucleation center with several branches that form large crystal structures (Sintang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Palla, Giacomozzi, Genovese, and Carrin (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) obtained micrographs, which show irregular elongated, fibrillary, and needle‐like dispersion of Myverol (commercial mixture of saturated MG) aggregates. Besides, light microscopy demonstrated the formation of network‐like structures through entanglement of crystals. Maintenance and diffusion restriction of sunflower oil into the outer part of the structure was shaped by dense crystals along with crystal entanglement (Sintang et al.,
