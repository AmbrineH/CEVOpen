<p class="p">The graphs obtained from the thermal behavior of comparing OGs, oil, MG, and CB with DSC are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> for temperatures ranging from −30 to 130°C. Monoglyceride OGs are presented as two peaks at all concentrations. Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Perez‐Monterroza, Ciro‐Velasquez, and Tobon (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) that showed that 10% OGs of commercial MGs had two crystallization peaks related to saturated and unsaturated components of MG. These observations were in accordance with the findings of Si et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, Basso et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) mentioned that these crystallization peaks may result from the β and α polymorphs, which is also comparable to the results found by Saberi, Lai, and Toro‐Vázquez (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) in a study on palm oil crystallization with monoacylglycerols and tripalmitin. It is indicated in their study that adding monoacylglycerols increases the number of crystallization seeds, decreases size of crystals, and favors the formation of the β crystals resulting in the accelerated crystallization of palm oil. On the other hand, temperatures of the observed melting peaks elevate with an increase in MG concentrations and reach 59.1°C from 48.9°C by changing the OG percent from 7% to 12%. Si et al. also reported that melting temperature of MG oleogel 3 was about 38.27°C; however, melting temperature of ~46.24°C was observed for MG oleogel 6%. This is in agreement with the previously reported findings of Blake, Co, and Marangoni (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) who found out that higher ratios of oleogelators in OGs are accompanied by higher melting points. Generally, peak temperatures were shown to have concentration‐dependent decrease versus decrease in MG proportions: This was as expected (Sintang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This finding can find technological application: A suitable level of organogelator can be selected for addition based on thermal properties and other aspects (Yilmaz &amp; Ogutcu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In addition, a study performed by Perez‐Monterroza et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) revealed that MGs concentrations might also influence the onset temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">onset</sub>) and crystallization temperatures (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>), probably due to the reciprocal interactions and the triacylglycerols from avocado oil. The oil TAGs contain double bonds, the steric effect of which plays a role in preventing the accommodation of MGs chains, lower

 <sub class="sub">c</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">onset</sub>, and formation of a less compact structure. The latter result is consistent with studies on crystallization of the candelilla wax OGs using safflower oil rich in triolein (Toro‐Vazquez, Alonzo‐Macias, Dibildox‐Alvarado, &amp; Charo‐Alonso, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, OG samples demonstrated lower peak temperature as compared to pure MG samples: Maximum peak temperature in these cases was 67.4 and 59.1°C in MG and OG12, respectively. Kouzounis and Lazaridou (
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that increased solubility of the solid crystals can be attributed to the oil medium. A similar trend has been observed on thermal DSC scans of virgin olive oil OGs with saturated MGs in comparison with the thermogram of the pure gelator (Lupi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Further, the peak temperatures were –17.3 and 41.7°C in oil and CB, respectively: This indicates the improving impact of adding MG to oil for increasing the melting point and getting close to the control sample. In fact, the organogels exhibit melting temperatures and enthalpies alike the CB sample. Hence, they can be applied as good alternatives and which will not cause any problem regarding thermal conditions in food processing. In plastic fats, melting temperature is an essential determining parameter for different applications. Moreover, the temperature of the OG peaks was very close during the melting and cooling processes, which confirms that the OGs are completely thermoreversible. Furthermore, execution of thermal cycling during evaluation yields very similar results (Yilmaz &amp; Ogutcu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31018-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
