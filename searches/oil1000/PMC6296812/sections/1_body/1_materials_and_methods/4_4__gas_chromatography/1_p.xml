<p class="p">Gas chromatography analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890N equipped with a DB-1MS column (30 mm × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The oven temperature was programmed as: isothermal at 40°C for 1 minute, then raised to 250°C (6°C/minute) and held at this temperature for 4 minutes. Helium was used as the carrier gas at the rate of 1.5 mL/minute in split mode (50:1 ratio). The constituents of the plant essential oil were identified by comparing their GC retention indices (RI). The RI of the constituents for each plant essential oil were identified by co-injection of essential oil and a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C8–C20; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). RI was calculated using the equation proposed by van Den Dool and Kratz (1963) [
