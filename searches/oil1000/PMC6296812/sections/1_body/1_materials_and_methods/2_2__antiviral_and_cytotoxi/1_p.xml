<p class="p">Anti-influenza (A/WS/33 virus) activity of essential oils was determined by the CPE reduction method [
 <xref rid="b12-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. There were 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> MDCK cells/well seeded into a 96-well culture plate in MEM supplemented with trypsin-EDTA containing 0.01% antibiotic–antimycotic solution and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 24 hours. Thereafter, the medium was aspirated and cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the diluted virus suspension (0.09 mL) containing 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of the virus, was added to MDCK cells to produce an appropriate CPE within 48 hours after infection. Thereafter, MEM containing essential oils in 100 μg/mL were added to each well. The culture plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 2 days until 50% CPE was achieved. Subsequently, the 96-well plates were washed once with PBS (100 mL). Ice-cold 70% acetone in water (100 mL) was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at −20°C. After 70% acetone had evaporated, the plates were dried in an oven at 55°C for 30 minutes. The plate was developed using 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid solution (100 mL) which was added to each well and left to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature. The excess SRB solution was removed by washing the plates 5 times with 1% acetic acid in water, then the plate was dried at 55°C. Bound SRB was then solubilized with 10 mM unbuffered Tris-base (SigmaAldrich) solution (100 mL). After 30 minutes, the absorbance was read at 524 nm with a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a reference absorbance determined at 650 nm. The percent protection achieved by the test compound in the influenza A/WS/33 virus-infected cells was calculated using the equation below. Oseltamivir was used as the positive control and dimethylsulfoxide as a negative control. The morphology of influenza A/WS/33 virus-infected cells was observed using a light microscope at 32 × 10 magnification (AXIOVERT10; ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany), and images were recorded.
