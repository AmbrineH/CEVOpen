<p class="p">The oils (marjoram, clary sage and anise) were analyzed further on a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N)-mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973N MSD) equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The oven temperature was programmed as described previously. Helium was used as the carrier gas at the rate of 1.0 mL/minute. The effluent of the GC column was introduced directly into the source of the MS via a transfer line (250°C). Ionization voltage was 70 eV and the ion source temperature was 230°C. Scan range was 41–450 amu. Compounds were identified by comparison of mass spectra of each peak with those of authentic samples in the NIST MS library.</p>
