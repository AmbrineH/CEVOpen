<p class="p">In this work, marjoram, clary sage and anise oils exhibited strong anti-influenza A/WS/33 virus activity. Linalool was a common constituent in the chemical compositions of marjoram, clary sage and anise oils. Therefore, the anti-influenza A/WS/33 activity of marjoram, clary sage and anise oils appeared to be associated with linalool. However, further studies will be required to explore the anti-influenza A/WS/33 virus effects of linalool.</p>
