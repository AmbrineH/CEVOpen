<p class="p">The effects of essential oils on influenza A/WS/33 virus-induced CPE were investigated (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). After a 2-day infection of MDCK cells with influenza A/WS/33 virus, mock cells (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>) or cells treated with 100 μg/mL essential oils (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figures 2E, 2G and 2I</xref>) showed typical morphology. At this concentration (100 μg/mL), there were no signs of cytotoxicity induced by the essential oils. However, oseltamivir was weakly toxic to MDCK cells at concentration of 100 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>). Infection with influenza A/WS/33 virus, in the absence of essential oils, resulted in a severe CPE (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>). Addition of the essential oils to the influenza infected MDCK cells, inhibited the formation of a visible CPE (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figures 2F, 2H and 2J</xref>). However, the addition of oseltamivir to influenza A/WS/33 virus-infected MDCK cell resulted in a small reduction in CPE (
 <xref rid="f2-ophrp-09-348" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the CPE of the virus infection was shown to be prevented by the presence of the essential oils.
