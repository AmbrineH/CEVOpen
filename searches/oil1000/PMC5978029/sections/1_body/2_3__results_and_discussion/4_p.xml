<p class="p">The particle size, structure, and morphology can have a significant influence on both materials and the efficiency of their use. Properties such as S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub>, V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> and D
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> are significant material characteristics in numerous applications, including pharmaceutical and medical products. To determine the total pore volume (V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) and pore size (D
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples, the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method was used. Moreover, the values of the specific surface area (S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub>) of the samples were determined by the BET method. The nitrogen physisorption results, including the S
