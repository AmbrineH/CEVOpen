<p class="p">Thus, in order to discover the complete molecular structural information of the HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L samples, we performed a peak fitting analysis of their IR spectra in the 800–1200 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> spectral range. As a first step in the peak fitting analysis procedure, the second derivative of the IR spectrum was calculated.
