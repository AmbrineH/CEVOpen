<p class="p">The BET surface areas increased from HAp to HAp-L. The S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> value for HAp-B is close to that of HAp. As expected, the pore volume V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> increased from HAp to HAp-L. The results regarding the porosity of the materials were similar to those observed by SEM analysis. These materials could have high potential for use in a variety of applications, due to the possibility of obtaining particles with a controlled size and shape.
