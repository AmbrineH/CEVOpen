<p class="p">In recent years, because of the excessive use of antibiotics, bacteria and viruses are becoming more resistant to drugs. On the other hand, viruses and bacteria have changed a lot over time, and antibiotics cannot treat most of the diseases they cause. Even if bacteria adapt and become resistant to antibiotics, medical and pharmaceutical specialists are trying to find new products that can be used to develop medicines to fight back against pathogens. More than that, chemically synthetized drugs present a certain toxicity and involve a potential risk to humans. In this context, researchers are continuously trying to find new molecules to fight against bacterial strains.</p>
