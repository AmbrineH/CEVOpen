  <italic class="italic">Background</italic>: Insect vector control is facing the challenges of resistance development and environmental hazards caused by synthetic pesticides. This has led to a considerable market opportunity for botanical insecticides. In this scenario, our study investigated the potential of selected bioactive monoterpenoids, carvacrol and thymol, as safe and effective tools to control the West Nile vector 
  <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic>. Furthermore, the combined effect of thymol-carvacrol mixtures and their possible interactions were assessed. 
  <italic class="italic">Methods</italic>: For determining larvicidal and ovicidal 50% lethal concentration (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>), each monoterpenoid was tested at different concentrations (5â€“500 mg/L). Then, the fixed ratio method was used for evaluating their combinational efficacy. 
  <italic class="italic">Results</italic>: Carvacrol was more toxic against larvae of 
  <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens,</italic> with a LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 14 mg/L, whereas thymol exhibited a LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 49 mg/L. Comparable trends of efficacy were observed when toxicity on 
  <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> eggs was investigated, with LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 7 and 13 mg/L for carvacrol and thymol, respectively. In combinational toxicity assays, the mixture thymol-carvacrol at 1:4 ratio achieved a synergistic effect against larvae of 
  <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens,</italic> whereas an additive effect was observed on eggs. Other ratios showed antagonistic effects. 
  <italic class="italic">Conclusions</italic>: Overall, our findings pointed out that the 1:4 ratio of thymol-carvacrol blend can enhance the insecticidal efficacy on 
  <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> young instars and can be considered further as active ingredient for developing botanical insecticides to be used in mosquito control operations.
