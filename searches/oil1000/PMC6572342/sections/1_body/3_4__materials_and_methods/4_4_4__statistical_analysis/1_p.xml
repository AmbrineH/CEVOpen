<p class="p">Egg and larval mortality data transformed by arcsine√ were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05). To determine LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> values, mortality data, corrected with Abbott’s [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] formula where needed, were subjected to probit analysis [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. When 95% confidence limits (95% CL) failed to overlap, LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> values were considered significantly different from one another. Concerning the combination assays, the obtained data were plotted for the construction of an isobologram for both larvicidal and ovicidal activity of thymol-carvacrol combinations. Then, 50% lethal concentration (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) and the fractional lethal concentration (FLC) index for each ratio were calculated. FLC index was calculated according to the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">FLC index = LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> A in combination/LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> A alone + LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> B in combination/LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> B alone.
 </disp-formula>
