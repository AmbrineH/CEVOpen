<p class="p">Larvicidal activity of carvacrol and thymol was evaluated on 3rd instar larvae according to the WHO protocol [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Both carvacrol and thymol were tested at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mg/L in tap water. To formulate the concentrations detailed above, both compounds were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO then diluted in water [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Negative control was 1 mL DMSO + 249 mL of water. In each replicate, 20 larvae were tested, 5 replicates were done per each concentration. Larval mortality was noted after 24 h [
