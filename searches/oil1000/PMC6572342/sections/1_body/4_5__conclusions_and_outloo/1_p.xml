<p class="p">Overall, the present investigation firstly shed light on the high toxicity of carvacrol and thymol against mosquito eggs. In addition, outstanding larvicidal activity was observed on 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pipiens</italic> larvae, with LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values lower &lt; 50 mg/L for both molecules. Extremely low LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> were detected both on eggs and larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pipiens</italic>, with values always lower than 20 mg/L. Combinational assays pointed out a synergistic effect testing 1:4 ratio of thymol plus carvacrol. Detecting a synergistic effect in bioactive phytochemical mixtures could be helpful in future operations aimed to manage West Nile and filariasis mosquito vectors exploiting low concentrations of the active ingredients, and their multiple mode of action, which can be helpful to reduce the risk of insecticide resistance development. Lastly, further ecotoxicology research to assess the impact of the binary mixtures proposed here on non-target species, with special reference to chronic toxicity on aquatic organisms, are still needed.
