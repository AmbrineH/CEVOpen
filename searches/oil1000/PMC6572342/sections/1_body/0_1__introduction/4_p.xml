<p class="p">Ten-carbon components of plant essential oils as monoterpenoids have been widely recognized as toxic, repellent, and antifeedant agents on insect pests and vectors. Thus, they are considered as potential molecules for the development of novel and eco-friendly pesticides [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Monoterpenoids are synthesized in the cytoplasm and plastids of the plant cell through two distinct pathways, namely mevalonate and methyl erythritol phosphate, respectively [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. They are endowed with a multitude of different chemical structures (e.g., linear, monocyclic, bicyclic) and functional groups (e.g., double bonds, alcoholic, aldehydic, ketonic, phenolic). Among them, phenolic monoterpenes as thymol and carvacrol have been recognized as two of the most powerful bioactive constituents produced by higher plants [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Research on the toxicity of these phenolic monoterpenes on various insect pests have highlighted their potential as ovicides, fumigants and contact toxicants [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Carvacrol is a monoterpene phenol that occurs in many essential oils of the Lamiaceae family, including
