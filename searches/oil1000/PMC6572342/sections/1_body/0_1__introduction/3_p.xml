<p class="p">However, plant essential oil composition can vary consistently according to many factors, including botanical species, geographical area of origin, growing conditions, genetic variability, harvesting time and extraction technique, just to cite some of the main ones [

This can play a major impact on their insecticidal activity, making the development of products for real-world use challenging. Therefore, an approach to deal with this issue is the detection of the bioactive components from plant essential oils, and their encapsulation or micro- and nanoformulations for highly stable pesticide development [
