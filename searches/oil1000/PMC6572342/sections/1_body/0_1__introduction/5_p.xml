<p class="p">To our knowledge, no data are available on the efficacy of these two monoterpenes and their mixtures against the mosquito species 
 <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic> L. The latter is part of the 
 <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic> complex, whose species, found worldwide in urban and sub-urban areas of temperate and tropical regions, vector important pathogens including West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis virus, among others, as well as parasites like lymphatic filariasis and avian malaria [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In particular, since West Nile is expanding its geographical range in Europe causing an increasing number of epidemics/outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], the effective management of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquitoes under the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) is timely and important. Thus, to develop novel insecticides of botanical origin characterized by a multiple mechanism of action [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and active at very low doses [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], the present study was conducted to assess the toxicity of carvacrol and thymol on eggs and larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic>. Furthermore, when formulating selected plant essential oil constituents in insecticidal blends, an important issue needing attention is the possible synergistic and antagonistic effects of the blend, as outlined by research conducted on various arthropod species of economic importance, including agricultural pests [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], houseflies [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], mites [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and ticks [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, the combined effect of thymol-carvacrol and their possible interaction were assessed on both eggs and larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquitoes, using the fixed ratio method.
