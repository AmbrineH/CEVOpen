<p class="p">Monoterpenoids are among the most important bioactive compounds in essential oil research. Concerning the development of novel insecticides, they have been reported as effective against a wide variety of species of medical, veterinary and agricultural importance, highlight their efficacy as ovicides, larvicides and even adulticides [

 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens molestus</italic>. Among the eight tested compounds, carvacrol and thymol were the most toxic ones. However, against this latter mosquito, they achieved LC

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]; carvacrol LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was substantially higher if compared to probit results achieved by the same compound in our study on 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> 3rd instar larvae (LC
