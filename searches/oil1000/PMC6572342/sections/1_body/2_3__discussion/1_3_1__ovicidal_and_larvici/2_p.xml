<p class="p">Besides, the larvicidal activity of carvacrol, the major constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> L. essential oil, has been evaluated against 3rd stage larvae of other mosquito species. Carvacrol has been reported effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</italic> Liston, with a LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 21.15 μg/mL, and exhibited LC
