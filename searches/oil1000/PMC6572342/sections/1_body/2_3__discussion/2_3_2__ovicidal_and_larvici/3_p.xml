<p class="p">The fixed ratio method and isobologram construction showed different interactions of the two monoterpene phenols when administered in combination. The most efficient ratio of thymol-carvacrol was 1:4, which resulted in synergistic effect against larvae and additive effect against eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic>. The various physiological interactions of plant-borne products with different insect targets is a complex issue to deal with. Concerning our findings, we may hypothesize that the 1:4 thymol-carvacrol combination is able to completely inhibit some receptors (e.g., octopamine and GABA ones) causing to insect neurotoxicity, or is the most effective in interacting with more than one target, leading to synergistic effects. Further research on this is warranted, since studies on the molecular effects of synergistic mixtures are extremely limited. More generally, when searching literature about the synergistic effects of natural products in mosquito ovicidal studies we faced a severe lack of literature. On the other hand, important research has been done on the essential oil toxicity to mosquito larvae [

 <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae showing that thymol was the most effective, with a LC

 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> was observed testing carvacrol + carvone, carvacrol + 4-allylanisole, and carvacrol + terpineol, among others. Besides, the author outlined, as shown for carvacrol + thymol on 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> data presented here, that some of the most effective mixtures varied in their efficacy according to the mixing ratio. In particular, 100% larvicidal efficacy was obtained formulating carvacrol + carvone at a ratio &gt;2. Overall, Pavela et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] selected two binary mixtures leading to mortality &gt; 90% when tested at &lt;20 mg/L: limonene + (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole (1:1) and carvacrol + carvone (1:2â€“3). In contrast to our findings, Karpouhtsis et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] reported that mixing carvacrol and thymol, resulted in reduction of insecticidal activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae), suggesting an antagonistic interaction between them. It was observed that the toxicity of carvacrol was reduced in presence of thymol. Interestingly, the obtained data and the trend of isobologram curve in the present study pointed out a loss of synergy when increasing the concentration of thymol and decreasing that of carvacrol. In other words, adding thymol to carvacrol, especially in the combinations containing higher amounts of thymol over carvacrol, can result in antagonistic interactions between these two molecules (FLC &gt; 1).
