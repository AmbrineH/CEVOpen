<p class="p">The toxicity of carvacrol and thymol to arthropod pests and vectors can be due to different mechanisms. Research has suggested that carvacrol and thymol potentiate ligand-gated chloride channels in insect nervous system and probably act as neurotoxic insecticides [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01867" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Furthermore, it was shown that thymol may work by blocking octopamine receptors, which are unique to insects and considered as an important target site for pest and vector control [
