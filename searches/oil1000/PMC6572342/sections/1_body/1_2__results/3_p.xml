<p class="p">Results of the quantitative analysis of LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> combinational toxicity of carvacrol and thymol and their FLC indices are provided in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01867-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The trend of interaction between thymol-carvacrol combinations against eggs and 3rd instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> was analysed by the fixed ratio method and the obtained isobolograms were given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01867-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The 1:4 ratio of thymol-carvacrol caused the highest toxicity, showing a synergistic effect against larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> with FLC index of 0.79, whereas an additive effect was observed (FLC = 1) against eggs (
