<p class="p">DHA and EPA from AOCED were clearly bioavailable as demonstrated by the dose-dependent increases in levels of these fatty acids in plasma of dogs in both generations (Figs

The essentially linear plasma DHA profiles observed in both dams during gestation and lactation and puppies during growth indicate that DHA levels had approached the steady state shortly after GD 28 and increased only incrementally thereafter (Figs
