<p class="p">In the present study, average daily AOCED intakes in the mid-dose group were approximately 250 mg/kg body weight/day during gestation, ~640 mg/kg body weight/day during lactation, and about 440 mg/kg body weight/day during growth, based on the food consumption and body weight data. These levels are higher than those used in most reported dog studies [

A recommended allowance for the combination of DHA and EPA for dog growth and reproduction was set by the National Research Council publication on Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats at 0.5 g/kg diet on dry matter basis, equivalent to 0.05 wt% [

 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The diets in our study contained nominal total DHA and EPA amounts of 0.12% (the control), 0.44% (the low-dose AOCED), 0.83% (the mid- dose AOCED) and 1.69% (the high-dose AOCED); therefore, all exceeded the recommended allowance and even the safe upper limit in the high-dose diet. However, there were no treatment-related adverse effects noted at any dose level in any phases of the study.
