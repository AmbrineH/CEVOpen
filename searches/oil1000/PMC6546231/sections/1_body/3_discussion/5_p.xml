<p class="p">No changes in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were noted in the test diet groups during the growth phase (Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217794.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). Further, coagulation parameters were not affected by the AOCED dietary treatment (
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). In addition, no increases in petechiae or hematomas developing from the handling and blood collection during the study were observed in the AOCED groups. Therefore, it was considered that animals across all groups had normal platelet activity.
