<p class="p">Benefits of dietary supplementation with n-3 LC-PUFA have been documented in several species, including dogs and cats (reviewed in [

Based on the scientific evidence indicating that n-3 LC-PUFAs are needed for the development of the nervous and visual systems during fetal and neonatal life stages, the Canine Nutrition Expert Subcommittee of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) established a dietary minimum concentration of EPA plus DHA at 0.05% on dry matter (DM) basis for growing and reproductive dogs [

Most canine studies have been conducted with fish oils as omega-3 PUFA sources, and in some of them relatively high doses of omega-3 fatty acids were used for the management of several conditions, such as joint health, osteoarthritis, atopic dermatitis and cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders [

 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Among detrimental effects which may occur with high dose supplementation of LC-PUFA, changes in coagulation and immune functions were suggested, as well as gastrointestinal disturbances and some other effects resulting from rancidity of LC-PUFA [
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. NRC set a dietary safe upper limit of EPA plus DHA for adult dogs at 11g/kg on a DM basis or 1.1% DM [
