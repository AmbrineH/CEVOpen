<p class="p">Although most commercial pet foods contain a source of n-3 LC-PUFA, this source is primarily fish oil obtained from fatty fish, such as menhaden, anchovies, herring and mackerel. High demand for fish meal and oil for both human and animal nutrition increases the impact on ocean resources, endangering fish stocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, fish do not synthesize these fatty acids 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic>, lacking the required key enzymatic activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Instead, fish obtain DHA and EPA from their diet in the form of plankton/single cell algae. Large-scale fermentation technology has made it possible to by-pass the marine food chain and produce DHA and EPA oils directly from microalgae. An Algal Oil Containing EPA and DHA (AOCED) produced from 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. was developed as an alternative source of LC-PUFA without risk of environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and PCBâ€™s. It enables the animal nutrition industry to keep up with the increasing demand for EPA and DHA without endangering fish stocks.
