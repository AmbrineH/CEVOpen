<p class="p">An algal oil similar to AOCED and also produced from the same species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> (named Algal Oil hereafter) has been used in human nutrition as a food ingredient and dietary supplement. Results of the comprehensive Algal Oil toxicity testing including a 90-day subchronic dietary study in rats and three genetic toxicity assays have been published [
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Algal Oil was non-mutagenic with respect to gene mutations, clastogenicity and aneugenicity, confirming that algal oils do not have genotoxic potential. The results of the rat study demonstrated safety of Algal Oil at extremely high intake levels. There were no treatment-related effects noted at any dose level. Based on these results, the no observable adverse effect level for Algal Oil was established at 5 wt% in the diet, or at the highest tested dose. This dose corresponded to an overall average Algal Oil intake of 3250 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rats.
