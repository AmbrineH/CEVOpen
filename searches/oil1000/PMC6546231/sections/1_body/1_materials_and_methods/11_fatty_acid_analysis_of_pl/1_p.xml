<p class="p">Blood samples (3 mL each) were collected from dams during the pretreatment period for a baseline, after 4 to 5 weeks of dietary treatment and at weaning. Blood samples (2 mL each) were also collected from all selected weaned puppies at weaning and during Weeks 13 and 34, at approximately the same time on each occasion. Samples were collected by jugular venipuncture into tubes containing K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-EDTA as anticoagulant and separated to plasma and red blood cells. Plasma was shipped on dry ice to OmegaQuant (Sioux Falls, SD, USA) for fatty acid analysis. The fatty acid analysis was done by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID). Plasma samples were directly trans esterified with 14% boron trifluoride, toluene, methanol; 35:30:35 v/v/v. Tricosanoin was added as an internal standard, (NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN). Samples were heated 45 minutes at 100°C. The Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) were extracted with hexane (EMD Chemicals, USA) and washed with water. An aliquot of the hexane layer was analyzed using a GC-2010 Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Columbia, MD) equipped with a SP-2560, 100-m fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.2 um film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Fatty acids were identified by comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids (GLC-782, NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN) and expressed as concentrations, μg of fatty acid per mL of plasma.
