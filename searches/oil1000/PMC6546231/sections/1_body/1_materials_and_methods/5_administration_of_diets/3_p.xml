<p class="p">Starting at 5 weeks of age and until weaning, puppies were provided with a feeding pan (approximately 300 g of feed). During that period, the daily food intake was calculated for the dam plus its litter (i.e.: dam’s bowl, plus feeding pan) since the dam also had access to the feeding pan. After weaning, puppies selected for the study continued on their mothers’ respective diets (approximately 400 g per day/dog for a 6–8 hours daily feeding period) for the additional 26 weeks until they reached 34 weeks of age. Puppies remained pair-housed for feeding during the first two weeks post-weaning to confirm ability to thrive, and then were individually housed for feeding for the remainder of the study.</p>
