<p class="p">Each dam was assigned an animal number determined randomly. Females were assigned to different dietary groups based on an assignment number. Blinding in the study was applied to the identity of the test and the control diets assigned to each experimental group (i.e., Groups 1 through 4). Only animal numbers (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) were maintained in the electronic data capturing system. Therefore, there were no indicators of animal assignment to treatment groups in the data capturing system until the study was unblinded after cessation of treatment. Personnel involved in the data collection were blinded to the experimental treatments. The access to the document with the animal assignment table was restricted to unblinded personnel which included a study director, a clinical pathologist, the pharmacy and veterinary staff, and the departmental team leaders. The unblinded personnel did not participate in direct data collection. This exception to the blinding requirement was necessary to permit adequate monitoring and quality checks during the study and to ensure animal welfare.</p>
