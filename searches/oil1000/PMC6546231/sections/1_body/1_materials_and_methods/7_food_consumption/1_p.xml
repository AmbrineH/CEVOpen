<p class="p">Individual food intake was measured daily throughout the study, starting at initiation of feeding the reference/the control diet (3â€“14 days prior to treatment start). In addition to the daily food consumption, achieved intakes were calculated on a weekly basis. Any spilled food was also weighed daily for each cage, unless contaminated with liquid or solid material (e.g. water, urine, feces, etc.). The amount of contaminated food (excluded from the spillage measured value) was visually estimated and documented.</p>
