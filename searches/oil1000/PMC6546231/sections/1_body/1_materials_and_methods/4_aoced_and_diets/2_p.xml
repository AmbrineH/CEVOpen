<p class="p">Experimental diets were manufactured at Kansas State University (Manhattan, KS, USA) in May 2017. The diets, including the control, were formulated by DSM Nutritional Products to meet the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profile for Growth and Reproduction (AAFCO, 2016). The dry kibble diets were manufactured using a Wenger X20 extruder and then dried in a Wenger dryer. They were cooled before coating with flavors and a mixture of chicken fat and fish oil (control), or a mixture of chicken fat and AOCED (AOCED-containing diets). The diets were made isocaloric with the control diet. The nutrient levels of the experimental diets were confirmed to meet or exceed the AAFCO minimums but not exceed the maximums via analysis by Eurofins (Des Moines, IA). Ingredient composition of the Base Kibble is presented in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217794.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>. AOCED levels were verified by measurements of the DHA and EPA content in the diets. Samples from each formulation were collected upon manufacture and shipped to Eurofins for analysis. Diets were coded with letters, numbers and colored labels to protect blinding.
