<p class="p">Diets were stored at room temperature throughout the study. Samples from each diet were collected in duplicates at the study start (Day 1 of dosing), at two-month intervals throughout the study, and at the end of the study. One set of samples was shipped after each collection point at ambient temperature to DSM analytical lab (Dartmouth, Canada) for measurements of DHA and EPA concentrations and peroxide value determination. The retention samples were stored at room temperature at Citoxlab until the study completion for a re-analysis. Fatty acid analysis of dietary samples collected throughout the study confirmed acceptable levels of EPA+DHA which ensured proper AOCED dosing of animals. Recovery values were generally above 80% of the EPA+DHA values determined by Eurofins upon diets manufacture and specified in the certificates of analysis. Peroxide values were below 10 mEq/Kg throughout the duration of the study.</p>
