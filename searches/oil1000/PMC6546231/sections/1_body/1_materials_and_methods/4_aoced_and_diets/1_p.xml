<p class="p">Dosing of AOCED was confirmed with batch records and analytically, using combined DHA+EPA as a reference for AOCED addition level. The nominal content of DHA+EPA in AOCED is 50% but can vary depending on the production lot. The AOCED lot VY00015572 used for the test diets preparation contained DHA at 42.7 area% of total fatty acids (400.3 mg/g oil) and EPA at 13.6 area% of total fatty acids (124.7 mg/g oil). Therefore, the total DHA+EPA content was 56.3 area% or 525 mg/g oil. Arachidonic acid was present at 1.99 area% of total fatty acids. The peroxide value of the oil was 0.30 meq/kg and p-anisidine value was 2.9.</p>
