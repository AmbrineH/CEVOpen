<p class="p">Fatty acid concentrations in the dietary samples collected during the study were analyzed at DSM analytical lab (Dartmouth, Canada). Samples were lyophilized and then homogenized with a food grinder. The samples were dissolved in equal parts toluene and 1.5N HCl in methanol. Tricosanoin was added as an internal standard (NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN). Samples were heated for 2 hours at 80°C and neutralized with 6% sodium carbonate solution. Aliquots of the organic layer containing the FAMEs were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph equipped with a FAMEWAX 30m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA). Fatty acids were identified by comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids (GLC 714, NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN). Fatty acid composition was expressed as a weight percent (% w/w) of total identified fatty acids in a sample.</p>
