<p class="p">For parameters with only one timepoint within a period, with only one sex and without baseline value, a one-way ANOVA was applied, e.g. for pre-treatment body-weights of dams. If a baseline, i.e. pre-treatment value was also available then ANCOVA was applied, including the baseline as covariate, e.g. for clinical pathology measurements of dams at weaning. Analysis on pre-weaning puppies included only those selected to continue on study after litters were equalized.</p>
