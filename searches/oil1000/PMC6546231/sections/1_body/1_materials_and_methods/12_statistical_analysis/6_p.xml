<p class="p">Three-way repeated measures ANOVA were used for longitudinal analyses on puppies, where males and females had to be differentiated, and when more than one follow-up timepoint within a period was available, e.g. for body weight of puppies post-weaning. The fixed effects in the model were the treatment group, sex, time and their two-way and three-way interactions with the animal as subject. For the pre-weaning period, the statistical unit was the puppy nested within litter.</p>
