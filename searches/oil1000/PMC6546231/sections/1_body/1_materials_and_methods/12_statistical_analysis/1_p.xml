<p class="p">The statistical analyses for this study were designed with reference to the Guidance for Industry #226: “Target Animal Safety Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis” of the Center of Veterinary Medicine (CVM), a division of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As recommended by the guidance, no statistical adjustments for multiplicity were applied to avoid false negative findings and the significance level for comparisons against the control group was α = 0.1 for safety endpoints. In the context of toxicology, this is a statistically conservative approach because it increases the probability of identifying adverse effects, and thus reduces the risk of overlooking any potential safety issues. The interpretation of the results was based both on statistical significance and clinical relevance, as recommended by the guidance.</p>
