<p class="p">At birth, number of live, dead and malformed puppies was recorded. Gross abnormalities (if any) were recorded. In addition, number of male and female puppies in each litter was determined by visually judging the anogenital distance and/or presence of a vulva or penis. Recordings of live and dead puppies continued daily from PPD 0 until weaning on PPD 56.</p>
