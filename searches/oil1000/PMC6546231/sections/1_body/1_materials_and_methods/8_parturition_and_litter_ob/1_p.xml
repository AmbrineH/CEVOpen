<p class="p">Dams were monitored for signs of parturition at least 3 times daily starting from gestation day (GD) 55. Body temperature was measured twice daily (12 Â± 1 hour apart) starting on GD 55 until the first signs of parturition were observed. Body temperature was also measured daily from GD 52 to 54 for baseline acquisition. The time of onset and completion of delivery was recorded for each animal when possible. The day when parturition was completed was termed as PPD 0. Any signs of difficulty in parturition were recorded.</p>
