<p class="p">Blood samples were collected via venipuncture of the jugular vein for hematology and clinical chemistry from all dams once during pretreatment and at weaning. In addition, coagulation and urinalysis were performed on all puppies during Weeks 13 and 34; while hematology and clinical chemistry evaluation was performed at weaning and every two months thereafter for a total of 4 occasions during the growth phase. Blood samples for hematology (1.3 mL) were collected into tubes containing K
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-EDTA as anticoagulant. Samples for coagulation (1.0 mL) were collected into tubes containing citrate as anticoagulant while clotting activator gel was in the tubes used for collection of clinical chemistry samples (1.1 mL). Animals were fasted overnight (approximately 8â€“9 hours) before blood samples collection.
