<p class="p">The animal room environment was set to maintain a relative humidity of 50 ± 20%; a light dark cycle of 12 hours /12 hours, and 10–15 air changes per hour. The room temperature was maintained at 21 ± 3°C from the study start until approximately 2 weeks prior to parturition when it was increased to maintain 24 ± 3°C until PPD 42. From PPD 43 (of the youngest litter) until the end of the study, the temperature was returned to 21 ± 3°C. Municipal tap water, exposed to ultraviolet light and purified by reverse osmosis at Citoxlab North America only, was provided to the animals
