<p class="p">Clinical signs were recorded twice daily throughout the study. The observations included evaluation of general appearance, fur condition, activity, and other indicators of changes in animal health and behavior, including gait and mobility. Litter checks were performed once daily (concurrently with a clinical sign activity) until PPD 56. A detailed physical examination was performed on each animal on the day of estrous and on the day of treatment initiation, and monthly thereafter. The last physical examination was performed on the day prior to or on the day of the animal release from the study. During the examination, animals were observed while in a cage for behavior, general appearance, coordination, and then removed from the cage for close evaluation of general condition of the whole body including head, thoracic, and abdominal areas through examination and palpation. Body temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate (counts per minute) were also evaluated.</p>
