<p class="p">Body weights and body weight changes were recorded for all dams on the day of estrous and on the day of treatment initiation, and weekly thereafter. Puppies were weighed every 3 or 4 days, i.e., PPD 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, etc., until weaning, and weekly thereafter. Body weight measurements were also performed on dams and puppies on the day prior to their release from the study.</p>
