<p class="p">No changes in hematology, clinical chemistry and coagulation parameters were noted in puppies fed the test diets compared to those fed the control diet at the study completion (Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>). Differences were observed in some hematology parameters over the different time points during the study, but they were transient and consistent with normal biological variability in growing dogs and thus considered incidental. No changes were noted in coagulation parameters during the study at both measurements (
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Creatinine values increased over time in all animals with primary increases by PPD 168 and peaking at PPD 224. This was expected due to increased muscle mass during the growth period and was noted in all groups, including the control.
