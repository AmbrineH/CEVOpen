<p class="p">There were no clinical observations in puppies from birth (PPD 0) to weaning (PPD 56) that were considered attributable to the dietary treatments. Clinical signs included skin changes (bruises, dryness, redness, lump, scabbed and wounded), tail kinked, firm/soft swelling of flank or cervical dorsal areas, and fur thin/dull/stained. Most adverse clinical observations of decreased activity, weakness, recumbency, body thinness, cold to touch, signs of dehydration, etc., were noted prior to PPD 5, generally in puppies that did not survive. These observations were considered incidental since they occurred across all groups including dogs in the control groups, are common in puppies of this age and species, and showed no relationship to dose levels in incidence or severity.</p>
