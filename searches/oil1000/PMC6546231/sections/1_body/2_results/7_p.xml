<p class="p">There was no AOCED related effects on litter size or viability index at birth (
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The percentage of live puppies at birth varied from 89% in the control group to 100% in the high dose group. Mean body weights of puppies at birth were overall similar across groups with a trend to higher values in the low- and mid-dose AOCED groups both in males and females (
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). There were no detrimental AOCED effects on the puppy viability before PPD 4 and survival indices up to PPD 56. On the contrary, the viability and survival indices were generally higher in AOCED groups, especially in the high dose group where only a single death was observed out of 38 born puppies (
 <xref rid="pone.0217794.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). After PPD 4, there was only one mortality observed across all groups: the last live puppy of the mid-dose dam mentioned above died on PPD 5, leading to a release of the dam from the study.
