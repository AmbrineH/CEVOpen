<p class="p">In puppies, the administration of AOCED in the diets started in utero, and thus resulted in plasma DHA and EPA increases compared to those in the control at all timepoints (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217794.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). There were no differences between genders in plasma DHA and EPA levels at any measured timepoint, therefore, sexes were combined. At weaning on PPD 56, the puppiesâ€™ plasma DHA and EPA levels in the test groups were significantly higher than those in the control group, indicating that the maternal fatty acid status affected their offspring. For plasma DHA, there were statistically significant differences between the low- and mid-dose AOCED groups but not between the mid- and high-dose groups at weaning and Week 13 of age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217794.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). At the study completion when puppies were 34 weeks of age, plasma DHA levels did not differ significantly between the low- and mid-dose AOCED groups but were different compared to the high-dose level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217794.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). The increases in plasma EPA levels were dose dependent across all three dose levels at all measured timepoints (
