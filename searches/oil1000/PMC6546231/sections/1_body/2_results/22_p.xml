<p class="p">Plasma arachidonic acid (ARA) levels in the high-dose AOCED group were lower compared to that in the control at weaning (p&lt;0.05). Plasma ARA levels were 853 ± 59, 775 ± 79, 754 ± 118 and 479 ± 72 μg/mL in the control, AOCED low-dose, AOCED mid-dose, and AOCED high-dose groups, respectively. By Week 13, the differences with the control reached statistical significance in all AOCED groups (data not shown). At the study completion at Week 34, the concentrations were 1091 ± 114, 954 ± 130, 810 ± 76 and 745 ± 109 μg/mL in the control, AOCED low- dose, AOCED mid-dose, and AOCED high-dose groups, respectively, with the mid- and high- dose levels being significantly lower than the control (p&lt;0.05).</p>
