<p class="p">In contrast to increases in DHA and EPA, plasma arachidonic acid levels declined by the end of lactation in AOCED mid- and high-dose groups compared to the control although differences reached statistical significance in the high-dose group only (p&lt;0.05). The concentrations were 1000 ± 136, 964 ± 131, 809 ± 185 and 641 ± 94 μg/mL in the control, AOCED low-dose, AOCED mid-dose, and AOCED high-dose groups, respectively.</p>
