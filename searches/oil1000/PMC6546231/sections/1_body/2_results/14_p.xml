<p class="p">Body weights of puppies after weaning are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217794.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. From weaning (PPD 56) onward, mean body weights of the low- and high-dose puppies were increased compared to the control in both sexes, reaching statistical significance on most occasions from PPD 182 onward. Consequently, the overall mean body weight gains for the whole growth phase (PPD 238 compared to PPD 56) in the low- and high dose groups were generally above the control mean. However, the same was not true for the mid-dose group. In males of the mid-dose group, mean body weights in the second half of the growth phase were even lower than those in the control (
