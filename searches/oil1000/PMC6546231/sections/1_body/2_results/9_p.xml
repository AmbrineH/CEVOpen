<p class="p">At weaning on PPD 56, one puppy from AOCED high dose group exhibited red buccal discharge, retching, labored and increased respiration, as well as being cold to touch. These clinical signs were observed shortly after blood sampling and therefore were considered procedure-related. Due to the animal condition, it was released from the study on PPD 56 and replaced by a spare from the same litter to continue to the growth phase of the study.</p>
