<p class="p">There were no statistically-significant differences between groups in body weights during gestation but there was a trend to higher body weights and body weight gains in all AOCED groups compared to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217794.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). During the lactation period (PPD 0–56), average body weights of females were comparable across groups: 10.0 ± 0.6, 10.0 ± 0.8, 10.2 ± 0.7, and 10.4 ± 1.2 kg in the control, AOCED low-dose, AOCED mid-dose, and AOCED high- dose groups, respectively. Similarly, average body weight changes from PPD0 to PPD 56 were not affected by the test diets: 0.11 ± 0.03, 0.02 ± 0.06, 0.04 ± 0.07, and 0.13 ± 0.06 kg in the same group order as above.
