<p class="p">The composition of the organic fraction of MSW widely differs according to the place and time of collection; in contrast, the composition of FSCW is dependent on the nature of the original raw materials. Although biosurfactants and biopesticides are produced from food waste fermentation, the most common microbial bioconversions relate to the production of bioethanol [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Furthermore, as a result of the high moisture content of the organic fraction of MSW, incineration is highly energy-intensive; concurrently, landfilling poses numerous pollution issues and its direct application as animal feed bears significant risk with regard to the propagation of diseases [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Therefore, anaerobic digestion (AD) is the preferred treatment route for food waste because its multiple steps and microorganisms can degrade different types of biomass into biogas.
