Although most of the amino acids and minerals such as Fe, Zn, and P are found in the floret fraction, stems contain most of the sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, and maltose). Broccoli leaves contain a high concentration of calcium, manganese, carotenoids, chlorophylls, vitamins E and K, as well as total phenolic content, all known by their antioxidant activity. Broccoli leaves also presented the highest myrosinase activity, which might translate on the generation of potent anticancer compounds. Therefore, these results might support future consumption of broccoli agrowaste as well as the extraction of its nutraceutical compounds.
