<p class="p">The recovery of carotenoids from fruit and vegetable wastes by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was studied in De Andrade Lima et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Fibre content (both type and concentration) on vegetable and fruit matrices is critical because it may render the extraction of targeted molecules through SFE challenging by limiting their dissolution into the solvent phase. A mixed sample of 14 vegetable samples was employed to simulate an applicable and economically feasible industrial scenario in which SFE waste extraction within an industrial establishment/processor recovers and exploits value-added components from multiple vegetable- and fruit-derived by-products and waste streams. The SFE process was able to extract carotenoids from a mixed fruit and vegetable matrix, with high recovery levels (74% to 99%
