<p class="p">Although AD is a reliable technology for converting waste to energy, an increase in methane concentration could facilitate its co-use with natural gas. However, the low economic performance of the process, due to low methane content, may incur limitations, particularly in terms of the biodegradability and inhibition of substrates, given the presence of substances with antimicrobial actions such as
