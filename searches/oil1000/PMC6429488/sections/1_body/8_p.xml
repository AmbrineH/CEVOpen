 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] evaluated three types of confectionary waste, comprising chocolate bars, wafers, and filled wafers, for biogas production. All three substrates resulted suitable for AD with a high content of biogas being produced (on the range of 60–73%). Although all substrates presented yields between 70% to 90% of the theoretical potential, higher efficiencies were achieved for the filled wafers and lower efficiencies for the wafers. Chocolate bars presented a higher acidification and thus lower pH and higher volatile fatty acids accumulation, which resulted in lower than expected efficiencies due to substrate composition. The study also proposed an estimation of theoretical potentials on the basis of substrate chemical composition. Although confectionary waste seemed to have a high biodegradability, enhancing methane production, MSW as a substrate for AD is known by its low methane production. This is mainly due to the lower biodegradability of the organic fraction of MSW in comparison with food waste as well as its high solids concentration, which usually require a longer hydrolysis time. To enhance biogas production, Seruga et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] investigated the effect of the introduction of co-substrates to increase methane production while stabilizing the fatty acids accumulation on a thermophilic AD process to enhance the hydrolysis of solids. The organic fraction of MSW was obtained from a full-scale mechanical biological treatment and was co-digested with restaurant waste, corn whole stillage, or effluents from the cleaning of chocolate transportation tanks, all of which were by-products or wastes from the food supply chain. Additions of 5–15% of co-substrates increased the biogas yield by 20–31%. Co-digestion also allowed the treatment of substrates with high organic concentrations, such as restaurant waste, which usually presents overloading issues in AD with the accumulation of fatty acids and process destabilization. Co-digestion can be also applied to reduce the concentration of inhibitory compounds in AD, such as

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] presented a two-step AD process to treat citrus waste. The study aimed to investigate the effect of recirculation from the second to the first step of biogas production. Citrus waste was primarly digested in a stirred tank reactor; the liquid fraction was then fed into an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed. When recirculation was applied, methane yields doubled on average, solids reduction was 33–35% higher, and the reactor performance was more stable. Recirculation helped to maintain the pH around 5–6 during the first step, stabilizing the hydrolysis-acidogenic process, despite the presence of
