OMW has a dark color, strong odor, and (phyto-)toxic properties, mainly attributable to its high quantities of phenolic compounds; it is also characterized by remarkably high biological (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). To this end, waste bioremediation was also targeted through the reduction of color and phenolics concentration of OMW. Partial or total substitution of water with OMW could support microbial growth and citric acid production in the yeast
