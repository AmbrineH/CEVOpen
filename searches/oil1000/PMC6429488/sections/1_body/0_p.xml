<p class="p">Circular economy and bioeconomy concepts have been introduced within an EU framework to sustainably overcome the dominant development model of “take, make, and dispose”, which has contributed to current economic, environmental, and societal burdens. Although the circular economy focuses on enhancing the efficiency of resource utilisation, bioeconomy relies on the conversion of renewable carbon reserves, derived from organic wastes as well as agricultural or forestry biomass, into diversified end-products and materials [

Therefore, the organic streams, which are generated along the food supply chain and are not aimed for human consumption, are an excellent feedstock to utilise within a circular bioeconomy. This Special Issue presents a series of studies that evaluate the potential recovery of targeted molecules from the food waste supply chain as well as enhancements to current technologies.
