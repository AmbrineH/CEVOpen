<p class="p">Biorefinery concepts could be a core element for the exploitation of biomass/waste towards the manufacture of marketable intermediates and end-products [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], being the variability of food waste quantities the key factor for process design. It would be beneficial to extract valuable compounds from uneatable waste for valorisation processes, if it was possible, to manufacture new products for human consumption; however, the influence of the state of the feedstock (e.g., spoilage level) on the quality and quantity of the extracted materials must be assessed [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00978" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The recovery of nutritional, functional, and textural properties from the food supply chain waste will be an important future driver. For example, new food industry additives could be derived from protease inhibitors (appetite suppressants) from potato or essential oils, flavonoids, and pectin from citrus waste or other bioactive compounds including polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamins, antioxidants, flavonoids, and fibers extracted from vegetable and fruits waste [
