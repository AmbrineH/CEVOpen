<p class="p">Biobased feedstocks are the alternative source for future energy, chemicals and materials. Not only because petroleum-based feedstocks are a finite resource, but because of their environmental burden and their need to be functionalized with, for example, oxygen and nitrogen, which are already present in biomass [

Every year, 1.3 billion tones of municipal solid waste (MSW) are accumulated globally, a number projected to expand to 2.2 billion tones by 2025. Waste should be viewed as a bioresource; such a perspective would ease its management, which is currently based on landfilling and incineration, with only a 38% being recovered. The organic portion of MSW is approximately 46%

Through enhanced resource efficiency, feedstock requirements for European industries could be reduced up to 24% by 2030, a figure achievable along the value chains [
