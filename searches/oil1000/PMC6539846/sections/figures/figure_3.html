 <p> Relative contents of the common peaks in total ion chromatography (TIC) of FA from two species ( A) α-pinene, ( B) Camphene, ( C) β-Myrcene, ( D) α-Phellandrene, ( E) d-Limonene, ( F) Terpinolene, ( G) Linalool, ( H) Camphor, ( I) Borneol, ( J) α-Terpineol, ( K) Bornyl acetate, ( L) α-Cadinol and ( M) α-Santalol. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. *** p &lt; 0.001, ** p &lt; 0.01compared with FALX. Blue dots meant the relative content of the common peaks in each FAL sample; while red dots meant those in each FALX. sample. </p>
