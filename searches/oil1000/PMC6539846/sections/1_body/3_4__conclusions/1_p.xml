<p class="p">In the present study, an efficient strategy for species identification of FA was developed by GC-MS analysis and chemometric methods. GC-MS fingerprints showed that FAL and FALX. were similar and had 13 common peaks. Yet at the same time, the difference was also very significant. First of all, the main component of the volatile oils was different. Bornyl acetate had the largest relative peak area in FA ranging from 41.32% to 60.20%, while in FALX. camphor accounted for the highest percentages ranging from 29.07% to 44.76%. Moreover, some markers with important identification values were found. Cis-nerolidol was only found in FAL, not in FALX, and the other eight components, bornyl acetate, α-cadinol, linalool, camphor, β-myrcene, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, terpinolene and borneol, could also be used as the distinguishing components by the unpaired T-test. Moreover, chemometric analysis based on the GC-MS spectrum including HCA, PCA and PLS-DA showed that there were significant differences in the volatile components of FAL and FALX., and the samples from the same variety were clustered together. In short, GC-MS analysis combined with chemometric methods could efficiently distinguish FAL and FALX.
