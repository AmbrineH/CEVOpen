<p class="p">HCA is a clustering technique that measures either the difference or the similarity between the objects to be clustered. Based on the relative contents of each component in the essential oil, the samples of FA with close similarities will be crudely classified into the same cluster by HCA. All the test samples were performed using a Ward method to visualize the differences and/or similarities among samples through Euclidean distance. The results showed that the samples were clustered into two groups. The first group included S1~S9 (FAL) and the second group covered S10~S20 (FALX.). In other words, FAL and FALX. could be distinguished based on the composition of the oils. The results are shown in
