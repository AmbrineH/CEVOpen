<p class="p">Both HCA and PCA could clearly clarify the composition of the two species, but failed to find out the variables for sample classification. Therefore, a supervised PLS-DA technique was used to visualize the variations among these samples. R2X, R2Y and Q2Y levels obtained by PLS-DA were 0.840, 0.972 and 0.962 respectively, which were suitable for fitness and prediction. Based on the PLS-DA, a loadings plot was drawn to exhibit the contribution of each variable to the discrimination of FAL and FALX. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01663-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the 13 common peaks were listed in order according to their contribution value. Eight components with variable important plot (VIP) values greater than or equal to 1.00 were selected as the potential markers, namely bornyl acetate, α-cadinol, linalool, β-myrcene, camphor, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, terpinolene and borneol. Notably, the unpaired T-test proved that all of the selected constituents could distinguish FAL from FALX. Therefore, these markers could be used for species identification and quality control of FA. Considering that the volatile oil of FA exhibited various activities, it is worth studying whether the above compounds are responsible for these activities. The results are shown in
