<p class="p">In order to find the marker compounds for chemical comparison of FAL and FALX., an unpaired T-test was employed for analyzing the relative contents of the common peaks of FA. The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value was set as the filtering standard in order to maintain the contents. The relative contents of the two compounds, camphor and bornyl acetate, regarded as the main chemical components in the essential oils of FA, were significantly different in FAL and FALX. In the FAL samples, the relative contents of bornyl acetate were the highest, ranging from 41.32% to 60.20%, with an average of 49.16 ± 5.13%, while that of camphor was the second highest, ranging from 16.84% to 28.90% with an average of 22.81 ± 3.79%, and the relative contents of both were above 70% with an average of 70.97 ± 2.14%. Meanwhile, in FALX. samples excluding S16, the relative contents of camphor were the highest ranging from 29.07% to 44.76% with an average of 36.13 ± 4.18%, and those of bornyl acetate were the second highest, ranging from 15.85% to 31.63% with an average of 24.51 ± 4.10%. The sum of the relative contents of the two was above 56% with an average of 60.64 ± 2.54%. In general, the relative contents of bornyl acetate in FAL were significantly higher than in FALX., but those of camphor in FAL were significantly lower than in FALX. In addition, the relative contents of other common peaks in the two species of FA were also obviously different. The relative contents of β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, camphor, α-terpineol, α-cadinol and α-santalol in FAL were 2.49~3.38%, 0.29~0.39%, 6.70~8.31%, 0.23~0.28%, 0.25~0.85%, 1.89~4.66%, 0.26~0.36%, 0.16~0.37% and 0.16~0.34%, successively. The relative contents of those in FALX. were 3.89~6.07%, 0.21~0.30%, 8.10~11.35%, 0.18~0.23%, 1.76~3.62%, 3.79~8.09%, 0.31~0.57%, 0.80~1.79% and 0.40~0.87%, respectively. Among these figures, the relative contents of α-phellandrene and terpinolene were significantly higher in FAL than in FALX., while β-myrcene, 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, linalool, camphor, borneol, α-terpineol, α-cadinol and α-santalol were significantly lower in FAL than in FALX. Furthermore, whether in FAL or in FALX., bornyl acetate and camphor were the two highest percentage compounds and accounted for more than half of all oil samples. Bornyl acetate, the quality control component of FA in Chinese pharmacopeia, always accounted for a higher percentage in FAL than in FALX. Wei et al [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01663" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that bornyl acetate accounted for more than camphor in FAL according to nine reports from 1985–2000. Comparatively, the percentage of camphor was significantly higher in FALX. than in FAL (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the ratio of the percentages of bornyl acetate to camphor was significantly higher in FLA than in FLAX. Therefore, it was concluded that FAL was a plant characterized by bornyl acetate while FALX. seemed to be a plant whose oil was mainly dependent on camphor. As was already known, bornyl acetate exhibited anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01663" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] effects while camphor showed various pharmacological effects including anti-tussive [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01663" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] activities. However, no report regarding the pharmacological differences of FAL and FALX. has been seen, which hinders the development and rational utilization of FA. Further study is needed to compare the bioactivities of the two species.
