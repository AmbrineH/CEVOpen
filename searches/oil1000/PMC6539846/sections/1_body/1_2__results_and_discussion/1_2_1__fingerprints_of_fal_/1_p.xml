<p class="p">According to total iron chromatography (TIC), the chemical composition of the two species was similar in general but still had some difference. The number of peaks of FALX. from 17 min to 25 min was higher than that of FAL. The peak, whose retention time (RT) was 21.345 min) identified as cis-nerolidol, appeared only in the chromatogram of FALX., but its relative percentages were too low, at only 0.23% to 0.48%. The chromatograms of FAL possessed 16 common peaks while those of FALX. had 17 common peaks. Among the above peaks, 13 common peaks, whose total areas accounted for above 90% of the volatile constituents and represented the chemical characteristic of the samples well, could be found in the chromatograms of FAL and FALX. The results are shown in
