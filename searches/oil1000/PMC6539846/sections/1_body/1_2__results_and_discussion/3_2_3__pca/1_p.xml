<p class="p">To provide more information about differentiation of the origins of FA samples, PCA was performed based on the 13 common peak areas. It was applied in order to reduce the number of variables (13 variables corresponding to the components in essential oil from FAL and FALX.) to a smaller number of new derived variables (PCs) that adequately summarize the original information. The first two PCs explained approximately 83.9% of the original data variability (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01663-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. From the PCA scatter plot, FAL (S1~S9) and FALX. (S10~S20) were divided into two areas respectively, which was similar to the result of cluster analysis. Moreover, the dots which presented S1~S9 were relatively nearer to each other, suggesting a closer relationship among the nine batches of FAL. The dots of S10~S20 were relatively scattered, indicating diversification of the 11 batches of samples. It was indicated that the chemical composition of FALX. was less stable compared with FAL. This was probably because the FALX. samples were collected from many parts of Asia, for instance, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar and Yunnan, compared with FAL, which was cultivated only in the south and southeast of China. The results are shown in
