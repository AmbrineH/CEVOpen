<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies apparatus 7890A-5975C with HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was applied as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and interface temperature was 280 °C. The initial oven temperature was kept at 60 °C., then it was gradually raised to 124 °C at 4 °C/min, to 196 °C at 8 °C/min, to 260 °C at 10 °C /min and finally kept for 2 min. The spectrometer operated at 70 ev with the full scan style. The injection mode was split with a 60:1 (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) ratio. Retention indexes (RI) were calculated for the common components using a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes injected in conditions identical to those of the samples. Identification of the common components was based on their RI relative to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes and comparison with the published literature. Then, the components of the volatile oil were positively identified using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 14.0 Mass Spectra Database. The semi-quantitative analysis of volatile compounds was performed by comparing their peak areas in the GC-MS total ion chromatogram. The percentage compositions of compounds were calculated by area normalization method.
