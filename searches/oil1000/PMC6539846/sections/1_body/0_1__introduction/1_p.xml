<p class="p">Fructus amomi (FA), also called Sharen, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It was firstly recorded as a medicinal resource in Yao Xing Lun (Tang Dynasty), and has a long medical history of more than one thousand years for treating gastrointestinal diseases and pregnancy-related diseases in China. In Chinese Pharmacopeia (2015 version), FA is defined as the dried ripe fruit of three ginger plants—

 <italic class="italic">A. villosum</italic> Lour. var. 
 <italic class="italic">xanthioides</italic> T. L. Wu et Senjen, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. longiligulare</italic> T. L. Wu [

 <italic class="italic">A. villosum</italic> Lour. (FAL) are called Yang Chun Sha, while those of 
 <italic class="italic">A. villosum</italic> Lour. var. 
 <italic class="italic">xanthioides</italic> T. L. Wu et Senjen (FALX.) are called Lv Ke Sha. Although the two species are used in the same way according to Pharmacopeia, it is generally acknowledged that FAL is more highly regarded by the general public, and considered one of the four most famous TCMs in the South of China, with a high price. In the Chinese market, FAL costs five to ten times more than FALX. Therefore, FALX. is often used as a counterfeit version of FAL because of their similar appearance and close genetic relationship. Precisely, they both originate from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Amomum</italic> in the Gingeraceae family, and possess indistinguishable shape, color, surface characteristics, odor and other characteristics. Therefore, it is imperative to clarify the differences between the two species and to obtain valuable additional evidence for identification.
