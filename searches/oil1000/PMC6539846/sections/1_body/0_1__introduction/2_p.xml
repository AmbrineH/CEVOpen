<p class="p">To date, there are relatively few studies on the identification of FAL and FALX. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was reported to differentiate FA (including FAL and FALX.) from other confusable varieties, but could not distinguish FAL from FALX. [

However, because FA is the dried processed product of the fruit, most of the DNA is degraded and destroyed during the processing. It is difficult to extract high quality DNA, therefore, the DNA barcode is not suitable for the identification of dried FA.
