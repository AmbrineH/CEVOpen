<p class="p">Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive strategy combining GC-MS analysis and chemometric methods was firstly proposed to compare FAL with FALX. Precisely, GC-MS combined with chemometric methods including HCA and PCA was employed for the identification of the volatile oils in the two confused species, while unpaired student’s–T-test (T-test) and PLS-DA were utilized to discover the potential chemical markers for discriminating these two herbal medicines. The aim of the present study is to investigate the chemical differences in the volatile oils between the two confused species of FA, by GC-MS in general and in detail.</p>
