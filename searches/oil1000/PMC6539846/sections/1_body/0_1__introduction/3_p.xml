<p class="p">FA is rich in volatile oil. Several studies have reported that the volatile oil of FA and its major compounds not only possessed anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, but also could be regarded as potential drugs for digestive diseases which cannot be effectively treated by chemicals, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis and inflammatory bowel disease [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01663" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Therefore, volatile oil is regarded as the main active ingredient of FA. However, non-volatile compounds of FA showed few activities, according to the previous reports. Therefore, the volatile oil of FA is the quality control component in Chinese pharmacopoeia. Moreover, in order to differentiate FAL from FALX., it is necessary to find an efficient approach to distinguish the volatile oil of FAL and FALX. by their chemical composition. Steam distillation combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is used as the routine method for the analysis of the volatile oils of FA [
