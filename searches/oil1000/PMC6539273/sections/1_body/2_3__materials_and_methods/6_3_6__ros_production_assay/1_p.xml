<p class="p">ROS production was determined by monitoring L-012-enhanced CL, which represents a sensitive and reliable method for detecting ROS production [

 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL in HBSS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> supplemented with 40 µM L-012. Cells (100 µL) were aliquoted into wells of 96-well flat-bottomed white microtiter plates containing test compounds (final DMSO concentration of 1%). Neutrophils were stimulated by the application of 100 nM PMA. Luminescence was monitored for 60 min (2-min intervals) at 37 °C using a Fluroscan Ascent FL microtiter plate reader (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA, USA). To calculate IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, individual ROS responses were normalized to the maximal response in a given experiment, which was assigned a value of 100%. Curve fitting (at least five or six points) and calculation of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were performed by nonlinear regression analysis of the dose–response curves generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
