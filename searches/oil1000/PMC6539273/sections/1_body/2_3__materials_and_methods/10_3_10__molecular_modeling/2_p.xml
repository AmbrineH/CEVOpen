<p class="p">DFT calculations were performed with the ORCA 4.1.1 program (Max Planck Institute fuer Kohlenforschung, Muelheim/Ruhr, Germany, December 2018) on a computer operating under Windows Server 2016 (16 Ã— 2.4 GHz CPU, 16 Gb RAM). The BP86 functional [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] were applied. The attainment of real energy minima on geometry optimizations in vacuo was confirmed by frequency calculations. The obtained results were visualized and analyzed with the use of Chemcraft graphical software for the visualization of quantum chemistry computations (
