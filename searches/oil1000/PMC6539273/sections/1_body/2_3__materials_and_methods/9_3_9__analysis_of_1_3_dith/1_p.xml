<p class="p">Biotransformation of 1,3-dithiane in culture medium from HL60 cells was evaluated by GC-MS analysis. HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 4 mM 1,3-dithiane for 0, 1, and 5 h at 37 °C. The samples were extracted with methanol for 4 h and then centrifugated. GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC with a 5890A mass-selective detector (MSD) system. A Restek Rtx-VMS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 1.40 μm film thickness) was used with He as the carrier gas (2.0 mL/min). GC oven temperature was kept at 30 °C for 1 min, increased to 250 °C at a rate of 11 °C/min, and kept constant at 250 °C for 4 min. The split ratio was adjusted to 10:1, and the injector temperature was 250 °C. Commercial 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide was used as a reference. The MS parameters were as follows: transfer line temperature was set at 250 °C, source temperature at 230 °C and quad temperature at 150 °C. Acquisition range was set between 30 and 550 amu at a scan rate of 5.2 scans/sec. Standard 1,3-dithiane and 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide were injected to identify the retention time. Under these conditions, 1,3-dithane eluted at 15.1 min and 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide eluted at 21.6 min. The corresponding M
