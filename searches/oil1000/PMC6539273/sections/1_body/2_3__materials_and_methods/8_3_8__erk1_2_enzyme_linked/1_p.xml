<p class="p">Differentiated HL60 cells were incubated for various times (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 min) with 500 µM of 1,3-dithiane or negative control (1% DMSO) at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (R&amp;D Systems), and the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were measured in the cell lysates using an ELISA kit for human phospho-ERK1 (Thr202/Tyr204)/ERK2 (Thr185/Tyr187) (R&amp;D Systems). The concentrations of phospho-ERK1/2 in the cell lysates were determined using a calibration curve with recombinant human phospho-ERK2 (Thr85/Tyr187).</p>
