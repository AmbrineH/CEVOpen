 <sub class="sub">i</sub>) were measured with a FlexStation 3 scanning fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Briefly, human neutrophils were suspended in HBSS
 <sup class="sup">-</sup>, loaded with Fluo-4AM at a final concentration of 1.25 μg/mL, and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. After dye loading, the cells were washed with HBSS
 <sup class="sup">–</sup>, resuspended in HBSS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, separated into aliquots, and aliquoted into the wells of flat-bottom, half-area well black microtiter plates (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well). Test compounds diluted in DMSO were added to the wells (final concentration of DMSO was 1%), and the changes in fluorescence were monitored (λ
 <sub class="sub">ex</sub> = 485 nm, λ
 <sub class="sub">em</sub> = 538 nm) every 5 s for 240 s at room temperature. The maximum change in fluorescence observed after subtracting the background signal from DMSO-treated cells was used to determine the agonist response. Antagonist activity was evaluated after a 30 min pretreatment with test compounds at room temperature, followed by the addition of the peptide agonist (5 nM 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>MLF). Maximum change in fluorescence during the first 3 min, expressed in arbitrary units over baseline, was used to determine a response. Responses for test compounds were normalized to the response induced by 5 nM 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>MLF, which was assigned a value of 100%. Curve fitting (5–6 points) and calculation of median effective inhibitory concentrations (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> or IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) were performed by nonlinear regression analysis of the dose–response curves generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), as described previously [
