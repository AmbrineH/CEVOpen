<p class="p">For the isolation of human neutrophils, blood was collected from healthy donors in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Montana State University (Protocol #MQ041017). Neutrophils were purified from the blood using dextran sedimentation, followed by Ficoll-Paque 1077 gradient separation and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, as described previously [
