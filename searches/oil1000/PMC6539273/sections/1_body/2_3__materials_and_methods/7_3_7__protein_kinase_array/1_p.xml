<p class="p">Analysis of the phosphorylation profiles of MAPKs and related kinases and their substrates was performed using a human phospho-kinase array kit, Proteome Profiler (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The array simultaneously detects 24 kinase phosphorylation sites, including MAPKs (ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK 1–3), p38 isoforms α, β, γ, σ), MSK2, MKK3, MKK6, hsp27, p53, mTOR, Akt 1–3, GSK-3α/β, RSK 1/2, p70S6K, and CREB. For the analysis, differentiated neutrophil-like HL60 cells were incubated for 15 min with 500 µM of 1,3-dithiane or negative control (1% DMSO) at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed, and the arrays were incubated overnight at 4 °C with lysates obtained from 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cells for each sample. The arrays were washed three times with 20 mL of the wash buffer, followed by incubation for 2 h with the detection antibody cocktail containing phospho-site-specific biotinylated antibodies. The wash steps were repeated, the arrays were exposed to chemiluminescent reagents, and the signal was captured with an Alpha Innotech FluorChem FC2 imaging system.
