<p class="p">In contrast to the ROS inhibition exhibited by several compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01809-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), 1,3-dithiane actually activated neutrophil ROS production. This compound stimulated ROS production with unimodal kinetics, which is similar to that observed for other phagocyte activating agents [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01809-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). Note that 1,3-dithiane-stimulated ROS production was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD, 100 U/mL), and 1,3-dithiane had no effect on the ROS assay system in the absence of cells, indicating neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation rather than an artifact (data not shown). Although 1,4-dithiane (an analog of 1,3-dithiane) has not been reported to be present in plant extracts/EOs, it has been reported to be present in products of bacterial fermentation and boiled beef extract [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Thus, we also tested 1,4-dithiane under the same conditions and found that it had no effect on ROS production, demonstrating that the effects of 1,3-dithiane were specific for this compound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01809-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). Since 1,3-dithiane is efficiently oxidized by flavin monooxygenases into the corresponding sulfoxide enantiomer (

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], we could not exclude that the biotransformation products of 1,3-dithiane might also activate neutrophils. Thus, we tested 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide and found that its activity was similar to 1,3-dithiane itself (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01809-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B), indicating that either 1,3-dithiane or its oxide could be responsible for the observed activation of neutrophil ROS production. To further investigate this issue, we incubated HL60 cells with 1,3-dithiane for 0, 1, and 5 h and evaluated the culture medium for oxidation products. Analysis of the cell lysates by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed the

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> of the 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide (M
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) ion to be 136.00. The electron impact (EI) mass spectrum also indicated the presence of trace amounts of 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide, but only after the 5 h incubation, and the identity of this compound was confirmed using a reference compound and the NIST 14 MS library embedded in the Agilent data analysis software (data not shown). Thus, neutrophil activation is primarily due to 1,3-dithiane, especially during the earlier treatment times evaluated in this study (0–60 min), whereas trace amounts of the oxidation product 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide could contribute to cell activation at much later times.
