<p class="p">The organosulfur compounds and garlic EO were evaluated for their ability to modulate neutrophil ROS production. We found that garlic EO and three of the individual compounds (diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, and allicin) inhibited spontaneous ROS production by neutrophils. These compounds, as well as alliin,

 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-allyl-L-cysteine, and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-allyl-L-cysteine, also inhibited phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated ROS production by these cells (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01809-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Ajoene and allicin were the most potent inhibitors of neutrophil ROS production. It should be noted that during the process of steam distillation, allicin, which is a precursor of ajoene, is completely eliminated from garlic EO [
