<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was monitored as L-012-dependent chemiluminescence (CL). EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the dose-response curves, as described under 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot5-molecules-24-01809" class="xref">Section 3.5</xref>, and are presented as the mean ±S.D. of three independent experiments. For the stimulation of ROS production, neutrophils were pretreated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (100 nM). N.A., no inhibitory activity was found at concentrations up to 50 µM. 
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>Instead of inhibition, 1,3-dithiane directly activated neutrophil ROS production (see below).
