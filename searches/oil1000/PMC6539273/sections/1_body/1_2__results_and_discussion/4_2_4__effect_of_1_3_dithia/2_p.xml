<p class="p">Activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 1,3-dithiane was one of the primary responses observed in our kinase array (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01809-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we further characterized the time-dependent modulation of this response and found that activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was maximal after a 15-min treatment with 1,3-dithiane (
