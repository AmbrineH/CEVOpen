<p class="p">To estimate the reactivity of 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane in biological environments, we performed a theoretical study of the molecules using the density functional theory (DFT) method. For geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations, the BP86 functional [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] were used. At this level of theory, high-quality results can be obtained for conformations, energies, and electronic properties of organic compounds [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The values of Gibbs energies indicate that the two dithianes are thermodynamically most stable in the “chair” conformation, for which we have analyzed their calculated properties. We found that 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane differ markedly in their electronic structures. In contrast to the zero polarity of 1,4-dithiane, the calculated dipole moment equals 2.11 D for 1,3-dithiane, which is very close to the experimental values of 2.13 and 2.09 D measured in tetrachloromethane and benzene solutions, respectively [
