<p class="p">Chemical hardness, calculated as a HOMOâ€“LUMO energy gap [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], is equal to 4.460 eV for 1,3-dithiane and 4.972 eV for 1,4-dithiane, also indicating the higher chemical reactivity of 1,3-dithiane, including reactivity to possible biotargets. Thus, the characteristics of the electronic structure obtained from the DFT calculations differ noticeably between the two dithianes, which may explain their differences in biological activity. Further studies are needed to examine the molecular targets of 1,3-dithiane or its biotransformation products that could be involved in phagocyte stimulatory effects.
