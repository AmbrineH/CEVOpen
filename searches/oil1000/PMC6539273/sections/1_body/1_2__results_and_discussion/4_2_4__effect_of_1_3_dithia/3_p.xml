 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], the current study is the first to report the biological effects of 1,3-dithiane, a small molecule organosulfur compound identified in

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Here, we found that 1,3-dithiane stimulates ROS production by human neutrophils, and this response was inhibited by specific inhibitors of PI3Kβ, γ, and δ. Activation of PI3K signaling usually occurs following the stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [

PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-(4,5) bisphosphate to form phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), and the accumulation of PIP3 facilitates the localization of Akt to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation following phosphorylation. PI3K/Akt signaling regulates many of the molecular mechanisms contributing to increased ROS production through the phosphorylation and activation of NADPH oxidase subunits [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Indeed, we found that 1,3-dithiane stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB and GSK-3α/β in differentiated HL60 cells. It should be noted that PI3K generation of PIP3 could directly or indirectly affect CREB phosphorylation [
