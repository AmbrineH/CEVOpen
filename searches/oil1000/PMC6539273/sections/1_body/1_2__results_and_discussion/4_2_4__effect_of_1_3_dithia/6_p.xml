<p class="p">The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies were equal to −0.702 eV (1,3-dithiane) and −0.280 eV (1,4-dithiane). The difference in LUMO energies of &gt;0.4 eV is substantial and indicates that 1,3-dithiane is a better electron acceptor and can relatively easily form an anion-radical via one-electron reduction. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) have a smaller energy difference (−5.162 and −5.252 eV for 1,3- dithiane and 1,4-dithiane, respectively). Nevertheless, the HOMO of 1,3-dithiane is higher in energy (less negative value) than that of 1,4-dithiane. This reflects a higher tendency to oxidation, in accordance with previous results [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], and the greater ability of 1,3-dithiane to form complexes with transition metals. It should also be noted that HOMOs in both dithianes are localized mainly on sulfur atoms participating in complexation with metal ions (see the isosurfaces of frontier orbitals in
