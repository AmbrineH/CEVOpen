 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. To evaluate the effects of 1,3-dithiane on the activation of a number of signaling kinases, including the three major MAPKs, ERK1/ERK2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK 1–3), four p38 MAPK isoforms (α, β, δ, and γ), and other intracellular kinases such as mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 2 (MSK2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein, heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), p53, Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)1/2, MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6), and p70 S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1), we evaluated the global intracellular kinase signaling response to 1,3-dithiane in differentiated neutrophil-like HL60 cells with a human phospho-MAPK array. Differentiated HL60 cells were pretreated for 15 min with 1,3-dithiane (500 µM) or 1% DMSO (control), and the levels of protein phosphorylation in the cell lysates were evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01809-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, treatment with 1,3-dithiane significantly (≥two-fold) increased the phosphorylation of p38α (Thr180/Tyr182; fold increase (FI) = 2.3), p38δ (Thr180/Tyr182; FI = 2.3), JNK2 (Thr183/Tyr185, FI = 2.0), ERK1 (Thr202/Tyr204, FI = 2.1), ERK2 (Thr185/Tyr187; FI = 5.5), CREB (Ser133; FI = 2.9), GSK-3α/β (Ser21/Ser9; FI = 14.8), GSK-3β (Ser9; FI = 6.4), and mTOR (Ser2448, FI = 2.7).
