 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that some allyl-containing garlic-derived organosulfur compounds, including diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide, can induce Ca

Here, we show that several pure organosulfur compounds, including allyl propyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, and AITC activate neutrophils, resulting in increased intracellular Ca

Thus, further studies are needed to examine the specific mechanisms and targets involved.
