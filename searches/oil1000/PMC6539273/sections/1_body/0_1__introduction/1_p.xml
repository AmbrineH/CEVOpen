<p class="p">Garlic and onion are important in the diet and have been reported to benefit human health [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For example, compounds in garlic and onions have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-asthmatic, antidiabetes, antithrombotic, and antiplatelet activities [

 <italic class="italic">Allium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ferula</italic> species, and essential oils (EOs) isolated from these spp., are rich in organosulfur compounds [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of garlic EO was associated with suppressed neutrophil infiltration into tissue and with lowered levels of certain soluble and cellular adhesion molecules generated under inflammatory conditions [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Approximately 100 organosulfur compounds have been identified in garlic EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Allium sativum</italic>, with diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl methyl sulfide, and diallyl trisulfide as the principal compounds [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Moreover, novel sulfides called garlicnins have been isolated from
