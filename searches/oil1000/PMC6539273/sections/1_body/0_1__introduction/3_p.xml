<p class="p">In the present study, we evaluated the effect of garlic EO and pure organosulfur compounds on neutrophil functional activity. All of these compounds were previously reported as components of garlic EO or mustard, garlic and onion extracts. We showed that allyl-containing organosulfur compounds and 1,3-dithiane activated human neutrophils, resulting in increased [Ca

Given the critical role played by phagocytes in innate immunity against pathogens, our data support the possibility that allyl-containing organosulfur compounds and 1,3-dithiane could be effective therapeutic modulators of innate immune responses.
