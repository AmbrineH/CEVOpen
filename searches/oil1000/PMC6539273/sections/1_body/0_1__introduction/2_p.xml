<p class="p">Neutrophils are key components of the innate immune system and play an integral role in normal tissue homeostasis, although their dysregulation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, infectious disorders, and certain autoimmune diseases [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes and the final effector cells of innate immunity, with a primary role in the clearance of extracellular pathogens. They can directly interact with macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells in order to either potentiate or resolve both innate and adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Consequently, the identification of substances that can modulate neutrophils is of great interest, and it is well established that a wide range of plant-derived compounds exhibit beneficial pharmacological effects via their ability to modulate phagocyte functions [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Indeed, several plant-derived small molecules have been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory activity via the regulation of neutrophil function [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Recently, we found that

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Onion extracts and garlic EO contain many organosulfur compounds, but only a few of them have been evaluated with phagocytic cells. For example, diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide suppressed endotoxin-induced neutrophil infiltration and damage in rat intestines [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Moreover, diallyl disulfide decreased nitric oxide (NO) production, with a reduction in the levels of interleukins (IL)-6 and IL-1Î² produced by macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01809" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The differential efficacy of these major organosulfur compounds on the suppression of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS) expression and NO production by macrophages was related to the number of sulfur atoms [
