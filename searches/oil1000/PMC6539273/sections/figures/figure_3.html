 <p> Effect of 1,3-dithiane on protein kinase phosphorylation in differentiated HL60 cells. The cells were treated for 15 min with 1,3-dithiane (500 μM), and the levels of protein phosphorylation in cell lysates were evaluated using a human phospho-kinase array. Statistically significant differences (* p &lt; 0.05) between 1% DMSO (control, dash line) and 1,3-dithiane-treated cells are indicated. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. of duplicate samples from one experiment that is representative of two independent experiments. Inset: Effect of 1,3-dithiane on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in differentiated HL60 cells. The cells were treated with 1,3-dithiane (500 µM) for the indicated times, and the levels of ERK phosphorylation were evaluated using an ELISA for human phospho-ERK1/2. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. Statistically significant differences between cells treated for 0 min (* p &lt; 0.01) are indicated. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. </p>
