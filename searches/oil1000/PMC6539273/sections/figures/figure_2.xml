  <p class="p">Effect of 1,3-dithiane, 1,4-dithiane, and 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide on human neutrophil ROS production. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>). Effect of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors on 1,3-dithiane-induced ROS production. Neutrophils were treated with 1,3-dithiane (200 μM), 1,3-dithiane (200 μM) in the presence of the indicated PI3K inhibitors A66 or PI 3065 (150 nM each), or DMSO (control), and L-012-dependent CL was monitored for 60 min. Representative of 3 independent experiments. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>). Concentration-dependent ROS production induced by 1,3-dithiane and 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide. Neutrophils were treated with the indicated concentrations of 1,3-dithiane, 1,4-dithiane, or 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide, and L-012-dependent CL was monitored for 60 min. ROS production monitored for 60 min is shown (% of control). (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>). Concentration-dependent inhibition of 1,3-dithiane-induced ROS production by selected PI3K inhibitors. Neutrophils were treated with 1,3-dithiane (200 μM) or 1,3-dithiane (200 μM) in the presence of varying concentrations of the indicated PI3K inhibitors, and L-012-dependent CL was monitored for 60 min. Inhibition of ROS production monitored for 60 min is shown (% of control). The data in Panels B and C are presented as mean ±S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment that is representative of three independent experiments.
