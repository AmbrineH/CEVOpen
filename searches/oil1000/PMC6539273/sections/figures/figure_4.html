 <p> Isosurfaces of frontier orbitals in 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane. ( A) and ( B) represent lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane, respectively. ( C) and ( D) represent highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane, respectively. A contour value of 0.03 for the isosurfaces was used. </p>
