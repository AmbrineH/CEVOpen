 <p class="p">Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) of talinolol (TAL) were developed using lipid formulation classification systems (LFCS) that improved the solubility and released the drug completely in dissolution media. 
  <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> toxicity studies with human red blood cells (RBC) showed that the SNEDDS formulations were non-toxic to human RBC. The oral bioavailability of TAL was significantly enhanced by the SNEDDS formulation in rats. Schematic Diagram: 
  <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic> processes occurring after ingestion of SNEDDS formulations developed based on LFCS.
