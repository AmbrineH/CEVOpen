 <p> In vitro toxicity test of pure TAL, Blank SNEDDS (drug free), and TAL loaded SNEDDS on blood erythrocytes. The extent of damage caused to blood erthyrocytes by TAL was measured as percentage lysis of total (RBC) red blood cells added. The data is a mean Â± SD of three set of different experiments. Formulation represents F6 SNEDDS [I308:TC(1:1)/HCO30(1/1)]. </p>
