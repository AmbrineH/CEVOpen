<p class="p">Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems is an efficient, elegant, and more patient compliant formulation approach for poorly water soluble drugs. It may enhance drug solubility, dissolution behavior in the GIT, gut permeability and thus may increase the absorption of the poorly water soluble model drug, TAL (
