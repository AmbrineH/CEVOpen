<p class="p">The most efficient SNEDDS formulations were selected according to the preliminary assessment studies and optimal solubilization capacity of the TAL. The dissolution studies of the selected SNEDDS formulations were performed using an automated dissolution tester (LOGAN Instrument, Corp., Somerset, NJ, United States) connected to an automated sample collector (SP-100 peristaltic pump, Somerset, NJ, United States). The standard USP II (Model UDT-804, LOGAN, Inst. Corp., United States) paddle method was used at 37 ± 0.5°C. The volume of the dissolution medium was 500 ml MilliQ water with pH 1.2 and 6.8 to simulate stomach and intestinal media respectively (

The drug loaded formulations (encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules, size “00”) were dropped into dissolution medium using capsule sinkers to prevent the capsules from floating in the medium. The capsule was filled with SNEDDS (equivalent to 50 mg of TAL) and the commercial tablet Cordanum
