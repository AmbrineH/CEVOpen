<p class="p">Liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) procedure was used for the extraction of TAL from the rat plasma. The plasma samples (≈100 μL) were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The internal standard solution (25 μg/ml in methanol) was added to the plasma sample and vortexed. Plasma protein precipitation was carried out by addition of 1.0 ml methanol to the plasma sample. The sample tubes were vortexed for 5 min (

The dry residue was then reconstituted with 125 μl of mobile phase, and vortexed. The concentration of TAL in the reconstituted residue was determined by a modified UHPLC method reported earlier (
