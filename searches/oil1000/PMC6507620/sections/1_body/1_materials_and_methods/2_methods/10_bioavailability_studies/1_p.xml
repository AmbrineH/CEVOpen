<p class="p">Healthy male Wistar rats (200 ± 20 g) were obtained from the Central Animal House Facility of the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) and maintained in plastic animal cages; six animals were housed per cage with a 12-h light/dark cycle, at 25 ± 2°C. This study was carried out in accordance with the principles of National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23; 1996). The study was approved by the animal facilities guidelines from the Ethical committee of Experimental Animal Care Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University (Clearance No. 5698; December, 2016). The animals were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experiments. The animals were divided into two groups (total 12 rats; 6 rats in each group) and fasted for 12 h before the experiment to avoid any food–drug interaction, but were provided
