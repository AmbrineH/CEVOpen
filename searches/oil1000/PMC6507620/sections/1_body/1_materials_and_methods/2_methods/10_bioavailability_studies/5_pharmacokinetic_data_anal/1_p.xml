<p class="p">A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis method was used to investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of TAL. Microsoft Excel was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters from the experiments. Area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated with the help of the linear trapezoid method. The relative bioavailability of the representative SNEDDS to the control was calculated as follows: Relative bioavailability % = AUC
 <sub class="sub">SNEDDS/</sub>AUC
 <sub class="sub">control</sub>. The apparent elimination half-life (T
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub>) was determined as 0.693/K
 <sub class="sub">el</sub>. The maximum plasma concentration (C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) and time to maximum concentration (T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) after oral administration were determined directly from the concentration versus time curve.
