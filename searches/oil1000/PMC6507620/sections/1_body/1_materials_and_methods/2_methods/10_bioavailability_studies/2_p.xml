<p class="p">The bioavailability of a selected SNEDDS formulation of TAL [F6, I308: TC (1:1)/HCO-30 (1/1)] was compared with pure TAL powder. Both, SNEDDS formulation of TAL (diluted with normal saline, 1:10 ratio) and pure TAL powder (suspended in normal saline, 17.5 mg/ml) were administered orally at a dose equivalent to 10 mg/kg of TAL. Blood samples (200 μL) were collected from fossa orbital’s vein under light anesthesia to minimize pain to the animal (
