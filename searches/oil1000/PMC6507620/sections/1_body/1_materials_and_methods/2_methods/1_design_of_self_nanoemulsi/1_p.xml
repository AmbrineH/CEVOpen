<p class="p">The self-emulsifying formulations were prepared using different natural/semi synthetic oils, lipophilic/hydrophilic surfactants and water-soluble cosolvents. Different types of excipients were made to establish a wide range of self-emulsifying compositions. A whole range of formulations and alternative formulations (F and AF) from LFCS Types I to IV were prepared and studied using 10 components; M812, COFA, I988, I308, P25MCT, CMCM, S767, TO-106V, HCO-30, TC, and by changing one excipient at a time.</p>
