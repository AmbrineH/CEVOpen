<p class="p">The droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential (surface charge) of all the representative diluted “F” and “AF” systems were measured by a laser light diffraction analysis technique using Zetasizer Nano (Model ZEN3600, Malvern, United Kingdom) particle sizing systems. The formulations were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic> with water and mixed well for 1 min. The diluted samples were transferred into cuvettes and 10 repeated readings were performed for each sample. Samples from each three (3) separate batches of a formulation were used to determine the droplet size and zeta potential values.
