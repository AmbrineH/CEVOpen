<p class="p">At the end of each digestion experiment, three samples of 2 mL of digestion mixtures were transferred into polyallomer centrifuge tubes and 20 μL of 4-bromophenylboronic acid was added to each sample to prevent further lipolysis. Samples were then ultra-centrifuged (model Optima
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> MAX-E-100K; Beckman, Palo Alta, CA, United States) at 80000 rpm for 50 min at 4°C utilizing a SW-60 swinging bucket rotor to separate the different digestion phases. After ultracentrifugation, the formulation digests were separated into an aqueous phase and a precipitated pellet phase. In this study, only two of the LFCS Types IIIB and IV representative formulations were used, where Type IV was explored as an example of the extremely hydrophilic formulation to compare their performance under the same experimental conditions. Sample obtained from each of the separated phases was analyzed for drug content by UHPLC as described previously.
