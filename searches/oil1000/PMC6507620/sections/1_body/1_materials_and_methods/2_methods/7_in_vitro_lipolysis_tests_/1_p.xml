<p class="p">For each lipolysis test, 250 mg of TAL loaded formulation was dispersed to 9 mL of a digestion buffer under fed (101 mM NaOH, 144 mM Glacial acetic acid, 203 mM NaCl, pH 5.0) and fasted (10.5 mM NaOH, 28.6 mM NaH

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galia et al., 1998</xref>) were included in the digestion mixture, which is the ratio secreted in bile. The lipid formulations were emulsified in the mixed micellar solutions prior to enzyme addition by stirring continuously for 10 min in the thermostatic jacketed glass reaction vessel. Experiments were performed at 37Â°C and 1 ml of pancreatin extract containing 800 tributyrin units of pancreatic lipase was then added to initiate lipolysis (

Lipolysis was allowed to continue for 30 min using a pH-stat titration unit (902 Titrando by Metrohm AG, Switzerland), which maintained the constant pH at 6.8. The fatty acids produced on lipolysis were titrated with 0.2 M NaOH for all the formulations.
