<p class="p">Anhydrous formulation represents the pre-concentrate, which can have maximum drug loading capacity. The solubility of TAL in the formulations was determined using the common shake flask method. Samples were prepared by adding an excess amount of TAL to the formulations followed by subsequent shaking with the vortex mixer for 3 min at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) to ensure adequate mixing. After incubation in a dry heat incubator at 37°C for 7-days period; the samples were removed for solubility determinations. The samples were placed in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuged (at 13000 rpm for 10 min) to separate excess solid drug from the dissolved drug. Then, an aliquot of the supernatant was taken by weight (approximately 50 mg) and diluted in 25 ml of acetonitrile. The amount of TAL solubilized was analyzed using a validated (UHPLC) method developed in our laboratory. Three replicate samples were considered for analysis of each formulation system.</p>
