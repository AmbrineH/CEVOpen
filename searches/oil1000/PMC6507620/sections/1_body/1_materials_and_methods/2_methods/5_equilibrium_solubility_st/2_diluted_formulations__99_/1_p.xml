<p class="p">An effective way to estimate the likely fate of the drug upon dispersion or dilution with water is to examine its solubility in the maximum diluted formulation (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mohsin and Alanazi, 2012</xref>). By this method one can predict how much TAL can be loaded in the anhydrous formulation and intended dose to be diluted in the average volume of gastric fluids. The 99% diluted formulations were prepared using water as diluent, each 1 mL of the anhydrous formulation (without any drug) was mixed with 99 mL of water (100 times dilution) and vortexed to ensure the formulation was well-mixed. In addition, TAL solubility was performed in water, and bile salt/phospholipid micellar solutions. Samples were prepared by adding an excess amount of TAL to the diluted formulations and shaken with the vortex mixer occasionally while keeping in a dry heat incubator at 37Â°C for a 7-day period, this was needed to see how much TAL remained in the solution after 100 times dilution. After 7 days, the solubility of TAL was determined in the aqueous and 99% diluted formulations by similar method used for the anhydrous formulations above.
