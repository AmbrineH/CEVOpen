For sample preparation, a 100 Î¼l of each formulation was diluted with 10 ml of water in a 20 ml screw capped glass vial (1:100 dilutions) and agitated gently for 1 min at room temperature. For self-emulsifying efficiency, visual assessment method initially is able to minimize the excess usage of chemicals. The visual assessment was observed/recorded immediately after preparation and for several months for each sample.
