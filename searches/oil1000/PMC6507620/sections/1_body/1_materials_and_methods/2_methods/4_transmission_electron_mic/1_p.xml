<p class="p">For the analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), samples were properly diluted with water. A drop of diluted sample was placed on 300 mesh carbon coated copper grid (Ted pella). Grid was left for 5 min to settle down the droplets. Excess of liquid was removed using filter paper and grid was left to air dry. Then a drop of 1% phosphotungustic acid in water was added to the grid. Phosphotungustic acid works as negative stain. Again this left for 5 min to settle down and dried as previous. Finally, dried grid was visualized under Jeol TEM, JEM1010 (Japan) at an operating voltage of 80 kV. Images of the vesicles were captured using iTEM software and olympus Megaview G2 top mounted camera.</p>
