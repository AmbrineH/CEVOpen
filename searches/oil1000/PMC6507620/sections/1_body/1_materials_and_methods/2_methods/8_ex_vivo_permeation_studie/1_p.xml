<p class="p">The male Wistar rats (weighing 200–250 g) were housed in a room temperature and humidity (55% air humidity) with free access to standard diet and water. The rats were fasted overnight, but provided with water only before the study. Animals were sacrificed by spinal dislocation. The small intestine was directly detached after a sacrifice by cutting across the duodenal upper end and the lower end of the ileum and stripping the mesentery. The small intestine was washed out carefully with Kreb’s Ringer phosphate buffer (KRPB) solution using a syringe with a blunt end. The clean intestinal sacs were cut into 6.0 ± 0.5 cm. The selected SNEDDS (F6) were dispersed with 1 mL of KPRB. A suspension of marketed tablet and TAL powder (control) was also dispersed in 1 ml of KRPB at same drug concentration. Six sacs were filled via a blunt needle with SNEDDS (F6) and TC solution (equivalent to 4 mg of the drug) and the other six sacs were filled with an equivalent amount of the tablet and powder suspensions. The two sides of the intestine were tied tightly with a thread. Each sac was placed in a glass test tube containing 10 mL of KRPB solution. The entire system was maintained at 37°C in a shaking water bath operated at 100 rpm and aerated using a laboratory aerator. Samples were withdrawn from outside the sac and the medium was totally replaced by fresh medium over 2 h. Samples were analyzed by UHPLC.</p>
