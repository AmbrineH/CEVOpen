<p class="p">The dissolution studies were performed for various SNEDDS (i.e., F2, F6, AF6, AF7) and the commercial tablet Cordanum
 <sup class="sup">速</sup>. The release of TAL from the F2, F6, and AF7 reached 45% within 5 min versus 13 and 0.5% release from the commercial Cordanum
 <sup class="sup">速</sup> tablet and pure raw powder in the acidic medium (
