<p class="p">It is common that weakly base compounds (pKa &gt; 8) have high solubility in acidic conditions (stomach media) and low in neutral and or basic conditions (intestinal media), as they can be converted into uncharged molecule in neutral and or basic conditions (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shahba et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, basic drugs might dissolve completely in the stomach, maintain drug in solubilized form and later precipitate in the intestine due to sudden changes in pH (pH shift to higher) and/or extensive dilution of excipients. However, the purpose should be to avoid precipitation and maintain the drug in dissolved state in both acidic and neutral/basic media, which will ensure the complete oral absorption of the poorly soluble basic drug compounds. In the present study the developed SNEDDS were able to improve the solubility and dissolution of TAL at pH 1.2 and 6.8, thus more likely to enhance its absorption in gastrointestinal tract (GIT).
