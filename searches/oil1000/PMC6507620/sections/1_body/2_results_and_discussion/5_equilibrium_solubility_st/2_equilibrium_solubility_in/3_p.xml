<p class="p">The combination of Imwitor 308 as oily phase with Transcutol (TC) (1:1) and HCO-30 as surfactant with an equal ratio (F6) showed the higher solubility in both anhydrous and 99% diluted formulations and yielded a transparent clear appearance. On the other hand, Capmul MCM (CMCM) and TC with HCO-30 as surfactant (AF6) have high equilibrium solubility in both anhydrous and 99% diluted formulation and also produced a transparent clear appearance. TC, which is a solubilizer and absorption enhancer, was found to be a very efficient solubilizer of TAL (AF7), and was chosen for dissolution studies.</p>
