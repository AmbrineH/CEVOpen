<p class="p">The key mechanism by which lipid-based formulations improve the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs has been suggested to involve solubilization of drug in bile salt and phospholipid mixed micelles (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Porter et al., 2008</xref>). If these micellar solutions significantly increase the solubility of a poorly water-soluble drug, then the release of bile salt/phospholipid at the time of dosing could improve bioavailability substantially. 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarized the solubility of TAL in bile salt/ phospholipid solutions (FaSSIF and FeSSIF). The solubilization of TAL in water, FaSSIF and FeSSIF solution was investigated. It can be seen from the result that the presence of bile salt/phospholipid increased the solubility of TAL from 0.23 (solubility in water) 2.16 mg/ml (solubility in FaSSIF) and further increased to 4.53 mg/mL due to higher concentrations of bile salt/phospholipid in FeSSIF. The solubility increased in presence of higher bile salt/phospholipid concentration indicates that TAL would be benefited during digestion in the gut under fed/fasted conditions.
