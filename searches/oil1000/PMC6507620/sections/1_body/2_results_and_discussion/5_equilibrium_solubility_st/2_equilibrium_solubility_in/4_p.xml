<p class="p">The data from the 99% diluted formulations in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> can be used to estimate whether or not the solubility of TAL would be exceeded or supersaturated on dilution of each formulation with water. Using these data, the drug can be dissolved at a lower saturation level to avoid any precipitation upon aqueous dilution. For example, if TAL was dissolved at 80% solubility in the anhydrous formulations, its solubility limit will not be exceeded for a sufficient period of time as dilution proceed and the drug may remain in solution. From the overall results, the formulations F2, F6, AF6, and AF7 with higher drug solubility and better aqueous dispersibility (Bluish/Transparent appearance) were chosen for the dissolution studies.
