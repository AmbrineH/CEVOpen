<p class="p">An essential consideration while designing self-emulsifying formulation is avoiding precipitation of the drug upon dilution in the gut lumen 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. Therefore, selection of the suitable oil/surfactant components are crucial for the model drug, which can maintain the drug in solubilized form upon aqueous dilution. The solubility of TAL in aqueous solutions and 99% diluted F and AF formulations depicted in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> confirm that F1 (Coconut oil FA) has an ability of dissolving very large amounts of the TAL in anhydrous pre-concentrate but the formulation appeared immiscible upon aqueous dispersion (large oil globules with low drug solubility), thus it was avoided.
