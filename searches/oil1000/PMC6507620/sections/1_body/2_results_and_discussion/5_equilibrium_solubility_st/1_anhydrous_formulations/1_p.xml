<p class="p">The main objective of this experiment was to increase the solubility of TAL in SNEDDS formulations, thus to reduce the dose and improve the oral bioavailability. The equilibrium solubility of TAL in various LFCS formulations is presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Solubility studies clearly indicated that TAL has high solubility in the formulations containing higher fatty acids. The solubility was also higher in Types IIIB and IV formulations (hydrophilicity increased). Amongst the various formulations, F1, F2, F6, AF6, and AF7 were found to solubilize higher amounts of TAL. The drug loading was found to be comparatively higher in the formulations containing fatty acid (F1) and water soluble cosolvent (AF7).
