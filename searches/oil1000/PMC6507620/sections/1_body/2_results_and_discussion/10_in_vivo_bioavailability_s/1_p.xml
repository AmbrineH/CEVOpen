<p class="p">The pharmacokinetics of SNEDDS [F6, I308: TC (1:1)/HCO-30 (1/1)] containing TAL confirmed the enhancement of bioavailability of the drug (

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of TAL raw powder after oral administration was 340.75 ± 7.80 ng/mL and the T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 1.5 h, while in the oral administration of representative SNEDDS formulation of TAL, the C 
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and T 
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were 593.05 ± 6.04 ng/mL and 1.5 h, respectively. The 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> value of TAL from the SNEDDS formulation was significantly increased (74.04%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The AUC

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> of TAL was also significantly increased in the SNEDDS-treated group as compared to the only TAL powder-treated group (58.33%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), from 927.35 ± 10.02 to 1468.23 ± 18.52 ng h/mL, respectively. The increase in relative bioavailability was found to be 158.33%. The calculated oral clearance was significantly declined (95.95%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from 0.15 ± 0.34 to 0.01 ± 0.0001 mL/kg, while the estimated oral volume of distribution at steady state was significantly decreased (95.70%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) from 0.37 ± 0.84 to 0.02 ± 0.001 mL/kg.
