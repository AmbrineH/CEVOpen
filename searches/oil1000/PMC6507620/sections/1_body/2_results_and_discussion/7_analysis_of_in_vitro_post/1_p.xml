<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> lipolysis tests in a small scale was performed in the current study to understand the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> behavior of the representative SNEDDS. TAL distribution across the digested phases of the representative lipid formulations under fed and fasted conditions are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. The data showed that Type IIIB formulations [I308:TC (1:1)/HCO-30(1/1)] presented comparably higher amount of drug in aqueous phase (AP)both under fed and fasted (59.81 and 66.83%) conditions, although around 80% of the total drug was recovered after 30 min digestion. In contrast, Type IV formulation (extremely hydrophilic, TC) showed only 31.77 and 13.41% drug in AP under fed and fasted conditions after 30 min digestion period from the 97% of total drug recovered (
