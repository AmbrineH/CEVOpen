<p class="p">The overall results suggested that the inclusion of monoglycerides (I308) and surfactant (HCO-30) in the formulation produced fine emulsion on dilution with simulated BS/PL solution and increased the rate of digestion. Therefore, the digestion of this formulation, I308:TC (1:1)/HCO-30(1/1) results high amount of drug in AP comparably with Type IV (lipid free) formulation of TC. Type IV formulation systems have high TAL solubility which may digest well but retain majority of the drug in the pellet phase after digestion as precipitates.</p>
