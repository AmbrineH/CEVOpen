<p class="p">The biorelevant 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> lipolysis model (high physiological relevance) is the key to generate high quality human reference data from the investigation of drug release and absorption of lipid formulation from the GI lumen. During 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> lipolysis studies, the fate of the drug can be determined (whether it is solubilized or precipitated) from the products after completion of the reaction of lipolysis.
