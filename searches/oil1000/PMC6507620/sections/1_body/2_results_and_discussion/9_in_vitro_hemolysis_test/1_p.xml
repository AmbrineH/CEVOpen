<p class="p">The effect of F6 SNEDDS formulation to cause RBC toxicity was studied by 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> RBC lysis (hemolysis) test. 100% lysis of RBC caused by Triton X-100 was used as positive control. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> showed the percentage RBC lysis induced by the representative SNEDDS formulation. In comparison with pure TAL powder and blank F6 (drug free) SNEDDS, insignificant RBC lysis was caused by TAL loaded F6 SNEDDS.
