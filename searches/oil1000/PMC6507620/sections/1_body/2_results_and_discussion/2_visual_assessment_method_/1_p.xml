<p class="p">A visual assessment method was used as a guideline for evaluating the miscibility, homogeneity and the appearance of the formulations. Visual assessment of all Types III–IV (F4–F7, AF4–AF7) formulations confirmed that the emulsion formed upon dilution with water was physically stable for several months. Both lipophillic and hydrophilic surfactants with HLB 10–14 were able to promote self-emulsification of pure oil. However, the resulting emulsions (F2, F3, AF2, Type II) appeared crude (visually turbid/milky, higher droplet size, with lipophilic surfactant TO106V) (HLB number 10.5) (

They provided fine (bluish/transparent systems without any visible particulates), uniform emulsion droplets which are more likely to empty rapidly from the stomach due to their fine particles upon dispersion. The alternative formulation (AF3) produced better appearance and lower droplet sizes compared to F3 within Type II systems. Pure fatty acid and glyceride oils (e.g., COFA- F1 and M812- AF1) showed very poor self-emulsification properties and did not form SNEDDS. They formed oil globules non-dispersed in aqueous media along with turbid appearances.
