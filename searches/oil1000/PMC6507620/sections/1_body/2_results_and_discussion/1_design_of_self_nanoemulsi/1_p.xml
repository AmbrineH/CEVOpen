<p class="p">The Self-emulsifying nature of the various formulations upon aqueous dispersion showed different degrees of transparency ranging from clear to whitish milky suspension of the formulations. The formulations were optimized on the basis of their self-emulsification efficiencies. The compositions of the formulations and the appearance upon aqueous dispersions are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The most interesting formulation systems, which were able to produce nanoemulsions (SNEDDS), belong to the LFCSs Types IIIB and IV. These SNEDDS (
