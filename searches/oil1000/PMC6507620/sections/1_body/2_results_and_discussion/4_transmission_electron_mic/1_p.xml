 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The droplet size was found to be around 150 nm, having size distribution similar to the results obtained by the Zetasizer Nano particle sizing systems. The droplet size upon dispersion determined by TEM imaging techniques also give information on particle shape, which can affect dissolution of the drug. This factor is often ignored in many emulsion development assays, which assume particle shapes as spherical.
