<p class="p">The effect of water soluble components in various “F” and “AF” formulations on the variation of droplet sizes and PDI are clearly shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The Type IV formulation, which contained the highest concentration of water soluble components produced the lowest droplets (F7, 32.57 nm) upon dilution with water. The largest droplet sizes were formed with Type I formulation (AF1, 1274 nm, PDI- 0.88) as it contained 100% oil and the formulation was poorly dispersed in water. As Type II (AF2) formulation contained 0–20% water soluble materials, the droplet sizes considerably dropped down to 231.42 nm (
