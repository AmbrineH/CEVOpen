<p class="p">In addition, the zeta-potential values of all the formulations of TAL were found in between -1.0 and -44.0 mV. However, the zeta potential (surface charge) values of the formulations from -15.0 to -32.0 were expected to be highly stable with no aggregation of droplets in the continuous phase (
