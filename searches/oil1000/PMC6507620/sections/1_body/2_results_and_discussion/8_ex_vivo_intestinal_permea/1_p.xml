<p class="p">The non-everted rat intestinal sac is significantly conducted to confirm the results obtained from the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> release studies and predict 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> absorption of TAL. This experiment provides the benefit of reduction of effort and experimental costs compared with 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> animal studies (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The non-everted sac method was used to evaluate 
 <italic class="italic">ex vivo</italic> intestinal permeation of the selected SNEDDS compared to the pure TAL (control) and marketed tablets. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8A</xref> displays the cumulative permeated concentration of TAL over a period of 2 h. The increased permeated TAL from the SNEDDS (F6) was higher than that permeated from TC (AF7), control and tablet suspensions. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">ex vivo</italic> permeation data were in agreement with the results of the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> release studies. The small intestine permeation of TAL-loaded SNEDDS established up to 20% (F6) in 2 h, whereas exhibited a maximum of 16, 11, and 5% from TC, tablet suspension and control, respectively (
