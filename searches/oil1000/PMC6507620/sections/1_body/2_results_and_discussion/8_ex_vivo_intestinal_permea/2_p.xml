It was observed that a SNEDDS composed of I308:TC/CO30(1/1) in the ratio of 1:1, respectively, showed a significant increase in drug rat gut diffusion. There are different mechanisms could explain the increase intestinal absorption of TAL from SNEDDS formulation. The high permeation might be attributed to the rapid dissolution of TAL in the intestinal sac and a subsequent rapid diffusion. It is supposed that the higher drug absorption is due to the resultant nano-emulsion droplet size from SNEDDS in the intestinal region, which could enhance absorption of TAL (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, nanoemulsion provides a larger surface area available for permeation of the drug through the intestinal membrane. Moreover, the high drug solubility and ability of self-emulsification of the formulation F6 may have contributed to the increased intestinal absorption of TAL. The bio-enhancing activities of the ingredients used in SNEDDS (F6), which contains I308 as surfactant that improve the permeability by disturbing the lipids of the cell membrane. A similar correlation was observed with
