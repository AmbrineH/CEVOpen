<p class="p">The developed SNEDDS formulations showed a high solubility and dissolution profile of TAL in the anhydrous, 99% diluted formulations and maintained solubilized TAL mostly in aqueous phase of the digested samples 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro.</italic> The gut permeability and oral bioavailability of the representative SNEDDS formulation was found to increase by 4- and 1.58-fold when compared to pure raw drug, respectively. The overall results conclude that LFCS Type IIIB lipid-based SNEDDS can be explored as a potential vehicle to obtain higher drug loading, improved dissolution, digestion, permeation and enhanced bioavailability of the poorly soluble drug, TAL with no toxic effects.
