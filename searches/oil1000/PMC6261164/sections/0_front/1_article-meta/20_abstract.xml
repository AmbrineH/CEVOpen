 <p class="p">The objective of this study was to investigate the volatile flavor compounds of 
  <italic class="italic">nkui</italic>, a Cameroonian food, using solid phase microextraction (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">SPME</styled-content>) and a two‐dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">GC</styled-content>×
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">GC</styled-content>‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">TOF</styled-content>‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MS</styled-content> system. Using 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">SPME</styled-content>, volatile compounds were extracted from 
  <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> and analyzed by 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">GC</styled-content>×
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">GC</styled-content>‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">TOF</styled-content>‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MS</styled-content>. The data retrieved revealed the presence of flavor volatiles including acids (20%), alcohols (4%), aldehydes (10%), aromatic compounds (4%), esters (7%), furans (4%), ketones (11%), terpenes and terpernoids (27%). Although the terpene compounds were the most predominant, an ester (linalyl acetate) had the highest percentage of 19%, conferring a sweet, green and citrus flavor. Results obtained from this study suggest that the characteristic flavor of 
  <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> was due to the combination of different volatile flavor compounds, which contributed to its aroma. Considering the medicinal importance of these compounds, their presence positions 
  <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> as a vital food source with health benefits and medicinal properties.
