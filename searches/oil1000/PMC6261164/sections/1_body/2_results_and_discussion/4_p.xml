<p class="p">The largest group of compounds found in the 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> were terpenes and terpenoids (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Terpenes constitute the largest class of natural products and are major sources of natural flavor additives in foods, fragrances, cosmetics, and in alternative medicines (Singh &amp; Sharma, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). They are usually endogenous in plants as secondary metabolites and could also be formed through biosynthesis by certain microorganisms. The major compounds in this category were à‐phellandrene (2%) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), α‐santalene (1.14%), and β‐caryophyllene (1.07%) (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), all causing a peppery, woody, and spicy flavor to
