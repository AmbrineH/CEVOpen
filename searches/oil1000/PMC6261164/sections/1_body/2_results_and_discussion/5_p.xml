<p class="p">According to Takahashi, Sumitani, Inada, and Mori (
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), aldehydes could be formed through the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), either by enzymatic action or autoxidation and lipid peroxidation. Few aldehyde compounds were observed in this study (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with the most significant in terms of % occurrence being 3,7‐dimethyl‐2,6‐octadienal, with a lemon odor. The presence of 3,7‐dimethyl‐2,6‐octadienal has also been reported in several plants and fruits (Burdock, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Similarly, ketone compounds with different chain lengths are abundant in nature and largely contribute to the flavors in plants and spices. Terpenes and their epoxides could possibly react to form ketones and alcohols (Preedy, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Ketones generally occurred in low amounts with relative quantities of 0.63% and 0.46% for 6‐methyl‐5‐hepten‐2‐one and 2‐nonanone, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). 6‐methyl‐5‐hepten‐2‐one (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) is an important flavor compound previously reportedly found in plants (Duke,
