<p class="p">Seven esters were identified in this study with linalyl acetate and terpinyl propionate being the predominant ones, with 19% and 1.5%, respectively, found (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Esters are characterized by pleasant fruit odors that contribute to the aromatic, sweet, and honey notes in foods (Burdock, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Linalyl acetate (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) is a naturally occurring phytochemical commonly found in spices and plants. It is an ester of linalool having a sweet, green, and citrus smell (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Its production from linalool has been hypothesized as being catalyzed by an alcohol acetyl transferase and biosynthesis via the nonmevalonate (1‐deoxyxylulose phosphate) terpene pathway (Harada, Ueda, &amp; Iwata, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>; Zaks, Davidovich‐Rakanati, Bar, Inbar, &amp; Lewinsohn, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Similar to linalool, linalyl acetate have also reported to have anti‐inflammatory, anti‐hypertensive, and analgesic effects (Peana et al.,
