<p class="p">Qualitatively, the acids were the sixth most important group of compounds identified in the SPME‐GC×GC‐TOF‐MS analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In terms of percentage abundance, the major acid observed was acetic acid (1.7%) known to induce a vinegar, sour and pungent odor. Two sulfur compounds identified in this study were disulfide, methyl (methylthio)methyl (3.6%) and trisulfide, dimethyl (0.35%) conferring a sulphurous and alliaceous smell. Also referred to as 2,3,5‐trithiahexane (TTH), disulfide, methyl (methylthio)methyl has been reported as volatile components in 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica</italic> species conferring a sulfury, allecoius odor (Spadone, Matthey‐Doret, &amp; Blank, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Other significant aromatic, bicyclic and furan compounds found were benzene, 1‐methyl‐4‐(1‐methylethyl)‐ (8.2%), 7‐oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan‐2‐one, 6‐methyl‐3‐(1‐methylethylidene)‐ (0.13%) and 2‐furanmethanol, 5‐ethenyltetrahydro‐à,à,5‐trimethyl‐, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>‐ (0.73%), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). These compounds influenced the earthy, herbal, spicy, and minty flavor in 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic>.
