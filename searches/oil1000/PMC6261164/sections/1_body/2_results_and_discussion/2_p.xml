<p class="p">Although a large number of volatile compounds are in foods, only a fraction of them eventually enhance flavor and aroma, as the perception of these sensory qualities is mainly driven by a combination of active volatile compounds sensed in the retronasal and/or orthonasal cavity (Bertuzzi, McSweeney, Rea, &amp; Kilcawley, 
 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). As these compounds have different characteristics, their concentrations can also affect the aroma of the finished food product. To identify the significant compounds that contribute to the flavor of

Although a total of 250 compounds were obtained from the GC profiles, only 92 flavor related compounds were identified and subsequently divided into groups. This consisted of acids (8), alcohols (14), aldehydes (5), aromatic compounds (9), esters (9), furans (4), ketones (12), sulfur compounds (2), terpenes/terpenoids (22), and miscellaneous compounds (2) (Table
