<p class="p">A comprehensive understanding and knowledge of volatile compounds in foods is quite complex and requires an efficient extraction and subsequent analytical technique. While several extraction techniques including solid phase extraction (SPE), stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), pressured hot water (PHW), and liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) are known (Gbashi, Adebo, Piater, Madala, &amp; Njobeh,

 <xref rid="fsn3736-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), challenges around cost, environmental friendliness, ease of extraction, and cross‐contamination are their major challenges. The emergence of solid phase microextraction (SPME) has provided an efficient, robust, selective, cost effective, and environmentally friendly extraction technique and their combination with an effective detection technique offer enormous potentials (George et al.,
