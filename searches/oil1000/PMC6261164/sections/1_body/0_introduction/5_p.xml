<p class="p">GC×GC‐TOF‐MS is sensitive chromatographic technique for both separation and detection of compounds. Its capabilities with includes increased mass spectral identification and deconvolution algorithms, identification abilities, enabled detection of thousands of peaks and the provision of additional data makes it a suitable analytical platform. Its compatibility with SPME for profiling of volatile flavor compounds has been reported (Ding, Wu, Huang, &amp; Zhou,
