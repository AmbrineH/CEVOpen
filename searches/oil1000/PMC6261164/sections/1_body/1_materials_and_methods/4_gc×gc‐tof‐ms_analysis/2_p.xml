<p class="p">Solid phase microextraction analyte samples were analyzed using a LECO Pegasus 4D Time of Flight mass spectrometer (LECO Corporation, St Joseph, MI, USA) equipped with a modified Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), a LECO GC×GC modulator and secondary oven (LECO Corporation, St Joseph, MI, USA) and a split/splitless inlet. The columns set used were: Rxi‐5 SilMS (29.5 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) as a primary column and Rxi 17 Sil MS (0.95 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) as the secondary column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min and an inlet temperature of 250°C. An initial oven temperature of 40°C was set and held for 0.5 min and then slowly ramped at 10°C/min to 250°C and then held for 0.5 min at 250°C. The modulator and secondary oven were run at an offset temperature of 5°C above the primary oven. The mass spectrometer was set up under the following conditions: no solvent delay because it was a SPME analysis; transfer line temperature at 250°C; Electron ionization at −70 eV; source temperature at 250°C; stored mass range: 45–600 μ; acquisition rate: 10 spectra/s for GC×GC‐TOF‐MS; detector offset voltage was set at 300 V.</p>
