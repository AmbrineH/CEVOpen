<p class="p">The extraction of 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> flavor components was done using a 50/30 μm SPME fiber coated with divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA). Briefly, 20 g of the sample was placed in a head‐space vial heated at 40°C for 20 min. Sampling was then done by exposing the fiber to the headspace of the sample for 20 min, after which the SPME device was transferred to the GC×GC‐TOF‐MS equipment for analysis. The process was repeated four times, though before each analysis the fibers were thermally cleaned and conditioned by heating them at 270°C in a stream of helium. A SPME fiber (Supleco, South Africa) was used to sample the volatile compound and immediately injected into a GC‐MS system for analysis.
