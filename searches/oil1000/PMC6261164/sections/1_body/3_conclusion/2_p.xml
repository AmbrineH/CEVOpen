<p class="p">The present work represents a comprehensive study on the volatile flavor profile of 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic>. Using SPME‐GC×GC‐TOF‐MS, this study was able to establish the volatile profile of 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> allowing complementary qualitative information. Findings from this study showed the presence of major flavor‐related volatile compounds all contributing to the flavor and aroma of 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic>. These major compounds were linalyl acetate, linalool, linalyl anthranilate, and 1,6‐octadien‐3‐ol,3,7‐dimethyl, acetate. Such data demonstrate the diverse range of flavors present in 
 <italic class="italic">nkui</italic> and could possibly be potential sources of natural flavors for their use in the food and fragrance industries. Nonetheless, it is recommended to quantitatively analyze these volatile compounds, especially the major ones using reference standards and should be explored in future studies.
