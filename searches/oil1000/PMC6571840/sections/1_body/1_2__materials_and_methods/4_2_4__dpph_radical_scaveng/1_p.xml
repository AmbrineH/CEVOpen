<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was screened by evaluation of the DPPH radical scavenging ability [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Briefly, 10 μL of each plant extract (10 mg/mL) were mixed with 990 μL of DPPH solution (0.002% in ethanol). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, absorbance was measured at 517 nm against a corresponding blank. The antioxidant activity (AA, %) was calculated as: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">AA (%) = (
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub> − 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">DPPH,</sub>
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH solution (in the absence of sample extract) and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorption of sample solution. Assays were carried out in triplicate and ascorbic acid was used as positive control.
