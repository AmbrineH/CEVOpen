<p class="p">Positive samples (capable of inhibiting microbial growth) from the well diffusion assay screening were subjected to a microplate broth microdilution method [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] in order to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Briefly, 100 μL of liquid Mueller-Hinton medium was distributed in each well of a 96-well plate. To the first well of each row were added 100 μL of each extract, positive control or negative control solutions at 1 mg/mL concentration and 1:2 serial dilutions were prepared (1.95–500 μg/mL range). Lastly, 10 μL of bacterial suspension were added to all wells and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Bacterial growth was evaluated with an absorbance microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC, Loughborough, UK) set at 620 nm. Data was expressed as the median values of at least three replicates.
