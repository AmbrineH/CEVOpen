<p class="p">The well diffusion assay was used for screening of the antimicrobial activity. Briefly, 100 µL of microorganism suspension, concentrated at 0.5 in McFarland scale, was inoculated in a Petri dish containing Mueller-Hinton (bacteria) or Sabouraud agar (yeasts). Wells were dug in the agar using a sterile Pasteur pipette. Then 50 µL of each sample (10 mg/mL), negative control (DMSO) or positive control (vancomycin for Gram-positive bacteria, rifampicin for mycobacteria, norfloxacin for Gram-negative bacteria or amphotericin B for yeasts) were added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h the growth inhibition zones around the wells were measured and the results were expressed in millimetres (mm) as median values of at least three replicates [
