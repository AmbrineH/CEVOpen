<p class="p">Dried plants were ground to small pieces and then pulverized. The plant material was extracted using different combinations of solvents (water, methanol, acetone and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and extraction techniques. Each crude extract was separated from the remaining plant material by paper filtration (Whatman paper #1, Sigma-Aldrich) and the organic solvents were evaporated in a rotary evaporator (IKA RV06-ML 1-B, Staufen, Germany) bellow 40 °C while aqueous extracts were freeze-dried as 1 mL aliquots (Freezone 2.5 L, Labconco, Kansas City, USA). Each dried extract was weighted and stored at −20 °C until further use.
