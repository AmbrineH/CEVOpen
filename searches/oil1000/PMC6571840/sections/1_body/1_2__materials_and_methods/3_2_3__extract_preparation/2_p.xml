<p class="p">The aqueous extracts were prepared by decoction (DEC), infusion (INF) or microwave-assisted extraction (MW). In the first procedure (DEC), the plant material (10 g) was boiled in 100 mL of distilled water for 10 min while in the latter procedures the plant material (10 g) was added to 100 mL of boiling distilled water and kept in contact with it for 10 min (INF) or alternatively added to 100 mL of distilled water subject to continuous irradiation (2.45 GHz) for 2 min (MW) in a conventional microwave oven. Organic extracts were prepared by maceration (MA) or ultrasound-assisted extraction (US) by adding the plant material (10 g) to 200 mL of organic solvent (acetone or methanol) kept stirring for 24 h (MA) or sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Bandelin SONOREX RK 510H, Berlin, Germany) at 35 kHz for 2 h (US). Alternatively, supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) was also performed by packing the plant material (30 g) into a 278 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> inox cell and injecting supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) during 3 h at a flow rate of 0.3 kg/h under a pressure of 230 bar and temperature of 40 Â°C [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The remaining plant material resulting from SCFE was recovered, air dried and re-extracted (R-SCFE) by addition to 200 mL of acetone which was kept stirring for 24 h at room temperature.
