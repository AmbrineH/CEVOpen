 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO

 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Briefly, a 96-well microplate was inoculated with approx. 6000 cells per well and incubated for 24 h. The samples were then added to obtain a final concentration of 15 µg/mL. After 48 h the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), fixed with 96% ethanol and stained with crystal violet. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm and the sample cytotoxicity was expressed as the fraction of absorbance comparing with non-treated control cultures. At least two independent experiments were performed, and four replicate cultures were used in each independent experiment. Doxorubicin (5 µM) was used as positive control.
