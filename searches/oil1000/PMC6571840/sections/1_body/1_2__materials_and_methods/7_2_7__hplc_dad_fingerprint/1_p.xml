<p class="p">Chemical characterization of plant extracts, namely their phytochemical profile, was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis performed with an Agilent Technologies 1200 Infinity Series LC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a diode array detector (DAD). A 20 μL sample extract (10 mg/mL) was injected into a reverse phase LiChrospher
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 100 RP-18 5 μm (4.0 × 250 mm) column (Merck) and eluted with a gradient composed of methanol (A), acetonitrile (B) and 0.3% trichloroacetic acid in water (C) as follows: 0 min, 15% A, 5% B and 80% C; 20 min, 80% A, 10% B and 10% C and 25 min, 80% A, 10% B and 10% C. The flow rate was set at 1 mL/min at room temperature. Detection was carried out between 200 and 600 nm. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
