<p class="p">Additionally, the main components of the extracts were identified by pure standards overlay of ultra violet (UV) spectra and retention time [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Standards (1 mg/mL) in methanol were run by injecting 20 ÂµL sample under the same analytical conditions used for the extracts. The UV spectra of each pure compound was retrieved and compared to peaks in the extract with similar retention times. When overlay of UV spectra was observed, a co-elution of the extract with the pure compound was performed for confirmation.
