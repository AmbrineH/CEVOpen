 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus porcatus</italic> Van Jaarsv. &amp; P.J.D. Winter is a highly aromatic plant endemic from the Limpopo province in South Africa, described for the first time in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and its potential medicinal properties are poorly understood. This plant has been briefly studied by our group and a new diterpene with a cycloabietane substructure, (13

 <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-6β,7α,12α,19-tetrahydroxy-13β,16-cyclo-8-abietene-11,14-dione, was obtained from the acetone extract [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], which showed antibacterial activity (62.5 &lt; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &lt; 125 μg/mL) against Gram-positive microorganisms [
