<p class="p">Plants have been used by humans since ancient times for medicinal purposes [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The herbal preparations are important healthcare resources remaining the most affordable medicines in developing countries [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> genus, comprising more than 300 species distributed through tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America, belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes some well-established medicinal genus such as mint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic>), sage (
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic>) and thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic>). The 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species are commonly used as medicinal plants targeting infectious, dermatologic and gastrointestinal pathologies [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Their pharmacological properties have frequently been attributed to the presence of bioactive oxygenated diterpenes from the abietane, kaurane, phyllocladane, labdane, neoclerodane and halimane classes [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In this study, three 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species were selected based on their known and/or potential ethnomedicinal uses, namely 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis, P. neochilus</italic> and the rare 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic>. These aqueous 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> extracts have already been described and are herein compared to the organic and supercritical fluid extracts. The chemical composition and biological activity will also be discussed and compared. Different extraction methodologies (decoction, infusion, maceration, microwave-assisted, ultrasound-assisted and supercritical fluid extractions) using several extraction solvents (water, acetone, methanol and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) were employed. The comparison of all solvents and extraction techniques was analyzed to uncover the efficiencies for each compound extracted. Moreover, the correlation study of the antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of each extract obtained with the corresponding phytochemical composition was also achieved. Antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> extracts was complementary assayed since the therapeutic effect of medicinal plants has frequently been associated with the presence of antioxidant constituents, like phenolic compounds. These can offer protection against radical oxygen species (ROS) damage involved in many pathological conditions, including cancer, although in vivo effects depend on the compound absorption and bioavailability [
