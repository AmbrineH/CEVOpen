<p class="p">In conclusion, the preparation and bioactivity screening of different extracts from the three 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species studied led to the identification of extracts with antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. Thus, the properties of each extract can be attributed to the presence of polyphenolic acids 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> (caffeic, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids) present in most of the extracts along with flavonoid glycosides (rutin 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> and naringin 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>) or abietane diterpenes (7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> and coleon U 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) detected by HPLC-DAD analysis. The methanol extracts were the ones with higher yield, so those with higher content in polar compounds, namely rosmarinic acid 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>. The aqueous extracts do not obtain diterpenoids resulting in no cytotoxic extracts. In addition, the more polar extracts have more antioxidant activity resultant from the phenolic compounds. The acetonic extracts are the ones with a high amount of diterpenes and so those with antimicrobial activity and potent cytotoxic activity. In general, to achieve bioactive 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> extracts attributed to the cytotoxicity, ultrasound-assisted extractions using a low quantity of solvent and rapid efficient extractions should be performed. This comparative study thus contributed to the characterization of bioactivities and phytochemical composition of three 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> species and to the scientific validation of the bioactive 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> ethnomedicinal uses. Additionally, these results highlight the potential use of 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> as a medicinal plant in the future despite its rarity, remoteness and strong smell [
