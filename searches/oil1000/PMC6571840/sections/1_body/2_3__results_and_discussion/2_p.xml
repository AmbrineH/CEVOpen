<p class="p">Antioxidant activity was higher in the methanol extracts (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00179-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) in comparison with the extracts obtained using the remaining solvents, but the antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts is slightly lower than the one of the ascorbic acid, used as positive control in the DPPH assay. Moreover, the most active were the ones obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> (E6 and E7), 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> (E15 and E16) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> (E23 and E24). The aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> also showed relevant antioxidant capacity (62.5–68.9%) in contrast to aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> (10.2–20.6%) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> (3.2–17.3%). Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> were previously described and are in agreement with literature results [
