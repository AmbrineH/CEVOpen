<p class="p">The extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> (E10–E18) were rich in polyphenols, including acids 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, but the flavonoid glycoside 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was also present both in the aqueous extracts (E10–E12) and inaf the organic ones prepared by ultrasound-assisted extraction using either acetone or methanol as solvent (E13 and E15). Polyphenols were also found in most of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> extracts (chlorogenic acid 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> in E20, E22, E25, and E26; caffeic acid

 <bold class="bold">3</bold> in E19 and E26) while flavonoid glycosides rutin 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> and naringin 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold> were present in all aqueous extracts of this plant. Many of those compounds have been shown to possess both antimicrobial [

 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> extracts did not show activities as potent as those of 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> despite their content rich in polyphenols and some flavonoids, the interesting antimicrobial activity of the acetonic extract obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> (E13) by the ultrasound technique could explain the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infection-related symptoms such as cough or chills [
