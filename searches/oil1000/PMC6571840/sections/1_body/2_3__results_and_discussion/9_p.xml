<p class="p">The HPLC-DAD fingerprinting of 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> extracts confirmed the presence of some known compounds identified in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-09-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,

 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, which were present in all of these plant extracts (E1–E9), and the abietane diterpenes 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (E8–E9). Thus, the higher antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of the acetonic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> can be attributed to the presence of these abietane diterpenes, which have been previously isolated from other
