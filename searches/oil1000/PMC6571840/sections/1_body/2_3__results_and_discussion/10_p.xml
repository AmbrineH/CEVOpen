 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> extract (E5) prepared by maceration in acetone. The highest antioxidant activity comparable to that of positive control ascorbic acid was also obtained for this plant methanolic extract (E6) prepared by ultrasound-assisted extraction. Since high yields of polyphenols are also present in the extract, the concomitant radical scavenging activities of both abietane diterpenes and polyphenols could explain this relevant antioxidant activity.
