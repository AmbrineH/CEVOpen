<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> extracts was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells selected due to their availability, ease of manipulation and lack of studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> plant extracts in this cell line. All extracts at a concentration of 15 μg/mL showed low cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00179-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). The most cytotoxic extract was the one obtained by maceration in acetone of 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic> (E5), with a reduction in cell viability of 20.13%, followed by the extract (E18) obtained by re-extraction in acetone of 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> plant material previously extracted by SCFE (11.44% decrease in cell viability). The extract concentration producing 50% inhibition of cell viability (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was determined for the most active extract (E5) and a value of 64.52 μg/mL was found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00179-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). This extract can thus be considered moderately cytotoxic [
