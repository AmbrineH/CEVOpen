<p class="p">Several extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">P. madagascariensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. neochilus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. porcatus</italic> were prepared with different solvents (water, acetone, methanol and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and extraction techniques (decoction, infusion, maceration, microwave-assisted, ultrasound-assisted and supercritical fluid extractions) to achieve preferential extraction of dissimilar polarity constituents obtained in variable yields (

 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> spp. Higher extraction yields were generally obtained by the maceration method and using methanol as a solvent which can be due to the ability of the alcohol to disrupt the plant cell wall with higher efficacy compared to the other solvents employed. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was also determined based on their radical scavenging ability (

 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus</italic> extracts can contribute to attenuate oxidative stress and prevent free radicals from damaging biomolecules such as membrane lipids, proteins and DNA [
