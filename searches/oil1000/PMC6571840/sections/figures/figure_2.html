 <p> ( A) The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to Plectranthus spp. extracts (15 μg/mL) for 48 h assessed by the crystal violet staining assay using doxorubicin (DOX, 5 μM) as positive control; ( B) Concentration-response profile for the P. madagascariensis extract obtained by maceration in acetone. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least two independent experiments. IC 50: extract concentration producing 50% inhibition of cell viability. </p>
