<p class="p">Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein using a 0.9-mm-diameter needle into heparinized tubes (5 mL). Blood samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 3000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min. The plasma samples in supernatant were then collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The digesta samples (about 4 g) were immediately removed from the proximal ileum of each pig and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. The jejunum and ileum (3 cm) samples were taken from the middle section of them and then rinsed with ice-cold saline. Jejunum and ileum samples were preserved in a 4% neutral-buffered formalin for intestinal morphological analysis.
