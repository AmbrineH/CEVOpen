<p class="p">The samples of jejunum and ileum were cut to a thickness of 5 mm and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The villous height and crypt depth were determined on the stained sections using an optical microscope equipped with an image analyser (Image Pro Plus 6.0, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA). Twenty villi and crypts were measured for each segment. The villus/crypt ratio was calculated by dividing villus height by crypt depth. </p>
