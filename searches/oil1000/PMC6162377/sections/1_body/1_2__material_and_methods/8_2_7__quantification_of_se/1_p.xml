<p class="p">Total microbial DNA was extracted and purified from the ileal digesta using a QIAamp DNA stool kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA from ileal digesta was collected and amplified by conventional PCR amplification using species and genus specific primers (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-08-00159" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). Primers used in this study were either synthesized according to our previous protocols or designed with Primer 5.0 according to pig gene sequences. After PCR amplification, the products of PCR were purified according to the manufacturer’s method (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA). The purified PCR products were linked to the pMD 18-T vector system (Takara, Japan) and then transferred to Escherichia coli DH5α (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for cloning. The positive clone plasmids were commercially sequenced to obtain the positive plasmids (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology Service Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The plasmids were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified by a spectrophotometer (Thermo Co., Vantaa, Finland). A series of dilutions of these positive plasmids were used to generate standard curves using quantitative real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA), allowing absolute quantification to be estimated based on the respective gene copies. Absolute quantitative real-time PCR was carried out referring to the method of Wei et al. [
