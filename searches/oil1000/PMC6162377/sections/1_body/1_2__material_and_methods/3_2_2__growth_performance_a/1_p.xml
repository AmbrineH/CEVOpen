<p class="p">After adapting to dietary treatments for 5 days, the pigs were fed with experimental diets for 98 days. One pig from the NPD treatment and one from the RPO treatment were excluded because of sudden death due to acute respiratory disease at the beginning of week 1. The pigs were individually weighed on days 0, 49, and 98. Feed intake was recorded, and ADFI, ADG, and gain:feed (G:F) were calculated per pig. Chromic oxide (0.2%) was supplemented to diets as an indigestible marker for determining the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, gross energy, and CP from day 36 to 42 and day 85 to 91. The fecal samples of all pigs were collected for 2 consecutive days, from day 41 to 42 and day 90 to 91, respectively, during the feeding period in the morning by rectal stimulation. All fecal samples and feed were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Before chemical analysis, the fecal samples were thawed and dried for 72 h at 70 °C, then they were finely ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve. Additionally, feed samples were ground and passed through a 1 mm screen. All feed and fecal samples were analyzed for dry matter (Method 934.01) according to the AOAC method [

Gross energy was determined using an automatic adiabatic oxygen bomb calorimeter (Moline, IL, USA). Chromium values were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The ATTD was then calculated according to the method of Sauer and Lange [
