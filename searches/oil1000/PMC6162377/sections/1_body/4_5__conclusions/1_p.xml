<p class="p">In the present study, our results suggest that supplementing oregano essential oil to a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet effectively improve the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and carcass lean percentage of growing-finishing pigs. The long-term adding oregano essential oil to a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet has the potential to modulate intestinal bacteria and improve intestinal morphology and antioxidative capacity of growing-finishing pig. Besides, this study provides theoretical guidance for application of low protein diet technology to guide the production of antibiotic-free feed.</p>
