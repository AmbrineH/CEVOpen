<p class="p">In this study, low-protein diet supplemented with OEO improved the growth rate and feed conversion and shortened the slaughter day of fattening pigs. Several previous studies reported the positive role of OEO on the growth performance of growing-finishing pigs on the basis of normal protein diet [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, no research was published concerning the effects of inclusion of OEO in low-protein diet on growth performance of pigs. Oregano essential oil (OEO), mainly composed of natural and volatile aromatic compounds, can exert antimicrobial and antioxidative activities [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Indeed, the improved digestive function in RPO treatment was confirmed by higher ATTD of dry matter and CP during growing and finishing period in this study. Our results agree with the literatures reporting the facilitating roles of OEO on digestive function in pigs [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Additionally, the improvement in nutrient absorption of OEO may be partly explained by increased secretions of saliva and bile and enhanced enzyme activities [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that RPO diet increased the carcass lean percentage of growing-finishing pigs, which consistent with the result of other researcher [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] who showed that OEO diet increased breast muscle percentage in chickens. To some extent, RPO may promote the deposition of protein in muscle by improving CP digestion and absorption, thereby promoting lean growth. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which RPO promotes lean growth. In addition, dietary RPO improved the villous height of jejunum and ileal, circulating antioxidant enzymes (such as T-SOD, T-AOC, and GPx), and the populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> of ileal digesta and reduced plasma TBARS levels in pigs. TBARS is an end product of lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The reduced plasma TBARS levels indicated that RPO could depress the degree of lipid peroxidation in growing-finishing pigs. Moreover, the increased activities of circulating antioxidant enzymes suggested that RPO can protect pigs against oxidative stress by improving their antioxidant defence system. A lower oxidative stress status will be more conducive to the growth of fattening pigs. An increase in the height of villi can be regarded as indicator of improved nutrient absorption capacity [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. No previous research was published concerning the intestinal morphology and gut microbiota of pigs fed with low-protein diet supplemented with OEO. Our previous studies indicated that OEO can modulate intestinal bacteria and improve the small intestinal morphology and antioxidant enzymes activities of pigs on basis of normal protein diet [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These results confirm the hypothesis that the use of OEO as an alternative to antibiotics in reduced-protein diets can improve intestinal epithelial absorptive function, gut microbiota composition, and antioxidative stress capacity in growing-finishing pigs. This study provides theoretical guidance for application of low protein diet technology to guide the production of antibiotic-free feed.
