<p class="p">Severe nitrogen pollution and the use of antibiotic growth promoters have adversely affected the rapid development of the pig industry and human health [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Therefore, developing antibiotic alternatives on the basis of a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet may be one of the effective measures to solve these problems. In this current study, our results suggest that although growth rates of growing-finishing pigs were maintained, the feed efficiency of pigs was significantly reduced when the dietary protein concentration was reduced by 2% units while balancing the first four limiting AAs to meet the NRC [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] requirements. Several studies have demonstrated that the reduction of the CP concentration by 2% units with crystalline AA inclusion did not reduce the feed conversion rate in pigs [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. One of the possible reasons for the inconsistency is that the energy systems used to formulate diets are different. For example, the energy systems used by Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] and Madrid et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] were digestive energy and metabolizable energy, respectively. However, in this study, the net energy (NE) system was used. Noblet et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] demonstrated the negative effect of protein content on the net energy value of diets. Moreover, Kerr et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] suggested that dietary CP concentration interacted with NE for gain:feed of pigs and long-term feeding of low-protein diets on a low NE basis reduced feed conversion rate in growing-finishing pigs. More importantly, the reduction in crude protein levels from NRC [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] to RPD was about 3%, but only four major essential amino acids were at the same levels in RPD as in NPD. In this case, the supply of other “nutritionally nonessential AA” is insufficient [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. These results further emphasize the important effect of synthetic AA in maintaining growth and development of pigs. Additionally, RPD-fed pigs had lower ATTD of dry matter than NPD-fed pigs. This result agreed with the finding of a study [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] that reported that the expression of genes encoding digestive enzymes (such as trypsinogen and dipeptidases-II and III) in the intestine is reduced after feeding a low-protein diet. Interestingly, the RPD-fed pigs had a lower population of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in ileal digesta than the NPD-fed pigs. Similarly, Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] suggested that a low protein diet significantly reduced the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in gut of pigs. 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, a member of the lactic acid bacteria group, is considered to improve the health of intestine, thus protecting the intestine from pathogens and promoting the effective extraction of nutrient and energy in animal’s body [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. It has been showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> was enriched in finishing pigs with high feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, we suggest that RPD treatment reduces population of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in the ileum, thereby affecting the nutrient digestibility of dry matter and feed conversion of pigs. Considering the importance of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in the health of pigs [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-08-00159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], further studies are needed to evaluate the role of a long-term reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet in intestinal microbiota of growing-finishing pigs.
