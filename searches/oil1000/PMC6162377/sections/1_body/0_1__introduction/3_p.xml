<p class="p">Accordingly, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of OEO inclusion in a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet on growth performance, carcass traits, nutrient digestibility, intestinal bacteria, intestinal morphology, and antioxidative capacity of growing-finishing pigs as an alternative to antibiotics. Our hypothesis was that the supplementation of OEO in a reduced-protein diet may improve the growth performance and nutrient digestibility of growing-finishing pigs by positively modulating intestinal bacteria, intestinal morphology, and antioxidative capacity. </p>
