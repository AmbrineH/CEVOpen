 <p> Effects of Pentapera sicula libanotica leaf extracts on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell viability. Cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 μg/ml) of extracts for 24, 48, and 72 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Each value corresponds to a mean ±SEM for 3 independent experiments (n=3), each done in triplicate. Ethanol extract-treated MCF-7 cells ( A), Methanol extract-treated MCF-7 cells ( B), Aqueous extract-treated MCF-7 cells ( C), Ethanol extract-treated MDA-MB-231 cells ( D), Methanol extract-treated MDA-MB-231 cells ( E), Aqueous extract-treated MDA-MB-231 cells ( F). * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001 vs. control untreated cells ( t test). </p>
