 <p> Effect of Pentapera sicula libanotica leaf extracts on LPS-Induced iNOS and Cox-2 protein levels in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of 100 or 50 Î¼g/ml of either methanol (M), ethanol (E), or aqueous (A) extract. Total protein was extracted and Western blot analysis was performed to assess the protein levels of Cox-2 and iNOS. A representative Western blot result is shown ( A, B). Levels of iNOS ( C, E) and Cox-2 ( D, F) were quantified by densitometer and normalized to GAPDH. </p>
