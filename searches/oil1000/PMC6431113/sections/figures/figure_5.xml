  <p class="p">Effect of 
   <italic class="italic">Pentapera sicula libanotica</italic> leaf extracts on LPS-Induced iNOS and Cox-2 protein levels in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of 100 or 50 Î¼g/ml of either methanol (M), ethanol (E), or aqueous (A) extract. Total protein was extracted and Western blot analysis was performed to assess the protein levels of Cox-2 and iNOS. A representative Western blot result is shown (
   <bold class="bold">A, B</bold>). Levels of iNOS (
   <bold class="bold">C, E</bold>) and Cox-2 (
   <bold class="bold">D, F</bold>) were quantified by densitometer and normalized to GAPDH.
