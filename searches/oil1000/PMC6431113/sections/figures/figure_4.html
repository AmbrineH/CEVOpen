 <p> Effect of Pentapera sicula libanotica leaf extracts on LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6 CCL4, COX-2, and iNOS mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of 100 or 200 μg/ml of either ethanol (E), methanol (M), or aqueous (A) extract. Total RNA was prepared and qRT-PCR was performed to quantify the mRNA levels of TNF-α ( A), IL-6 ( B), CCL4 ( C), COX-2 ( D), and iNOS ( E). The data represent the relative mRNA levels (values obtained in: RAW 264.7 cells treated with both LPS and extract/RAW 264.7 cells treated with only LPS). Presented values correspond to the averages ±SEM of 3 independent experiments (n=3) each done in triplicate. * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001 vs. control untreated cells ( t test). </p>
