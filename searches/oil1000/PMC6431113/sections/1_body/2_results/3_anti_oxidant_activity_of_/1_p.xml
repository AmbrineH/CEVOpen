<p class="p">DPPH free radical scavenging assay was used to determine the anti-oxidant potential of the 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapera</italic> leaf-derived aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic extracts. Antioxidants can react with the violet-colored stable free radical DPPH and convert it into a yellow-colored α,α-diphenil-β-picrylhydrazine; therefore, quantification of the change of the reaction mixture color was used as a readout of the scavenging ability. The different extracts showed different anti-oxidant activities with methanolic extract (IC50=48.27±3.52 μg/ml) &gt;ethanolic extract (IC50=52.14±5.6 μg/ml) &gt;aqueous extracts (75.26±5.7) (
