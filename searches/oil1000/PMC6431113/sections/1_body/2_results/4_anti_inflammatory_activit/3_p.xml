<p class="p">In the case of TNF-α, 100 μg/ml of either extract significantly reduced TNF-α transcription levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, treating cells with 200 μg/ml of either ethanol or methanol extract lead to more striking inhibitory effect, with the ethanol extract being more potent that the methanolic one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). On the other hand, 200 μg/ml of aqueous extract exerted no significant negative effect on TNF-α mRNA levels (

In the case of IL-6, treating cells with 100 μg/ml of either ethanol or methanol extract significantly reduced IL-6 mRNA levels. No inhibitory effect was observed upon treating cells with 100 μg/ml of aqueous extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, treating cells with 200 μg/ml of ethanolic extract dramatically reduced IL-6 mRNA levels to an extent lower than that exhibited by cells treated by 200 μg/ml of methanolic or aqueous extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>). In the case of CCL4, treating cells with 100 μg/ml of methanol extract significantly lowered CCL4 mRNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>). However, no significant inhibitory effect was detected after treating cells with 100 μg/ml of ethanolic or aqueous extract. On the other hand, 200 μg/ml of ethanol or methanol extract strikingly reduced CCL4 transcription levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>). In the case of COX-2 and iNOS, treating cells with either 100 or 200 μg/ml of aqueous extract significantly lowered the mRNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" class="xref">Figure 4D, 4E</xref>). Interestingly, a dramatic decrease in COX-2 and iNOS mRNA levels was observed upon treating cells with 100 or 200 μg/ml of either methanolic or ethanolic extract (
