<p class="p">To assess the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapera sicula libanotica</italic> leaf extracts to alter cell viability, MTT assay was performed. This is a colorimetric assay based on the conversion of the yellow substrate MTT to a highly-colored formazan product by succinate dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells. This occurs only in viable cells; therefore, the amount of the produced formazan is proportional to viable cells in the sample.
