 <xref rid="b4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, aberrant ROS and RNS generation causes harmful processes such as oxidative stress and inflammation [4–]. In humans, ROS and RNS can be neutralized by: (1) endogenous enzymatic systems such as superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase, (2) non-enzymatic endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione and melatonin, and (3) exogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E [

It is widely described that plants, due to their phytochemicals such carbohydrates, lipids, phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids, can exert important anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, and/or anti-proliferative activities, and are thus valuable pharmacological tools [
