Inflammation is a local tissue defensive process triggered by pathogens and/or injury, and leads to: activation of immune cells (mainly macrophages); and release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL4, and soluble factors such as nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [

Despite its role in restoration of tissue structure and function, untreated inflammation can trigger critical health problems such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. Accordingly, characterization of plants with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties is of great medicinal value.
