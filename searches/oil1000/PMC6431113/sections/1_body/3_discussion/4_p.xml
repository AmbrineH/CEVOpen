<p class="p">Remarkably, the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties were more striking in the alcohol extracts, which is in line with the better chemical content of the alcohol extracts than the aqueous extract. For instance, the ethanol extract appeared to contain squalene and vitamin E. Squalene is a triterpene (an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway), which is characterized by different biological and pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="b24-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Squalene is known for its anti-oxidant properties, acting as a highly effective oxygen-scavenging agent [
 <xref rid="b25-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Moreover, squalene has been reported to effectively inhibit tumorigenesis [
 <xref rid="b26-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Vitamin E is a potent bioactive component with a wide variety of biological activities [
 <xref rid="b27-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In fact, vitamin E can efficiently suppress cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, vitamin E is well known for its anti-inflammatory potential via suppressing the expression of TNF-Î±, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, iNOS, and COX-2, all of which are mediators of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, vitamin E has important anti-oxidant activities via induction of anti-oxidant enzymes [
 <xref rid="b27-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The methanol extract included guanosine and linolenic acid. Guanosine, a purine nucleoside, plays important roles in cell metabolism and has significant neuroprotective properties, especially by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in different components of the nervous system [

 <xref rid="b29-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Linolenic acid has a variety of biological effects, such as anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammatory activity, that are relevant to human health [
