<p class="p">Although the 3 extracts appeared to contain isorhamentin, hyperoside, and quercetin, those extracts were dissimilar in terms of their oil content, with the alcoholic ones (ethanol and methanol extracts) being richer than the aqueous extract. Despite the identified bioactive components, the 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapera sicula libanotica</italic> content of bioactive compounds appears to be much more striking. Various limitations accounted for this limited number of identified components: (1) the output of the GC/MS analysis, used to detect essential oils, is highly affected by the type of the solvent used during the extraction method; (2) LC/MS/MS analysis was targeted towards only 11 flavonoid compounds, and many other components were not analyzed; and (3) the chemical content of this plant is sensitive to different environmental and geographical factors such as the year and the season of harvest, exposure to sunlight, the elevation and the region in which the plants were harvested.
