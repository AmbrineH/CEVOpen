<p class="p">Oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and uncontrolled cell proliferation are deleterious to human health; therefore, identifying new natural components that can suppress these events is of great importance. In this study, we showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapera sicula libanotica</italic> has significant anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative effects. In fact, the aqueous extract negatively affected, even to lower extent than alcoholic extracts, TNF-Î±, IL-6, iNOS and Cox-2 mRNA levels, as well as MCF-7 viability. This anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative capacity could be attributed to quercetin, which exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects [

Despite the negative effect of the aqueous extract on iNOS and Cox-2 mRNA levels, the protein levels of these 2 components were not affected, indicating that the aqueous extract can impair gene transcription but not translation.
