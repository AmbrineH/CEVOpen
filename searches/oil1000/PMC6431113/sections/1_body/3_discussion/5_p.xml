<p class="p">It is noteworthy that the observed anti-cancer potential could be attributed to the fact that the chemical components of the studied plant can induce cell necrosis or activate components of the apoptotic signaling pathway, thus leading to cell death. In parallel, the observed anti-inflammatory effect could be due to the ability of the plant constituents to inhibit the NF-ÎºB pathway, which usually ensures the expression of pro-inflammatory elements. Characterization of these molecular events and signaling pathways will be addressed in our future studies.</p>
