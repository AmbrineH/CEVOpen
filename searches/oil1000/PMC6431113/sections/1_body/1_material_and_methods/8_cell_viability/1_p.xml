<p class="p">MCF7 and MDA- MB 231, corresponding to breast cancer cell lines, were seeded in 96-well plates (5×10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well). Cells were then treated with the different extracts at different concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 μg/ml for 24, 48, and 72 h and viability was assayed using Cell Proliferation Assay (MTT, Sigma, USA). The proliferation test is based on the color reaction of mitochondrial dehydrogenases from living cells with MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). At the end of the treatment period, MTT (final concentration 0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well, which was then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 3 h. The colored crystals of produced formazan were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) (Sigma, USA). The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using an EL×800 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapera sicula libanotica</italic> extracts on cell viability was calculated as the effect (%) of individual extract dose 
 <italic class="italic">vs.</italic> control (untreated cells).
