<p class="p">RAW 264.7, a murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, was cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% defined FBS and 1% penicillin G-streptomycin in an atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 95% air at 37°C. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/well) using fresh medium. Following preincubation for 24 h, cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) and 2 different concentrations of the extracts (100 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml) in DMEM without FBS for 24 h.
