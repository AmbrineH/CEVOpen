<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s guidelines (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and first-strand cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription (Superscript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit; Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). Quantitative mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR with the PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Gent, Belgium), and the SYBR Green Master mix kit with β-actin mRNA used as an internal control. 
 <xref rid="t4-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> summarizes the primers used for the amplification of each of the tested genes. The program used for amplification was: 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. The expression levels (2
