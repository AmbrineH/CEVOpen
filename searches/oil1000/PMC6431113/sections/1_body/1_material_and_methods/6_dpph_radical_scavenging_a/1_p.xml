<p class="p">The anti-oxidant potential was assessed according to the method of Farhan et al. [
 <xref rid="b17-medscimonitbasicres-25-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] using free radical DPPH. We prepared 5, 50, 100, 150, and 200 Î¼g/ml concentrations of extracts. For each extract, we added 1 ml of each prepared dilution to 1 ml of DPPH reagent [0.135 mM]. Following incubation in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a Gene Quant 1300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The DPPH scavenging ability was calculated according to the following equation:
