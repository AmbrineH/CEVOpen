<p class="p">Powdered leaves (100 g) were put in a flask with 500 ml of the solvent (distilled water, ethanol, or methanol). Following maceration and stirring (1 week at room temperature), the macerate was isolated and filtered. After that, extracts were concentrated by a rotary evaporator at 40°C under reduced pressure (in the case of ethanol and methanol extracts). The aqueous extract was prepared as described for the alcoholic extracts, except that the temperature of the extraction step was 60°C and the filtrates were frozen prior to lyophilization to obtain powders.</p>
