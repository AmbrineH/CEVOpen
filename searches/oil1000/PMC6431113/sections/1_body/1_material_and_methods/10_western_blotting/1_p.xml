<p class="p">Protein samples were loaded into the wells of stacking gel and run until bromophenol blue reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (4Â°C at 80 V for 1 h). The membrane was then blocked in 3% BSA (bovine serum albumin, Sigma A2153), prepared in Tween PBS, for 2 h at room temperature. Detection of the protein of interest was achieved by probing the membrane with the primary antibody of interest. Monoclonal antibodies that can detect Cox-2 (Abcam USA, ab15191), iNOS (Abcam USA, ab3523) and beta-actin (Abcam USA, ab20272) were used.</p>
