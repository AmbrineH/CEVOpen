<p class="p">Fresh leaves were collected from Ibrahim River at 400 m altitude in spring season (March 2018), and the biological authentication was performed by Professor George Tohme (president of C.N.R.S of Lebanon). Leaves were then washed, cut into small pieces, and dried in the shade (at room temperature). Leaves were then crushed and ground to obtain homogeneous fine powder and then conserved at room temperature (in a dark place) until use.</p>
