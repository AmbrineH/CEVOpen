<p class="p">The CP peels EO was dominated by limonene, which represented over 98% of the total composition. A very similar profile was reported by Camarda et al. [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]: both these studies evidenced a dominant presence of limonene in the composition of the headspace emission of Pompia fruits [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The candied peel volatile emission, as well, exhibited limonene as the most abundant compound in the headspace profile [

No comparison can be performed with other HD peels EOs from other accessions as, to the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first report of Pompia peel hydro-distilled EO. The composition of the EO hydro-distilled from the leaves of the present study is very similar to that reported by Fancello et al.: they reported limonene as the main compound, followed by geranial, neral and
