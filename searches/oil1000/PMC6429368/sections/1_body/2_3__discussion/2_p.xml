<p class="p">The rebuttal of the classification of Pompia as a citron variety seems to be confirmed by the present work, based on the significant compositional differences of the peel EO between the two species, which exhibit noteworthy qualitative differences. Several studies report the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus medica</italic> L. peel EOs, extracted from specimens of different provenience and belonging to diverse genotypes: all these EOs showed a consistent limonene/γ-terpinene composition, with relevant contents of α- and β-pinene, as well [
