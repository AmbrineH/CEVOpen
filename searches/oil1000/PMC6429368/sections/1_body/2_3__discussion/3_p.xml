 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], are only slightly more plausible. Indeed, compared to the published compositions of lemon peel EO, Pompia differed for its α- and β-pinene content: whilst these compounds were only detected in relative abundances lower than 0.5% in the analyzed Pompia peel EO, they are reported as accounting for over 1.5% and 9.0% in
