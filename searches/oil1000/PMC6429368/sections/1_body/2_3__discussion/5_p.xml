<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of Pompia peel EOs was determined for the first time, and weak activities were found in both the DPPH and FRAP assays. In the literature, only the antioxidant activity of Pompia leaf EO was evaluated [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]: it showed a weak activity in relation to the reference compounds (ascorbic acid or Trolox). 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs antioxidant activities have been reported for other species, such as the peel EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus maxima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus sinensis</italic>, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 8.84 and 9.45 μL/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. On the other hand, Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] evidenced a more relevant radical-scavenging ability of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs rich in γ-terpinene and terpinolene, but in the present work γ-terpinene was not detected in Pompia peel EO, and terpinolene was only found in traces. Moreover, Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] concluded that limonene, although dominant in the EO compositions, had no significant role in their antioxidant activity [
