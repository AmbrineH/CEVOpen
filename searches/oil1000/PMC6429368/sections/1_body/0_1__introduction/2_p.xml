 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The main features of the fruit are the exaggerated albedo (mesocarp) thickness, coupled with the rough, bumpy and very irregular peel (exocarp) appearance [

 <italic class="italic">monstruosa</italic>: it has been hypothesized that the appearance of its peel might be due to
