<p class="p">The HD peel EO showed a larger variety of compounds, compared to the CP one: oxygenated monoterpenes, indeed, were detected in a relevant amount (16.44%), whereas they were only in traces in the CP peel EO. The HD leaf EO, instead, showed oxygenated monoterpenes as the most abundant chemical class of compounds, as they accounted for up to 53.50%. Whilst only detected in traces in the CP peel EO, geranial and neral exhibited a relevant presence in both the peel (6.16% and 4.43%, respectively) and leaf (24.44% and 18.84%, respectively) HD EOs. Geranyl and neryl acetates, only detectable in trace in the CP peel EO, accounted for circa 0.6% in the HD peel EO, and for 3.94% and 1.48%, respectively, in the HD leaf EO. Their related alcohols, instead, were lower than 1.5% in both the peel and leaf HD EOs, whilst they were not found in the CP peel EO.</p>
