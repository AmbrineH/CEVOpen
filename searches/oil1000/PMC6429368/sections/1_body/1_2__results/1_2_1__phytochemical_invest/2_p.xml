<p class="p">Monoterpene hydrocarbons accounted for over 80% in both the peel EOs. For the CP peels, they represented 98.38% of the EO composition, with limonene exhibiting a relative abundance of as much as 95.77%. The latter was the most abundant compound in the HD peel EO, as well, where its relative content was over 75%. Among monoterpene hydrocarbons, myrcene was the second most abundant compound, accounting for 2.12% and 1.55% in the HD and CP peel EOs, respectively. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were also abundant (42.01%) in the HD leaf EO, where limonene (28.64%) was the most abundant component in the EO, as well. In the latter sample, however, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-Î²-ocimene showed a relevant presence (10.50%), whilst it was under 1% in both the HD and CP peel EOs.
