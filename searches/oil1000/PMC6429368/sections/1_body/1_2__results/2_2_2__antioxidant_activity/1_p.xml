<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the EO extracted by hydrodistillation from Pompia peels was determined by two different test systems: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picarylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. In the DPPH assay, the ability of the samples of interest to act as hydrogen atoms or electrons donors in the transformation of DPPH• into its reduced form DPPH—-H was investigated (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 39.33 ± 6.1 mg/L, while ascorbic acid (used as positive control standard) had IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 4.70 ± 0.86 mg/L. (26.6 μM)). Some authors reported the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for ascorbic acid in the range of 11.8–56 μM [
