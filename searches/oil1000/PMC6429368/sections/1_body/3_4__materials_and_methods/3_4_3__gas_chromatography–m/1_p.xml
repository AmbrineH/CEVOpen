<p class="p">As reported in Ascrizzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], the GC/EI-MS analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a non-polar DB-5 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary column (length: 30 m; 0.25 mm internal diameter; film thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion-trap mass detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA. The oven temperature program was set to rise from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min. The set temperatures were as follows: injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer-line temperature, 240 °C. The carrier gas was He, at 1 mL/min flow. The injection volume was set at 1 μL. The acquisition was performed with the following parameters: full scan, with a scan range of 35–300
