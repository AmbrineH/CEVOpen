<p class="p">The fruit fresh peels (flavedo) were manually squeezed to obtain a cold pressed essential oil (EO): this volatile fraction was captured in a glass vial; HPLC grade 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was added prior to GC–MS injection. The flavedo was also separated from the albedo and hydro-distilled in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h: the obtained EO was diluted to 0.5% in HPLC grade 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. The fresh leaves were roughly cut and hydro-distilled in the same apparatus and diluted in the same ratio prior to GC–MS injection.
