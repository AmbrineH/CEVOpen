 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00908" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] was used to perform the radical scavenging activity. Different concentrations of EOs, in a range from 0.01 up to a maximum of 0.1 mg, were added to a solution of DPPH (100 μM in ethyl acetate), until a final volume of 1 mL was reached. The mixtures were shaken and incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 30 min. The measurement of the absorbance of the solution at 517 nm using a 1 cm quartz cuvette on a Shimadzu UV–1800 spectrophotometer was used to determine the reduction of the DPPH radical. The ascorbic calibration curve in the range 0.5–10 μg/mL was used as standard control. The percent inhibition of the DPPH radical by the samples was calculated according to the formula: % inhibition = (A
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − A
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub>/A
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub>) × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the DPPH radical without the antioxidant and A
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of the samples. Plotting a graph of the inhibition percentage against extract concentration was performed to calculate the concentration (μg/mL) of the extract providing 50% of antioxidant activities (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). All determinations were performed in triplicate.
