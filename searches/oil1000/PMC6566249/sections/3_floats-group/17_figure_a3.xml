  <p class="p">Interfacial tension over time. Grey line is the average interfacial tension (IFT) of brine and crude oil (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4), while blue line is the average IFT for nanofluid and crude oil (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2). The experiments lasted for 12 h and were performed at room temperature.
