  <p class="p">On the left is one micro-CT slice. The black area around the image is air. The grey value represents matrix in the sample. The black area in the slice represents pore space. The top image in the middle is one zoom in area indicated with a black square in micro-CT slice, to give better visualization of sample components. The histogram of this micro-CT slice is in the middle. The red rectangle indicates the grey value range of pore space. The bottom image in the middle is the segmented image when the threshold value applied. The complete segmented result of this micro-CT slice is given on the right.</p>
