   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of CNC aged at 120 °C, from the first cycle of decreasing shear rate. The concentrations of CNC are given in wt. %. Aging of 1 wt. % samples at 6, 12 and 18 h was conducted twice. Error bars signify standard deviation between shear viscosity replicate measurements. The other aging tests were conducted only once. The 1% line follows the average between test replicates.
