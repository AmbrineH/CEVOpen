<p class="p">During the saturation phase of the core, various types of oil were used and their properties are listed in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Isopar L (ExxonMobil Chemical Europe, Mechelen, Belgium) was applied first, then a mix of 20% isopar L and 80% high-viscous paraffin (HVP) oil (VWR International AS, Oslo, Norway). At the end, when the desired initial water saturation was reached, the 20/80% isopar L/HVP solution was replaced with stabilized and degassed crude oil. From the SARA (Saturates, Aromatic, Resin and Asphaltene) analysis the crude oil consisted of: 66.21 wt. % saturates, 25.78 wt. % aromatics, 7.69 wt. % resins and 0.32 wt. % asphaltenes. The crude oil was obtained from a field in the Norwegian Sea, and was filtered twice through a 5 Âµm Millipore filter under vacuum in order to remove impurities.
