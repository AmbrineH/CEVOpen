<p class="p">Nanocellulose was purchased from the University of Maine. The material was manufactured at the USDA Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, WI, USA (U.S. Dep. of Agriculture). The cellulose nanocrystals were produced using 64% sulphuric acid to hydrolyze amorphous regions of cellulose material, resulting in acid resistant crystals [
