<p class="p">An effective EOR method should yield a minimum of 5% OOIP extra in recovery in order to be a viable candidate for an industrial operations. This means that the oil recovery in this experiment should ideally have been increased from 61 to 66%. However, since the recovery factor for the water flood is so high, it is challenging to extract the remaining oil. From the IFT measurements, a lower IFT value was observed for nanofluid in comparison to brine. Nevertheless, the IFT reduction was sufficiently small so that it would most likely not have a big effect on the overall oil recovery. For a recovery factor as high as 61%, the IFT would need to be reduced to an ultralow value (using surfactants) to be able to achieve a higher oil recovery after the water flood. In other words, in this experiment the water flood was highly successful in sweeping the core for oil. From micro-CT imaging of the core plug, it was concluded that the core was quite homogenous. It is believed that the effect of the nano flood would have been substantially improved in a heterogenic sample (layered). </p>
