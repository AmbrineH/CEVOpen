<p class="p">The CNC nanofluid does not seem to have increased appreciably in viscosity during flooding, as expected based on heat aging trials of CNC under static conditions. The actual nanofluid residence time within the reservoir is unknown, but even if it is half of the maximum residence time, the increase in viscosity observed under static conditions should be sufficient to provoke an increase in incremental oil recovery. It is likely that the mechanism of heat aging of CNC is very different in static conditions compared to porous flow conditions. </p>
