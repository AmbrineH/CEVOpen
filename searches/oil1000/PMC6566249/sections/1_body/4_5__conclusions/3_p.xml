<p class="p">An initial low salinity water flood provided an oil recovery of 61%, which is considered a high recovery factor. For the nano flood, 1.2% incremental oil was recovered. During the different stages of the nano flood the differential pressure kept increasing and it was also significantly higher than during the water flood. The increasing pressure could be an indication of log-jam formation inside the core. Log-jamming may provide a mechanism for increased oil recovery and it is likely the cause of the oil production that was observed during the nano flood. Particle size measurements were also performed on the effluent nanofluid at certain times during the flood, and the results obtained correspond with the log-jamming hypothesis. In total, 15.5 PV of nanofluid were injected, which ultimately resulted in a large portion of the pore volume being constricted by agglomerated nanoparticles. This constriction was also evident from the permeability measurement after the flood, in which the permeability had decreased by 89.5% from the initial value. A thin nanocellulose filter cake was also observed at the inlet side of the core plug, which contributes to the decreased permeability. In addition, SEM images show immobilized nanoparticles throughout the core plug, with a larger portion of particles being retained at the inlet side of the core in comparison to the outlet side.</p>
