<p class="p">Prior to the core flood, a high-temperature aging study was performed on CNC. The study showed that the viscosity increased substantially after 24 h of heating at 120 Â°C, with higher viscosities obtained as a function of higher particle concentration. Based on this study it was decided to use 1 wt. % CNC in the core flood, and the flow rate was chosen to 0.1 mL/min corresponding to 24 h flooding time for 1 PV.</p>
