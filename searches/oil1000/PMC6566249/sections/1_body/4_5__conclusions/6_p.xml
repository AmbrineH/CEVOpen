<p class="p">The above conclusions are based on one single core flood, as it was a complex experiment and therefore not possible to do several replicates. The water flood stage contributed to a high oil recovery, which in turn resulted in a very low recovery with nanofluid. Based on this, it is difficult to conclude whether CNC may represent a good EOR candidate, as more core flood experiments should have been conducted. Future experiments should, therefore, try to implement the method earlier during water flooding, such that the recovery factor is not too high for that stage, or alternatively use a heterogeneous sample. The findings from this study can, therefore, be looked upon as preliminary results and based on the observations obtained it is believed that CNC has the potential as an EOR additive if tested under slightly different conditions. </p>
