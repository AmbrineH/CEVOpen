<p class="p">A micro computed tomography (micro-CT) scan was performed to determine if the core was homogenous or if high permeable flow paths were present in the core. The micro-CT scan was performed on a Nikon XT H225 scanner (Nikon Metrology, Tring, UK). The scan was executed after the core flood was completed and the core had been rinsed and dried. The core was placed in a plastic holder (

One scan (half the core) consisted of seven sub-scans at 205 kV and 110 µA with exposure time 0.14 s. The image resolution is 27.4 µm/voxel. After reconstruction, one image stack was generated for each sub-scan. All image stacks were subsequently stitched together using the program ImageJ.
