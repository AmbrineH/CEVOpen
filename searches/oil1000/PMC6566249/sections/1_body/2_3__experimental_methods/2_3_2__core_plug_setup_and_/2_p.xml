<p class="p">The Bentheimer core plug had not been used in previous experiments and was not contaminated with oil residue. Therefore, a mild cleaning procedure was applied. After the core plug was installed in the core holder inside the heating cabinet, it was rinsed by injecting methanol overnight. A low flow rate of 0.01 mL/min was used and the back pressure was maintained at 15 bar. The cleaning procedure was performed at room temperature. </p>
