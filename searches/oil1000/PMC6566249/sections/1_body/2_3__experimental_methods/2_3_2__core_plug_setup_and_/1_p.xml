<p class="p">The core was mounted in a hydrostatic core holder with a Viton
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup> rubber sleeve (Elastomer Engineering Limited, Lymm, UK). The core was pressure tested at 60 bar for 16 h using nitrogen (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) gas, to ensure that no leakage into the core occurred from outside the sleeve. The nitrogen gas was subsequently replaced with high-viscous paraffin oil to maintain a constant sleeve pressure during the experiment. All valves were leak tested prior to initiating the experiment.
