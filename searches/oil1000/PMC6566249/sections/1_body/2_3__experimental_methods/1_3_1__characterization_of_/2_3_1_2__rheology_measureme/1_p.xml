<p class="p">Rheology measurements were performed using a Physica MCR 301 rotational rheometer from Anton Paar (Graz, Austria). A 40 mm diameter cone-and-plate geometry was used with roughened surfaces and a cone angle of 2°. The truncation gap size was 0.057 mm. All rheology measurements were carried out at 20 °C. The rheometric protocol for all samples comprised of the following stages: (1) a 60 second pre-shear (100 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) stage, (2) 60 s period of quiescent rest, (3) two consecutive cycles of increasing and decreasing shear rate from 0.1–1000 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Each step in the protocol lasted for 600 s, and the duration of the entire protocol was 42 min. The concentration of samples was not altered before rheology measurements and each analysis was performed at least twice. For all comparison of viscosity data, viscosity values were extracted from a shear rate of 1 s
