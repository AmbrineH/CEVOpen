<p class="p">Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco diMultimode V instrument from Veeco Instruments Inc. (Santa Barbara, CA, USA). ScanAsyst mode was employed and Bruker AFM probes with silicon tips on nitride levers were used. The scanning probes had a spring constant of 0.4 N/m. 2 × 2 μm area images were obtained of effluent samples and 5 × 5 μm area images were obtained of aged CNC samples. Nanoscope Analysis v 1.50 software (Bruker Inc. Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used to analyze the images. The CNC and effluent samples were prepared according to Lahiji et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] Mica discs of 10 mm width were cleaved and a drop of suspension was deposited. The surface was immediately rinsed with DIW, and compressed N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas was used to dry the sample. Aged CNC samples were diluted with DIW to 0.0125 wt. % prior to deposition onto the mica. Effluent samples from the core flood were sonicated for 2–4 min and diluted 10 times in DIW.
