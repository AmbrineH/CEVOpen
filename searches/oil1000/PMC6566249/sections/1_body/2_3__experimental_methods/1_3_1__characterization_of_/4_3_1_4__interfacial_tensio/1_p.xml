<p class="p">The interfacial tension (IFT) between crude oil and brine/nanofluid was measured with the pendant drop method using the drop shape analyzer DSA 100S (Kruss GmbH, 22453 Hamburg, Germany). The experimental procedure consisted of filling a glass container with the respective fluid (i.e., brine or nanocellulose) and a J-shaped needle was then immersed in the fluid and an oil droplet was created. The diameter of the needle was 1.047 mm. The drop shape analyzer DSA 100S uses the software ADVANCE to measure and analyze the droplet shape. Interfacial tension was measured at five minute intervals for 12 h, and recorded values were automatically logged in ADVANCE. The experiments were performed at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Four measurement replicates were performed with crude oil and brine, while two replicates were performed with crude oil and nanofluid.</p>
