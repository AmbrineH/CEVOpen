<p class="p">CNC dispersion was diluted to samples of 0.49, 1 and 2 wt. % containing 0.1 wt. % NaCl, and 40 mL of the sample was transferred to 50 mL Schott bottles with heat-resistant caps. Schott bottles containing CNC suspension were refrigerated both before and after heat aging. Heat aging was performed in a heating bath (Julabo Gmbh, Seebach, Germany) containing oil at 120 Â°C for aging durations of 2 h to 16.5 weeks. These trials were conducted in an identical manner to a previous study by Molnes et al. [
