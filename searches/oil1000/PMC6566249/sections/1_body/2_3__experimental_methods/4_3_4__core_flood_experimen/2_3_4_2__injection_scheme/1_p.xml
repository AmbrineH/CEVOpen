<p class="p">After establishing initial water saturation and aging the core for five weeks at 60 °C, the temperature was increased to 120 °C. The core flood was initiated after the temperature stabilized at 120 °C. The first stage of the core flood was secondary recovery using low-salinity water (LSW) (0.1 wt. % NaCl). LSW was injected at a rate of 0.1 mL/min until no additional oil was produced and the pressure had stabilized. Near the end of the water flooding stage, the injection rate was increased to 0.5 mL/min for half a PV to determine if any capillary trapped oil at the core outlet could be released prior to the nano flood. Nanocellulose fluid was then injected in several stages as a tertiary oil recovery agent. First, the core was flooded at the same rate used during water flooding, 0.1 mL/min. Utilizing a flooding rate of 0.1 mL/min indicates that one PV requires approximately 24 h to complete; 24 h should be sufficient time for the nanocellulose fluid to undergo a substantial viscosity increase inside the core, which hypothetically should give rise to a different flow path than the pure LSW flood. By creating a different flow path, nanofluid may extract additional oil from the core. However, to provide complete certainty that the nanofluid was able to properly viscosify inside the core, it was decided to shut-in the core for 24 h. During the shut-in period, the content of the core was un-extracted oil and nanocellulose fluid, while the bypass line was flooded with brine to prevent the flow lines from becoming constricted with viscous nanocellulose fluid. After 24 h, nanofluid injection continued ata low rate of 0.1 mL/min. The injection continued until no additional oil was produced. Subsequently the rate was increased in three stages to 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 mL/min, respectively. It was decided to increase the rate in steps, as there was uncertainty regarding how shear thinning the nanofluid was. The pressure gauge could only read values up to five bar before it saturated. Therefore, it was important to build the pressure up gradually so that it was maintained below this value. During all nano flooding stages the goal was to inject nanofluid until no additional oil was produced and a stable pressure reading was attained. The final step of the core flood was a post flush, in which low salinity water was injected at a rate of 0.5 mL/min.</p>
