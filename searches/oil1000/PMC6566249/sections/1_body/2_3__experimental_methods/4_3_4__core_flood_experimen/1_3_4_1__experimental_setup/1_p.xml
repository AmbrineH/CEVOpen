Sleeve pressure was kept at 75 bar during the primary experiment using high viscous paraffin oil. A cylinder containing high viscous paraffin oil (200 mL) in the bottom and nitrogen gas on the top was placed outside the heating cabinet and was used to maintain the system at equilibrium. The back pressure was kept at 15.5 bar during the main experiment and the temperature was set to 120 Â°C.
