<p class="p">The injection fluid container was placed on a balance (during water flooding) or on a magnetic stirrer (during nano flooding). The balance measurements were fed to a computer for data logging. The balance was not able to be used in combination with a stirrer, but the pumping rate was tested and confirmed prior to nano flooding. The sample changer also provided an opportunity to monitor the flow rate on an hourly basis. The injection fluid was pumped into the core using a Pharmacia P-500 pump. The differential pressure (dP) across the core was logged, as well as the inlet pressure and the temperature inside the core holder. During saturation of the core, a cylinder containing crude oil at the top and isopar L at the bottom was placed inside the heating cabinet for the final saturation step (replacing 20/80% isopar L/HVP oil with crude oil). Autoclave tube fittings and valves were used to direct fluid flow. A bypass line was installed over the core to allow fluid diversion during various stages of the experiment. For example, fluid diversion was applied to reduce the dead volume of the prior fluid during heating and prior to introducing a new fluid to the core. </p>
