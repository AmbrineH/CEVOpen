<p class="p">For the graded cylinders, it was difficult to estimate the amount of oil when reaching the tail of the production for each flood. A weight-based method was implemented to obtain a more accurate oil volume estimation. Toluene was added to the measurement cylinder containing oil and water and the toluene/oil phase was extracted using a syringe. The mixture was then added to an empty beaker of known weight, and re-weighed. The beaker was subsequently placed over a heating bath (60 °C) for some hours and then placed in an oven (80 °C) so that the toluene could evaporate over time. The beaker was weighed over three days until it stabilized. The amount of crude oil in the beaker was then scaled using a factor that was determined from a reference set. The reference set (three samples) consisted of a known amount of oil and toluene added to a beaker and reading the final weight at the end after evaporation. The difference in weight from start to end was calculated and based on a factor that was determined on how much oil was lost to evaporation.</p>
