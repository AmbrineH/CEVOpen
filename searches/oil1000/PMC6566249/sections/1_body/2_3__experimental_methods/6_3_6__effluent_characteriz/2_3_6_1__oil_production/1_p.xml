<p class="p">Oil produced during core flooding was measured in one of two ways, either from vials from the fraction collector or by graded measuring cylinders. The vials in the fraction collector were not graded; the calibration line was established based on reading the height of volume in centimeters and measuring the weight for each reading. The volume was plotted against the height for all the reference samples and a factor was established to correlate fluid height (cm) directly to volume (mL).</p>
