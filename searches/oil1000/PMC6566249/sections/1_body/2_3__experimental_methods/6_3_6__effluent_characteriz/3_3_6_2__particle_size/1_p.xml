<p class="p">Particle size measurements were performed on selected effluent samples. These effluent samples were collected during the nano flood and the idea was to investigate the size distribution throughout that stage to see if it could yield additional information concerning the processes occurring inside the core. Particle sizes were, therefore, measured prior to oil breakthrough, at oil breakthrough, at the end of first low rate stage, after shut-in, at the end of the second low rate (after shut in), and at two high rate stages (0.5 mL/min and 1.0 mL/min). The particle size was measured at room temperature using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Nordic AB, Skallestad, Norway).</p>
