<p class="p">Saturation of the core was performed using an injection scheme in which the core was mounted in the core holder on the rig. The cleaned core was first 100% saturated with brine by injecting 0.1 wt. % NaCl. This brine composition was selected for all experimental stages to avoid concentration gradients and associated uncertainties in local salinity values. The oil saturation protocol consisted of four stages and the duration of each stage is listed in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. A synthetic oil (isopar L) was first injected through the core at a rate of 1 mL/min, resulting in an initial water saturation (

 <sub class="sub">wi</sub> value of 15%. The original oil in place (OOIP) was quantified as 120.5 mL. To achieve an optimal displacement of the fluid front, these first three injection stages were conducted at room temperature conditions corresponding to a high oil viscosity. In the final step of the oil saturation procedure, crude oil was injected to replace the 20/80% isopar L/HVP oil. This was done at 60 °C. The core was then aged for five weeks at 60 °C.
