<p class="p">The post-flush stage was performed as a final step in which LSW was injected at 0.5 mL/min for 4.8 PV. With this stage, the idea was that the LSW could help break-up nanocellulose agglomerates and push the nanoparticles out from the core. In addition, if the nanocellulose had released some additional oil, but was unable to transport it all the way out due to the agglomerates, perhaps LSW could help facilitate this oil movement. Injection was continued until the pressure stabilized. However, no additional oil was produced during this stage.</p>
