<p class="p">A recovery factor of 61% during water flooding is a high recovery factor. Thus, it is challenging to try to achieve a higher recovery factor after this stage. Generally, polymers can provide excellent incremental oil recovery factors only when the recovery factor of the initial water flooding stage is poor (0â€“40%) [

Thus, the remaining oil proves difficult to extract using a high-viscosity aqueous front (i.e., nanocellulose fluid).
