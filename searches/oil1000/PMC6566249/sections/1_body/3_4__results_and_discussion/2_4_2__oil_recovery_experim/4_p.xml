<p class="p">At the end of the water- and nano-flood stage permeability measurements were conducted using four different flow rates (at 120 ° C). The effective permeability near the end of the water flooding stage was calculated to be 205.3 mD (where µ

 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), while the effective permeability near the end of the nano flooding stage was calculated to be 753.9 mD. In order to take into account that the CNC had been aged for a certain time inside the core during the experiment, the viscosity of the nanofluid was calculated according to the kinetics in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. Because CNC is a non-Newtonian fluid, the calculations were based on the viscosity after 10 h, providing a reasonable estimate for the average CNC viscosity inside the core during the experiment (µ

 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). From these values, the mobility ratio for water- and the nano flood could be calculated using Equation (2), and was 1.49 and 0.04, respectively. Thus, nano flood should give a favorable mobility ratio, which could indicate that the fluid behaved more like a viscous polymer front compared to water.
