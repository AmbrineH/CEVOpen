<p class="p">The nano flood scheme consisted of several stages. CNCs were first injected at a similar low rate as LSW flooding, until no additional oil was produced. From this stage, it was observed that the pressure was considerably higher than for water flooding. By comparing the pressure at the end of water flooding to the end of nano flooding, the pressure was 65.1 times higher for a nano flood. Furthermore, the pressure also kept increasing and did not stabilize. However, the last oil was produced around 14.4 PV and nanofluid injection continued until 15.4 PV was reached. Although the differential pressure continued to increase, the increased pressure differential did not give rise to additional oil production. Merely 0.92% incremental oil was recovered during this stage. To ensure that the nanocellulose had sufficient time to viscosify inside the core, the core was shut in for 24 h (this event is denoted by the red dotted line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). After 24 h, CNC was injected through the core at a low rate of 0.1 mL/min, and an incremental oil recovery of 0.14% was achieved. During this stage two PVs were injected, even though oil was produced only during the first 0.21 PVs. The pressure was spiky during this stage, and this might be attributable to log-jams building up and breaking free. Log-jam formations occurs when particles accumulate at pore throats, causing pore constrictions and increased differential pressure. Log-jams are a form for mechanical entrapment of particles [

At approximately 16.4 PV, the pressure dropped somewhat, which might be caused by a main flow path reopening after being constricted by nanocellulose agglomerates. The pressure never stabilized, but no additional oil was produced so it was decided to proceed with the next flooding stage.
