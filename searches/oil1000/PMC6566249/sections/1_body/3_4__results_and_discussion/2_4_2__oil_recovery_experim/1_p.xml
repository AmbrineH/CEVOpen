 <sub class="sub">wi</sub>) of 15%. The core was aged for five weeks using crude oil. The study was performed in three flooding stages. First, low salinity water (LSW) was injected to recover as much oil as possible, then nanocellulose was injected as an enhanced oil recovery method to determine if incremental oil could be produced. Finally, a post flush with LSW was conducted. The core flood methodology was to continue each stage until no additional oil was produced and the pressure had stabilized. For the water flood 7.4 PV was injected at a low rate of 0.1 mL/min, which resulted in an oil recovery of 60.8%. The rate was then increased to 0.5 mL/min and an additional 0.21% oil was produced. This might be capillary trapped oil that was released from the outlet.
