<p class="p">High-rate nano flooding was performed in three stages in order to prevent that the pressure gauge was capped. In the first attempt for the high rate (0.3 mL/min) the pump malfunctioned at 17.7 PV, and the core was shut in while repairing the pump. The pump was quickly repaired, but it was decided to inject additional PV using the low rate (0.1 mL/min) to ensure proper functioning of the pump. The low rate was continued until 21.7 PV was reached and during this stage 0.09% incremental oil was produced. The pressure kept increasing and never stabilized as was previously observed for the other nano flood stages, but with no large spikes of pressure as was seen before. High-rate injection of 0.3 mL/min was then re-initiated and 0.02% incremental oil was produced. At this rate, as well as for the second high rate of 0.5 mL/min, the pressure seemed to be stable. However, the second high rate did not produce any additional oil. Finally, a high injection rate of 1.0 mL/min was applied and continued until 23.4 PV was reached. The pressure increased slightly during this stage, but no extra oil was produced. Overall, 15.5 PV of nanofluid was injected during the nano flood stage, and it resulted in a total oil recovery of 62.2%. This means that the nanofluid contributed to an extra 1.2% oil being recovered after LSW flooding. </p>
