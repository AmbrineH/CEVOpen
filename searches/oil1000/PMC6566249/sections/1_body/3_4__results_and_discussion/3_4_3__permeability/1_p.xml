<p class="p">At 100% water saturation, the core permeability was measured to be 1980 mD. After the nanofluid core flood experiment, the core was rinsed with methanol and toluene in alternate sequences. The permeability was then measured using methanol and was calculated to be 192.4 mD. The substantial permeability reduction provides strong evidence of nanoparticle retention inside the core. Reverse flooding was therefore implemented to extract large nanoparticle agglomerates that are unable to transverse the core. Such large agglomerates would be immobilized near the core inlet, and reverse flooding was implemented to remove the nanoparticle agglomerates from the core inlet and recover the initial core permeability. After reverse flooding was conducted, the permeability was tested in the reverse direction using methanol yielding a permeability value of 207 mD. This was a small increase in permeability of 14 mD, but still represents a substantial deterioration from the initial core permeability. Thus, the porous media suffers a significant permeability impairment during nano flooding. </p>
