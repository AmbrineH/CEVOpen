 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>, there are four SEM images with resolution 5.4 nm/pixel. Images of a, b, c in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> correspond to the pieces of 1, 2, and 3 of core cuttings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Image d is from clean core without nanoparticles. The SEM images focus on the pore space in the core pieces. The white arrows in image a, b, and c point out some of the particles which cannot be seen in image d. Because the nanoparticles can be seen in both piece 1 (close to inlet) and piece 3 (close to outlet), it indicated that the nanoparticles traversed the entire core, and were immobilized in all core regions, even though a filter cake was formed at the inlet side (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A4" class="xref">Figure A4</xref>). From the images it was observed that there were more nanoparticles at the inlet side than the outlet side. However, the amount cannot be determined quantitatively using this method, as this is a qualitative approach. The observation of nanoparticles present within the core, even after rinsing with toluene and methanol, supports the hypothesis of the effluent concentration being significantly lower than the injection fluid concentration. However, selective filtration of CNC particles based on particle size is more difficult to ascertain based on the SEM images. In comparison to the CNCs observed in AFM images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A7" class="xref">Figure A7</xref> (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Appendix D</xref>), the nanoparticles in the SEM images seemed to be of roughly the same length range. However, the characteristic elongated shape of CNC particles was not seen.
