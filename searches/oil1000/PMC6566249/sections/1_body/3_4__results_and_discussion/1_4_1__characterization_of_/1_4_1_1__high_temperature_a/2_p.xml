<p class="p">The color change followed the same color scheme observed by Molnes et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], but over dissimilar time scales. There, the samples were completely black after one week, while 6 weeks of aging time were required before true black areas were observed. The dissimilar time scales are believed to be due to differing amounts of sample in the bottles, as this is the only known difference between the samples of the current study and the samples from the Molnes et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] study. The current study used approximately three times as much sample in containers of identical size. Therefore, after the viscosity increased and the rate of diffusion diminished, a smaller volume was accessible to chemically reactive species. This hypothesis is based largely on the color gradient observable across the sample height.
