<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, the 2 wt. % CNC sample reached a maximum viscosity after approximately 12 h of aging time, but the 0.49 wt. % sample showed no sign of change at 12 h. All three concentrations underwent a substantial viscosity increase after 24 h, with higher viscosity as a function of higher concentration. The extreme effect of heat aging on the 2 wt. % CNC samples, manifested by both the immediate onset of viscosity increase and the magnitude of the viscosity increase (three orders of magnitude) gave cause for concern that the nanofluid was likely to plug the core completely, with the consequence of shutting down the experiment before results could be obtained. The late onset of viscosity increase for the 0.49 wt. % CNC samples were also deemed problematic, as it is desirable to maintain elevated viscosity through a core section of maximum length to mobilize the greatest amount of trapped oil. A compromise of 1 wt. % was chosen, with the hope of avoiding both the extremes of plugging the core, and CNC travelling through the core without having aged.
