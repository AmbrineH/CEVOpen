<p class="p">Results from Molnes et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] show drastically increased viscosity of CNC dispersions after 24 h of heat aging at 120 Â°C. These results are repeated and expanded upon in the current study. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows these viscosity results for 2 wt. % samples of CNC, demonstrating that the viscosity increase begun immediately and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows that the viscosity reached a maximum after about 12 h, after which the viscosity was stable for over 16 weeks. The heat aging study was subsequently terminated, without observing any viscosity reduction. Heggset et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] found that during high-temperature heat aging of CNC and CNF a form of thermo-oxidative degradation called oxidative-reductive depolymerization, takes place, which is propagated via hydroxyl radicals.
