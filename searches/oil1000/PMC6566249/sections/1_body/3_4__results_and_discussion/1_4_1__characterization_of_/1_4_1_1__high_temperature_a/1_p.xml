<p class="p">After aging at 120 Â°C, changes in the nature of the CNC suspension were clearly visible, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. While the unaged sample was slightly transparent, all aged samples were translucent (i.e., not transparent). After 12 h, the suspension had attained a gel form able to sustain its shape against gravity. The CNC suspension became altered from a pale white color at 12 h to increasingly beige hues after each subsequent day. After 10 days, black and grey tones, indicative of charring, became visible, and after 6 weeks, the top half of the sample was completely black, Undoubtedly, oxygen gas trapped above the suspension played an essential role in the charring process, but most likely does not contribute to the observed viscosity increase.
