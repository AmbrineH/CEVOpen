<p class="p">The shear viscosity values and shape of curves fit well with the results of Molnes et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], but the onset of the viscosity increase at static conditions has not previously been studied. The long-term stability of increased viscosity is also elucidated in the current study. The aforementioned study had suggested some difference in onset and rate of viscosity increase depending on initial CNC concentration of the suspension. Due to the importance of selecting a representative CNC concentration in the current study, corresponding to relevant core flooding parameters, the concentration dependence of the viscosification phenomenon was also studied. The results are shown in
