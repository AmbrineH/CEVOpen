<p class="p">The interfacial tension between crude oil and brine/nanofluid was measured at ambient pressure conditions using the pendant drop method. The experiments were performed at room temperature, as the equipment did not have the necessary components to perform measurements at 120 Â°C. The results (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Appendix B</xref>), demonstrate that the nanofluid exhibited a reduced interfacial tension in comparison to low salinity water. At the start of the experiment, the IFT for CNC was 1.4 mN/m lower than the reference sample and after 12 h the difference was 2.3 mN/m for the two systems. In other words, the interfacial tension reduction is modest. Thus, IFT reduction is, therefore, likely not a dominant mechanism for incremental oil production.
