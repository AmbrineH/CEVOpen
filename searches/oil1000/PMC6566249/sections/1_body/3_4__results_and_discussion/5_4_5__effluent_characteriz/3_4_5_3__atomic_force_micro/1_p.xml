<p class="p">AFM images were obtained of the unaged CNC injection fluid and of the effluent acquired from five different stages of the nano flood phase. The results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A7" class="xref">Figure A7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Appendix D</xref>. The images before-, at peak- and after oil production appear similar to each other, which is expected as they are subject to the same flow rate and residence time. By comparing the image with the longest residence time (after shut-in period) against the image with much lower residence time (high rate, 1.0 mL/min) there are no distinct differences between them. Thus, there does not seem to be a clear relationship between residence time of CNC in the core at high temperature and aggregation states. However, the shut-in period seem to be a marker where the effluent changes, as the images after shut in are much more similar to each other compared to the three samples obtained before shut in.
