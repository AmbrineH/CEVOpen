<p class="p">The calculated porous media shear rates were then compared against the shear viscosity measurements in order to predict what viscosity to expect inside the core. All the shear viscosity values displayed in the current study are obtained at shear rate 1 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and viscosity values at this value are quite similar to (but slightly lower than) the calculated shear rate at the flow rate chosen for core flooding, which was 3.2 s
