<p class="p">Viscosity of injection fluid should be larger than viscosity of crude oil in order for the additive to be truly effective, i.e., the viscosity ratio should be larger than one. 1 wt. % CNC initially has viscosity not much higher than pure water, but during high-temperature aging the viscosity ratio increased by two orders of magnitude. The effluent did not exhibit higher viscosity as a result of the 24 h spent at 120 Â°C, and the viscosity ratio was not any higher than that of the injection fluid, and well below unity. </p>
