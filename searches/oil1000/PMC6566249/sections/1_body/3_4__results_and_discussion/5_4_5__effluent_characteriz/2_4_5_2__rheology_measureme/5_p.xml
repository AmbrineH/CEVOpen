<p class="p">Regardless of the true causality of the viscosity discrepancy, the lack of viscosity increase of CNC during core flooding is important, and can be evaluated in light of Equation (2) (mobility ratio). The viscosity ratio between displacing fluid and oil has been calculated and is displayed in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. This can be used as a simplified alternative to mobility ratio, which requires additional data.
