<p class="p">From these results, it seems that the CNC had not been aged within the core in any manner similar to the static samples aged in Schott-bottles. A plausible account for the discrepancy is that the real residence time within the reservoir is not known. If the entire pore volume of the core had been accessible to fluid flow, the residence time should be 24 h; however, much of the pore volume is most likely inaccessible, or at least not preferred flow paths. After the experiment was finished the residual oil saturation was 32%, which may be a good estimation of inaccessible pore volume, corresponding to a residence time of approximately 16 h. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows, however, that the 1 wt. % CNC viscosity should have increased by more than one order of magnitude after 12 h and two orders of magnitude after 18 h. Had the CNC nanofluid reacted similarly to the high-temperature conditions as the statically aged samples, higher viscosity of the effluent should have been observed, provided that the concentration of effluent was not significantly reduced due to retention of particles in the core.
