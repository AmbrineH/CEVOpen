<p class="p">The magnitude of viscosity differences observed here were quite small, which stands in stark contrast to the evolution of viscosity observed for 2 wt. % CNC during static aging. All the effluent viscosity values were in the same order of magnitude as the injection fluid. Standard deviations were substantial in relation to the difference between samples. The only effluent sample to show a distinct deviation was the sample extracted after the injection of 8.5 PV. This sample was extracted in the beginning of the nano flood, and before additional oil production was observed and had slightly lower viscosity than both injection fluid and other effluent samples.

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Appendix D</xref>), a higher particle size can be recorded, so aggregation, i.e., reduction of number of particles, might be the explanation. Dilution from the preexisting water in the core after water flood might also have resulted in lower concentration, causing viscosity to be lower. As explained in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot3-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Section 4.3</xref>, a large reduction of permeability was observed after the core flooding was finished, and retention of particles inside the pores was assumed to be the cause. Retention of particles inside the core would lead to a reduction of particle concentration in the effluent, and could partly explain the low viscosity values. The amount of nanocellulose in the core and the concentration of particles in the effluent is unknown, so a quantitative conclusion cannot be drawn on the effect of particle retention on viscosity. The similarity in viscosity between injection fluid and effluent samples was unexpected, given the evolution displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, which shows an onset of viscosity increase between 6 and 12 h aging time at 120 Â°C, with an eventual viscosity increase of approximately a factor of 100.
