<p class="p">Shear viscosity at low shear rate was investigated for core flood effluent from different stages of the core flood. The results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>. Effluent samples were acquired from the same flooding stages as those displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A6" class="xref">Figure A6</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-nanomaterials-09-00665" class="xref">Appendix D</xref>), but slightly different times. As each hour of flooding only produced 6 mL of effluent, only 2â€“3 measurement replicates could be measured for each sample. The two high-rate sample data points are missing error bars because one test replicate was discarded from each of them due to unreasonably high viscosity values, perhaps because of particulate matter in the sample.
