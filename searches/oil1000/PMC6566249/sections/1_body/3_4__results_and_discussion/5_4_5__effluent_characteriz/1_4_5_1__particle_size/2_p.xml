<p class="p">Based on the particle size measurements, it was established that the injection fluid had an average particle diameter of 139 ± 2.0 nm (

Throughout the nano flood effluent samples were collected and the particle size was measured on selected samples to see how it changed during the flood. The first particle size measurement was taken at 8.6 PV, which was before any oil had been produced during the nano flood stage. The effluent particle size was slightly larger (225 ± 4.4 nm) than what was measured for the unaged injection fluid. The apparent disparity in particle size indicates that a change in particle characteristics occurs in the porous media, because of increased temperature, particle agglomeration, and/or size-selective filtration processes. At 9.5 PV, oil was produced from the core and the particle size reached its maximum value during the nano flood, 262 ± 5.5 nm. In other words, it seemed like the particles were slightly increasing in size until oil was being produced. At 14.6 PV, the production of oil had stopped, and the particle size was reduced to 178 ± 2 nm, but it was still higher than the initial size. After the core had been shut in for 24 h, the nanocellulose fluid inside the core should have increased in viscosity. From the particle size measurement afterward, an increase in particle size was observed compared to the value before shut in. However, the particle size after shut-in was not as high as it was during the oil breakthrough. One measurement was also performed towards the end of the second low rate after shut in (20.6 PV), and the size was approximately the same as immediately after shut in, 180 ± 13 nm. For the two high rates at the end of the nano flood, the size seemed to have stabilized around 167 nm, these were also the smallest sizes that were observed during the nano flood.
