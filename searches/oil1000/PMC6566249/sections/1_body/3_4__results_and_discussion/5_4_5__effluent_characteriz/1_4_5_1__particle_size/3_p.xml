<p class="p">The particle size observations collectively suggest that the particle agglomeration occurs in the initial stages of the nano flood, as evidenced by the increased size for the two first measurements. Initially, all the flow paths that the water has flown through should in principle also be open for the nanofluid. This reasoning suggests that larger agglomerates of particles have the ability to traverse the core, as the biggest pore throats should be open. Over time, as additional particles traverse the core, they could start to build up at the pore throat, creating a log-jam. A log-jam means that two or more particles with sizes slightly smaller than a pore throat arrive at the pore throat together, blocking the path, thus making it hard for large particle agglomerates to traverse the core. Over time, upon continuous nanofluid injection, the particles will continue to block off pores and pore throats in the core. It is believed that this occurs inside this core, and this is further supported by the pressure data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. During the different stages of the nano flood the pressure kept increasing, which is an indication that either oil is being mobilized inside the core, and/or pores are being blocked off. After the big oil production in the beginning of the nano flood, there appear to be a filtering of large particles inside the core, as differential pressure continues to increase and particles exiting the core are smaller in size. During the final stage of the nano flood, the particle size seemed to be relatively constant and the pressure was also more stable. These observations confirm that the porous media was filtering the large particles, but not blocking off more pore throats, and there were some flow paths open where the small sized particles could traverse the core.
