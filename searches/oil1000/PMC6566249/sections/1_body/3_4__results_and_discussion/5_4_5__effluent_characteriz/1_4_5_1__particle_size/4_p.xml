<p class="p">Formation of log-jams in high permeable channels may divert the fluid into un-swept low permeable channels, however a premise for fluid diversion is that the subsequent fluid contains particles that are small enough to be able to pass through the narrower pore throats. This could be a mechanism of producing more oil, as the fluid would be introduced to new flow paths inside the core. However, if the particles are large (which they seem to be in this case), the fluid will not have the possibility to sweep the narrower flow paths. Therefore, the idea behind the post flush after the nano flood was that it would potentially sweep a new area of the core. Nevertheless, it seemed like the nanocellulose fluid had blocked off most of the core at that point, because there was no extra oil being produced during that stage and the core had a permanently impaired permeability.</p>
