<p class="p">The current investigation is an extension of the heat aging experiments performed by Molnes et al. [

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The potential of CNCs as an EOR agent was tested by performing a core flood experiment in low salinity water. The core flood was performed at 120 Â°C using a long core (approx. 60 cm) and low flow rate in order for the CNC solution to have a long residence time within the porous media. The goal was to reproduce the same viscosification effect that was revealed in the Molnes et al. [
