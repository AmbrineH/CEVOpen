<p class="p">Temperature conditions in petroleum reservoirs may be quite high (&gt;100 °C), a potential EOR agent should, therefore, be thermally stable within the temperature limits of oil reservoir applications. Heggset et al. [

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] also performed a heat aging study on CNCs, where shear viscosity was measured after 24, 48 and 168 h of heating. The study demonstrated that shear viscosity increases drastically after only 24 h of aging at 120 °C. The results collectively demonstrate that a certain aging period is required under high temperature conditions to obtain a dramatic increase in shear viscosity for CNCs in low salinity water [
