<p class="p">Microscopic displacement efficiency refers to trapping of residual oil at the pore level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The term ED quantifies how well displacing fluid mobilizes residual oil upon contact. At the pore level, various factors influence oil displacement, such as interfacial tension, wettability, capillary pressure and relative permeability. For oil/brine systems, interfacial tension values are typically in the order of 20â€“30 mN/m [

 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, by adding tailored chemicals to the water phase, it is possible to reduce the interfacial tension by several orders of magnitude [
 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. A lower interfacial tension allows extraction of more oil, as the oil droplets will become dislodged from the pore throats.
