<p class="p">Nanocellulose is introduced as another green and environmental friendly alternative to existing EOR polymers. Nanocellulose is nanoscaled particles composed of the biopolymer cellulose, and is an abundant and renewable natural resource. Cellulose is the structural component of plant cells [

 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] cellulose is almost an inexhaustible source of raw material and thereby perfectly able to supply the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products. A tree produces 10 g of cellulose per day and the total production of cellulose all over the world is estimated to be 1.3 Ã— 10

The majority of forest areas utilized for commercial wood conversion are managed based on the criterion of sustainable development, meaning that the annual growth of the forests is considerably greater than what is removed. In addition, since nanocellulose can be produced from unused (today) remains from paper production, no new consumption of trees may even be necessary. Thus, extensive use of nanocellulose should not have a large effect on the environment. Another positive attribute with nanocellulose in terms of offshore EOR applications is that it can be discharged into the ocean. Nanocellulose would agglomerate in high salinity water and degrade.
