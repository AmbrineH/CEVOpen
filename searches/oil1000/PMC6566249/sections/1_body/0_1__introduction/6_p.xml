<p class="p">The displacing fluid should ideally have a high viscosity in order to be able to sweep the reservoir more effectively. A favorable mobility ratio can thus be achieved by altering the parameters in Equation (2). For a given reservoir with a specified oil, the parameter that can be controlled is the viscosity of the injection fluid. However, it is important that the fluid has a sufficiently low initial viscosity to make it easy to pump into the reservoir. The optimal solution is, therefore, to have a low viscosity during injection, and then as the fluid enters the reservoir it would increase in viscosity with time.</p>
