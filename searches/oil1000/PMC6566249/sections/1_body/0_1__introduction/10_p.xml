<p class="p">Disintegration of wood fibers into cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) was first described by Turbak et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and Herrick et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Similar materials called cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were studied as early as 1949 [
 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and described as rod-like cellulose micelles by RÃ¥nby and Ribi [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], and the current study focuses on CNC material. CNCs are produced from acid hydrolysis of cellulosic material, which dissolves amorphous sections, leaving crystalline, rod-like particles intact. Sonication or similar methods are often required to obtain dispersed particles [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The particles are typically 100 to 250 nm in length and 5 to 70 nm wide.
