<p class="p">The macroscopic displacement efficiency term may be quantified as the product of the areal (EA) and vertical (EI) sweep efficiencies, where EA denotes the horizontal area that can be swept and EI denotes the cross-sectional area that can be invaded (

Overall, the EV term describes how well the injected fluid has traversed the reservoir, i.e., which fraction of the reservoir the displacing fluid has been able to contact. Several factors affect the macroscopic sweep efficiency, such as mobility ratio, reservoir heterogeneities and anisotropy, well pattern, and the type of rock matrix imbibed with oil.
