<p class="p">There does not exist much literature on nanocellulose for enhanced oil-recovery applications. However, preliminary experiments have investigated the potential of nanocelluloses as the EOR agent. For instance, retention is a commonly encountered problem when developing EOR polymers. Molnes et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] investigated injectivity of nanocellulose through porous media, and found that the particles traversed the core. Nevertheless, there were indications that a portion of the CNC particles became trapped inside the pore matrix [

 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] performed a more extensive retention study on CNCs in core plugs and sandpacks and observed that salinity had the largest effect on retention. The study concluded that CNCs dispersed in low-salinity water could have promising potential as EOR agents [

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] investigated interactions between anionic surfactants and nanocellulose and found that both surfactants and nanocellulose play a role in lowering interfacial tension between oil and water, and that the presence of surfactant increased the viscosity of the nanocellulose dispersions by effectively binding together nanocellulose particles.
