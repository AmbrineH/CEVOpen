<p class="p">A common technique for increasing the displacement fluid viscosity is to add polymers to the injection water. Shiran et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] performed laboratory experiments in which polymer flooding was introduced as a tertiary recovery technique (after water flooding). To obtain a favorable mobility ratio, a diluted crude oil with a viscosity of 2.4 cP was used. Two polymer solutions with viscosities of 2.6 and 2.2 cP were tested. Three Bentheimer sandstone cores were used with different wettabilities, and all cores had a permeability value of approximately 2 D. The quantity of additional oil recovered after water flooding ranged from 3.2%â€“12.9%. The low percentage of 3.2% was achieved when the core plug was preferentially water-wet, while the highest percentage of 12.9% was achieved when the core plug was preferentially oil-wet. A lower recovery efficiency and higher residual oil is generally observed in strongly water-wet porous media. The reason for this is that oil may remain in larger pores where it could be snapped off, or a water film may disconnect a continuous mass of oil. In both scenarios the oil becomes trapped in the pore structure of the porous media [
