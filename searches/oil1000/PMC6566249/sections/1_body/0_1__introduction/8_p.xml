<p class="p">Two main polymer types are currently in use commercially; xanthan gum and partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Both of these serve to reduce the mobility of water by increasing the viscosity. However, both polymers have substantial performance limitations with respect to EOR. Xanthan gum can plug formations, is prone to microbial degradation, and exhibits poor thermal stability [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. HPAM, on the other hand, is susceptible to numerous chemical, thermal and mechanical degradation mechanisms. Thus, the viscosifying capability of HPAM will gradually diminish as it migrates through porous media [

 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. As many of the polymers used today are considered toxic and detrimental to the environment, it is of importance to develop stable and green alternatives to this EOR technique. This has been a focus area in research over the last decade, where many different types of green alternatives have been tested [
