 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-09-00665" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] the injectivity of CNC dispersions at 60, 90 and 120 °C was investigated using core plugs. They observed no viscosity increase for any of the tests. A possible explanation for this was that the residence time of the CNCs in the matrix was insufficient for modification of the CNC structure. For their tested flow rate (4 pore volume (PV)/day), a CNC particle would take approximately six hours to traverse the core. The heat aging experiment revealed that the increase in viscosity was not observed before the dispersion had been aged for at least 20 h [

CNCs in low salinity water was injected as a tertiary recovery technique at 60 °C and 90 °C and the incremental oil recovery was calculated. It was concluded that CNCs dispersed in low salinity water might have a certain potential for use in enhanced oil recovery. Additional oil produced attributable to nanocellulose was 3.4% for the test at 90 °C, while no significant EOR effect was observed for the test performed at 60 °C [
