   <title class="title">Results of Interfacial Tension Measurements</title>
   <p class="p">Interfacial tension between crude oil and brine (0.1 wt. % NaCl) was measured as a reference case, so that the IFT to nanofluid and oil could be compared against it. Four replicate measurements were performed for the reference sample and the average IFT of those is plotted in 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A3" class="xref">Figure A3</xref> (grey line). The average droplet size was 53 ± 2.3 µL and the average temperature was 23 ± 1 °C. From the graph, it is observed that IFT did not stabilize over the duration of the experiment (12 h). These experiments will, therefore, show the general trend for IFT; the starting point, how steep the decrease was and the IFT value obtained after 12 h. For the reference sample, the IFT started at 22.4 ± 0.3 mN/m and after 12 h it was 19.2 ± 0.3 mN/m.

   <p class="p">For the nanofluid and crude oil, two replicates were run, and the average is shown in 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A3" class="xref">Figure A3</xref> (blue line). The average droplet size was 47 ± 1.7 µL and the average temperature was 26 ± 0.5 °C. The same trend was observed in this case, with a decrease in IFT over time and the value did not stabilize over 12 h. However, for this experiment IFT started at 21.0 ± 0.7 mN/m, which is a lower value than what was observed for the reference sample. After 12 h, the IFT was 16.9 ± 1.2 mN/m.

   <title class="title">Results of Micro-CT Scan</title>
   <p class="p">The total porosity of the core calculated based on micro-CT image is 18.63% (
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A5" class="xref">Figure A5</xref>), which is 3% less than measured value in the lab. Due to the limit of micro-CT technique, any component smaller than the resolution (27.4 µm/voxel) cannot be visualized. Therefore, the porosity via micro-CT can only be used as a reference in this work. However, the distribution of porosity along the core indicates that the sample is quite homogeneous (

   <title class="title">Results of AFM Images</title>
   <p class="p">AFM images were obtained of the unaged CNC injection fluid and of the effluent acquired from several stages of the nano flood phase. The results are displayed in 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00665-f0A7" class="xref">Figure A7</xref>. The particle concentration difference seen between (a) and the other images is due to different methods of preparation for imaging. For images (e) and (f) it proved difficult to find sample sections with individual crystals and crystal aggregates such as seen in images (b), (c) and (d). It is unclear whether this phenomenon corresponds to an actual tendency towards aggregation.
   </p>
   <p class="p">Images (b), (c) and (d) appear similar to each other, which is expected as they are subject to the same flow rate and residence time, the only difference between the samples being to which degree the particles may have been in contact with crude oil. From these images there does not seem to be a clear relationship between residence time of CNC in the core at high temperature and aggregation states. Particles in image (e) have much longer residence time than those in (b), (c) and (d), while (f) would have had much lower residence time. Despite this, (e) and (f) are much more similar to each other than to the other three samples.</p>
