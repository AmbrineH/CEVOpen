<p class="p">Similar to other lignocellulosic biomass, oil palm biomass also consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as major components of its cell wall, forming a fibre-like structure that makes the oil palm biomass recalcitrant. The cellulose and hemicellulose are polysaccharides that can be converted into sugar monomers, which can be used as fermentation substrates for various products. However, these components are protected by lignin, which is a complex and large complex structure containing cross-linked phenolic polymers that cover the internal layer of hemicellulose and cellulose [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The composition of lignin plays an important role in the selection of suitable lignocellulosic biomass as a substrate for sugar production prior to fermentation. A higher lignin content makes the structural arrangement rigid and highly ordered, therefore, it increases the biomass recalcitrance [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. High lignin content will also contribute to the use of a vigorous pre-treatment process and/or require high amounts of enzymes or chemicals for delignification, subsequently increasing the total pre-treatment cost. Besides, the hydrolysis yield of sugar over the total biomass weight will also be less than for those substrates with a lower lignin content.
