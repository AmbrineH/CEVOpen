<p class="p">Besides OPEFB and OPMF, palm oil mill also produces oil palm decanter cake (OPDC) and OPKS as waste. It should be noted that OPKS is fully utilized to generate steam and electricity by burning it in a boiler. However, several studies have been conducted to utilize this biomass in order to produce various value-added products. Most of OPKS is studied for biochar and activated carbon production, since this biomass is very compact, high density, and low moisture content, which are the criteria for biochar and activated carbon production [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. It is also composed of very high lignin content of more than 50%, thus making this biomass unsuitable for sugar production. Another valuable oil palm biomass is OPDC, which is obtained from the three-phase decanter system. This oil separator functions to further extract the remaining oil present in POME before it is discharged as an effluent. The three-phase decanter extracts oil from sludge leaving over the remaining liquid (POME) and solid residue (OPDC) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. OPDC contains a significantly low amount of potential sugar of ~26% [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The major advantage of OPDC is that this biomass naturally has a small fibre size due to mechanical pressing during oil extraction [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Small particle size is also a key factor for the effective pre-treatment and hydrolysis by enzymes, since enzyme action is highly affected by the surface area [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, OPDC is not produced in all the mills in Malaysia since the three-phase oil separator is installed only in several palm oil mills. Besides, OPDC contains very high ash amount (22%) as it comes from waste mixed with water after the washing procedures. The lignin content is also considerably high at approximately 31%, which requires a harsh pre-treatment process to remove lignin.
