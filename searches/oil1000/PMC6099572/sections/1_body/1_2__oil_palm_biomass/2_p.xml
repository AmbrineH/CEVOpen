<p class="p">The process flow of palm oil production at the mill with the production of oil palm biomass is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01381-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. It shows that in every input of 100,000 tonnes of FFB for processing palm oil, a total of 43,700 tonnes of oil palm biomass residuals were generated. This value accounted for 23,000 tonnes of OPEFB, 5000 tonnes of OPKS, and 15,700 tonnes of OPMF. It should be noted that the OPEFB is the most abundant biomass produced from the palm oil mill. This value does not include the amount of biomass in wastewater, which is known as palm oil mill effluent (POME), which generates 69,000 tonnes per 100,000 tonnes of FFB input. In total, the palm oil mills in Malaysia generate 7.34 million tonnes of OPEFB, 7.72 million tonnes of OPMF, 4.46 million tonnes of OPKS, and 64 million tonnes of POME per year [

The fundamental principles of waste management are to minimize and recycle the waste, recover the energy, and finally dispose of the waste [
