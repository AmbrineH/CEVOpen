<p class="p">Although some pre-treatments could achieve up to 100% of glucose recovery, the efficiency and the suitability of the pre-treatment should be considered based on energy and time consumption, cost for chemicals and/or enzymes, initial capital for setting up the plant, the inhibitors released after the pre-treatment process, the waste generated from the pre-treatment process, the environmental impact, and the conversion of oil palm biomass into sugar. The mechanical pre-treatment to reduce substrateâ€™s size is important since enzymatic hydrolysis by cellulase is highly affected by the accessible surface area to digest cellulose into glucose. Therefore, many mechanical pre-treatments, such as wet disk milling, hammer mill, and ball milling resulted in a high glucose recovery. Besides, even though a single pre-treatment could save the energy and time, a combination of more than two pre-treatments efficiently enhances the glucose or sugar recovery. However, the compatibility of combining the pre-treatments is limited, hence more research on the combination pre-treatment should be conducted.</p>
