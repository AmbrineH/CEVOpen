<p class="p">At the moment, the palm oil industries are still practicing the traditional waste management, with only little improvement. The oil palm biomasses, such as OPKS and OPMF, are still burned in a boiler to generate steam and electricity for mill operation [

 <uri xlink:href="http://www.kulimnursery.com/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.kulimnursery.com/</uri>), have started producing biocompost, biocharcoal, dried fiber, and pellets from oil palm biomass. Nevertheless, there is large potential for this biomass to be converted into various value-added products that will generate additional income to the industry, and at the same time, reduce the impact on the environment.
