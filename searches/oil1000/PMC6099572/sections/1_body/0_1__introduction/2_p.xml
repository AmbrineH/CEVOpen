<p class="p">In line with the increase of the palm oil production capacity in Malaysia, a large amount of waste is being generated from this industry. Processing fresh fruit bunch (FFB) in the mill generates oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF), oil palm kernel shell (OPKS), and a large amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME). Some biomass is also generated in the plantation area, such as oil palm frond (OPF) and oil palm trunk (OPT). In total, the palm oil industry generates more than 80 million tonnes of oil palm biomass in 2016, and the value will keep on increasing to fulfil the demand [
