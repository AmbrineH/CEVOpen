<p class="p">Combinations of different pre-treatments are always put into consideration in order to obtain an optimal fractionation of different components and achieve high yields of fermentable sugars. Selection of the pre-treatments to be combined and the sequence of the pre-treatment processes depend on the substrate characteristics, the availability of equipment, and the operational cost. The operational costs of pre-treatment are influenced by the pre-treatment duration, the amount of energy used, and the quantity of chemicals/enzymes that are applied in the process. For example, OPEFB and OPMF were ground using a hammer mill to a size of 0.25 mm, before being pretreated with laccase [

As an example, the OPF was ground to a size of 0.25â€“0.5 mm, before being pretreated using ILs, followed by an enzymatic delignification by laccase. This combination of pre-treatments resulted in a higher lignin removal as compared to single pre-treatment using either ILs or laccase [
