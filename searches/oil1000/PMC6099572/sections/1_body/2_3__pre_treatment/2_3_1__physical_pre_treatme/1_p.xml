<p class="p">Physical pre-treatment, also known as mechanical pre-treatment, is a process that uses mechanical methods, such as milling, chipping, grinding, and shredding to reduce the particle size and to increase the surface area of the biomass. Large biomass surface area increases the enzyme accessible area, and therefore increases the degree of depolymerization of biomass [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. For example, the crystallinity index (CrI) of OPEFB reduced from 56% to 9% after grinding using ball milling for 120 min. A shorter milling duration is required for OPF, since this substrate has a lower lignin content than OPEFB [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In many practices, physical pre-treatment is used as an initial pre-treatment before the substrate is processed using other kinds of pre-treatment methods [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Sun and Cheng [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] reported that the selection of the pre-treatment method for chipping, grinding, and milling is depending on the final particle size of the biomass, usually in the range of 10–30 mm after chipping, and 0.2–2 mm after milling or grinding. Biomass size smaller than 400 mesh (0.04 mm) has little effect on the rate and yield of sugar production. In a study by Rizal et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], the particle size was shown to play an important role in enhancing the hydrolysis of OPEFB and OPMF into glucose. The substrate with a size of 0.25 mm improved the hydrolysis yield by 4.6–4.8-fold.
