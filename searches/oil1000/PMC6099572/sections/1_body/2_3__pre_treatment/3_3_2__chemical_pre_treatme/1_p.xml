<p class="p">Chemical pre-treatment can be divided into two categories, which are acid and alkaline pre-treatments. The acid pre-treatment acts by solubilizing the hemicellulose fraction of biomass and exposes the cellulose to be converted to sugars [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. It can be performed while using either concentrated or diluted acid. However, the utilization of concentrated acid is less desirable for the subsequent process due to the formation of inhibitors that inhibit enzyme action during hydrolysis and/or microorganisms during fermentation. Besides, its major disadvantages include serious corrosion problems and the use of sophisticated equipment for acid recovery, which leads to high operational and maintenance costs [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. These limitations reduce the interest in applying this method on a commercial scale [
