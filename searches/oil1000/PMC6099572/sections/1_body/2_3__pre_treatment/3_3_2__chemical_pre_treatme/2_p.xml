<p class="p">The alkaline pre-treatment involves the use of bases, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium hydroxides [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This pre-treatment causes the swelling of lignocellulosic biomass, dissolution of lignin and hemicellulose, and de-esterification of intermolecular ester bonds, which subsequently reduces the extent of polymerization and CrI. Since alkaline pre-treatment dissolves mostly lignin, this pre-treatment is preferable than acids that dissolve carbohydrates. The disruption of lignin structure increases the exposure of the internal surface, and makes it accessible to enzyme digestion, which improves the hydrolysis efficiency [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] produced approximately 32 g/L of sugar. Alkaline pre-treatment also has been tested on OPDC, which improved the sugar production from &lt;1 g/L (untreated) to ~6 g/L after pre-treatment using 1% of NaOH [
