<p class="p">Besides acids and alkaline chemicals, ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DES) are some of the chemicals that have been tested for the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass. ILs are salts occurring in the liquid form that was employed to dissolve the lignocellulosic biomass [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Meanwhile, DES can be formed between a variety of quaternary ammonium salts and carboxylic acids capable of self-association, often through hydrogen bond interactions. This interaction forms a eutectic mixture with a melting point that was lower than that of each individual component [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. ILs and DES is an inexpensive process, which can be conducted in low/mild temperature, non-toxic to enzymes or cells during saccharification and fermentation, and selectively depolymerize the lignin, thus making this pre-treatment process attractive to the industrial scale [

 <xref rid="B63-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Besides, ILs and DES can also be recovered and recycled [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. However, the recovery process requires a step to remove the inhibitor, in which the additional cost should be considered [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. It was observed that approximately 11% of lignin composition was removed from OPF after being treated using ILs, which was higher than that of enzymatic delignification by laccase [
