<p class="p">Recently, this environmentally friendly approach has received renewed attention as a pre-treatment method for enhancing the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass into sugars. The major advantages of this pre-treatment are low capital costs, low energy usage, little or no chemicals involved, and can be conducted in mild environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Biological pre-treatment can be divided into two major categories, i.e.,: (1) microbial and (2) enzymatic pre-treatment. Microbial pre-treatment employs microorganism, including white fungi, brown fungi, soft rot fungi and bacteria to modify the lignocellulosic composition [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. White rot fungi are most widely used for biological pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass as they effectively destroy the cell wall and lignin [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. There are several types of white rot fungi such as

 <italic class="italic">Clostridium butyricum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma viride</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pycnoporus cinnarbarinus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Dichomitus squalens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Phlebia radiate</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Trametes versicolor</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus oryza</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pleurotus ostreaus</italic> that have been investigated to pretreat different kinds of lignocellulosic biomass [

 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Lignin degradation by white rot fungi occurs through the action of lignin degrading peroxidases and laccase [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. The major disadvantage of this pre-treatment is that it requires a long process duration to grow the fungi on lignocellulosic biomass.
