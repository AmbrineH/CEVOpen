<p class="p">Enzymatic pre-treatment employs enzymes to delignify the lignin component of oil palm biomass. The process is faster than microbial pre-treatment, as the enzyme will act directly on the biomass. The process takes about 72 h [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] as compared to a microbial pre-treatment that could take up to 40 days [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Enzymatic pre-treatment is also selective as it only attacks the lignin component, leaving the cellulose and hemicellulose intact. However, in order to effectively pretreat the biomass using enzymes, the biomass must first be mechanically pretreated to reduce the particle size as the substrate surface area affects the pre-treatment efficiency [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. OPT was ground using wet disk milling to a size of 80 Âµm before being pretreated while using extracted enzymes that were produced by local isolates. They found that the mixture of enzymes rich of xylanase improves the hydrolysis efficiency of OPT [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The common ligninolytic enzymes are peroxidases, such as lignin peroxidase (LiP EC 1.11.1.14) and manganese peroxidase (MnP EC 1.11.1.13), as well as laccase (EC 1.10.3.2; benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. All of these enzymes play a role in lignin degradation, and due to their dependence on molecular oxygen as opposed to hydrogen peroxide, they are becoming an item of interest in the industries related to enzyme [
