<p class="p">Steam-assisted fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass improves enzymatic hydrolysis after an exposure to high pressure and temperature. After a certain pre-treatment duration, the biomass is rapidly decompressed, resulting in the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass and reducing its recalcitrance [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Typically, the oil palm biomass is treated at the temperature range of 160–240 °C and pressures of 20–50 bars for 1–120 min [

However, it should be noted that a higher temperature will cause severe degradation of cellulose, lowering the cellulose compositional percentage that will reduce the total glucose yield that was obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis. The selection of suitable temperature and pre-treatment duration is based on the types of oil palm biomass. It was reported that lower temperature is more efficient than a pre-treatment with higher temperature, even though at longer pre-treatment duration [
