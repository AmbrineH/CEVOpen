<p class="p">Most of the physico-chemical pre-treatments are conducted at a high temperature and pressure, in aqueous solutions, and in a closed system [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. The steam penetrates into the biomass and breaks the structural components, shearing the cell walls and partially hydrolyses the glycosidic bonds of hemicellulose. Physico-chemical pre-treatments use water to avoid the negative effects on the environment [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The effective pre-treatment mechanism occurs when autoionization of water at high temperature generates hydronium (H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) ions and reduces the pH, in which the solution formed acts, like an acid [

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. This acid is able to further solubilize the hemicellulose component and acetyl residues from xylan, which is then liberated in the form of acetic acid. This acetic acid will further catalyze the hydrolysis and this process is qualified as autohydrolysis [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Besides, it was reported that the concentration of hydronium ions from disassociation of acetic acid is higher than that from water autoionization [
