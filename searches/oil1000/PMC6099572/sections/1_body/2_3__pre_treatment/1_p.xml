<p class="p">The structural arrangement of oil palm biomass and its composition play an important role for the conversion efficiency into fermentable sugars. In general, pre-treatment can be categorized into chemical, physical, physico-chemical, and biological pre-treatment [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], whereby each category has their own advantages and disadvantages, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01381-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Pre-treatment at upstream operation includes a physical pre-treatment, such as size reduction and thermo-chemical process that involve the disruption of the recalcitrant biomass. It increases substrate porosity by delignifying the lignin, hence, enables the maximal exposure of cellulose for cellulase action, which subsequently improve the hydrolysis process, minimize the energy consumption, and maximize the sugar recovery [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. According to Taherzadeh and Karimi [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-01381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], an effective and economical pre-treatment should meet the following requirements: (1) avoiding destruction of hemicelluloses and cellulose, (2) avoiding formation of possible inhibitors, (3) minimizing the energy demand, (4) reducing the cost of size reduction for feedstock and cost of material for the construction of pre-treatment reactors, (5) consumption of little or no chemicals, and (6) using a compatible chemical. Effective pre-treatment is fundamental for optimal successful hydrolysis and downstream operations.
