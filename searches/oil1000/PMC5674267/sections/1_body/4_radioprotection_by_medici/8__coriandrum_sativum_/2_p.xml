<p class="p">The radio protective effect of coriander seeds against whole-body Î³-irradiation was studied in rats. Treatment with coriander seed extract was effective in preventing radiation-induced biochemical changes in serum and significantly improved the antioxidant status in liver and kidney of rats. It is suggested that scavenging of free radicals was a possible mechanism of protection [
