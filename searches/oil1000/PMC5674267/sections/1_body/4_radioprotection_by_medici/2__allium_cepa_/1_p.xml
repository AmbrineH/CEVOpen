 <italic class="italic">A. cepa</italic> contains compounds such as 3-1,8-cineole, L-linalool and camphordare and has been thoroughly investigated. Besides this, the onion bulb contains Kaempferol, β-sitosterol, ferulic acid, myritic acid and prostaglandins. Flavonoids and tannins are also present in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cepa</italic>. Quercetin, quercetin 4-glucoside, taxifolin, taxifolin 7-glucoside and phenylalanine have been isolated from the bulb. The major sulfur compounds are dimethyl trisulfide, propenyl propyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, propenylmethyldisulfide and methyl propyl trisulfide dipropyle trisulfide.
