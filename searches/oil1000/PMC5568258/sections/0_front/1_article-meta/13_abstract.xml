  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">This study evaluated the in vitro activity of essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">Myracrodruon urundeuva</italic>.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">The oil was obtained by hydro-distillation and characterized by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the broth microdilution technique and the MIF was determined by using growth indicator CTT (2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium) and CBM in BHI agar. The oil’s cytotoxicity was evaluated in HeLa, HEK-293, and Vero E6 cells using MTT, 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium.</p>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">The oil showed chemical markers, including α-pinene (87.85%), trans-caryophyllene (1.57%), limonene (1.49%) and β -pinene (1.42%), and activity against all strains: 
   <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = MBC = 0.22 mg/mL), 
   <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 0.11 mg/mL and MBC = 0.22 mg/mL), 
   <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC = 0.88 mg/mL and MBC = 1.75 mg/mL), 
   <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = MBC = 7 mg/mL) and 
   <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis (MIC = MBC = 0.44 mg/mL). In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed that the oil is not toxic and has slight antitumor activity.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">We conclude that the 
   <italic class="italic">M. urundeuva</italic> oil results are promising, with prospects of being pharmacologically viable.
