 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The controls validated the tests. The positive control (PC) showed no bacterial growth at higher concentrations, demonstrating the effectiveness of gentamicin as a positive control in the test, since the antibiotic’s inhibitory effect on the bacteria occurred up to a concentration of 0.004 mg/mL (4 μg/mL), with equivalence between the MIC and MBC. Bacterial growth occurred in all assays for both the negative control (NC) and for the growth control (GC), confirming the non-bacterial inhibition of Tween 80 and the viability of the strains used and demonstrating the antibacterial effect of
