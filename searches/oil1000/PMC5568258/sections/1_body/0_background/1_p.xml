 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], we find that research in plant-based natural products to elucidate new therapies from novel antibacterial agents has grown significantly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Studies report that certain natural antibacterials, when given with standard antibiotics, are even more effective in synergy than the standard drug alone [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the cells of resistant pathogens, these naturally occurring molecules supposedly reach different targets than the known antibiotics do.
