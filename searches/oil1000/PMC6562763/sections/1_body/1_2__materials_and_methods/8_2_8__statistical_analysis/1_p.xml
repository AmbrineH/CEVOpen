<p class="p">The experimental solubility of bioactive compounds extracted in 16 oily solvents was further transformed using MATLAB 2015a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). First, principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the dimensionality of our data set (individuals: oily solvents; variables: TPC, antioxidants, and VACs) by linear combination into new coordinate systems. The solute concentrations in 16 oily solvent systems were taken for the principal component determination so as to compare the solubility of these 16 solvents in PCA plotting graphs. Clustering analysis was used to classify the closest individuals into clusters, where Wardâ€™s hierarchical clustering was applied to calculate dissimilarities from the Euclidean distances and aggregation criterion corresponding to the minimization of the within-cluster inertia and the maximization of between-cluster inertia. Concerning the extractability of non-volatile and volatile bioactive compounds in different solvents, this statistical method could partition oily solvents into homogeneous clusters with a low within-variability, which are different from others with a high between-variability. Given this, a dendrogram was made to illustrate the aggregations made at each successive stage.</p>
