<p class="p">The fatty acid composition of various vegetable oil solvents was determined according to our developed FAME method [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. FAMEs were obtained after the methylation of oil samples, from which the supernatants were transferred into vials for further GC-FID (Gas chromatography- flame ionization detector) analysis by a 7820A GC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with an FID detector and auto-sampler using a BD-EN14103 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) with helium as a carrier gas at the linear velocity of 35 cm/s and glyceryl triheptadecanoate (C
 <sub class="sub">54</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">104</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>) as the internal standard. One microliter of sample was injected in split mode (split ratio 1:20) at 250 °C. The oven temperature program was operated as follows: initial temperature at 50 °C, increasing at 20 °C/min to 180 °C and at 2 °C/min from 180 °C to 230 °C, held isothermally at 230 °C for 10 min. Data were collected using Agilent EZChrom Elite (Palo Alto, CA, USA) software and fatty acids were identified by referring to 37 FAME standards (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). FAMEs were quantified as the relative percentage of the total fatty acids.
