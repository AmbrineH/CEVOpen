<p class="p">Carnosol, carnosic, and rosmarinic acids were quantitatively analyzed using an HPLC system (Agilent 1100, Les Ulis, France) equipped with a photo diode array detector (DAD) according to our internal method developed [
 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], whose procedures are detailed below. Carnosol and carnosic acid were detected at a wavelength of 230 nm using a C18 column (1.8 µm, 4.6 mm × 50 mm, Zorbax Eclipse XBD-C18, Agilent Technologies, Courtaboeuf, France). The mobile phase was isocratic and composed of 0.5% phosphoric acid in water:acetonitrile (35:65, 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>). Samples (5 µL) were injected with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and the column oven temperature was 25 °C. Rosmarinic acid was detected at a wavelength of 328 nm using a C18 column (5 µm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Zorbax SB, Agilent Technologies, Courtaboeuf, France). The mobile phase composed of acetonitrile (32%) and 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid in water (68%). Samples (5 µL) were injected with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and the column oven temperature was 20 °C with a 10 min runtime.
