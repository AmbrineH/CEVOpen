<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis was performed using a QP2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column UB-WAX (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 µm) and helium as a carrier gas at the constant flow of 35 cm/s. The initial oven temperature of 35 °C was held for 2 min, then rose at 5 °C/min until 230 °C. The temperature of the transfer line connecting the GC-MS was held at 250 °C. The inlet was operated in the splitless mode and the mass spectrometer operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV with continuous scans (every 0.2 s) over the mass-to-charge ratio (

Data were collected using GCMSsolution software 2.40 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and the major VACs were identified as compared to their linear retention index and mass spectra with those of authentic standards, as well as with the NIST’98 (US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD, USA) mass spectral database.
