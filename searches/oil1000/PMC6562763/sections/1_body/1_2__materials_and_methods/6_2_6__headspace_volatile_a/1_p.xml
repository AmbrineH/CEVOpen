<p class="p">The volatile aroma compounds (VACs) in oily rosemary extracts were identified and quantified by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS-QP2010, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an AOC 5000 auto-injector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The auto sampler was operated in SPME mode using a divinylbenzene-carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane fiber (2 cm, 23 gauge, 50/30 µm DVB/CAR/PDMS; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for extraction. For each extraction, oily extract (4 g) was hermetically sealed in screw-top vials (20 mL) containing aluminum seals and PTFE/silicone septa from Grace, France. The samples were equilibrated during incubation time at 35 °C for 15 min before the automatic insertion of the SPME device into the sealed vial, where the fiber was exposed to the headspace of samples at the same temperature for 25 min. The samples were agitated during the incubation and extraction procedures, and the SPME fiber was subsequently removed and inserted into the GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy) injector port for desorption at 250 °C for 5 min.
