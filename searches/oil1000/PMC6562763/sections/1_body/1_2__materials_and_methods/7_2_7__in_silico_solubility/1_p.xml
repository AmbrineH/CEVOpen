The chemical structure of all solvents and solutes studied was mutually transformed by JChemPaint version 3.3 (GitHub Pages, San Francisco, CA, USA) into the simplified molecular input line entry syntax (SMILES) notations, which could be further simulated to their three-dimensional σ-surface modelling (

 <sup class="sup">+</sup>), and red codes electron-rich regions (δ
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>). This 3D information on the repartition of charge density on the molecular surface can be reduced to σ-profiles and σ-potentials, which could be used for subsequent prediction of the interactions between oily solvents and bioactive compounds based on a quantum-chemical approach. COSMO-RS is known as a modern and powerful method with the combination of quantum chemical considerations (COSMO) and statistical thermodynamics (RS) for molecular description with predicted thermodynamic properties and further solvent prescreening without any experimental data [
