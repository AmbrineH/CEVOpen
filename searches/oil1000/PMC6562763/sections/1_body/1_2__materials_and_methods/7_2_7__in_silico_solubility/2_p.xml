<p class="p">As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-08-00140-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, COSMO-RS generally involves two major steps. All molecules are embedded into virtual conductors simulated in the first step by the COSMO model, where the molecule induces a polarization charge density (Ïƒ) on its surface that is a good local descriptor of the molecular surface polarity. Therefore, molecules during the quantum calculation are converged to their energetically optimal states in the conductor with respect to electron density and geometry. Density functional theory (DFT) with triple zeta valence polarized basis set (TZVP) were used as the standard quantum chemical method throughout this study.
