<p class="p">The statistical thermodynamics calculation was used in the second step. This polarization charge density was used for the quantification of the interaction energy of pair-wise interacting surface segments concerning electrostatics and hydrogen bonding. The 3D distribution of the polarization charges on the surface of each molecule was converted into a surface composition function (σ-profile) that provided the information about molecular polarity distribution. The thermodynamics of molecular interactions based on the σ-profile obtained was then calculated to chemical potential of the surface segment (σ-potential) using the COSMO
 <italic class="italic">thermX</italic> program (version C30 release 13.01). The σ-potential describes the likeliness of the solute compound interacting with solvents according to their polarities and hydrogen bonds, where the part of the negative charge of molecules (hydrogen bond acceptor) was located on the right side with positive σ-profile values, whereas the part of the positive charge (hydrogen bond donor) was located on the left side with negative σ-profile values. The solvent’s affinity for polarity surface could be interpreted according to the σ-profile and σ-potential in order to better understand the solute–solvent interaction in a mixture state.
