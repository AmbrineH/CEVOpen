Briefly, the dried rosemary leaves were mechanically ground and passed through No. 60 mesh screens (0.25 mm) for further maceration. The resulting fine powders (3.75 g) were poured into flasks containing 25 mL of various vegetable oils on a magnetic stirrer plate (RT-10, IKAMAG, Staufen, Germany) at 40 °C for 3 h. Meanwhile, the total phenolic content (TPC) in the rosemary leaves was determined by reflux extraction (EMA0250 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) of rosemary leaf powders (3.75 g) in 25 mL of aqueous methanol (methanol/water, 90:10
