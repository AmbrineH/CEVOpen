<p class="p">From experimental results above, it can be noted that oily solvents with various solutes are multi-component systems for which it is difficult to predict the dissolving power due to their complexities. Conventional solubility simulation methods (Hilderbrand or Hansen solubility parameters, etc.) often underestimate molecular structural difference and interaction force (type, proportion, and position of three main fatty acid chains in TAG, etc.) resulting in predicted results with little differences between each other. Thus, a powerful COSMO-RS simulation was conducted to determine the relative solubility of both phenolic antioxidants and VACs in refined soybean oils and their mixtures with oil derivatives. The σ-potentials of solvents and solutes (i.e., TAGs, oil derivatives, major antioxidants, and VACs) derived from the COSMO-RS simulation can be successfully employed to describe and classify solvents in a purely predictive manner with a good consideration of hydrogen bond donor–acceptor interactions. Generally, the region σ ± 0.01 e/A
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is considered as non-polar or weakly polar. For instance, the σ-profile of limonene showed two peaks resulting from the hydrogen atoms on the negative side and from the carbon atoms on the positive side. Therefore, the σ-potential of limonene was similar to the U-shape centered at σ = 0, which is the typical characteristic of non-polar solvents. As represented in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-08-00140-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the TAG composition possibilities in refined soybean oils including 66% of TAG 1 (R1: C18:2, R2: C18:2, R3: C18:2), 23% of TAG 2 (R1: C18:1, R2: C18:2, R3: C18:2), and 11% of TAG 3 (R1: C18:2, R2: C18:1, R3: C16:0), and their mixtures with oil derivatives could be taken into consideration in this quantic chemical approach. As the logarithm of the best solubility is set to 0, all these solvents could be predicted under simulated industrial conditions at 40 °C. It was found that the relative solubility of all components was below zero, indicating that these oily solvents may not be perfect solvents theoretically though they have considerable dissolving power in real extractions. Compared to the relative solubility value of refined soybean oil as the reference solvent, oily solvents with higher relative solubility values (in green) could be recognized as having better dissolving powers. Otherwise, solvents with poorer dissolving capacities had lower relative solubility values (in red). The theoretical solubility of both non-volatile antioxidants and VACs in the mixture of refined soybean oil and oil derivatives was in good consistency with experimental data, with the exception of camphor in refined soybean oils with DAG. Overall, refined soybean oils with soy lecithin (1%,
