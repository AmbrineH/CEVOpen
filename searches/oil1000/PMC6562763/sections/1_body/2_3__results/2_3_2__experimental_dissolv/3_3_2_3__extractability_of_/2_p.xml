<p class="p">Major monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., α-pinene, limonene, and 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene) and highly odoriferous oxygenated monoterpenes (e.g., borneol, camphor, eucalyptol, and terpinen-4-ol) were both quantified in all oily extracts, but their contents were different from those in rosemary essential oils [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Eucalyptol was found as the major compound in oily solvents with the highest concentration, followed by camphor, α-pinene, 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene, and limonene. Different refined oil solvents showed an individual difference regarding the proportion of major VACs extracted (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-08-00140" class="xref">Figure S2a, Supplementary Materials</xref>). In other words, the highest contents of major VACs observed here were eucalyptol (49.26% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>) in wheat germ oil, camphor (13.48% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>) in rapeseed oil, α-pinene in soybean oil (10.70% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>), terpinen-4-ol (3.65% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>) in corn oil, as well as limonene (7.96% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene (9.27% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>), and borneol (3.05% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) in hazelnut oil. Furthermore, the mixture of refined soybean oil and 1% w/w of oil derivatives was studied as well to verify its performance consistency (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-08-00140" class="xref">Figure S2b, Supplementary Materials</xref>). Compared to refined soybean oil solely, the addition of oil derivatives could help to significantly increase the extraction yield of eucalyptol and α-pinene than other VACs. The highest content of camphor (16.61% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>), terpinen-4-ol (4.24% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>), and borneol (3.66% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) was found in the mixture of refined soybean oil and DAG. Therefore, it is worthy to note that adding oil derivatives to refined oil solvents could increase the extraction selectivity of VACs, which gave a higher yield of total oxygenated monoterpenes than total monoterpene hydrocarbons compared to using refined oils alone (
