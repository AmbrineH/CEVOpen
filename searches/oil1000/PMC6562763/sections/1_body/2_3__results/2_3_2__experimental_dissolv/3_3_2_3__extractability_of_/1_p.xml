<p class="p">The standard of seven VACs at the same different concentration gradients was analyzed first in different aromatized oils under the same HS-SPME/GC-MS conditions in order to evaluate the extraction efficiency of the oily matrix and HS-SPME fiber. The fiber used was kept consistent and updated for analyses of each independent aromatized oil in order to minimize the error quantification. The content of major VACs in all oily solvents is presented in
