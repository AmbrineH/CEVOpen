<p class="p">The TPC in refined vegetable oils and mixtures with their derivatives as solvents quantified by the Folin–Ciocalteu test is illustrated in

Generally, these refined oils consisting of more than ≥98% TAGs are often considered as strictly non-polar liquid solvents which are unfavorable for extraction. Therefore, only 1/3 of the refined oil solvents (avocado, olive, corn, and soybean) in this study showed relatively higher TPC yield, among which soybean oil obtained the highest (
