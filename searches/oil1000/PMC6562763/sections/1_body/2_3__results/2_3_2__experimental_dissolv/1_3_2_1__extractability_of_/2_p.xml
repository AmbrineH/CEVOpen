<p class="p">This could be explained by its highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, allowing it to give itself a lower viscosity corresponding to a higher diffusivity that helps to increase the extraction yield. However, it was found that there is no obvious correlation between the TPC extraction yield (0.07–3.25 mg in 3.75 g of rosemary powders) and the polyunsaturation level of refined oil solvents (6.2–75.8%), which indicates that the TPC extraction yield may be more related to the presence of endogenous amphiphilic compounds like partial glycerides and phospholipids, and the refining degree of oils as well. For this, with the aim of further improving the dissolving power of refined soybean oils, the influence of oil derivatives on the TPC extraction was studied at the same dosage (1% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>). Compared to the refined soybean oil, the addition of amphiphilic oil derivatives helped to increase the TPC extraction efficiency with the exception of DAG (

The performance of these food additives was found corresponding to the order of their hydrophilicity: soy lecithin &gt; GMO &gt; GMS &gt; DAG. The presence of more polar phosphate groups in the soy lecithin allowed the formation of more reverse micelles containing phenolic compounds in the water pool center [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], which led to the highest TPC increment by approximately a factor of 1.7. Because of the higher lipophilicity of DAG, it obtained a lower TPC yield than MAG. GMO had a higher TPC extraction yield than that of GMS, which could be explained by the fact that the unsaturated GMO with a higher polarity and lower viscosity could facilitate the TPC extraction.
