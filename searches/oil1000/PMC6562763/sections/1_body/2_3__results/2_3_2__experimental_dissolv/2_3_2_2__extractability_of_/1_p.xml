<p class="p">Specifically, the content of main antioxidants in the refined oil solvents and their mixtures with oil derivatives is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-08-00140-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. All refined vegetable oils used were capable of extracting apolar carnosol and carnosic acid to various degrees, whereas polar rosmarinic acid was undetectable in all oil solvents. Similar to TPC results, the highest content of carnosic acid (1.76 mg in 100 g oil) and carnosol (0.16 mg in 100 g oil) was also observed in refined soybean oils (
