<p class="p">Soy lecithin was the most suitable additive for the extraction of main rosemary antioxidants, followed by GMO, GMS, and DAG. Although the content of carnosic acid and carnosol in the solvent system was not as much as that in refined soybean oils, it is interesting to quantitatively detect rosmarinic acids within. Its higher extractability for both polar and non-polar compounds could also be the reason why the solvent system gave the highest TPC content compared to other oily solvents. Considering the relatively high extractability to phenolic compounds, refined soybean oil and its mixture with soy lecithin could be considered as good solvents for the extraction of rosemary antioxidant compounds.</p>
