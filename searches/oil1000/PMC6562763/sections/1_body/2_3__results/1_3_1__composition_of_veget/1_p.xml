 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. According to the main three fatty acid chains on the triglyceride (TAG), it was noted that most vegetable oils (rapeseed, hazelnut, sweet almond, apricot, sunflower, and peanut oils) contained the same major fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid–oleic acid–linoleic acid (OOL)) with different proportions. Similarly, the major fatty acid compositions in grapeseed, corn, wheat germ, and soybean oils were oleic acid–linoleic acid–linoleic acid (OLL) and avocado oil had its own main fatty acid composition as oleic acid–oleic acid–palmitic acid (OOP). Moreover, three oleic acids (OOO) was inferred in the TAG of olive oil. The above-mentioned four categories of three major fatty acids represented 12 vegetable oils, which could be selected to constitute TAG structures for further computational simulations. Apart from the major composition in oils, it must be mentioned that minor compounds including diglycerides (DAGs), monoglycerides (MAGs), and phospholipids could be considered as food-grade surfactants, which can strongly affect the physiochemical and dissolving properties of the vegetable oils [
