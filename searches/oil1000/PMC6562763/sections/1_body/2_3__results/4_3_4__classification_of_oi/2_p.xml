<p class="p">The oily solvents merging together within each cluster showed low dissimilarity on the dissolving power. Therefore, the low dissimilarity was found in cluster 1 among several sub-clusters in the same color (refined sunflower, peanut, almond, and apricot oils, etc.), and in cluster 2 between refined soybean oil with GMO and GMS. However, some oily solvents presented high dissimilarity corresponding to their lower or higher dissolving powers as compared to others. For instance, refined wheat germ and rapeseed oils in the same sub-cluster had nearly the same dissolving power with much lower yields for all bioactive compounds extracted, although they had a relatively higher affinity to VACs. Refined hazelnut oil with the lowest dissolving power showed the highest dissimilarity, which was isolated at a distance from others in the PCA graphs. A similar case happened in another cluster for refined soybean oil with DAG, which also had the lowest dissolving power. Nonetheless, refined soybean oil with soy lecithin showed a high dissimilarity because of its best performance in the oleo-extraction of both non-volatile and volatile bioactive compounds from rosemary. Interestingly, refined vegetable oils having similar TAG composition were distributed in different sub-clusters, which also further states the fact that the dissolving power of these complex solvents is more correlated to their endogenous amphiphilic constitutes. Refined sunflower oil was previously reported as the optimal product for the extraction of six VACs from basil [

Nevertheless, refined soybean oil had a better dissolving power in this work for the maximal extraction of non-volatile antioxidants and VACs from rosemary, indicating the specificity of oleo-extraction that is worthy for case-by-case studies. All results were in good consistency with the PCA observation and theoretical relative solubility results, which further proved the effectiveness of COSMO-RS for a priori solvent screening before trial and error.
