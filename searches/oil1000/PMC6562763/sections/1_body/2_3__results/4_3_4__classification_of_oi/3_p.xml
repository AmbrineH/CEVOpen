<p class="p">Since the dissolving power of vegetable oils have been confirmed as alternative solvents for natural product extractions, a novel oleo-extraction process could be subsequently developed based on green extraction principles with the integration of innovative techniques (ultrasound, microwave, etc.), resulting in a high-efficiency, time- and energy-saving extraction, as well as high value-added lipidic products with the maximal risk reduction of oxidation or degradation thanks to the extracted bioactive compounds within [

In addition, vegetable oils could also be extracted by other alternative eco-friendly solvents (terpenes, 2-MeTHF, liquefied gas, etc.) to n-hexane, which conceivably led to a truly green extraction process for future industrial applications [
