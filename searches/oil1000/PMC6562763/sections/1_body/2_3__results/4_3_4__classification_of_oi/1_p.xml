<p class="p">Generally, the variability of independent principal components is the percentage of information which is well represented for other components. In this case, the PCA plotted all oily solvents with the main components PC1, PC2, and PC3 representing 95.27% of the original information with less than 5% loss of information (

The distribution of 16 oily solvents on the 2D mapping graphs (PC1 versus PC2 and PC1 versus PC3) described well their inner similarity depending on the experimental solubility of TPC, non-volatile antioxidants, and VACs inside, which is directly related to independent variables that can bring significant information for the oily solvent discrimination. The following clustering analysis was carried out on the basis of the concentration of both non-volatile and volatile bioactive compounds as well (

The dendrogram showed that the dissolving power of oily solvents could be finally aggregated into two main clusters. The first cluster including all refined vegetable oils showed the highest dissimilarity as compared to the second cluster, which indicated the significant effect of the addition of oil derivatives to refined oil solvents on their extraction improvement.
