<p class="p">This study aimed at developing a green oleo-extraction of total volatile and non-volatile bioactive compounds from rosemary leaves towards a zero-waste biorefinery concept using vegetable oils and their amphiphilic derivative constitutes as bio-based solvents. The experimental results showed that refined soybean oil performed the best concerning the yield of both major phenolic antioxidants and VACs in rosemary. Moreover, the addition of oil derivatives, soy lecithin in particular, surprisingly improved the extraction efficiency of more polar compounds and VACs on the basis of the original oleo-extraction. Meanwhile, a good consistency with COSMO-RS simulation proved its suitability for modeling these supramolecular solvent systems, which could overcome the limit of conventional solubility methods. Considering theoretical, experimental, and statistical results, refined soybean oil with soy lecithin (1%, w/w) appears to be the most promising and economically viable solvent among all oily solvents tested for the maximal extraction of major antioxidants and VACs from rosemary.</p>
