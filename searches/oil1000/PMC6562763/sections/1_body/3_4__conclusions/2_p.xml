<p class="p">From the practical point of view, COSMO-RS could be conducted as a heuristic tool before real extractions for a low-cost and high-accuracy screening of complex solvents or multicomponent soluteâ€“solvent mixtures. As the dissolving power of vegetable oils as bio-based solvents has been gradually proved for solutes with a broader range of polarity, the green oleo-extraction updated in this study is more comprehensive, where no additional separation steps are required after extractions. Revisiting this safe, easy-to-use, and eco-friendly method has produced novel enriched oils, thereby providing a relatively green solution towards the biorefinery of wastes from the processing of nearly all plant materials, depending on the market demand in the cosmetic and agro-food industries.</p>
