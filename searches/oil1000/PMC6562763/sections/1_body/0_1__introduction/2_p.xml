<p class="p">Extraction, as the key step in many common process industries and the major expenditure (â‰¥50%) of the total costs, has been paramount within the scope of biorefinery technological development in particular [
 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Considering the increasing demand to reduce the amount of time, energy, costs, and solvents involved in conventional extraction procedures, green extraction with its principles regarding renewable raw materials, alternative solvents [

 <xref rid="B6-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reduced energy consumption, process intensification, and production of co-products instead of wastes may be well suited as an alternative for a green biorefinery [
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-08-00140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Currently, several representative technologies such as ultrasound, microwave, supercritical fluids, and instantaneous controlled decompression have successfully proved their effectiveness for the green extraction of natural products from laboratorial to industrial scale [
