<p class="p">The novelty of this work is the development of a direct oleo-extraction method towards the zero-waste biorefinery concept using vegetable oils and their amphiphilic derivatives as solvents, which facilitates the simultaneous extraction of both volatile and non-volatile bioactive compounds from rosemary leaves (

The large consumption of conventional volatile organic solvents was replaced in this maximal extraction of rosemary compounds so that potential risk factors could be avoided. Moreover, the COSMO-RS (COnductor like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents) simulation study helped to theoretically predict the solventâ€“solute miscibility and further confirm the experimental extractability of all oily solvents for a better comprehension of the dissolving mechanism. In addition, the maximal extraction efficiency of refined soybean oils was verified for the first time with the addition of their amphiphilic derivatives as food-grade surfactants in both a theoretical and an experimental way.
