<p class="p">The large quantities of biomass wastes generated from food processing industries worldwide could be considered as a huge potential resource with high-value compounds for biorefinery, which can provide bio-based chemicals and renewable energy with high added value rather than environmental pollution compromising the economy, environment, and human society in the future [

Although the existing biorefinery technologies (anaerobic digestion, fermentation, hydrothermal conversion, pyrolysis, etc.) have been widely studied and applied in biomass waste reutilization, increasing concern about high setup costs accompanied by incomplete resource utilization, and even secondary pollution, is compelling the scientific, industrial, and government communities to focus more efforts on developing green biorefinery technologies that integrate innovative technologies, which is crucial in achieving maximum recognition of biowastes as chemical and energy resources [
