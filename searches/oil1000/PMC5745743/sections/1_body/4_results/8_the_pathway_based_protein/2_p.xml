 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. As Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shown, most nodes of the pathway-based protein association network exhibited high values of C. On the other hand, L of the network was only 2.59. Short average path length and relatively high clustering coefficient suggested that the pathway-based protein association network had small-world property. This property demonstrated that the network was consisted of many small, but highly connected modules which combined in a hierarchical manner, and exhibited as larger, less cohesive units [
