 <italic class="italic">O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">thunbergii</italic> essential oil. Eugenol and geraniol were reported to exert multiple pharmacological actions. For instance, eugenol exhibited potential to inhibit ehrlich ascites and solid carcinoma [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Geraniol in essential oil of plants was reported to modulate DNA synthesis and potentiates 5-fluorouracil efficacy on human colon tumor xenografts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Experimental evidences showed the therapeutic or preventive effects of geraniol on other different types of cancer, such as breast, lung, pancreatic, and hepatic cancer [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. In addition, geraniol in plant essential oil also exhibited anti-microbial activity against many microorganisms [
