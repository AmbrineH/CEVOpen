<p class="p">According to serum lipoprotein profiles, the CS diet appears to be the most plausible combination of dietary components to induce atherosclerosis among the groups. Although sufficient cholesterol circulated in the bloodstream, why did the CS diet induce the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver? Furthermore, why was the level of LAC1 significantly higher in the CS group than in the other groups (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). A certain number of cholesterol molecules may be required to assemble LAC1, regardless of the demand for cholesterol in peripheral tissue. Therefore, cholesterol may be necessary as a carrier in order to maintain a constant level of TG. Since mammals are not able to fully hydrolyze cholesterol, excess cholesterol must be removed mainly through its conversion to bile acids [

A sufficient lipid level was maintained in the peripheral tissue of rats fed the CS diet and the voluntary uptake of lipids from the diet was not essential; therefore, the concentration of fecal bile acid was presumably not increased. Mammals have adapted to starvation throughout almost the whole process of evolution, and, thus, they may not have gained a sufficient ability to reduce excess cholesterol. Excess LDL1 and LDL2 are presumed to be recovered by the liver. However, re-incorporating cholesterol into VLDL may be difficult because the recovery and synthesis of VLDL occur in different hepatocytes; if these processes were performed within a cell, the cell has to distinguish the particles of likely protein components and sizes: particles under development and recovery. Therefore, reloading may require the intrahepatic transfer of recovered cholesterol, which requires energy and time [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. LAC1, which contains a large amount of serum cholesterol, appears to be utilized as a convenient cholesterol pool; however, this pool may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
