<p class="p">We assume that the levels of lipoproteins transporting TG and cholesterol to peripheral tissues are generally maintained at specific levels (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s004" class="xref">S4</xref>) through a similar mechanism as glucose homeostasis. However, this regulation appears to be exceptional in the TF group. Total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the CS group than in the other groups (

The lipoprotein profile may be assessed by the metabolic balance between the synthesis and degradation of substances. The transcriptome analysis revealed that fatty acid synthesis was significantly suppressed in the tofu groups (Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s011" class="xref">S6</xref>), whereas this alteration was not observed in the metabolome of lipoproteins. Therefore, homeostasis may be maintained at the level of the metabolome. Alternatively, the demand for cholesterol in peripheral tissue may have been reduced in the tofu groups. In the present study, the health of rats did not appear to be impaired, possibly because the experimental period was not long enough to perturb physiological homeostasis.
