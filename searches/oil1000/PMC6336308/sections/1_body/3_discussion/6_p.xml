<p class="p">Our results suggested that the intake of fish oil caused the excessive degradation of PUFAs in the liver. Some PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, are essential for mammals because of the lack of several types of desaturases [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]; fish oil is a good source of these fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of the liver was strongly influenced by dietary fat (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s010" class="xref">S5 Table</xref>). Excessive PUFAs alter cell membrane fluidity [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], and ω-3 fatty acid epoxides mediate signal transduction that enhances mast cell activation and anaphylaxis; this may be cytotoxic for cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Inflammatory cells and molecules are recruited and accumulate on atherosclerotic lesions, and these lesions are enlarged during the process of dead cell clearance [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Thus, the excessive accumulation of PUFAs may contribute to the progression of inflammation and atherosclerosis. The saturation and desaturation of fatty acids are reversible reactions. The cytotoxicity of excessive PUFAs may be attenuated if mammals possess appropriate enzymes: i.e., desaturases; although these enzymes were named from a single direction, the reactions are reversible; ω-3 fatty acids are essential because animals do not have desaturases. Therefore, excess fatty acids need to be stepwise oxidized to acetyl-CoA. We speculated that the induction of hepatic fatty acid oxidation in rats fed fish oil indicated the degradation of toxic PUFAs. The acetyl-CoA produced may be used to resynthesize fatty acids; however, the levels of transcriptome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s012" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>) and enzymatic activity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s013" class="xref">S8 Table</xref>) did not indicate that acetyl-CoA was used in fatty acid synthesis. Fish oil increased the mRNA level of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, catalyzing the reverse reaction of a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s012" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>). Fish oil reduced almost all classes of lipoproteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Fish oil may suppress hepatic fatty acid synthesis, and acetyl-CoA was oxidized or used for other reactions. Since the selective β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids does not appear to be possible, 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesized fatty acids may be at least partly degraded when fatty acid β-oxidation is stimulated. In this case, energy is dissipated for the elongation of fatty acid chains. The suppression of fatty acid synthesis may prevent wasted energy expenditure. Moreover, liver weights in the fish oil groups may have increased due to the detoxification of PUFAs.
