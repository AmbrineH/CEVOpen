<p class="p">Since tofu and fish oil independently affected the levels of different lipoprotein classes in serum (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s012" class="xref">S7</xref> Tables), the mechanisms underlying this regulation by these dietary factors differ. Tofu suppressed mRNA expression by regulating hepatic fatty acid synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s011" class="xref">S6 Table</xref>). These results were consistent with our previous findings [

 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Fish oil facilitated the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and catabolism (
