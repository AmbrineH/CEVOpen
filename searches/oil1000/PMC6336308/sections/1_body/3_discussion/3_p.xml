<p class="p">Since the level of LAC1 was markedly higher than that of LAC2, the total level of LAC was considered to be strongly suppressed by tofu and fish oil (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). LAC1 and LAC2 are a complex of LDLs and anti-proteases [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The anti-proteases alpha-1-macroglobulin (A1m) and alpha-1-inhibitor 3 (A1i3) were detected in LAC1 and LAC2, respectively. In the CS group, LAC1, along with LDL1 and LDL2, contained a large amount of serum cholesterol, whereas the level of LAC2 was approximately 1/10 that of LAC1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Although limited information is currently available on these proteases, if LAC, as a complex of thrombotic material and an anti-fibrinolysis enzyme, is a cause of atheroma, soy protein and fish oil have the potential to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. We speculate that fish oil decreased total cholesterol levels in serum, while tofu suppressed the synthesis of cholesterol. The mRNA levels of genes involved in hepatic cholesterol synthesis were lower in the tofu diet groups than in the casein groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s007" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). Since soy protein is known to increase the rates of cholesterol turnover, cholesterol oxidation, and fecal steroid excretion and reduce cholesterol absorption [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], these actions may have contributed to decreasing serum cholesterol levels in the tofu diet groups. In contrast, fish oil effectively suppressed cholesterol levels in the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, particularly LDL1 and LAC1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the ingestion of fish oil stimulated the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid Î²-oxidation (Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s012" class="xref">S7</xref>). Fatty acids are esterified with cholesterol stored in lipoproteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that esterified fatty acids were rapidly degraded, and the cholesterol residue was excreted as a bile acid into feces. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this regulation were not elucidated in the present study.
