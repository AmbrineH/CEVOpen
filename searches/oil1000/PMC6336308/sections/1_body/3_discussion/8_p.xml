<p class="p">We herein propose an alternative pathway model for lipoprotein metabolism considering the detoxification of PUFAs and steroids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). In this model, CM is preferentially captured by the liver, degraded, and reconstructed into smaller lipoproteins. TG is transported to peripheral tissues by VLDL. However, the present model is not opposed to our previous model [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It is another aspect that is observed from different directions of the same phenomenon. The probability of one CM particle being metabolized in any tissue may be influenced by the affinity between the apolipoprotein included in CM and lipases in peripheral tissues. Since CM is not necessarily a homogeneous particle, affinity may vary depending on the apolipoprotein in CM.
