<p class="p">Changes in the particle sizes of LDL by tofu may reflect differences in apoproteins, which influences the qualitative properties of lipoproteins. Differences in particle sizes (represented in time; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>) were less prominent than those in the quantity of lipoproteins (represented in the levels of cholesterol and TG; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s004" class="xref">S4</xref> Figs) among individual samples. Furthermore, the log normal distribution and its Ïƒ were nearly constant in the dietary group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the particle sizes of lipoproteins were generally conserved and stable [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In terms of a process of elimination, differences in particle sizes appear to represent those in the types of components, possibly apolipoproteins, instead of the amount of lipids being transported. Since apolipoproteins are specific to their receptors, the characteristics of lipoproteins vary depending on the proteins contained within. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), the primary apolipoprotein of LDL particles, is a candidate for the cause of these changes. The protein size of ApoB is known to be modulated by dietary conditions via RNA editing [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In principle, the larger molecular weight form (ApoB100) is known to be synthesized in the liver, whereas the smaller molecular weight form (ApoB48) is synthesized in the intestine. However, evidence for this tissue specificity is limited. ApoB100 was predominant in the fetal human intestine, but disappeared in the adult intestine in which ApoB48 was synthesized [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, the tissue-specific localization of apolipoproteins is possibly altered by diets. Alternatively, lipoproteins may include unknown apolipoproteins. We previously reported that lipoproteins may contain more protein than previously considered [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify and directly measure these apolipoproteins in the present study. In principle, proteins are more difficult to identify than RNA because their biochemical properties are divergent.
