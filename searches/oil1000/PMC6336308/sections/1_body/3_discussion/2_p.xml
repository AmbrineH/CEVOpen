<p class="p">We speculate that differences in the particle sizes of lipoproteins may affect their turnover rates. Tofu slightly increased LDL1 particle sizes, but decreased those of VLDL and LDL2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), which implies that particles at the void volume of the gel-filtration column increased. As described above, size differences may be reflected by the types of apolipoproteins. Therefore, the affinity of lipoproteins and their receptors vary depending on the constituents of apolipoproteins. Increases in the levels of LDL1 and VLDL classes in the TS group may be influenced by these changes (
