<p class="p">Dietary soy protein and fish oil may improve lipoprotein profiles, thereby reducing the risk of vascular disease. A previous study reported that soy protein mainly reduced cholesterol and phospholipid levels in VLDL and LDL [

Therefore, dietary soy protein and fish oil may favorably regulate lipoprotein metabolism and contribute to reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated how soy protein-rich tofu and Ï‰-3 PUFA-rich fish oil affect the types and amounts of serum lipoproteins in rats using a gel filtration system [

Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the hepatic transcriptome was performed to examine changes in lipid metabolism, and the involvement of dietary factors in the modulation of circulating lipoproteins was demonstrated. Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies revealed that soy protein and fish oil independently modulated lipoprotein metabolism. These dietary components both markedly decreased the concentration of LAC1, which is presumed to be the cause of atherosclerosis.
