 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Chylomicrons (CM) incorporate dietary lipids in the small intestine. Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) incorporate endogenous lipids in the liver. These particles and their metabolized derivatives transport lipids to peripheral tissues. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is responsible for the transport of lipids from peripheral tissues to the liver. We recently identified ubiquitous lipoprotein LDL-anti-protease complexes (LACs), which are 10-15-nm liver-derived particles that hold large amounts of cholesterol, in the serum of the rat [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Since LACs consist of cholesterol and anti-protease, they may promote atherosclerosis by supplying the material of the plaque and inhibiting plasmin activity. Despite this potential risk, since they have a very high density, LACs may have been wrongly categorized as HDL. Therefore, they may be important for elucidating the relationship between lipoprotein metabolomics and atherosclerosis.
