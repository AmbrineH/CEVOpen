<p class="p">Dietary lifestyles may be related to the risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the mechanisms by which diet affects disease progression remain unknown. The effects of diet on the risk of cardiovascular disease have been extensively investigated in epidemiological and intervention studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]; epidemiological studies indicated that the habitual consumption of soy and fish contribute to reducing cardiovascular disease mortality rates to low as those among Japanese populations [
