<p class="p">Cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide, is associated with atheroma. Its major direct cause appears to be the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], and focal arterial inflammatory activity is one of its most prominent characteristics [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Continuous exposure to inflammation or other types of endothelial activation increases vascular permeability, thereby allowing excess lipid infiltration in the intima and promoting transmigration on immune cells and monocytes, resulting in the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The formation of fragile and leaky vessels that invade the expanding intima concomitantly contributes to enlarging the necrotic core, which increases the vulnerability of the plaque [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. When plaques rupture, prothrombotic material is exposed to the coagulation system with the ensuing inhibition of blood flow [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Since atherosclerotic plaques contain a fibrous cap overlying a lipid-rich necrotic core consisting of oxidized lipoproteins, cholesterol crystals, and cellular debris [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], high plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations are considered to contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, previous cohort studies did not find a correlation between LDL-cholesterol levels and the incidence of coronary events [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Thus, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines did not specify the LDL and non-HDL cholesterol goals needed to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [
