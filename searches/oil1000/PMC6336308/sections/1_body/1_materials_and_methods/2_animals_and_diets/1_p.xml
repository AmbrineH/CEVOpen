<p class="p">Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan) at 4 weeks of age. Animals were housed individually in a room with a controlled temperature (23 ± 1°C) and humidity (55 ± 5%), and 12-h light-dark cycle for 5 days. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 7–8) and assigned an experimental diet for 21 days: casein and soybean oil diet (CS); casein and fish oil diet (CF); tofu and soybean oil diet (TS); tofu and fish oil diet (TF). Casein and soybean oil were employed as a reference to tofu and fish oil for protein and fat sources, respectively. The total protein and fat contents of each diet were 200 and 150 g/kg, respectively. In fish oil diets, 50 g/kg of fish oil was replaced with the same amount of soybean oil (CF and TF). Since freeze-dried tofu contained large amounts of fat and protein, the amount of tofu that covered 100 g/kg of fat was approximately 290 g/kg (equivalent to 14.6% protein in diet). Thus, 60.9 g/kg of casein (equivalent to 5.4% protein) was supplemented in order to adjust dietary protein contents in the tofu diets (TS and TF). The compositions of the experimental diets were shown in

Feces were collected for 3 days prior to dissection and stored at −30°C. At the end of the experimental period, animals were euthanized by collecting blood from the abdominal aorta under isoflurane anesthesia after being deprived of food for 3 h. Liver samples were immediately excised, weighed, frozen in liquid N
