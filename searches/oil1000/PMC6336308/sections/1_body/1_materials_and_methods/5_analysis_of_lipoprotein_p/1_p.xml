<p class="p">Serum lipoproteins were examined by the LipoSEARCH profiling service (Skylight Biotech Inc., Akita, Japan). Briefly, lipoproteins in serum were separated using a gel filtration HPLC system and the effluent was constitutively monitored for the concentrations of TG and cholesterol as described by Usui et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The output patterns of HPLC for TG and cholesterol were fit to the curve using the least number of parameters [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. This method estimated ten classes of lipoproteins and mimicked their elution patterns by a set of normal distributions. Since each class of lipoprotein had a similar size distribution among the diet classes, fitting started from values estimated in the previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and parameters were tuned to find a better fit to each data set. The appropriateness of the model was verified through the fit (
