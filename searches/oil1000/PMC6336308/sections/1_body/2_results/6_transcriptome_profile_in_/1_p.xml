<p class="p">The matrix of transcriptome data of samples by genes was analyzed using PCA (Method). The multivariate analysis separated the experimental groups into two individual directions. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>, PC1 and PC2 represented differences in dietary protein and fat sources, respectively; each group was clearly divided by the grids. These results suggested that protein and fat sources independently affect hepatic gene expression, and that gene expression reflected independent responses to tofu or fish oil (the contribution of PCs was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g007" class="xref">Fig 7B</xref>). The numbers of genes selected for PC1 and PC2 were 259 and 546, respectively, and only 96 were found in both. Scores for the selected genes in PC1 and PC2 showed Pearsonâ€™s correlation of -0.0641, negating a correlation between the axes.
