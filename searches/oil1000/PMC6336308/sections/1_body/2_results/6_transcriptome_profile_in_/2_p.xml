<p class="p">In PC1, tofu suppressed the mRNA expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid elongation, fatty acid desaturation, cholesterol synthesis, and fatty acid transport; this was clear from the annotated functions and keywords of the genes provided by the protein source (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s011" class="xref">S6</xref>). Tofu depressed the PC1-negative gene group including the lipogenic rate-limiting enzyme. Moreover, other lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthases, ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid desaturases, and SREBP-1, were involved in the gene list (
