<p class="p">On the other hand, PC2-positive genes suggested that the ingestion of fish oil stimulated the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation (Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s012" class="xref">S7</xref>). The fatty acid β-oxidation pathway contains several enzymes that catalyze irreversible reactions; the mRNA expression of these enzymes was stimulated well in the fish oil-fed groups. For example, the expression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in addition to irreversible thioesterases, was induced. Moreover, the enzymes of the genes required to catabolize the unsaturated fatty acids, enoly-CoA hydratase and enoyl-CoA Δ-isomerase, were present in the list. Other enzymes facilitating fatty acid β-oxidation, such as carnitine acyltransferases and acyl-CoA oxidase, and fatty acid catabolism represented by acyl-CoA thioesterases were also involved in the PC2-positive group. These reactions may induce the production or degradation of acetyl-CoA and/or fatty acid re-synthesis. Since the levels of mRNAs for some subunits of the rate-limiting enzyme of TCA cycle isocitrate dehydrogenase were slightly induced by fish oil, these enzymes may be involved in the oxidation of acetyl-CoA (

The mRNA expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which plays a role in the reverse reaction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, was strongly stimulated by fish oil. Although the transcript level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was increased in the casein groups, elevated levels of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase may cancel its activity and reduce the total production of fatty acids in the fish oil groups.
