 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Fish oil reduced the cholesterol levels of several lipoprotein classes (CM1, CM2, VLDL, LDL1, LDL2, LAC1, and HDL1). Cholesterol-rich lipoprotein LDL2 and LAC1 were sensitive to the fish oil diets; significant differences were observed between CS-TF and TS-TF in LDL2, and CS-CF and CS-TF in LAC1. The value for LAC1 was almost 50% lower in the fish oil groups than in the soy oil groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). The TS diet did not reduce the cholesterol levels of CMs, VLDL, LDLs, or LAC2 from those with the CS diet. In contrast, the level of LAC1, a major cholesterol-rich lipoprotein class, in the TS group was approximately 1/3 that in the CS group.
