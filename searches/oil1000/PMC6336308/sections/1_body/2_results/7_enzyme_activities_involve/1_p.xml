<p class="p">Alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism at the level of the transcriptome were verified by some enzymatic activities. The enzyme activities involved in fatty acid oxidation were significantly suppressed by tofu and fish oil (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s013" class="xref">S8 Table</xref>). The fish oil diets largely induced the activities of fatty acid Î²-oxidation enzymes, while the tofu diets slightly reduced peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation.
