<p class="p">Tofu modulated the particle sizes of several lipoprotein classes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210950.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). The peak time for the normal distribution is known to be proportional to the logarithm of the particle size [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]; thus, it represents the diameter of a lipoprotein. The elution times of VLDL and its metabolite LDL2 were delayed by the tofu diets, whereas those of LDL1 were earlier (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Regarding CM, the ratio of the earlier peak CM1 (larger than the pore size of our column) [
 <xref rid="pone.0210950.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] to the later peak CM2 was higher in the TS group than in the other groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210950.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). However, these variations in particle sizes were within a several percent range of their size. They did not correlate with the total amount of lipids in lipoproteins or variations in particle volumes. Therefore, the modulation of particle sizes may represent a qualitative change in apolipoproteins as described later.
