 </sup>: 3034–2995 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing the vibrational modes of unsaturated groups in lipid alkyl chains, named CH); 2995–2825 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing the vibrational modes of lipids, named LIP); 1754–1718 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing the vibrational modes of fatty acids, named FA); 1718–1481 cm

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing the vibrational modes of COO
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> groups in glutamate and aspartate amino acids, named COO); 1274–1181 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing the vibrational modes of phosphates groups inside nucleic acids, named PHOSPHO), and 1130–1013 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (containing above all the vibrational modes of carbohydrates, named CARBO). An arbitrary colour scale was used, white colour indicating areas with the highest absorbance values and blue colour areas with the lowest ones.
