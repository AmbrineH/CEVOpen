<p id="Par24" class="p">From each frozen ovarian sample, three thin sections (∼10 μm thickness) were cut at 200 μm from each other, by using a cryomicrotome. Sample sections were then deposited, without any fixation process, onto CaF
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> optical windows (1 mm thickness, 13 mm diameter) and air-dried for 30 min. FTIRI measurements were performed within 48 hours after cutting at the Infrared Beamline SISSI (Synchrotron Infrared Source for Spectroscopy and Imaging), Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste (Trieste, Italy). This procedure was already carried out on similar samples and a good stability in terms of infrared features was always observed

 </sup>. A Bruker VERTEX 70 interferometer coupled with a Hyperion 3000 Vis-IR microscope was used. The spectrometer was equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled bidimensional Focal Plane Array (FPA) detector that allows to perform the imaging analysis of non-homogeneous biological samples by simultaneously acquiring 4096 spectra on an area of 164 × 164 μm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The visible image of each ovarian section was obtained with a 15X condenser/objective and used to select areas containing oocytes at different development stages (previtellogenic, vitellogenic, mature, and atretic). On these selected areas, IR maps were collected in transmission mode in the 4000–900 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> MIR range with a spatial resolution of ~2.56 μm. Each spectrum was the result of 256 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The size of the areas to be mapped was chosen based on oocytes’ dimension. Background spectra were acquired on clean regions of CaF
