<p id="Par27" class="p">For a deeper analysis of the cellular compartments of oocytes at different development stages (oogonia (O) primary oocyte, PO; lipid stage, LS; vitellogenic, VTG; mature/hydrated, MAT, and atretic, ATR), some microareas representative of yolk vesicles (YV), lipid droplets (LD) and Zona Radiata (ZR) were chosen, each containing at least 200 IR spectra. These IR spectra were integrated under the same spectral regions above defined (Integration routine; OPUS 7.1 software package, Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). The sum of the integrated areas 3050–2800 and 1770–950 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was considered indicative of the total cell biomass (CELL). Integral values were used to calculate specific band area ratios (reported in the Results section).
