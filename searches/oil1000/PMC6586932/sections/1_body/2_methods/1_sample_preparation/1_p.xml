<p id="Par23" class="p">10 swordfish (
 <italic class="italic">Xiphias gladius)</italic> females with a Lower Jaw-Fork Length (LJFL) &gt;100 cm (according to Italian legislation) were caught by commercial vessels using long lines in the period May–July 2017, in the central Mediterranean Sea (Sardinia and Sicily). The fish were caught for commercial purpose and ovaries samples were collected under the guidelines of the biological samples indicated in the ICCAT manual. The procedures did not include animal experimentation, and ethics approval is not necessary in accordance with the Italian legislation (D.L. 4 of Mars 2014, n. 26, art. 2). Soon after capture, ovaries were removed; a gonad portion (∼2 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) was picked up from the middle part of the ovary of all specimens and preserved at −80 °C for FTIRI analysis.
