<p id="Par2" class="p">In teleost fish, eggs are the final product of oogenesis, a process during which the oocyte growths and differentiates. Eggs need all the necessary information to direct the development of free-swimming larvae as well all the ‘building blocks’ such as amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and maternal determinants, to form a viable embryo

 </sup>. These components are produced by the oocyte it-self or derived from several maternal sources and incorporated into the oocyte during oogenesis. When eggs lack specific compounds, or contain inappropriate amounts of them, they will be not able to sustain the development of a viable embryo. Hence, egg’s quality is strictly related to its cytoplasm composition
