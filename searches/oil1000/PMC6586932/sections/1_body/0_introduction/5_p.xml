<p id="Par6" class="p">Advances in comprehensive understanding of oogenesis process obtained by FTIRI will undoubtedly contribute to improve knowledge on the effects of environment (pollutants, food, overfishing, etc.) on egg quality and integrity in a wild and endangered species such as swordfish. By understanding the molecular and morphological changes that occur in oocytes, it will be possible to identify critical checkpoints in the reproduction of this endangered species.</p>
