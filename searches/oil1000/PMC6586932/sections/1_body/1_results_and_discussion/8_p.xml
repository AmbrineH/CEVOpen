<p id="Par14" class="p">Concomitantly, during lipid stage, the egg envelope named “Zona Radiata” (ZR) begins to form between the oocyte and the surrounding follicular cells

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. The thickness and complexity of ZR changes gradually during oocyte developmental stages: ZR continues to differentiate throughout the growth of the oocyte becoming highly ordered and architecturally complex during later maturational stages

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. ZR plays an important role during fertilization. In fact, glycoproteins composing the external part of ZR, have an affinity for spermatozoa and guides a single sperm into the micropyle to reach the egg cell

 </sup>. After fertilization, ZR will protect the embryo in the aquatic environment and will enable gas exchange, excretion and transport of nutrients from the external environment

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2E</xref>) and glutamate and aspartate amino acids (COO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2F</xref>) it was possible to evidence the appearance of a thin ZR.
