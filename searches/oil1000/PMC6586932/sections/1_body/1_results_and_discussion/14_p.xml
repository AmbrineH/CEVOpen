<p id="Par20" class="p">A portion of an atretic oocyte (ATR) is reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7A</xref>. Ovarian atresia is a common phenomenon in vertebrate ovaries during which a number of ovarian follicles recruited into the vitellogenesis pool fail to complete maturation and ovulation

 </sup>. The process of atresia and resorption of ovarian follicles in fish is characterized by oocyte marked morphological changes. The first morphological signs of atresia is the disintegration of cytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria, cortical alveoli, ...), followed by the fragmentation of the Zona Radiata

 </sup>. By comparing FTIRI results achieved on vitellogenic and atretic oocytes it was possible to obtain an imaging molecular signature that could readily and reliably differentiate vitellogenic oocytes from atretic ones. In particular, the Zona Radiata of the atretic oocyte shows a very different composition and organization with respect to that of a vitellogenic one. In particular, by analysing the IR map, he total absence of lipids (LIP, Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7F</xref>) and carbohydrates (CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7G</xref>) is observed. In addition, the plasma membrane (PM) is differently organized as indicated by the distribution of lipids (LIP, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7B</xref>), and cytoplasm is not homogeneous and presents a great number of vacuoles.
