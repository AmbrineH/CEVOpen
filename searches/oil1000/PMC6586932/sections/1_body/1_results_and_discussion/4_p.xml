<p id="Par10" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>, the microphotograph of an ovarian section at previtellogenic stage, containing oogonia (O) and primary oocytes (PO), is reported. The vibrational imaging analysis shows, both in O and PO, a similar and homogeneous composition of cytoplasm in terms of lipids and proteins, these latter representing the more abundant macromolecules among those investigated (LIP, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>, and PRT, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>). The analysis of the distribution of lipids and proteins did not highlight respectively the presence of membrane-limited vesicles inside the cytoplasm of the primary oocyte and of the Zona Radiata around it. Conversely, the concomitant accumulation of proteins (PRT, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>), phosphates (PHOSPHO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1D</xref>) and carbohydrates (CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1E</xref>) in a defined intra-cytoplasmic area of primary oocytes (as indicated by the white arrow in the upper right corner of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>) could be probably ascribed to the presence of the Balbiani Body (BB). In vertebrates, the Balbiani Body is asymmetrically positioned generally adjacent to the nucleus of primary oocytes, and it a transient collection of organelles including endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi
