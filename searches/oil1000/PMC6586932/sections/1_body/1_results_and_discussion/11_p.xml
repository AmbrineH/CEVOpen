<p id="Par17" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>, the inner portion of a vitellogenic oocyte containing at once oil droplets (OD), cortical alveoli (CA) and yolk vesicles (YV) is shown. The occurrence of yolk vesicles (YV) is put well in evidence by the topographical distribution of lipids (LIP, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref>), fatty acids (FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4C</xref>), phosphate groups (PHOSPHO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4G</xref>,), and, as further extent, also carbohydrates (CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4H</xref>). Conversely, the presence of oil droplets (OD), rich in fatty acids with a high rate of unsaturation, was monitored by the distribution of fatty acids (FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4C</xref>) and unsaturated lipid alkyl chains (CH, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4D</xref>). Cortical alveoli (CA), mainly composed by glycosylated proteins and poor in lipids, were highlighted by the topographical distribution of proteins (PRT, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4E</xref>), glutamate and aspartate amino acids (COO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4F</xref>), and also carbohydrates (CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4H</xref>).
