<p id="Par13" class="p">Neutral lipids derive from triglycerides-rich serum lipoproteins. They cross the oolemma either by simple diffusion or via the action of fatty acid transporters or binding proteins and are deposited as droplets in the ooplasm

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>), fatty acids (FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>) and unsaturated lipid alkyl chains (CH, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2D</xref>) it was possible to highlight both the crossing of the plasma membrane of unsaturated fatty acids coming from the outer of the cells and their accumulation in the form of oil droplets (OD) within the cytoplasm.
