 </sup>. In oviparous vertebrates, vitellogenin (VTG) is a lipoglycophosphoprotein synthetized in the liver and incorporated by the oocyte as major precursor of egg yolk proteins, essential nutrients for future embryogenesis

 </sup>. Once in the ovary, VTG enters the ovarian follicle through capillaries in follicular cells layer. It then passes through the pore canals of the ZR alongside the oocyte microvilli until it makes contact with the oocyte plasma membrane. VTG is incorporated into oocytes by binding specific VTG receptors localized on the oocyte plasma membrane and stored in endosomal vesicles. Finally, VTG containing vesicles blend with lysosome and VTG is cleaved by lysosomal enzymes to generate multiple egg yolk proteins

 </sup>. In the present study, by applying FTIRI spectroscopy, it was possible to characterize at macromolecular level the formation of yolk vesicles from the plasma membrane and their fusion with bigger yolk globules. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>, a portion of a swordfish vitellogenic oocyte (VTG) was showed. The topographic distribution of lipids (LIP, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B</xref>) and fatty acids (FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C</xref>), let identify in the inner part of the oocyte the concomitant presence of yolk vesicles (YV) and of oil droplets (OD) and outer of the oocyte, the Zona Radiata (ZR). The distribution of proteins (PRT, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3D</xref>), glutamate and aspartate amino acids (COO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3E</xref>) and carbohydrates (CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3F</xref>) are evident in both the ZR and YV.
