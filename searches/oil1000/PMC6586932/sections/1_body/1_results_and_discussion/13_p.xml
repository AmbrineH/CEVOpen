<p id="Par19" class="p">A portion of a hydrated mature oocyte (MAT) is reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>. The cytoplasm appears homogeneous and not organized in vesicles; the presence of holes could be attributed to the high degree of hydration typical of pelagic eggs. Following the distribution of lipids (LIP, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6B</xref>), it is possible to evidence the plasma membrane (PM). The occurrence of oil droplets (OD) which do not appear still fused in a central oil globule, is well highlighted by the distribution of unsaturated fatty acids (indicated by the concomitant distribution of both fatty acids, FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6C</xref>, and unsaturated alkyl chains CH, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6D</xref>). In this stage, it is well evident the increase of the Zona Radiata, rich in glycosylated proteins (PRT, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6E</xref>; COO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6F</xref>, and CARBO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6H</xref>). Conversely, phosphate groups (PHOSPHO, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6G</xref>) and unsaturated fatty acids (FA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6C</xref>, and CH, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6D</xref>) are not detected in this area.
