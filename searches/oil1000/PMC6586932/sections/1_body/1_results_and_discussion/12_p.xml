<p id="Par18" class="p">The macromolecular characterization of yolk vesicles (YV), oil droplets (OD) and cortical alveoli (CA) into vitellogenic oocytes was also obtained by a semiquantitative analysis of the spectral data (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Yolk vesicles (YV) resulted rich in proteins (PRT/CELL), phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL), and carbohydrates (CARBO/CELL). Cortical alveoli (CA) contained above all proteins (PRT/CELL), carbohydrates (CARBO/CELL) and phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL), while they were poor in lipids (LIP/CELL) and fatty acids (FA/LIP). Finally, oil droplets (OD) were found to be characterized by a high concentration of lipids (LIP/CELL) and, mainly, fatty acids (FA/LIP) with a high rate of unsaturation level (CH/LIP), and a really low amount of phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL), proteins (PRT/CELL) and carbohydrates (CARBO/CELL).
