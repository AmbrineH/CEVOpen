<p id="Par21" class="p">A deeper focus on ZR macromolecular composition was done by applying a spettroscopic semiquantitative analysis comparing ZR from previtellogenic (PV), vitellogenic (VTG), mature (MAT) and atretic (ATR) oocytes (Fig.Â

 </sup>. Nevertheless, in the present study, the coupling of spectral imaging with semiquantitative analysis of IR data let highlight, for the first time, the modifications in the macromolecular composition of Zona Radiata of oocytes at different developmental stage. In particular, ZR from vitellogenic (VTG) and mature (MAT) oocytes showed with respect to that from oocytes in previtellogenic phase, a higher level of proteins (PRT/CELL), aspartate and glutamate amino acids (COO/CELL) and carbohydrates (CARBO/CELL), lipids (LIPIDS/CELL) and fatty acids (FA/LIP). A significant higher amount of phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL) was observed only in the Zona Radiata of vitellogenic oocytes (VTG). The presence of lipid-containing compounds within the ZR may be ascribable to the vitellogenin crossing of the numerous canal pore of ZR directly connecting oocytes with surrounding follicular cells

 </sup>. Once again, the Zona Radiata of atretic oocytes (ATR) shows a peculiar macromolecular trait, completely different from vitellogenic and mature oocyte and more similar to the previtellogenic one. It results characterized by very low levels of phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL) and fatty acids (FA/LIP).
