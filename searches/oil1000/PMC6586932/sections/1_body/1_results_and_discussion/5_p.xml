 </sup>. Cortical alveoli are membrane-limited vesicles of variable size rich in proteins and carbohydrates synthetized by the oocyte itself. As the oocyte grows, cortical alveoli increase in size and number, filling the ooplasm. The content of cortical alveoli, mainly glycoproteins, is released into the egg surface at the fecundation time as part of the “cortical reaction”
