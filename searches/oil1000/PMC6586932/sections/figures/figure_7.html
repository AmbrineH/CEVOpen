 <p> FTIRI analysis of portion of a representative atretic oocyte (ATR), containing the Zona radiata (ZR) and the plasma membrane (PM). ( A) Microphotograph (164 × 164 μm). IR maps representing the topographical distribution of: ( B) lipids (LIP), ( C) fatty acids (FA), ( D) proteins (PRT), ( E) aspartate and glutamate amino acids (COO), ( F) phosphate groups (PHOSPHO), and ( G) carbohydrates (CARBO). Due to different molar extinction coefficients of the analysed peaks, different scales were used for each IR map (blue colour indicating the areas with the lowest absorption values, while white colour the highest ones). </p>
