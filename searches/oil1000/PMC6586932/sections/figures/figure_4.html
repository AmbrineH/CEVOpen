 <p> FTIRI analysis of the inner portion of a representative vitellogenic oocyte containing different kinds of structures (cortical alveoli, CA; oil droplets, OD, and yolk vesicles, YV). ( A) Microphotograph (164 × 164 μm 2). IR maps representing the topographical distribution of: ( B) lipids (LIP), ( C) fatty acids (FA), ( D) unsaturated lipid alkyl chains (CH), ( E) proteins (PRT), ( F) aspartate and glutamate amino acids (COO), ( G) phosphate groups (PHOSPHO), and ( H) carbohydrates (CARBO). Due to different molar extinction coefficients of the analysed peaks, different colour scales were used for each IR map (blue colour indicating the areas with the lowest absorption values, while white colour the highest ones). </p>
