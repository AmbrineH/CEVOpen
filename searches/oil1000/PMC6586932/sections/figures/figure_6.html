 <p> FTIRI analysis of a portion of a representative mature oocyte (MAT), containing the Zona Radiata (ZR), the plasma membrane (PM) and oil droplets (OD). ( A) Microphotograph (164 × 164 μm 2). IR maps representing the topographical distribution of: ( B) lipids (LIP), ( C) fatty acids (FA), ( D) unsaturated lipid alkyl chains (CH), ( E) proteins (PRT), ( F) aspartate and glutamate amino acids (COO), ( G) phosphate groups (PHOSPHO), and ( H) carbohydrates CARBO). Due to different molar extinction coefficients of the analysed peaks, different scales were used for each IR map (blue colour indicating the areas with the lowest absorption values, while white colour the highest ones). </p>
