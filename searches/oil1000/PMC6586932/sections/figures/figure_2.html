 <p> FTIRI analysis of a representative Swordfish oocyte in lipid stage (LS). ( A) Microphotograph (328 × 328 µm 2). IR maps representing the topographical distribution of: ( B) lipids (LIP), ( C) fatty acids (FA), ( D) unsaturated lipid alkyl chains (CH), ( E) proteins (PRT), ( F) aspartate and glutamate amino acids (COO), ( G) phosphate groups (PHOSPHO), and ( H) carbohydrates (CARBO). Due to different molar extinction coefficients of the analysed peaks, different scales were used for each IR map (blue colour indicating the areas with the lowest absorption values, while white colour the highest ones). </p>
