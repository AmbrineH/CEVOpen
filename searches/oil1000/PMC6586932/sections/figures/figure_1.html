 <p> FTIRI analysis of a representative Swordfish ovary section with oogonia (O) and previtellogenic oocytes (PO). ( A) Microphotograph (328 × 328 μm 2). IR maps representing the topographical distribution of: ( B) lipids (LIP), ( C) proteins (PRT), ( D) phosphate groups (PHOSPHO), and ( E) carbohydrates (CARBO). Due to different molar extinction coefficients of the analysed peaks, different scales were used for each IR map (blue colour indicating the areas with the lowest absorption values, while white colour the highest ones). Arrow indicate Balbiani Body (BB). </p>
