 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hammes and Egli (2005)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prest etÂ al. (2016)</xref>. All details of AOC and GP procedures are described in great detail in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section S.5</xref>, however AOC and GP both measure the amount of bacterial growth that can be supported by the carbon and other nutrients in the water. In the case of AOC the water sample is spiked with nutrients to ensure carbon limitation. In GP testing, growth is based on nutrient limitation within the sample.
