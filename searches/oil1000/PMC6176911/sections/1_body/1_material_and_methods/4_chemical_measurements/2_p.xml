<p id="p0125" class="p">DOC was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-L, Kyoto, Japan). The sum of ammonium and ammonia was measured with gas-diffusion flow injection (Foss, Hiller√∏d, Demark). Nitrite, nitrate and chloride were measured by ion chromatography (Metrohm 881, Herisau, Switzerland). Nitrogen and sulfur concentrations in soap, humic acid and personal care products were measured with a EuroEA3000 elemental analyzer (Eurovector, Pavia, Italy). Calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Spectro Arcos, Kleve, Germany). Concentrations of all other elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (t7500ce ICP-MS, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA).</p>
