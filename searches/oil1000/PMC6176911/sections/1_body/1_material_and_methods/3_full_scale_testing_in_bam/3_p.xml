<p id="p0120" class="p">This BAMBi was initially inoculated with 0.5â€¯L of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. After approximately 6 weeks of operation, steady state performance was achieved. The system was then operated for a period of 100 days, and DOC, ammonium and nitrate were measured. The BAMBi system is intended to completely recycle water in future testing; however, this initial testing was conducted in a once-through configuration permitting greater control of the nutrient levels in the system.</p>
