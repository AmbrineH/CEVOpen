<p id="p0115" class="p">The BAMBi system consisted of a 58 cm tall standing sandwich membrane module (Microclear MCXL, Newterra, Ontario, Canada) featuring a 150 kDa polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane (Microdyn-Nadir, Wiesbaden, Germany) placed into a 52 L wastewater linear low density polyethylene tank (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The BAMBi was fed 75 L/day of nutrient-balanced synthetic hand washing water, in 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day. Each feeding event consisted of pumping directly into the BAMBi a 20X concentrated feed (SP Quick Peristaltic pump head and 5001 pumpdrive with Pharmed tubing, Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) and an appropriate dilution of non-chlorinated tap water (Tauchpumpe Typ 04, Barwig Wasserversorgung, Bad Karlshafen, Germany). The concentrated feed was stored at 4 °C and mixed at 10 rpm. The general recipe for the feed is presented in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section S.3</xref>, however, for full-scale testing tap water was used instead of deionized water. This resulted in some nutrients needing to be added in lesser part, or not at all, to match the same target minimum concentrations. Aeration was provided to the BAMBi at a rate of 20 L/min directly below the membrane module through aeration tubing (Air Curtain 90 cm, Guangdong Risheng, Shenzhen China) producing bubbles approximately 3–4 mm in diameter. Water that passed through the biofilm and through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir and then pumped (Tauchpumpe Typ 04) from the reservoir to a clean water storage tank every 5 min. The water level in the BAMBi was maintained at approximately 42 L, which corresponded to approximately 75% of the membrane surface area being submerged in the water. This water level also corresponded with a maximum hydraulic pressure at the bottom of the membrane of approximately 40 mbar. Feeding and permeate pumps were activated using process control hardware (Endress + Hauser AG, Reinach BL, Switzerland), and automation software (Codesys, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH, Kempten, Germany and CitectSCADA, Schneider Electric, Rueil-Malmaison, France).
