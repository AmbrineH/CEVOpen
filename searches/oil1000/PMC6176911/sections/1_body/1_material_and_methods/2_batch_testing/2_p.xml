<p id="p0110" class="p">Batch testing consisted of preparing separate 500 mL volumes of representative and nutrient-balanced synthetic hand washing waters in sterile 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks. The representative hand washing water was designed to recreate a generic hand washing water composition. The nutrient-balanced hand washing water recreated the representative hand washing water composition, but then supplemented the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient for biological treatment. The specific composition of the two hand washing water solutions result from the analysis presented in
