<p id="p0100" class="p">The first goal of this study is to understand the quantities and compositions of different inputs to hand washing greywater and how these compositions relate to nutrient-balancing requirements of biological treatment. This analysis must address both the biological compatibility of the carbon and also the macro- and micro-nutrient content of each contributing input and construct a strategy to supplement deficient nutrients.</p>
