<p id="p0055" class="p">The reported BOD of hand washing water varies between 100 and 252 mg
 <sub class="sub">O2</sub>/L and the COD between 110 and 587 mg
 <sub class="sub">O2</sub>/L. As the concentrations of ammonium and other non-carbon oxidizable constituents are low in hand washing water (between 0.39 mg 
 <sub class="sub">NH4-N</sub>/L and 1.15 mg
 <sub class="sub">NH4-N</sub>/L) we assume that BOD and COD values are dominated by the oxidation of the carbon. The BOD/COD ratio can thus also be used to estimate the biodegradability of the carbon. The BOD/COD ratios for the studies presented in
