We have not identified any study that reports concentrations for all the nutrients regarded as being always or mostly essential for biological treatment (

What we can say is that we expect greywater may be more easily biodegradable than municipal wastewater, but contains lower nutrient to carbon ratios for essential nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus.
