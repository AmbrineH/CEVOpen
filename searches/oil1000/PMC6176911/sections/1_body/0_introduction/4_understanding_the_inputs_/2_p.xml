<p id="p0045" class="p">The composition of any wastewater is the sum of materials in the initial water and all the materials that are added during usage. In the case of hand washing water, the additional materials consist of soap, whatever dirt or undesirable materials are intentionally washed off the hands, but also traces of personal care products and skin cells. Existing literature can contribute to our understanding of hand washing water inputs by two different approaches. Existing literature investigating greywater or greywater treatment often present chemical characterization of real-world hand washing water. These studies generally do not investigate the quantity or composition of contributing sources or fully analyze the influent water, though they can provide information about what the individual contributions can add up to. The organic carbon (OC) is generally expressed as total organic carbon (TOC) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), but not biologically-compatible assimilable organic carbon (AOC). The second tool we have in existing literature to understand hand washing water inputs is the collection of recipes for synthetic greywater that have been designed, in part, to recreate the chemical and physical characteristics of measured greywater, often with some (though incomplete) consideration for individual inputs.</p>
