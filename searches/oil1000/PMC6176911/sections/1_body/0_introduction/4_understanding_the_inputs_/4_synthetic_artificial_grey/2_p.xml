 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hourlier et al., 2010</xref>). While no synthetic greywater recipe is known specifically for hand washing water, many synthetic greywater recipes exist for combined greywater, or greywater from unspecified inputs. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> presents several recipes. The main inputs considered in these greywater recipes are detergents (soap, shampoo and laundry), personal care products, organic matter (e.g., from dirt, kitchen sinks and human body), inorganic matter (e.g., from dirt) and microbial contamination. Some of the recipes also include buffers to maintain a stable pH and some salts to mimic a realistic composition of real greywater.
