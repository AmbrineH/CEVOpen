<p id="p0075" class="p">Future work with synthetic greywater requires understanding how existing recipes can be improved, but also what they do well. The main drawbacks of existing recipes are a general lack of information regarding (i) the specific type of greywater (heavy vs light) and specific inputs (kitchen sink or no, with in-sink grinder or no) the recipe intents to mimic, (ii) a complete understanding of how the amounts and types of ingredients used in the synthetic recipes were selected, (iii) the exact composition of the added ingredients, and (iv) a lack of attention to the quantities and the availabilities of biologically-relevant nutrients. A generic or a non-specific synthetic recipe for greywater that may mimic kitchen waste, will not as accurately reflect realistic performance in a treatment system as would a recipe designed specifically for hand washing water. Some recipes have taken steps to link ingredients to inputs (such as hand soap, skin, organic and inorganic dirt and personal care products), but not in a complete or quantifiable fashion. Being complete and quantifiable is necessary to more accurately create a synthetic recipe to reflect a specific input. Once we build an understanding of inputs, we must build a recipe out of reproducible reagents. As many existing synthetic greywater recipes use commercial products, with compositions that can vary depending on the geographic region and over time, they cannot be reproduced accurately. The importance of reproducible ingredients has also been stressed in the work of
