<p id="p0095" class="p">Unlike conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems, this membrane system does not require any cleaning over the course of standard operation and does not require high-pressure to drive water though the system. BAMBi systems are operated in a gravity-driven membrane (GDM) configuration, resulting in stable flux, without backwashing or other fouling controls (

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The only pressure needed in a GDM system is supplied by the head of the water. Treatment in a BAMBi is predominantly biological, and therefore also requires a balance of nutrients. Household-scale BAMBi systems have demonstrated 95% removal of organic carbon from a wastewater similar in organic loading to hand washing water, but contaminated with feces and urine (
