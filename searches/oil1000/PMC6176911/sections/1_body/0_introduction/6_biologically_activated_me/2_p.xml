<p id="p0090" class="p">One promising biological treatment system that has demonstrated strong performance recycling wastewater, chemically similar to greywater, is called a biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi). BAMBi systems feature an ultrafiltration membrane module immersed in a tank of the water to be treated. A biofilm develops on the surface of this membrane that then consumes contaminants from the water as it passes through the biofilm and through the membrane. The permeate water is pumped to a storage reservoir to be reused. Post-treatment systems such as granular activated carbon or chlorine production through electrolysis may be necessary to combat the growth of bacteria in the water during storage (
