<p id="p0035" class="p">Biological treatment processes are essential to meeting current discharge-oriented wastewater treatment objectives, and we must also look to biological processes to provide water recycling capability to meet the expanding water demands of the future. The wastewater stream that can most easily be recovered and recycled for high-quality water demands is greywater, and more specifically light greywater derived from hand washing and showering, due primarily to reduced organic and nutrient loading compared to other wastewater types (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eriksson et al., 2002</xref>). Effective biological treatment of greywater, or any other wastewater, requires a balance between biologically-essential nutrients. The microbial communities that perform the treatment require a variety of essential nutrients for growth and maintenance functions, and the exhaustion of an essential nutrient may limit the removal of other nutrients from the wastewater (
