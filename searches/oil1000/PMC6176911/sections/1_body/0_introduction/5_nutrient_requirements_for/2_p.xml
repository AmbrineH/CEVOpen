 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Egli, 2009</xref>). Harvested biomass can be analyzed for carbon content by conventional TOC measurements and elemental composition can be measured in ash following incineration. The ratio of elements in the biomass provides an estimate of the ratio of elements in the feed water needed to produce this biomass. This approach however, does not, (i) account for carbon which is utilized by the cell, but not incorporated into biomass, or (ii) account for variation in nutrient composition and demands between different cell types in a diverse population. During aerobic degradation in activated sludge systems only between 0.3 and 0.5 units of cell carbon are produced per unit of substrate carbon in high-load conditions, as the remaining part is oxidized to carbon dioxide during cellular respiration (

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rouf, 1964</xref>). While additional requirements for carbon in energy production indicate that biomass composition would overestimate requirements for other nutrients (the true yield of carbon must be less than one), the variability observed between the composition of different bacterial species makes it difficult to conclusively estimate the nutrient requirements for a given system.
