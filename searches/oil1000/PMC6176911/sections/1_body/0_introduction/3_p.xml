Whether or not supplementing nutrients improves treatment will depend on the specific source and nutrient composition of the water to be treated. While tremendous variations have been observed in greywater samples collected in different parts of the world (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Al-Jayyousi, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedler, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghaitidak and Yadav, 2013</xref>), part of the variation is based on which inputs are included in the broad category of greywater, such as kitchen sink and laundry sources. Light greywater inputs, such as bath, shower or hand washing, generally contain significantly less dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than dark greywater inputs such as kitchen sinks, dishwashers or washing machines (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedler, 2004</xref>). Therefore, understanding the relative volume contributions of specific inputs, and the nutrient composition of each specific input, impacts design choices for treatment and reuse strategies, specifically with respect to meeting nutrient requirements for biological systems. No existing study has systematically investigated the quantities and composition of different material inputs to greywater, analyzing both the biological compatibility of the carbon and the concentrations provided of other biologically-essential nutrients.
