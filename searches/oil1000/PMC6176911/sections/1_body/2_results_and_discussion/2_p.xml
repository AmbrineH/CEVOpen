<p id="p0135" class="p">The results and discussion section is organized into two main parts. The first part (
 <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Sections 3.1</xref>) quantifies the mass inputs to hand washing water, and assesses each input for nutrient-balance with respect to biological treatment requirements, and presents a supplementing strategy to correct nutrient-imbalance. The second part (
 <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.3</xref>) investigates first the differences in mechanism and performance between biological treatment with the realistic (nutrient-deficient) and nutrient-balanced synthetic hand washing waters in batch testing. Then, the long-term performance of the nutrient-balanced solution was investigated in a full-scale BAMBi system.
