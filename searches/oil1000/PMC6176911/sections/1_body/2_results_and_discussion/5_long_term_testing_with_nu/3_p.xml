<p id="p0195" class="p">While we believe that, as in the batch test, nutrient-balancing may also promote cell growth in the BAMBi system, any growth and accumulation of biomass that occurred during our test did not negatively impact the performance in terms of water quality or reduction in membrane flux. Constructive comparisons can be drawn between these residence times within the BAMBi, and the residence times required for carbon removal in the batch tests. The residence time in the full-scale BAMBi is only ∼11 h and the residence time within the biofilm may be only 10–15 min. The shorter timescale (&lt;16 h) for treatment within the nutrient-balanced batch experiment is likely more reflective of the ∼11 h residence time within the BAMBi. In the nutrient-balanced batch test, we observed growth accompanying the carbon removal to a much greater extent than in the batch test without the nutrient-balancing. If the impacts of nutrient-balancing in the full-scale BAMBi system are similar to what we see in the batch tests, we might also expect significant cell growth to occur in the BAMBI, and we might expect that the rate of carbon removal in the BAMBi might be significantly reduced if the system were operated without nutrient-balancing.</p>
