 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> presents concentrations of DOC, ammonium and nitrate in the reactor permeate over 100 days of stable operation. The concentrations of DOC and total nitrogen in the feed water were 130 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L and 31 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L (10 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L of which as ammonium) respectively. The membrane permeate displayed DOC averages of 4.8 ± 3.2 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L, ammonium at or close to the quantification level of 0.2 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L and nitrate averages of 3.5 ± 1.5 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L. A small disruption occurred on day 43, where the ammonium concentration increased to 2.7 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L. This was caused by a temporary interruption in the aeration which limited ammonium conversion, but aeration was restored before carbon concentrations in the permeate were significantly impacted. Ammonium concentrations were again below detection (0.2 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L) at the following sample point. The ammonium concentration in the permeate was more sensitive to this loss of aeration than the carbon in the permeate (which was not clearly impacted). This behavior may indicate that the normally low ammonium concentration we observe in the permeate may also be dependent on nitrification, and this nitrification was significantly limited while the aeration was off. Our nutrient-balancing strategy may be overestimating nitrogen demands of the system, if our nitrogen supplement can support both nitrification processes and effective carbon removal through cell growth and maintenance. With ammonium generally removed, we expect the ultimate fate of nitrogen that enters the system to be either (i) integrated into biomass through growth, (ii) removed through denitrification, or (iii) reflected in the ∼3.5 mg
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>/L nitrate that exits BAMBi in the permeate. Additional testing could be conducted to better understand how much nitrogen is incorporated into biomass, and how much is removed through denitrification. The presence of nitrate in the permeate also supports the possibility that we are adding more nitrogen than the system truly requires. What our results do clearly show, is that our system is able to achieve 95% removal of the carbon and 90% removal of the nitrogen we do add, which is an strong position from which to explore further optimization.
