 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarizes the mass concentrations of all the inputs to hand washing water. By evaluating the relative mass contributions of different hand washing water inputs, we see that soap is tremendously dominant, representing over 90% of the dry mass of inputs to the water. Looking then at individual components of the soap, SDS and glycerol are the most significant ingredients (respectively 69.8% and 24.9% of the total soap dry mass,
