<p id="p0160" class="p">While nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur contents in dust are insufficient to balance the organic carbon in dust, all other elements exceed the concentrations required for biological nutrient-balance. For the humic acid mixture, in contrast, none of the elements were present in sufficient quantities to balance the carbon. An AOC assay on a 1 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L solution of the humic acid mixture yielded a &lt;0.5% reduction in the TOC. Similarly to dust and humic acid, skin contains a high proportion of carbon compared to all other elements. Only calcium is estimated to be present in a concentration sufficient to balance the carbon. The examined sunscreens and moisturizer had similar compositions in terms of carbon (∼100,000 mg/kg) and other nutrients. However, AOC to DOC ratios were tremendously lower in the sunscreens than in the moisturizer, which may be due to the presence of various ingredients toxic to microorganisms like titanium dioxide in the sunscreens. Similarly to the examined soaps, sunscreens and moisturizer were nutrient-deficient with respect to carbon.
