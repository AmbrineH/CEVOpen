<p id="p0155" class="p">The four examined soaps presented large variations in TOC, ranging between 24,600 and 93,400 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L. Even greater variation was observed in AOC concentrations. There was no microbial growth at all in one of the commercial soaps, while more than half the organic carbon was assimilated in a second commercial soap and in our custom-made soap. In terms of nutrient-balance, the soaps, as well as all other inputs were determined to contribute insufficient nutrients to balance the carbon. Only sulfur was present in sufficient concentrations to meet the nutrient-requirements in all soaps.
