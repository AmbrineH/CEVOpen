 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Three commercial soaps are compared with the custom soap developed for this study. Also examined are the composition of dirt and skin, along with commercially available personal care products that are expected to be present in the hand washing water (sunscreen and skin moisturizer) and tap water. While we acknowledge there could be great variation in the composition of dirt to be washed off hands, we are representing dirt in this study with a compiled dust and a commercially harvested humic acid. All values for soaps, sunscreens and humic acid were measured in our laboratory. Values for dust and skin were assembled from literature sources, explained in greater detail in Supporting Information

For each input source, the theoretical concentration required of each element to balance the TOC from that input was calculated and compared to the actual concentration of that element. The estimated nutrient requirements to balance a given concentration of carbon was calculated directly from the elemental composition of biomass compiled from (
