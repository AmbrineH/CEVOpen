 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> combines the results from 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, presenting the elemental contribution of all individual inputs, reflecting the relative mass contributions of each input. Elements present in concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to be completely absent in the hand washing water input. The three most-right columns of 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> present the elemental compositions of a representative hand washing water, the estimated biological-nutrient requirements to balance the carbon content of the representative water, and a nutrient-balanced version of the representative water which is supplemented with the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient.
