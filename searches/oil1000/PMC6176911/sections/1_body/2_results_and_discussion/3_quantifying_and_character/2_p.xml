<p id="p0140" class="p">The main identified inputs into hand washing water were soap, dirt, dried skin and moisturizer. Representative volumes of liquid soap and washing water per hand washing event have been measured as 1.5 mL soap and 1 L water (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Larson et al., 1987</xref>). Consumer-oriented hand soaps do not often include a list of ingredients and their concentrations. To overcome this uncertainty in the composition of commercial soaps, a custom liquid soap recipe was developed using exclusively biodegradable ingredients. The components and their relative contributions were selected based on compatible ingredients we do observe in commercial soap products, detailed representative formulations for soap products presented by
