<p id="p0175" class="p">Comparing the “assembled” compositions (based on the sum of identified inputs) to the “representative” composition (based on measured values) demonstrates a general pairwise similarity for the concentration of most nutrients. The assembled and representative compositions also both show (in yellow highlights in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>) similar nutrient-deficiencies. We observe each to be deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus and many micro-nutrients. Such deficiencies are expected, though, as we have demonstrated (in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), deficiencies in all contributing inputs. 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> also demonstrates the significance of operating a treatment system with recycling or without. The nutrient contribution of the initial water stock could become less significant over time in a recycling system. We estimate substantially lower concentrations of some nutrients (e.g., calcium, magnesium, and potassium) in systems that continuously recycle water, as opposed to systems that treat the water once, and then receive new water with each usage. As tap water is; however, itself not nutrient-balanced, some nutrients must still be supplemented in each case to achieve biological nutrient-balance, however the amounts required could be different. For other nutrients, such as calcium or magnesium, the inclusion of tap water may greatly exceed the biological requirements.
