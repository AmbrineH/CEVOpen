 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL. Therefore, some organic carbon was removed through a growth-based mechanism and some was removed through a cellular maintenance-based mechanism. Supplementing the realistic composition with nutrients shifts the relative carbon removal system towards growth, and achieves more carbon removal in less time. Requirements of removal rate and ultimate removal to be achieved are application-driven. Full-scale BAMBi reactors in previous studies, treating a similar nutrient-balanced wastewater, achieved 95% carbon removal (

It is possible though that water treated by a biological system without nutrient-balancing might produce a water quality that is acceptable for less-demanding applications, such as toilet flushing, or more-intensive post-treatment may enable usage for more-demanding applications. While post-treatment can improve water quality, optimizing a treatment system to increase the treatment rate for maintenance-based removal may be challenging.
