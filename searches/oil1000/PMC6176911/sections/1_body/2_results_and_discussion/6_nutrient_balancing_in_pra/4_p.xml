<p id="p0210" class="p">Effective strategies for nutrient-balancing must identify which nutrients to add, how much, but also when to supplement. Estimating nutrient requirements with respect to carbon from generic ash content likely overestimates the true demand. The BAMBi in this study was operated as a once-through system, however accurate nutrient-balancing is likely more critical in a recycling system, where excess nutrients could accumulate over time. Promoting growth through nutrient-balancing may also reduce the start-up time of biofilm systems such as BAMBi, or to help maintain effluent quality during periods of extra waste loading. This study has focused exclusively on hand washing water, however to expand the application of the BAMBi or other biological greywater treatment systems, we would need to understand the nutrient content of these inputs and the biological compatibility of any additional carbon loading. Including water from a kitchen sink may contribute a significant amount of nutrients into the system, however, soap (which can be controlled by the users) may no longer be the dominant input into water from a kitchen sink. Treating greywater from a kitchen sink may also introduce tremendous variability in loading between different locations and at the same location over time.</p>
