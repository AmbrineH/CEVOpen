<p id="p0220" class="p">Variability in loading, uncertainty in compositions of inputs, environmental conditions and many other influences can all impact our ability to realize a treatment strategy in the real world. However we must also consider that each of these influences and our ability to engineer solutions through process design (including nutrient-balancing) may ultimately require different strategies in different systems. Further research is required to better understand the link between the balance of nutrients and the performance of a biological system, specifically in the context of promoting either a growth or a maintenance-based conversion of carbon. This work, however, demonstrates that these pursuits can be rewarding and that understanding when to supplement and perhaps when not to, can have tremendous impacts on the performance of biological systems treating wastewater with nutrient-imbalances.</p>
