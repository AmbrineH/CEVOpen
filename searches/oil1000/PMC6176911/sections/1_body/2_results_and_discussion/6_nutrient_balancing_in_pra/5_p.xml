<p id="p0215" class="p">Part of what makes designing a treatment system exclusively for hand washing water a bit less complex than a system that treats all the greywater from a house involves minimizing variability. We have estimated in this study that soap is the dominate (90% of dry loading) input to hand washing water. When we consider a real world application of our BAMBi system with nutrient-balancing, the soap would also dominate the loading on the system. If the dosage of supplemental nutrients is linked to the usage of the soap, possibly by supplementing nutrients directly into the soap itself, then the nutrient-balance we prescribe for the system can be generally conserved. We suggest then that the performance we achieve in our full-scale BAMBi testing with artificial greywater is likely reflective of performance with real greywater, because the impact of the materials actually washed off the hands is much less significant than the impacts of the inputs that can be controlled (soap and nutrient-supplement).</p>
