<p id="p0200" class="p">While we have presented variation in literature values for greywater compositions of light greywater, measured in different parts of the world (
 <xref rid="sec1.1.1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 1.1.1</xref>), we have also identified that the dominant inputs to hand washing water are themselves nutrient-deficient (
 <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 3.1</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that despite any variation in the composition of hand washing water, nutrient-deficiency may be omnipresent. Nutrient-supplementing can correct nutrient-imbalance; however, the value of this approach is dependent on, (i) the composition and degree of imbalance in of the water, (ii) the mechanisms of biological carbon removal in the treatment system, and (iii) the required performance in terms of removal.
