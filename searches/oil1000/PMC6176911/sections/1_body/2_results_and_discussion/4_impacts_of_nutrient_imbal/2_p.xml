<p id="p0180" class="p">The impacts of nutrient-balancing were examined in batch testing with one solution formulated to match a representative hand washing water composition and a second solution matching the components of the representative hand washing water, but including additional nutrients, in which we believe the representative solution to be biologically deficient. Each solution was adjusted to contain 10 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L TOC to reduce inhibition from excessive surfactant. An inoculum of bacteria was added to flasks of each solution and incubated for 10 days. Changes in the DOC, AOC, GP and TCC values are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. To measure AOC, a sample of water is incubated with a bacterial inoculum and spiked with a sufficient concentrations of all other nutrients to ensure that carbon will be limiting. To measure growth potential, in contrast, the sample is incubated without any additional nutrients, and therefore growth can be limited by whatever nutrient is limiting in the sample, not only carbon. Though some bacteria in the inoculum were acclimated to grow on the carbon supplied in the hand washing water, no growth was observed until approximately 24 h of incubation. Following this apparent lag phase, DOC, AOC, growth potential and TCC values for the nutrient-balanced hand washing water all transitioned from initial values to approximately final values within one sample interval (16 h). Both DOC and AOC stabilized at concentrations of approximately 1.7 and 0.09 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L respectively (76% and 99% reductions of the initial concentrations). The growth potential in the nutrient-balanced hand washing water followed the same evolution as the AOC, confirming that the nutrient-balanced synthetic hand washing water did contain sufficient concentrations of other nutrients to balance the carbon content of the water. The decreases in organic carbon, AOC and growth potential observed in the batch reactor with nutrient-balancing was accompanied by growth of bacterial cells, finally stabilizing at a TCC of 6.4 × 10
