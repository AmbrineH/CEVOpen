<p id="p0185" class="p">Testing with the representative hand washing water resulted in a more gradual reduction in organic carbon and a higher final concentration in DOC of 3.5 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L (54% reduction) and AOC of 1.2 mg
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>/L (86% reduction). The growth potential of the representative hand washing water was only 15% of the growth potential in the nutrient-balanced hand washing water. This limited growth potential resulted in limited cell growth in the experimental flask, with final concentrations of only 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL. Net cell growth did not continue after 1 day of growth (following 1 day lag); however greater than 80% of AOC remained in the flask, and then 80% of this remaining AOC would be ultimately consumed. Reductions in AOC in the absence of net growth, may be largely attributed to cellular maintenance functions. These two types of processes, growth and maintenance functions have been thoroughly explored for different demands in terms of carbon and energy, but in our context can be considered to be different mechanisms of carbon removal. While the growth-based removal in the nutrient-balanced batch test produced rapid (minutes or hours) reductions in organic carbon, the maintenance-based removal required days (∼6) to reach ultimate removal values.
