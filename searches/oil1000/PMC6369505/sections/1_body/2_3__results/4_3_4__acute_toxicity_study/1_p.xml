<p class="p">The results revealed that the single dose treatment with
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO by oral route at 2000 mg/kg dose did not cause death in female mice throughout the study period. No treatment related toxicity signs were noted. Moreover, EO produced no change in the skin, eyes, diarrhea, salivation, and behaviour patterns of mice. Hence, lethal dose (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) for oral route of
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO was estimated to be higher than 2000 mg/kg.
