<p class="p">Biochemical analysis (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>) showed no significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">P&gt;0.05</italic>) in any of the parameters analyzed in either control or treatment group of both female and male mice after 21 days oral administration of the EO. Nonetheless, the amounts of ALPL, SGPT-L, and SGOT-A were a bit higher in female treated mice except CREAT-A as compared with untreated group. The amount of all measured biochemical parameters was lower in treated male mice except ALPL as compared with control mice. Yet, this difference is not significant statistically.
