<p class="p">The necropsy showed no abnormal findings in the male and female EO treated and control groups. The differences in relative organ weight of liver and kidneys recorded between the treatment and the control groups were not significant statistically (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). However, the relative organ weight of female treated mice was slightly higher than untreated group. On contrary, the relative organ weight of male treated mice was slightly lower than control. But, no difference in the parameters related to liver and kidney toxicity was observed in serum biochemical and histopathological examinations. Hence, the aforesaid changes were not considered toxicologically significant
