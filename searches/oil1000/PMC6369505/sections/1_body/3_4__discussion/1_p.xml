 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia </italic>is characteristic of strong fragrance, indicating that there are rich aromatic compounds. The oil is generally composed of complex mixture of monoterpene, biogenetically related phenols, and sesquiterpenes (Yazdani et al., 2013). The EO obtained in this study was rich in monoterpene and phenols. GC-MS analysis showed that eucalyptol, camphor, gamma-terpinene, endoborneol, and beta- pinene are the major components, which suggests that these compounds may play major roles in the biological activities. In a previous phytochemical study with this plant showed the presence of the same major components of
