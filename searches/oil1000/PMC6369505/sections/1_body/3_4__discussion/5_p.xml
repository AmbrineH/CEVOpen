<p class="p">Results of biochemical analysis demonstrated that
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO did not produce toxic effect. Serum biochemicals like ALP, SGPT, and SGOT still keep the gold standards for the assessment of liver injury and have been served as biomarkers of choice for decades [

 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia </italic>EO had no toxic effects on the kidneys. The findings were further established by the histological study of the organs shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>. The histological examination is the golden standard for evaluating treatment related pathological changes in organs and tissues. Histopathological examination of kidneys showed normal features of renal tubules and glomeruli suggesting that normal renal function of the treated and untreated group. Liver histopathology showed normal morphology of hepatic cells, central vein, and portal triads indicating normal liver function in both treated and untreated group. The assessment of pathological alteration in the organs of treated animals, both macro and microscopically, is the basis of a safety assessment [
