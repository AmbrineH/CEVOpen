<p class="p">Although acute toxicity helps to determine the toxicity nature of substances, it is important to assess subacute oral toxicity profile because it helps to evaluate the morphological and physiological changes in organs after repeated administration [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In oral toxicity assessment the body weight change is sensitive and indicative marker for toxicity sign [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. No significant changes in the body weight were observed in treated mice compared to untreated group after 21 days administration of
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO. However, a slight retardation of the body weight gain and food intake was noticed in the female mice, but no effects were evident from histopathology and clinical chemistry. As optimal supplements intake is important to the physiological wellbeing of the animal, it is also important to determine the water and food intake during toxicological study [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In this toxicity study, water and food intake were not affected by the administration of
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO indicating that no interruption in the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Changes in organ weights are a clear indicative of damage caused by the substance under test [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. No gross abnormality was found in the organs at necropsy and did not produce organ swelling, atrophy, or hypertrophy.
