<p class="p">Several scientific papers reported plentiful therapeutic uses of
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> as an alternative medicine effective for a wide range of diseases [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Hence, investigation of safety profile of this plant is used to guide the management of its applications and usage in herbal preparations. Toxicity studies in appropriate animal models are commonly used method to assess potential health risks in humans [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In this toxicity study, acute oral treatment of female mice with
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO at 2000 mg/kg had no effects on mortality, examined clinical signs, or overall observation. Therefore, the approximate median lethal oral dose was determined to be higher than 2000 mg/kg. According to the Globally Harmonised Classification System for Chemical Substances and Mixtures of acute systemic toxicity, the
 <italic class="italic"> L. angustifolia</italic> EO was assigned class 5 status (2000 mg/kg&lt;LD50&lt;5000 mg/kg) which was the lowest toxicity class [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The finding of this toxicity assessment was in agreement with study conducted by Silva et al., [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] who reported that LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was 3.55g/kg.
