 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> EO analyses were carried out using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis was performed by using Agilent 5977A (Agilent Technologies, Germany). GC was equipped with a 30 m HP-5 capillary column with 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness. The helium carrier gas had a delivery rate of 1 ml/min. The injector temperature was held at 250°C and the detector temperature was held at 250°C. The injection volume was 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l. The split ratio was 40:1. The temperature program was as follows: the initial temperature was held at 50°C for 6 min and then increased to 76°C at a rate of 4°C/min for 5 min, then increased 190°C at the rate of 4°C/min, then increased to 270°C at the rate of 30°C/min and held for 7 min. The constituents were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST 14 &amp; Wily library data for the GC-MS system. Percent composition of each compound was calculated from peak area using normalization method.
