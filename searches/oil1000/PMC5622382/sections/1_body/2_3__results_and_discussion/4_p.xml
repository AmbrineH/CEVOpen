These workers sampled two different individual plants from different geographical origin, but grown in a common garden under identical conditions. Young leaves were characterized with high concentrations of α-humulene, viridiflorol, and manool, but low concentrations of camphor or α-thujone. As leaves aged, the concentrations of α-humulene, viridiflorol, and manool dropped significantly with concomitant increases in camphor and α-thujone. A hierarchical cluster analysis showed that young leaves belonged to an α-humulene chemotype, while old leaves from the plant originating in Serbia belonged to a camphor chemotype, and old leaves from the plant originating in Croatia belonged to a thujone chemotype.
