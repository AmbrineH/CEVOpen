<p class="p">The α-humulene-rich chemotype, C2, is equivalent to type I that was described by Lakušić and co-workers [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00047-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) into three subgroups: C2a, α-humulene &gt; α-thujone &gt; camphor; C2b, 1,8-cineole ≈ α-thujone &gt; α-humulene; and C2c, viridiflorol &gt; manool ≈ α-thujone &gt; α-humulene. Lakušić and co-workers had observed α-humulene concentrations to be relatively high in young leaves collected in April and May, with decreasing concentrations during late summer (August–October), and then increasing again in the autumn and winter [
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Samples from other global locations, however, showed high α-humulene concentrations during the summer [
