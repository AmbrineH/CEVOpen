<p class="p">Caution should be exercised in using sage essential oil. The oil contains large concentrations of α-thujone, which was thought to have been the hallucinogenic constituent of absinthe and the cause of absinthism. This, however, has been shown to be false [
 <xref rid="B4-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, high doses of α-thujone causes convulsions by way of blocking γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels [

 <xref rid="B6-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and chronic exposure can lead to neurotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and carcinogenicity [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Use of the herb itself is safe, however; it has been estimated that between 2 and 20 cups of sage tea would be required to reach the acceptable daily intake of thujone [
 <xref rid="B10-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Additionally, thujone has shown a low affinity for cannabinoid receptors, but failed to show cannabinoid receptor agonism [
 <xref rid="B11-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. α-Thujone has also been shown to reduce 5-HT
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (ligand-gated ion channel serotonin) receptor activity [
 <xref rid="B12-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In this work, we have characterized two commercial sage essential oils as well as an essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of sage leaves grown in Mexico. In addition, a cluster analysis has been carried out to place the different chemotypes of sage oil in perspective.
