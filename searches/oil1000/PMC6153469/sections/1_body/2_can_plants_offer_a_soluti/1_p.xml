<p class="p">The past 30 years have seen development of an enormous body of evidence on the importance of plant-based foods in preventing or reducing the risk of chronic disease. Indices of healthy eating that incorporate high consumption of fruit and vegetables, such as the alternative healthy eating index (
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McCullough

Many foods are now labelled with nutritional information detailing their content of protein, carbohydrates (sugars), fats and additives, but many health-promoting factors in plant-based foods are still not measured or listed. To secure effective shifts in diets towards consumption of more plant-based foods, actions need to be supported at many levels: by governments, policy-makers, food industries, medical industries and healthcare professionals, breeders, farmers, horticultural industries and food purveyors, such as supermarkets and, most importantly, by funders of scientific research.
