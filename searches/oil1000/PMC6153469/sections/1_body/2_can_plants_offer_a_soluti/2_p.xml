<p class="p">To gain support from all sectors necessary to implement these profound changes in dietary patterns, much greater understanding of how plant-based foods and phytonutrients impact our health is essential. This, in itself, is a major challenge because food and the diet–health equation are very complex. Understanding how food works to prevent and protect against disease is challenging. However, integrating new ideas from analytical approaches with understanding why traditional diets are usually healthier than modern ‘Western diets’ should inform our progression towards a better understanding of the complex relationships between diet and health and how best for different societies to achieve nutritional security. We also need a far better understanding of the impact of nutritional insufficiency, rather than nutritional deficiency of foods. Insufficiencies underpin the evidence from epidemiological, intervention, clinical and preclinical studies for the importance of dietary phytonutrients in protecting against chronic diseases such as CVD, obesity, metabolic disease, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, because phytonutrients are not classified as essential in the diet. Understanding the effects of nutritional insufficiencies will be highly demanding scientifically, because effects are likely to be small and therefore difficult to measure, and mechanisms are likely to be multifold and possibly synergistic with other components of food.</p>
