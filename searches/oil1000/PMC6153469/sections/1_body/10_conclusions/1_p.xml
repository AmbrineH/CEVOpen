<p class="p">What I have tried to do in this article is to explain, by example, some of the complexities that impact our understanding of the beneficial role of plant-based foods in our diets. These are summarized in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> require substantial investment in research if we are to understand the relationship between plants, our diet and our health. The outcome of greater understanding, particularly of the mechanisms and relative efficacies of different phytonutrients on protection from chronic disease, would go a long way towards persuading the agricultural and food sectors of the importance of nutritional security, and to set aside current emphases on yield, profit margins and processed cheap foods. Such changes would benefit societies, the world over. If this does not happen, and the agricultural and food sectors continue to lobby against measures to improve nutrition (

Certainly, it would be expedient for politicians and policy-makers, already struggling with rising healthcare costs associated with the increasing numbers of people living with chronic disease, to support research by plant scientists, through multidisciplinary collaborations, into the roles of plant-based foods in health and well-being, and thereby to support progress towards ensuring global nutritional security.
