<p class="p">When I was young one of the major issues that drove life in my family was responding to international appeals for charitable assistance. My mother worked tirelessly for charities, collecting blankets, clothes and food to be shipped to emergency areas, and at Christmas and Easter collected money to support people in places of famine. The aspiration for the money collected was always to provide water and food so that people had ‘enough to eat’. Her efforts and those of many others were founded on two early principles in famine relief which emerged from the Indian Famine Codes of 1880 and greatly influenced European philosophy on how to deal with famine. The first was that relief should not be so generous as to encourage dependency among recipients and the second was to provide relief without weakening the donor’s economy by intervening or participating in food-grain markets (

Consequently, 50 years ago, our concept of famine relief was based on immediate provision of calories for communities, particularly those afflicted by drought or war, where crops had failed. In 1974 the World Food Conference defined food security solely in terms of yield.
