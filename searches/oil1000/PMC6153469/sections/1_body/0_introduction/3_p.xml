<p class="p">Meanwhile, measures taken to address ‘the food problem’ in the USA in the early 1970s, when food price inflation threatened to make the cost and availability of food top issues on the national agenda, gave rise to new nutritional challenges in the developed world. Policy changes under Richard Nixon shifted subsidies from farmers to investments in programmes that boosted yields from a few commodity crops (principally corn and soy in the USA). This allowed agro-industrialization and a dramatic fall in crop prices. Farmers had to produce more in order to break even. The price of many foods fell, especially processed foods and sweetened beverages that could be made from corn or soy. At the same time the price of fresh foods such as fruit and vegetables increased substantially, in relative terms. In breeding crops for increased yield, many important traits including flavour and nutritional value were lost. This focus on commodity crops meant that many of the nutritional advantages of diverse, fruit and vegetable-rich diets were lost. In addition, the processing of commodity crops into vegetable oils, which were frequently hydrogenated to form trans-fats in margarines and baked goods or for products for sweetening such as high fructose corn syrups (HFCS), meant that the consumption of low-cost, health-challenging, anti-nutritionals increased in line with the increased consumption of processed foods.</p>
