<p class="p">The scientific world embraced the need for increasing agricultural productivity to meet the needs of a burgeoning world population also facing substantial changes in climate. To offer long-term solutions to famine, higher yielding crops were developed during the ‘Green Revolution’ for developing countries and facilitated the alleviation of hunger, but brought with them an increasing dependency of many on a few, calorie-rich but nutritionally poor, staple crops. This dependency on staples gave rise to ‘hidden hunger’ caused by deficiencies in micronutrients (particularly iron and zinc) and essential vitamins (especially provitamin A) in diets based heavily on foods such as white corn, cassava or rice (

With these developments came changes in our understanding of the relationships between nutrition and hunger, and in 1996 the World Food Summit redefined food security as existing ‘when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life’.
