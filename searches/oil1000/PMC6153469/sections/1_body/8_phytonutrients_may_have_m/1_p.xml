<p class="p">In addition to the manifold complications associated with establishing the levels of phytonutrients in the foods we eat, how digestible they are, how bioavailable and how bioactive they are, and the differing responses of individuals to consumption of phytonutrients, it is highly unlikely that dietary phytonutrients work by a single mechanism. Many phytonutrients are antioxidants and their antioxidant activity was championed as key to their health-promoting and health-protecting effects by 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gutteridge and Halliwell (1994)</xref>. However, their ability to act as direct antioxidants in humans has been broadly dismissed on the grounds that many phytonutrients have low bioavailability and the efficacy of antioxidant supplements in promoting health has been questioned in systematic reviews (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Of course, antioxidant activity may be maintained through the microbial metabolites of phytonutrients, and provided these metabolites are bioavailable, the bioactivity of the phytonutrients may be manifest primarily through the antioxidant activity of their metabolites. When considering chronic diseases of the gut, bioavailability is an issue of lesser importance, and it is possible that the anti-inflammatory effects of many dietary polyphenols in the GI tract are the direct result of their antioxidant activities (
 <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tomlinson 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Recent results also suggest that the impact of phytonutrients on the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiota is the primary mechanism underpinning their bioactivity. Effects on the gut microbiota could involve the antioxidant capacity of phytonutrients (as many gut microbes are obligate anaerobes) or more diverged activities as identified for different dietary fibres.
