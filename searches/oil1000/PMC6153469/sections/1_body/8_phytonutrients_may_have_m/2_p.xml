<p class="p">A common feature of ‘health-protecting’ phytonutrients is that they have anti-inflammatory activity. The physiological process underpinning many chronic diseases, including CVDs, metabolic diseases and even obesity itself, is believed to be chronic inflammation (

 </xref>). Chronic inflammation is a complex disorder and although identification of many pharmaceuticals has focused on single key targets in inflammation, the one-target-one-disease approach has matured to view compounds that interfere with multiple targets as superior, in terms of outcomes (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koeberle and Werz, 2014</xref>). Clearly, in assessing foods rather than drugs, impacts on multiple inflammation targets are not only possible, but predicted. Therefore, assessing the effects of the phytonutrients broadly on inflammation has become imperative. Such studies would not only give a more generic overview of how different plant-based foods impact health but would also point the way to investigations of how particular plant-based foods offer protection against specific chronic diseases.
