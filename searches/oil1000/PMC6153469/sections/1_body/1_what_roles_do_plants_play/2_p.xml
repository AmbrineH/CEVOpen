These have been recognized as important dietary components contributing to significant protection against chronic diseases only relatively recently. Because such phytonutrients are usually not considered ‘essential’ in the same way as vitamins and micronutrients, they are often missing from nutritional evaluations, and clear dietary recommendations for daily allowances are often not available. Phytonutrients include polyphenols (flavonoids and stilbenoids), carotenoids, plant sterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and plant fibres.
