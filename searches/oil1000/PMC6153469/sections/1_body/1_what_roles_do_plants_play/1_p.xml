<p class="p">Plants provide us with macro-nutrients (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) in our diet. Although many consumers in developed countries obtain most of their protein from animal products, there are large population groups that are dependent on plant sources of protein. Protein obtained from pulse crops is significantly less expensive and its production is markedly more sustainable than animal protein, requiring substantially lower inputs, especially of water (
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh, 2017</xref>). Pulse crops are of particular importance in India because of the high proportion of vegetarians, variously estimated as between 20 and 42 % of the population. There are as many as 500 million people in India solely dependent on non-animal protein sources. Efforts are now being made to increase the availability of plant proteins in the developed world, because plant protein sources (such as legumes) have the lowest environmental production costs, while at the same time demonstrate the highest density of nutrients. Support for such efforts is demonstrated by the funding of consortia under the Horizon 2020 programme such as the TRUE project - transition paths to sustainable legume-based systems in Europe (
