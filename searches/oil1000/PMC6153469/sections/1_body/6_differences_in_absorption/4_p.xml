<p class="p">Closely related to the anthocyanins are the flavan 3-ols, which include monomeric forms (catechins and epicatechins) and polymerized forms known as proanthocyanidins. These are formed in plants by reduction of anthocyanidins (to form epicatechins) or leucoanthocyanidins (to form catechins) (

 </xref>). Epicatechins are the major polyphenolic compounds in green tea, and the most significant active component is thought to be epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Proanthocyanidins are polymers of catechin and epicatechin and have been reported to be the principal vasoactive polyphenols in red wine (

 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blount 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Given that they are reported to have rather similar effects in a dietary context, particularly on protection from CVD, the lack of similarity in their microbial metabolites suggests that these may not be the bioactive forms. Alternatively, their primary effects may be through their impact on the composition of the microbiota, and their metabolites may have little relevance to their bioactivity.
