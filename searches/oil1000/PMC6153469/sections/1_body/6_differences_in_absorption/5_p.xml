<p class="p">Another example of different vitamers having different bioavailabilities involves vitamin E. Vitamin E activity is conferred by several different tocopherols and tocotrienols made in plants. Bioactivity of dietary vitamin E is influenced heavily by absorption, which is determined by affinity for a transporter in the liver, which is greatest for α-tocopherol. Consequently, the ‘vitamin E’ content of foods is often expressed as ‘α-tocopherol equivalents’, to take into account differences in the uptake and consequently the bioavailability of tocochromanols in plant-based foods (
