<p class="p">Polysaccharides include starch, which is composed of α 1–4 linked glucans (amylose and amylopectin) that can be digested at different rates. Fibres are complex, consisting of cellulose (β 1–4 linked glucan), which cannot be digested by humans, and soluble fibres which may be fermented by the microbiota and which may have prebiotic effects through influencing the composition of the microbiota. Generally, bacteria that can ferment oligosaccharides only (
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> spp.) offer health-promoting features to the microbiota, and are favoured by oligosaccharide-soluble fibre-rich diets.
