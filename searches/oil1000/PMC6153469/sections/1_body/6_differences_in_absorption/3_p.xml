<p class="p">Amongst the phytonutrients, there are widely different chemical types within broad chemical groups, with widely different properties which may impact their biological functionalities. For example, more than 600 different anthocyanins have been identified from plants. There is a common assumption that in a dietary context they all behave in the same way (

 </xref>), although recent evidence of health-protecting properties being more closely associated with some anthocyanins than others has been offered (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). One of the problems associated with studying the health benefits of dietary anthocyanins is their reportedly low bioavailability. Typically, &lt;1 % and often &lt;0.1 % of intact anthocyanins have been reported in plasma in pharmacokinetic studies in both human subjects and animal models. The concentrations detected in peripheral blood are typically in the low nanomolar range, and these are not consistent with the concentrations required to induce biological responses in pre-clinical studies (typically 1–100 μ
 <sc class="sc">m</sc> range). This has led to the notion that the observed effects of consuming anthocyanins are likely to be mediated by anthocyanin metabolites rather than the intact anthocyanins, themselves (

 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">de Ferrars 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2014)
 </xref>, substantial quantities of ingested labelled anthocyanin ([5-
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C]-cyanidin-3-glucoside) reached the peripheral circulation in the form of phenolic acid metabolites derived mainly from the anthocyanin B-ring. The total plasma excursion for these phenolic metabolites was 140-fold greater than that for total anthocyanins, with mean concentrations of 3.3 μ
 <sc class="sc">m</sc> compared to 0.14 μ
 <sc class="sc">m</sc> for anthocyanins. More than 20 individual phenolic acid metabolites were identified, including methylated and sulphated metabolites of protocatechuic acid as the major forms. These data support the notion that it is the phenolic acid-derived metabolites of anthocyanins that are likely to induce the changes in cells and tissues that ultimately give rise to beneficial effects in humans, such as improvements in plasma lipid/lipoprotein profiles.
