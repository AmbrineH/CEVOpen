<p class="p">There have been claims that organically produced food is ‘more nutritious’ and therefore organic cultivation should be encouraged to ensure nutritional security (
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reganold and Wachter, 2016</xref>). There are very few data to support such claims. A meta-analysis of crops grown organically compared to conventionally (non-organic production) suggested that factors including genotype, year, place, environmental conditions and time of harvest were more important in determining nutritional value than organic cultivation methods (assessed by Fe and Zn micronutrient and carotenoid contents) (

 </xref>). Even in reports where phenolic contents were significantly enhanced by organic cultivation (probably associated with greater pathogenesis and often with reduced yields) the degree of enhancement was not more than 50 %, meaning that the nutritional benefit of these phytonutrients with reported low bioavailability was likely to be very small (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2013
 </xref>). Organic food is, of course, free from synthetic pesticide residues which, in a sense, may make it more ‘nutritious’ but the consumer should not forget that many anti-nutritionals, such as copper, are still used by organic farmers to protect their crops. As a result of the widespread use of Bordeaux mixture in protecting organic vineyards, the French have detected copper levels of over 1000 ppm (or 0.1 %) in agricultural soils, which is ten times the maximum permitted level in US farming (
