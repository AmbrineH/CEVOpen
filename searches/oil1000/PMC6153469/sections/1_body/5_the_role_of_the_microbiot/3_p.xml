<p class="p">Many phytonutrients impact the composition of the microbiota. For example, the plant pigments anthocyanins have reported effects on reducing weight gain and obesity in preclinical studies and can protect against NAFLD (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2012)
 </xref> showed relatively strong influences of malvidin 3-glucoside on the microbial composition of pH-controlled faecal (human) batch cultures; the anthocyanin enhanced the growth of all bacteria, but promoted significant increases in 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> spp., effectively greater than fructooligosaccharides, which are well-recognized prebiotics. Both Bifids and Lactobacilli are beneficial, reducing the formation of pro-carcinogens, reducing the pH, and promoting the formation of butyrate (an SCFA which has anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects in the colon;

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Similarly, in tests of dietary anthocyanins in berries that limit weight gain of mice on a high-fat diet, antibiotic treatment to remove the microbiota eliminated the preventive effects, suggesting strongly that the impact of anthocyanins on the composition of the gut microbiota represents the primary mechanism whereby they limit weight gain (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Esposito 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Indeed, berries containing delphinidin-based anthocyanins appear to have stronger effects on weight gain than berries containing cyanidin-based anthocyanins, and cause a substantial shift in GI bacteria away from Firmicutes and towards obligate anaerobes such as Actinobacteria that correlate with decreases in the GI luminal oxygen and oxidative stress (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Clearly, investigation of the impact of anthocyanins on the composition of the microbiota of the GI tract is important to understanding how they promote human health and consequently for dietary recommendations. Moreover, study of their effects on the composition of the gut microbiota in the context of whole foods, and their impact on nutrient/calorie load in humans is important for recommending or designing healthy foods.
