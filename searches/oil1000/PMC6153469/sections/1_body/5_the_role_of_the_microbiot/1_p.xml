<p class="p">Many chronic diseases are related directly to obesity, and the global obesity epidemic, which started in the late 1970s, underpins much of the projected increase in mortality from chronic diseases and predictions about the increased prevalence of chronic disease in the near future (

In the European Union, approx. 60 % of adults and over 20 % of school-age children, equating to around 260 million adults and over 12 million children, are either obese or overweight. In the USA current estimates suggest that more than 35 % of the population is obese with projected associated costs of obesity in terms of healthcare and lost disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) set to rise to between $48 and $66 billion per annum by 2030 (

Contrary to many preconceptions, the nutritional quality of food eaten, as opposed to purely its calorific content, predicates significantly on the occurrence of obesity. Consequently, predictions about the future incidence of mortality from chronic diseases are based on the risks to which current adolescents are exposed, primary among which are the poor ‘Western’ diets that have fuelled the obesity epidemic.
