<p class="p">The intestinal microbiota has recently been identified as a major modifiable contributor to metabolic disease risk both in laboratory animals and in humans. Distinct profiles of gut bacteria characterize different animal models of obesity and its complications [non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes] as well as in humans who suffer from obesity, type 2 diabetes or NAFLD. The intestinal microbiota of lean and obese individuals differs in composition; obesity is associated with fewer Bacteroidetes and correspondingly more Firmicutes than in lean individuals (

 </xref>). The microbiota of obese individuals are more efficient at extracting energy from a given diet than those of lean individuals. The factors determining the composition of the microbiota are not well established, but any research aimed at understanding the relationship between dietary constituents and obesity, and the mechanisms underpinning the effects of dietary constituents on weight gain, needs to consider and assess the impacts of dietary bioactives on the composition of the gut microbiota.
