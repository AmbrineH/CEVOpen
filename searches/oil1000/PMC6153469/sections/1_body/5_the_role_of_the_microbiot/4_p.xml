<p class="p">Anthocyanins represent just one group of polyphenols with reported effects in combatting obesity and adipogenesis. Other dietary polyphenols have been reported to have beneficial effects on health, including cardio-protection, anti-cancer/pro-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects (

Resveratrol, a stilbenoid compound, found in wine (particularly red wine), grape juice, peanuts and blueberries, has effects similar to caloric restriction when consumed as part of the diet, ultimately resulting in weight reduction through prevention of abdominal obesity (

 </xref>). However, despite the extensive research on the cellular activities of resveratrol, study of its impact on the microbiota of the GI tract has been very limited. Resveratrol has been shown to increase levels of Lactobacilli and Bifids in rats, implying that some of its beneficial effects on weight gain may operate through modulating the gut microbiota (
