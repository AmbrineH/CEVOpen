<p class="p">Finally, for some phytonutrients, at least, there is evidence that they do not have the same beneficial effects when consumed in extracted/purified forms compared to their activities in whole foods (

This is probably because the food matrix is an important component in bioactivity, influencing absorption, microbial metabolism, synergistic interactions between different phytonutrients and effects on the composition of the GI microbiota. For all these reasons, improving health outcomes and protection against chronic diseases needs to be based on dietary improvements and increased consumption of plant-based foods, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, rather than improvement of low-quality Western diets with supplements that may not work, or may, indeed, increase the risk of disease.
