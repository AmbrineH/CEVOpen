<p class="p">Many people in developed countries already take dietary supplements to improve their intake of vitamins, micronutrients and omega-3 PUFAs. More than 50 % of Americans use dietary supplements (

Yet, systematic reviews of the efficacy of supplements suggest that associations between supplement consumption and health outcomes are, at best, inconsistent. A Cochrane review in 2012 of 78 randomized trials with 296 707 participants concluded that antioxidant supplements have little or no effect on health outcomes and an increased risk of mortality associated with consumption of beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A supplements, although none was associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium supplements (

 </xref>). The Iowa Womenâ€™s Health study assessed mortality against supplement use in 38 772 older women (average age 61.6 years) at three time points (1986 baseline; 1997 and 2004) and concluded that several vitamin and mineral supplements were actually associated with increased total mortality risk, with the strongest association for supplemental iron (

However, although there were no statistically significant differences between dietary and supplemental sources of PUFAs, their consumption in diets (fish or seafood) always gave rise to lower risk ratios than consumption of supplements (
