<p class="p">The main source of isoflavones in the human diet is soybean, and isoflavones come in several different forms, mainly daidzin and genistin, and small amounts of their aglycones. It is believed that these isoflavones do not have significant bioactivity in their own right, but are metabolized to their aglycones and then to another compound, equol, in the gut by anaerobic colonic bacteria (

 </xref>). Oestrogen receptors have a very high affinity for equol, greater than that for the plant isoflavones. Thus, the effects of dietary isoflavones in protecting against chronic diseases, particularly steroid-hormone-related cancers, has been attributed to the activity of equol as an oestrogen analogue. However, the ability to produce the more potent isoflavonoid, equol, varies between individuals, which may account for some reported negative responses to isoflavones. This has led to the concept in humans of ‘equol producers’ and ‘non-equol producers’ depending on an individual’s gut microflora (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>). Such differences in human subjects must be taken into account in analysing epidemiological and intervention study data, for any results from such studies of dietary isoflavones to be meaningful and for dietary recommendations to be robust. In fact, results from human trials of dietary isoflavones have often been contradictory (
