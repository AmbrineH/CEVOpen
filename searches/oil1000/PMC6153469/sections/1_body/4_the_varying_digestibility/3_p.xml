<p class="p">Currently the roles of fibre in the diet (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) are believed to be more far-reaching than simply reducing the digestibility of macronutrients. The evidence for health beneficial effects of insoluble plant fibre from epidemiological studies is relatively weak (
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martin 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>), but many foods rich in insoluble fibre such as whole grains, corn bran, nuts and seeds, potatoes and the skins from fruit such as apples, bananas and avocados, many green vegetables such as green beans, courgette, celery and cauliflower and some fruits such as tomatoes and kiwi are promoted as part of a healthy diet. Insoluble fibre does not dissolve, nor is it fermented by colonic bacteria. It retains water and so promotes larger, bulkier stools and more regular bowel activity. Insoluble fibre is the main component of fibre that reduces the digestibility of other macronutrients in the food matrix.
