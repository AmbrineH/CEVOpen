<p class="p">Resistant starch has properties similar to those of soluble fibre. Starch consists of two polymers, branched amylopectin and essentially unbranched amylose. Due to the ways that these polysaccharides are arranged in starch granules, branched amylopectin is more easily digested and the linear chains of amylose are broken down more slowly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it therefore comprises a major fraction of slowly digested starch and resistant starch, type II (

Resistant starch also induces beneficial changes in the composition of the colonic microbiota and induces production of SCFAs which modulate immune function and lower pH in the gut. The average Western diet includes 3â€“6 g of resistant starch each day, but traditional diets, such as those studied by Burkitt in East Africa, have considerably higher contents. Good sources of resistant starch are starchy fruits such as green banana and mango. In Uganda, men would traditionally eat matoke dishes of baked green bananas before a long day in the fields, because its high content of resistant starch gave a slow release of energy. Resistant starch and soluble dietary fibre are being promoted for their prebiotic functionalities because of their beneficial effects on gut health and chronic disease (
