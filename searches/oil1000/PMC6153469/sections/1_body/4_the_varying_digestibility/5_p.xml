<p class="p">A subgroup of soluble fibres includes inulin (fructan) fibres and plant-derived oligosaccharides that can act as prebiotics. These types of soluble fibre are not absorbed by the body but are metabolized by colonic microbiota, and promote the growth of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in the colon, which are associated with improved gut health. Some oligosaccharides are associated with the increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which supress inflammation, are preferred energy sources for colonic epithelial cells and signal satiation, which limits food consumption (
