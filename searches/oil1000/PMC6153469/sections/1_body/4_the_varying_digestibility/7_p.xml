<p class="p">Other phytonutrients have different bioactivities in different individuals because of differences in the composition of the microbiota in different individuals. Legumes are the source of an important group of bioactive compounds – the isoflavonoids – often referred to as phyto-oestrogens because they bind to oestrogen receptors in animals, and have been assigned many health benefits in humans. They are believed to be important in reducing occurrences of prostate, breast and colon cancers, reducing post-menopausal symptoms and reducing coronary heart disease by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma (

Western diets generally have 100-fold lower levels of isoflavonoids compared with Asian diets (due to lower consumption of soy protein products), and epidemiological studies have shown this difference in isoflavonoid intake to be inversely correlated with breast cancer incidence in these two groups (five-fold lower in women on Asian-style diets). Preclinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of isoflavonoids in preventing CVD, breast and prostate cancers, and post-menopausal ailments (
