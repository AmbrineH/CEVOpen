<p class="p">Our study reported six isolated sesquiterpenes from essential oil and from extracts of the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">Pilgerodendron uviferum</italic>. Additionally, we showed that two of these sesquiterpenes (âˆ’)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) and cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), as well as the essential oil and DCME extract, were effective in reducing the adult growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Hylastinus obscurus,</italic> a major red clover pest. The chemical composition from the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> may potentially be useful in future biological control programs as a means to control the crop damage to 
 <italic class="italic">T. pretense</italic> that is caused by this global pest.
