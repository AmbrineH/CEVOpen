<p class="p">Our study showed that the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood was effective in reducing the adult growth of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, a major commercial pest of red clover. We suggested that five of our treatments, including EO, DCME extract, (−)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), and (−)-torreyol (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>), could have potentially been used in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> control programs in order to prevent or reduce the crop damage in 
 <italic class="italic">T. pretense</italic>. Despite the fact that eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to chemical pesticides have been gaining popularity in Chile, they have remained poorly promoted and need advanced investigation. As a minimum requirement for the development of new biological control agents, future research into the potential of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> compounds in this context should focus on testing the effect of the extracts and sesquiterpenes on both 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> and non-target and/or beneficial species under field conditions.
