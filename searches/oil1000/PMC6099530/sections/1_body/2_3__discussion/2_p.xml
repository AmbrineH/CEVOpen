 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] demonstrated that the EOs from the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Eupatorium adenophorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia nilagirica</italic>, which were abundant in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, produced an antifeedant effect in 
 <italic class="italic">Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</italic>, which was a major pest of coconut palm. A recent study revealed that several sesquiterpenes that were commonly found in aromatic Mediterranean plants, induced an antifeedant activity in the Colorado potato beetle

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], with the sesquiterpene (−)-α-bisabolol, which was found to be the most active compound against this beetle, followed by the monoterpenoids carvacrol, (+)-terpinen-4-ol, and thymol.
