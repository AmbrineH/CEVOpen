<p class="p">The main goal of this study was to determine the potential antifeedant effects of the EO and extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood on the global pest 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. Here we have showed evidence that two of the most abundant sesquiterpenes that were found in EO and both of the extracts were effective in controlling the feeding behavior of the red clover borer. As in other species of Cupressaceae that were characterized by terpenoid biosynthesis, the composition of the PEE and DCME extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood demonstrated high levels of sesquiterpenes. This agreed with chemical analyses of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood that was described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], which reported the presence of ten sesquiterpenes and five diterpenes in a heartwood methanol extract. In addition to this, our study identified eleven sesquiterpenes that were previously undescribed in this species.
