 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> was one of the most serious red clover pests globally. In Chile, currently, there has been no efficient method for the control of this insect, although semiochemicals appeared to offer a promising alternative for reducing the crop damage that was caused by this curculionid. Toledo et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] showed that long chain fatty acids from non-polar root extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">T. pratense</italic> induced feeding behavioral changes (repellent or phagostimulant) in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, although significant decreases in weight only occurred when palmitic acid was added to artificial diets. Similar results were obtained by Quiroz et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], using the isoflavones that were present in red clover roots, they found that only the isoflavones formononetin and genistein demonstrated inhibiting effects on feeding. Here we showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> EO, DCME extract, and individual sesquiterpenes efficiently deterred the feeding in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, with (−)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), and (−)-torreyol (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) being the strongest inhibitors in this respect. The behavioral responses to these sesquiterpenes were similar, which resulted in a decrease in insect weight from −0.25% (control) to approximately −5–7%, similar to the levels that were reported for the root isoflavones [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The physicochemical properties of these sesquiterpenes, including lipophilicity and vapor pressure, might have been responsible for the antifeedant effects on 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. Our results showed that the negative responses in adults were associated with the sesquiterpenes that had the highest lipophilicity and logVP values. Vapor pressure was a measure of the volatilization tendency of a compound, and might have been useful in estimating the lifespan of the application deposit. The enhanced bioactivity of (−)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) and cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>) seemed to be linked to higher vapor pressure, which led to greater fumigant action and/or lipophilicity, which resulted in better penetration and bioavailability in the insect body. An antifeedant effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> EO was previously been reported in the weevil 
 <italic class="italic">Aegorhinus superciliosus</italic> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major berry pest in Chile, and in the housefly 
 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic> (Diptera: Muscidae) (Urzúa, unpublished results).
