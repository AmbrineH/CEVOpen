<p class="p">The EO and both of the extracts were fractioned by column chromatography with silica gel as a stationary phase, using a different gradient elution for each extract. The EO and PEE gradient elution was as follows: light petroleum ether (PE) (bp 35–60 °C), PE-CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1:1), CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-MeOH (9:1). The DCME gradient elution was as follows: CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-MeOH step gradient. The resulting fractions were evaporated under reduced pressure and were analyzed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 F
