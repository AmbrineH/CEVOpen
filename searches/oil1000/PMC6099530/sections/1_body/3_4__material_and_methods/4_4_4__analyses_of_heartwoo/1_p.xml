For this study, the analyses of the PEE and DCME extracts were performed by GC and GC/MS, using the following instrumentation: a Thermo Electron Model Focus GC (Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to a DSQ Thermo Electron quadrupole mass spectrometric detector, with an integrated data system (Xcalibur 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and a BPX5 capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 µm film thickness, ×0.25 mm i.d., SGE Forte, Trajan Scientific and Medical, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia). The operating conditions were as follows: on-column injection; injector temperature, 250 °C; transfer line temperature, 250 °C; carrier gas, He at 1.00 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; and oven temperature program: 40 °C for 2 min, increased to 250 °C at 5 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, followed by 250 °C for 5 min. The mass spectra were obtained at an ionization voltage of 70 eV. The recording conditions employed a scan time of 1.5 s and a mass range of 30 to 400 amu. The compounds were identified based on the comparisons of the mass spectra with a library database (NIST ver. 2.0, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and the comparisons of the calculated retention indices with those that were reported in the literature for the same column type [
