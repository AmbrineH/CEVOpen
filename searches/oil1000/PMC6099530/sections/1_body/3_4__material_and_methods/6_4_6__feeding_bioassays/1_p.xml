<p class="p">The feeding bioassays were performed based on a no-choice test using an artificial diet, according to a previously described method [

 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adults were placed in petri dishes (100 mm diameter x 15 mm length) on wet filter paper at 5 °C ± 1 °C, in darkness. An artificial diet of 400 μL, which was composed of 87.6% water, 4.3% starch, 3.5% agar, 2.6% glucose, and 2.0% cellulose, was added to a transparent glass tube (6 mm diameter × 25 mm length). Then, 10 μL of EO, PEE, DCME extract, and isolated sesquiterpenes, which were diluted in CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1000 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), were added separately to the artificial diet, as proposed by Manosalva et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. An artificial diet that was supplemented with 10 μL of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was used as the control. Sucrose was used as a positive control as it acted as a phagostimulant agent. In this case, 10 μL of sucrose, which was diluted in distillated H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1000 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), was added to the diet. To ensure a homogeneous distribution of the solution, the glass tubes were vortexed at 12 rpm continuously for 15 sec. After that, the tubes were incubated in the vertical position for 1 h at 21 °C ± 1 °C so as to allow the complete evaporation of the solvent. Subsequently, one previously weighed (iw) 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adult was introduced into each tube, which was then closed with a plastic cap. Each bioassay was replicated 10–15 times, and each insect was used only once. The feeding assay was performed at room temperature over a period of five days under conditions of darkness. Following this, the insects were weighed again (fw). The feeding performance was evaluated by the weight shift (%), as follows: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Weight shift (%) = ((fw − iw)/fw) × 100</disp-formula>
