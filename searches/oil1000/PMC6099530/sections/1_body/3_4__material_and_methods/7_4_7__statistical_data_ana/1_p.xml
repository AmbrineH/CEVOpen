<p class="p">The differences in the weight shift of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> among different artificial diets were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey HSD test. The data followed assumptions of the homogeneity of variance and normal distribution. To investigate the potential role of the lipophilicity and logVP inhibiting feeding behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, we tested correlations of the feeding behavior (weight shift) with lipophilicity and logVP (Pearson´s product–moment correlation coefficient). The analyses were performed in Statistica 7.0 software (StatSoft, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
