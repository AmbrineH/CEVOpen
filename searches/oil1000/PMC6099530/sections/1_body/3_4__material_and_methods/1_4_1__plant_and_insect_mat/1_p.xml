<p class="p">In order to collect adult insects of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, in November 2014, nine month old 
 <italic class="italic">T. pratense</italic> plants were collected from experimental cultivars at the INIA Experimental Station at Carillanca (38°41′ S, 72°25′ W, 200 m.a.s.l.), La Araucanía, Chile. The plants were sampled with enough soil to avoid root damage. Colonies of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adults, without gender differentiation, were hand collected from the 
 <italic class="italic">T. pratense</italic> roots. The beetles were transferred to small cages and were then reared in petri dishes (150 mm diameter × 15 mm length) at 22 °C ± 1 °C under a 16:8 light:dark cycle and 80% humidity. The adults were provided with fresh red clover roots.
