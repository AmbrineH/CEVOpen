 <italic class="italic">Trifolium pratense L.</italic> (Fabaceae), commonly known as red clover, is an important perennial forage crop, which is cultivated for its nitrogen fixation, high forage quality, and beneficial effects on soil structure [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. It is mostly cultivated in warm areas of the world, either as a monoculture or as a mixture with other forage crops [

 <italic class="italic">Hylastinus obscurus</italic> Marsham (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), or red clover borer, is considered as one of the most important factors that is contributing to the decay of red clover [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In the last decade, there has been increased interest in the use of alternatives as opposed to conventional chemical insecticides, which are considered environmentally deleterious. Plant-derived substances, which are capable of repelling and/or killing insect pests, have been shown, in several studies, to be effective substitutes for chemical pesticides [
