<p class="p">The aim of this study was to investigate the potential antifeedant effects of plant secondary metabolites on 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. We studied the effects of essential oil (EO), petroleum ether extract (PEE), dichloromethane extract (DCME), and six purified sesquiterpenes from the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">Pilgerodendron uviferum</italic> (D. Don) Florin (Cupressaceae), on the feeding behavior of the red clover borer.

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, this tree may be a potential source of natural products for the control of the red clover borer. In fact, a recent study has shown a repellent effect for the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> against the weevil 
 <italic class="italic">Aegorhinus superciliosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], a major berry pest in Chile. The composition and characterization of EO and extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood were determined using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The structural identification of the sesquiterpenes were determined using optical rotation, FTIR, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Some of the physicochemical properties of the sesquiterpenes, including lipophilicity and vapor pressure (logVP), were also determined. The antifeedant activities of the EO, extracts, and pure sesquiterpenes against the antifeeding behavior of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adults were performed using a no-choice test that was based on artificial diets.
