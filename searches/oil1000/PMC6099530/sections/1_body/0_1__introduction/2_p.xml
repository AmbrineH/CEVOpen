<p class="p">In Chile, 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> causes a premature decay of 
 <italic class="italic">T. pratense</italic>, which leads to a significant yield reduction [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Both the larval and adult stages feed on roots, which causes weakening and subsequent plant mortality [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Furthermore, red clover pastures can suffer infestation levels of approximately 70–100%, after a period of 2–3 years [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. To date, the chemical control of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> has largely been unsuccessful [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and biological control has hardly been explored [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, some studies have shown that the secondary metabolites that are present in red clover roots play an important role in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> behaviour. For example, some isoflavones, depending on their structure, elicited an antifeedant effect, while others elicited phagostimulant insect behavior. The same pattern has been observed in the volatile fraction that was obtained from the 
 <italic class="italic">T. pretense</italic> roots [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]; where some volatiles have acted as repellents against 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>, others have stimulated its activity. Alternative strategies to effectively control the feeding behavior in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> have so far hardly been explored, and they are a high priority for red clover producers.
