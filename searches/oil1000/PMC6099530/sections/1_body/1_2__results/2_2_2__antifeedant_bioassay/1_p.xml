<p class="p">Antifeeding behavior of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adults was significantly affected by diet (F
 <sub class="sub">1.86</sub> = 9.52, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.000, one-way ANOVA). In comparison to the control, only the essential oil, the DCME extract, and the sesquiterpenes (−)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), and (−)-torreyol (
 <italic class="italic">5</italic>), had caused a significant reduction in the weight of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> adults (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01282-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). All of the other treatments were not significantly different from the control. As expected, the sucrose significantly increased the weight of the insect. Regarding the analyzed physicochemical properties, our results revealed that the sesquiterpenes with the highest values of lipophilicity and logVP, including (−)-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) and cadalene (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), significantly decreased the weight in 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. Whereas, the feeding behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> (weight shift) was negatively and significantly correlated with lipophilicity (r = −0.84, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.03; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01282-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A), where a marginally significant (r = −0.73, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.06; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01282-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B) negative tendency between the feeding behavior and logVP were observed.
