 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. According to these analyses, three monoterpenes (0.43%) and 17 sesquiterpenes (86.62%) were present in EO, with torreyol (24.16%), cubenol (22.64%), 15-copaenol (15.46%), and δ-cadinene (10.81%) being the most abundant components [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In this study, we identified 25 and 22 compounds in the PEE and DCME extracts, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01282-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), accounting for 82.4% and 79.8% of all of the detected compounds, respectively. There were 19 sesquiterpenes (73.53%, comprising 13 non-oxygenated and 6 oxygenated) and 6 diterpenes (8.90%, comprising one non-oxygenated and 5 oxygenated) that were present in the PEE extract, and 17 sesquiterpenes (28.57%, from which 11 non-oxygenated and 6 oxygenated) and 5 oxygenated diterpenes (47.97%) that were present in the DCME extract. Sesquiterpenes δ-cadinol, cubenol, and 15-copaenol were the most abundant compounds in the PEE and DCME extracts (
