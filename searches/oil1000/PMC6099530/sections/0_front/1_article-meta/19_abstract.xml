 <p class="p">The beetle 
  <italic class="italic">Hylastinus obscurus</italic> Marsham (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), endemic to Europe and Northern Africa, is one of the most important red clover pests in Chile. As commercial insecticides are less effective against this pest, plant secondary metabolites have been considered as an alternative for its control. Here, we have investigated the chemical composition of essential oil (EO), petroleum ether extract (PEE), and dichloromethane extract (DCME) from 
  <italic class="italic">Pilgerodendron uviferum</italic> heartwood. Additionally, the effects of EO and extracts on the feeding behavior (% of weight shift) of 
  <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic> have been evaluated. The composition of EO, PEE, and DCME were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed the presence of a similar mixture of sesquiterpenes in the essential oil and in both of the extracts, which accounted for circa 60% of the total mixture. Sesquiterpenes were further isolated using chromatographic methods and were structurally characterized by optical rotation, GC–MS, FTIR, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The physicochemical properties of the isolated sesquiterpenes, including lipophilicity and vapor pressure, were also determined. The sesquiterpenes were identified as the following: (−)-
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
  <bold class="bold">1</bold>), cadalene (
  <bold class="bold">2</bold>), (−)-cubenol (
  <bold class="bold">3</bold>), (−)-
  <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (
  <bold class="bold">4</bold>), (−)-torreyol (
  <bold class="bold">5</bold>), and (−)-15-copaenol (
  <bold class="bold">6</bold>). The antifeedant activity of EO, extracts, and isolated sesquiterpenes were evaluated using artificial diets in a non-choice test. Relative to the control, the EO, DCME extract, and the isolated sesquiterpenes, namely, (−)-
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (
  <bold class="bold">1</bold>), cadalene (
  <bold class="bold">2</bold>), and (
  <bold class="bold">5</bold>) torreyol, were found to be the most effective treatments against 
  <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. Our study showed that the compounds occurring in 
  <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood were effective in reducing the adult growth of 
  <italic class="italic">H. obscurus</italic>. The physicochemical properties of the isolated sesquiterpenes might have been associated with antifeedant effects.
