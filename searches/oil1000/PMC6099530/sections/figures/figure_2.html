 <p> Weight shift (%) of H. obscurus adults fed with artificial diet supplemented with 10 µL of EO, PEE, DCME, and 1–6 sesquiterpenes that were diluted in CH 2Cl 2 (1000 mg/L). Control: artificial diet supplemented with 10 µL of CH 2Cl 2. Sucrose: artificial diet supplemented with 10 µL of sucrose diluted in H 20 (1000 mg/L). The sesquiterpenes were (−)- trans-calamenene ( 1), cadalene ( 2), (−)-cubenol ( 3), (−)- epi-cubenol ( 4), (−)-torreyol ( 5), and (−)-15-copaenol ( 6). Values indicate mean + SE. Different letters indicate significant differences based on the Tukey HSD test. </p>
