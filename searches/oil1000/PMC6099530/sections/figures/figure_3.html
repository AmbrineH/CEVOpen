 <p> ( A) Correlations between weight shift (%) and lipophilicity and ( B) between weight shift (%) and LogVP. For logVP, values near to zero indicated higher vapor pressure. The sesquiterpenes were (−)- trans-calamenene ( 1), cadalene ( 2), (−)-cubenol ( 3), (−)- epi-cubenol ( 4), (−)-torreyol ( 5) and (−)-15-copaenol ( 6). </p>
