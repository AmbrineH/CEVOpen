<p class="p">One hundred constituents were identified in the volatile profile of true lavender leaves, with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (4.09% ± 0.67), a mixture of borneol and lavndulol (4.66% ± 0.69), 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene (4.81% ± 0.52), bornyl acetate (5.57% ± 0.82), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (6.11% ± 1.48), eucalyptol (7.28% ± 1.06) and γ-cadinene (10.53±1.51) as a major ones. When various methods are applied during the drying process, this profile is strongly affected. The optimal drying method is dependent on the purpose of the product utilization. A most interesting fact is that the drying process may decrease the share of camphor, while increasing the share of linalool and linalyl acetate which are the most desirable in components in true lavender aroma. This result may be a good starting point for considering the improvement of the value of true lavender leaves in comparison to its flowers for flavoring applications.
