<p class="p">Identification of all volatile constituents obtained by HS-SPME analysis and hydrodistillation were based on comparison of experimentally obtained compound mass spectra with mass spectra available in NIST14 database. Also the experimentally obtained retention indeces (RI) by Kovats were compared with RI available in the NIST WebBook and literature data [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The quantification analysis was performed using ACD/Spectrus Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) through the integration of the peak area of the chromatograms.
