<p class="p">The traditional and natural method of drying uses solar radiation, however nowadays convective drying (CD), which uses flows of the hot air [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], is the most common drying method used in natural products treatment. Nevertheless other techniques like freeze-drying, infrared drying, vacuum-microwave drying (VMD), spray drying or a combination of convective pre-drying with vacuum-microwave finishing drying (CPD-VMFD) are lately the objects of numerous investigations regarding natural products drying [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Unfortunately in case of drying the true lavender leaves only single factors were investigated. Interest in this topic is due to the necessity to find an optimal drying method for specific raw materials. In addition, not only a specific technique, but also its parameters, like drying time, temperature or pressure have a significant influence on the quality of the obtained products [
