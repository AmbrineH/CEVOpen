<p class="p">The objective of this study was to determine the volatile profile composition and compound quantity of true lavender leaves and the influence of three drying methods (CD, VMD, CPD-VMFD) applied with various parameters. The study was done by a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS). Also the total essential oil content was validated by using a hydrodistillation extraction technique.</p>
