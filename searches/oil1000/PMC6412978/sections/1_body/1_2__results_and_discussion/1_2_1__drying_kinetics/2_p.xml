<p class="p">The Page model can be successfully used to describe the drying kinetics of the true lavender leaves dehydrated by the CD, VMD and CPD-VMD methods, characterized by high values of the determination coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &gt; 0.99) and low RMSE values (&lt;0.05). A good adaptation of the applied Page model for description of the drying kinetics can be found in many earlier publications of dill leaves, chanterelle and oyster mushrooms [
