<p class="p">In the case of CD increasing the drying air temperature from 50 to 70 °C decreased the time of drying from 245 to 135 min, respectively. In VMD drying, radical reductions in the total drying time have been observed: the time was shortened from 32 to 14 min with a power change from 240 to 480 W. This radical reduction in the total drying time of VMD compared to CD is a result of the conventional water diffusion occurring, according to Fick’s law, that is supported by a pressure diffusion mechanism of the Darcy type [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Combined CPD and VMFD using 480 W, shortened the drying time of leaves almost 18-fold compared to CD at 50 °C. The use of CD and 480 W power caused a drop in the material temperature during VMD by 4 °C for leaves and 2 °C for flowers in reference to VMD 480 W. This condition is caused by the molecular distribution of water particles inside the dried CD and the distribution of water particles has an effect on the generation of heat energy production under microwave radiation during VMD [

The CD is very effective at the beginning of the drying process (the largest loss of water occurs during that phase) and VMD at the final stage of drying (removal of water strongly bound to the cellular structure of the material being dried) [
