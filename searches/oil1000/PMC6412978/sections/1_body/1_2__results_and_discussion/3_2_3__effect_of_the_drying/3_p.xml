<p class="p">The total essential oil content results are not equivalent to the content of sixteen major constituents. In fresh true lavender leaves, sixteen major constituents accounting for 66.51% of the total volatile constituents and changes caused by all drying methods were significantly distinct. Less differences were observed in the CD and CPD-VMFD methods (5.09–6.68 percentage points) and the highest were observed for the VMD method (22.54–24.04 percentage points). Further, some results in the case of particular constituents among the sixteen major ones are worth underlining. Again, all drying methods had a significant influence on a particular constituent share of total volatile constituents. The most interesting was the increase a share of linalyl acetate (even up to 11.06% of the share in the CD 60 °C method) along with the decrease of camphor share (down to 1.40%) at the same time. Also the share of linalool, the main aroma compound for true lavender, increased significantly after all drying treatments, except for VMD 240 W and VMD 360 W. These results suggest that applying drying, mainly CD, for true lavender leaves, may improve the characteristics for use in flavoring, in accordance with Kim and Lee [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], who report that the high ratio of linalool and linalyl acetate to camphor ratio is an important quality marker for lavender fragrance. Similar changes after applying drying were obtained by Śmigielski et al. [

Very poor results, both in case of total essential oil and major volatile constituents, were obtained after the CPD-VMFD method, what is in contradiction with results obtained by Szumny et al. [
