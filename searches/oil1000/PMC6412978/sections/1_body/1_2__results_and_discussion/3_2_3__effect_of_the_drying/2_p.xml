<p class="p">In the case of essential oil content all applied drying methods significantly affected the raw material. The most efficient method was VMD 480 W (1.302 g per 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), followed by VMD 240 W (1.075 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), CD 70 °C (0.992 g per 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and CPD-VMFD (0.921 g per 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) which were in overlapping significant groups. The percent recovery of essential oil in these methods were as follows 42.26%, 34.87%, 32.19% and 29.87%, in comparison to the amount of essential oil obtained from fresh sample. The less efficient drying method was CD 50°C, with a 19.06% recovery. The ratios of percent recovery between fresh sample and ones subjected to drying are presented in
