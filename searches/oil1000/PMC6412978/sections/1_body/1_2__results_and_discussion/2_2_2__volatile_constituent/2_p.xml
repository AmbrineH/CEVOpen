<p class="p">The main headspace volatile constituents of the examined true lavender leaves samples were 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (4.09% ± 0.67), a mixture of borneol and lavandulol (4.66% ± 0.69), 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene (4.81% ± 0.52), bornyl acetate (5.57% ± 0.82), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (6.11% ± 1.48), eucalyptol (7.28% ± 1.06) and γ-cadinene (10.53 ± 1.51). In less amounts cumin aldehyde (1.92% ± 0.59), τ-cadinol (2.04% ± 0.55), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>-cymen-8-ol (2.09% ± 0.25), camphor (2.09% ± 0.92), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (2.58% ± 0.33), caryophyllene oxide (3.31% ± 0.18), limonene (3.42% ± 1.16) and 1-octen-3-pl acetate (3.80% ± 0.52), which have a significant influence on true lavender leaves’ fragrance quality, were identified. The most characteristic and valuable constituents for true lavender (flowers), linalool and linalyl acetate, represented 0.42% ± 0.03 and 2.21% ± 0.73 of the total amount of volatile constituents, respectively.
