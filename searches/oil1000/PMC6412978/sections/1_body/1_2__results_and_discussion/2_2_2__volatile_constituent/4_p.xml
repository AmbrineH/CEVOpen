<p class="p">Unfortunately, there is a lack of reports in literature including HS-SPME analysis of true lavender leaves volatile constituents. Most of available ones takes as study object lavender flowers or whole aerial parts of the plant, where linalool and linalyl acetate dominate in the chromatographic profile of the volatile constituents [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] reported high amounts of eucalyptol (41.37%), camphor (15.83%), borneol (12.32%), α-pinene (4.66%), and γ-cadinene (1.07%) found by HS-SPME analysis of true lavender samples. At the same time they did not find any traces of linalool or linalyl acetate, suggesting that the major part of their samples were lavender leaves.
