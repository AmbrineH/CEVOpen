<p class="p">Similar findings were reported in recent studies where eucalyptol (8.50% and 31.9%), borneol (15.21% and 24%), camphor (2.00% and 16.1%), cumin aldehyde (0.50% and 2.2%) were identified as main volatile components of a true lavender leaves sample [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Also, one of these studies, by Hassanpouraghdam et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] pointed out low amounts or even a lack of linalool (0.7%) and linalyl acetate. This result is contrary to the one obtained in this study, however it may be related to the slightly different plant chemotype or due to the fact that in Hassanpouraghdam’s study leaves essential oil was analyzed, not headspace volatiles. Nurzyńska-Wierdak and Zawiślak [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00764" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] have identified linalool and linalyl acetate in a similar ratio (1:5), and furthermore they also found higher amounts of γ-cadinene (3.4 ± 0.1) and caryophyllene oxide (7.2% ± 0.2).
