<p class="p">HS-SPME analysis coupled with the GC-MS technique had revealed one hundred and four peaks (one as a two compound mixture) recognized as volatile constituents, of which only one hundred of them could be identified (the mass spectra of unidentified constituents are available in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-00764" class="xref">supplementary materials</xref>). Volatile constituents of true lavender leaves are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00764-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Among them nineteen compounds were qualified as monoterpene hydrocarbons, twenty-six as oxygenated monoterpenes, twenty-four as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, nine as oxygenated sesquiterpenes, ten as esters and eleven as others.
