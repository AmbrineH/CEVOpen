<p id="Par38" class="p">Our results therefore clearly demonstrate that the predominant, &gt;90% (w/w) MUFA source of the MRAFO product renders it much more resistant to thermally-induced, autocatalytic, O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-driven peroxidation processes occurring during standard frying practices than frequently employed PUFA-laden ones. Indeed, significantly lower levels of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals were generated in this product at each sampling time-point following exposure to LSSFEs at 180 °C. Furthermore, markedly lower concentrations of PUFA-derived aldehydes, such as 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 4,5-epoxy-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, were detected in this product when thermally-stressed in this manner, as expected. Indeed, samples of this oil collected at the 10 and extreme pan-frying 20 min. LSSFE time-points contained little or no toxic aldehydes, whereas substantially higher concentrations of these toxins were found in corresponding samples of PUFA-rich corn and sunflower oils.
