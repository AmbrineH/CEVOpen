<p id="Par55" class="p">The health-threatening significance of these estimated LOP intake values are further exemplified by the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s tolerable intake level of acrolein, which in 2002 was specified as a higher 7.5 μg (0.13 μmol) per day per kg of body weight (equivalent to a burden of only 525 μg per day for an average human body weight of 70 kg)

 </sup>. This tolerable intake level is 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 4.5-fold less than that estimated for only the total 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenal content of the above 154 g single FFRPCS, although this is only one of the 7 or more classes of aldehydes detected and monitored in this work. Moreover, the estimated mean molar % of this aldehyde was only an estimated 30% of the total aldehyde concentration found in FFRPCSs; that for similarly-toxic 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals was 39 molar % (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). However, although when adjusted for the higher molecular mass of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-octenal (126.12) over that of acrolein (56.06), the estimated tolerable daily intake level for an average human would be 1.18 mg, and therefore the content of the former still exceeds this tolerable intake value &gt; 2-fold. Moreover, the ‘acrolein-mass equivalent’ content of total α,β-unsaturated (i.e. both mono- and di-unsaturated) aldehydes would be approximately 3-fold higher than this maximum tolerable intake value.
