<p id="Par58" class="p">The oil reuse lag periods observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(a–c)</xref>, i.e. those determined from potato chip aldehyde levels only, were 5 episodes for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 1-2 for 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals, and 2 for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals respectively, and hence for each of these aldehyde classes, these values provide an indication of the maximum levels of repetitive use for sunflower oil when used for frying purposes according to our domestic deep-frying protocol.
