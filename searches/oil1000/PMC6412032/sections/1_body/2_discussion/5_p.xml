<p id="Par40" class="p">The higher levels of aldehydes found in sunflower, extra virgin olive and MRAFO oils when exposed to our LSSFEs than those found in the ‘at-home’ domestic frying ones (DBDRFEs) are predominantly explicable by the fact that the former processes were performed under shallow frying conditions, whereas the latter domestic ones involved deep-frying, albeit repetitive sessions. Indeed, these results are fully consistent with our previously conducted 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR investigations which compared the extent of aldehyde generation within fixed volumes of oils heated according to standard frying practices in vessels of increasing diameter

 <sup class="sup">th</sup> repetitive frying episode (i.e. 6 × 10 min. sessions with 30 min. cooling periods between each one) performed with this oil according to our domestic deep-frying protocol. Moreover, at the 60 min. heating time-point, although LSSFE levels of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals were

 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 1, 0.3 and 0.5 respectively for the MRAFO product, little or none of these were found in either of these oils when exposed to our DBDRFEs; low concentrations were only detectable in these oils at the later DRDRFE episodes.
