<p id="Par54" class="p">In view of these observations, very recently the Australian Government Department of Health (AGDH) specified that the acceptable daily intake of the similarly-toxic, simplest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein, i.e. that which is considered to be a level of intake of this molecule that can be ingested daily over an entire lifetime without any appreciable risk to health, to be only 0.5 µg per kg of body weight, i.e. a total of only 35 μg for an assumed (average) human body weight of 70 kg

 </sup>. This alone is a critical toxicological concern, especially since we have found here, for the first time, substantially greater contents of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals present in FFRPCSs available to consumers for purchase in fast food restaurants. Indeed, assuming that linoleoylglycerol CHPD-derived 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-octenal represents the total 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenal content therein, this estimate for a 154 g ‘large’ serving portion of this fried food (
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 2.4 mg) is 68-fold greater than that of this acceptable daily intake limit for its lower homologue acrolein (a value corresponding to 30-fold greater for its acrolein mass-equivalent). Strikingly, this 2.4 mg value is that of only one of the 3 major classes of such cytotoxic/genotoxic aldehydes detectable at similar levels, together with at least several minor ones. Corresponding estimates for the major 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienal (
 <italic class="italic">t,t</italic>-DDE) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanal (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexanal) species arising from linoleoylglycerol peroxidation were &gt; 3.7 and 1.9 mg (acrolein mass-equivalent values of 1.50 and 1.11 mg), respectively, per 154 g serving. Moreover, these estimates correspond to only one potato chip portion of a single fried meal!
