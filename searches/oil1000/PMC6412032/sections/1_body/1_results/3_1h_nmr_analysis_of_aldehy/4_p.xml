 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref> demonstrated that there was a significant sample (i.e. oil

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, in which sunflower oil FA-normalised aldehyde concentrations were either higher than or similar to those found in potato chips during the 0–5th, 0–2nd and 0–2nd repeated deep-frying episodes for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals respectively, but were greater in the fried potato chip samples than in the oil samples from the 6th-8th, the 3rd-8th and 3rd-8th deep-frying episodes of the cycle for these aldehydes respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between the FA-normalised contents of potato chips and oils at the 6th-8th frying episodes for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, the 4th, 6th and 8th episodes for 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals, and the 3rd, 4th and 8th ones for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals. However, the oil content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals was greater than that of potato chip samples on completion of the second episode.
