Corresponding partial spectra of the oils employed for this purpose are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(b)</xref>. Clearly, increases in aldehyde concentrations detectable in potato chips deep-fried in sunflower oil develop with increasing numbers of frying episodes, and these levels attain maximal (saturation) values for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals following the 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>, 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> episodes of the repetitive frying cycle respectively [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(a–c)</xref>]; their relative percentages were 21, 52 and 27%, 24, 47 and 29%, and 12, 64 and 28% at the 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>, 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> completed consecutive frying session points respectively. These proportions differed somewhat from those observed in potato chip portions obtained from fast-food restaurants (mean value figures were 30, 39 and 31% respectively), although it should be noted that the latter represent only the means of a range of samples fried in differing culinary oil media employed by these outlet sources. Indeed, our deep-fried potato chip level percentages of PUFA only-derived 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals were higher in our sunflower oil-fried chips than the corresponding mean percentage value of the fast-food restaurant ones, as might be expected, especially if such outlets utilised oils of a lower PUFA content than that of sunflower oil, as appeared to be the case for 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 50% of the samples examined (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Particularly notable is the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR detection of each of these aldehydes in the neat (unheated) oil, with levels of up to 0.15 mmol./mol. FA observed for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals.
