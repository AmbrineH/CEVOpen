<p id="Par27" class="p">Similarly, marked increases in CHPD and HPM precursors of aldehydes were observed in sunflower oil with increasing number of repetitive frying episodes [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(d)</xref>], their generation commencing from the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> frying episode and still increasing at the final sampling cycle. Following the 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> frying process, the mean hydroperoxide level was 1.93 mmol./mol. FA, a value equivalent to 6.54 mmol.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> oil. However, these hydroperoxides were not 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR-detectable detectable in the potato chip samples fried in this medium, and little or none of them were found in the extra virgin olive and MRAFO oil products investigated, nor sequentially collected samples of potato chips fried in these oils.
