 <sub class="sub">3</sub> extracts of FFRPCSs confirmed the availability of aldehydic LOPs in these samples, and also provided evidence for their potential passive transfer into these human food sources from the cooking oils in which they had been deep-fried. Typical spectra acquired are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, and these contained prominent 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenal-, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienal- and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanal-C
 <underline class="underline">H</underline>O function resonances, demonstrating the presence of these major classes of aldehydic toxins in FFRPCSs available for human consumption. In some samples collected, relatively minor signals assignable to 4-hydroxy-/4-hydroperoxy-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals and formaldehyde (singlet, δ = 9.60 ppm for the latter) were also visible in spectra acquired, the latter also being a secondary LOP. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> lists the mean ± SEM total concentrations of the three major aldehyde classes (μmol.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) found in such FFRPCS samples purchased from 7 different fast-food restaurants (including those from large chain outlets), together with their estimated molar % SFA, MUFA and PUFA compositions, which predominantly reflects those of the oils in which they were fried. The possible identities of these frying media are also listed. Although these mean values for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals and 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals were 30 and 39% of the total aldehyde detectable, respectively, that for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals was 31%. There was also a considerable ‘between-fast-food-restaurant-source’ variation for these FFRPCS determinations (for example, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenal contents ranged from 0–345 μmol.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>).
