<p id="Par24" class="p">There were strong positive correlations between the potato chip contents of each of the 3 major classes of aldehydes detectable. There were also significant positive and negative correlations observed between each of these FFRPCS aldehyde concentrations and the molar % PUFA and SFA contents respectively. There were no significant correlations between each of these aldehyde class levels and molar % MUFA contents. As expected, there was also a strong negative correlation between FFRPCS acylglycerol SFA and PUFA contents. A strong, highly significant correlation between each of these aldehyde class contents and those of total FFRPCS acylglycerols was also found. All these correlations are shown in Fig.
