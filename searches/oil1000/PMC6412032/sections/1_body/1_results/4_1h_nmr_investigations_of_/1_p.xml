 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR resonances assignable to intermediate epoxy acid LOPs were also generated in a time-dependent fashion in the spectral profiles of culinary oils when thermally stressed according to our LSSFEs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> provides examples from the sunflower and MRAFO oil spectra studied). Only 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9,10-epoxystearates were generated in the MRAFO oil, although only at the prolonged, shallow-frying irrelevant 60 and 90 min. time-points. However, as expected, sunflower and the other PUFA-rich oils investigated generated a range of such epoxy acid LOPs, and these were observed from the 30 min. LSSFE time-point (further details are available in section S5).
