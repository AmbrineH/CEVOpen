 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals and (g) 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-2-alkenals as a function of heating time for sunflower, corn, extra-virgin, canola and MRAFO oils. Corresponding polynomial cubic spline plots of culinary oil aldehyde concentrations 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> increasing LSSFE time-point are provided in Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2(a–g)</xref>, and these were employed to further explore inter-relationships between the concentrations of each class of these toxins detectable therein and monitored, and also to facilitate the determination of primary and, where appropriate, intermediate lag-phases for their evolution. The thermally-induced generation of 
 <italic class="italic">cis-</italic>2-alkenals was found to be very significantly time-delayed, i.e. by 20–30 min. (section S2).
