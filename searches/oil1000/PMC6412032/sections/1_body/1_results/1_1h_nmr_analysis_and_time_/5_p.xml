<p id="Par13" class="p">The univariate ANCOVA model applied (equation 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>) revealed very highly significant differences between (1) the culinary oils investigated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup>, with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-2-alkenals for which 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 4.85 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>), and (2) sampling time-points (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup>) for all aldehydes monitored. Moreover, the oil x sampling time-point interaction effect was also very highly significant for all aldehydes determined, and one of the major critical determinants of this was the significantly higher and lower lag-phase times for the generation of culinary oil MUFA- and PUFA-derived hydroperoxide aldehydic LOP sources respectively; the zero time-point MUFA and PUFA contents of the oils tested varied considerably. However, it should also be noted that the relative evaporative loss magnitudes of the differing aldehydic LOPs generated from either of these sources, i.e. those within &gt;7 aldehydic classes (each containing a range of differing b.pt homologues, as discussed in the Discussion section), is also likely to account for this. Details regarding the 
 <italic class="italic">post-hoc</italic> univariate ANCOVA analysis of these datasets are available in supplementary materials section S3.
