<p id="Par19" class="p">The time-dependent decline in the PUFA content of each oil was monitored via decreases in the normalised relative intensities of their 
 <italic class="italic">bis</italic>-allylic-CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> group resonances (i.e. the δ = 2.73–2.84 ppm ISB, section 4.1). Significant (i.e. ≥5%) decreases in these intensities were observed at 10–20, 10–20, 10–20, 20–30 and 20–30 min. for sunflower, corn, extra-virgin, canola, and MRAFO oils respectively (although the PUFA content of the MRAFO product is very low). Moreover, significant (i.e. ≥5%) reductions in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR-determined omega-3 FA contents of these oils (section 4.1) were observed at 10–20 min. for corn oil, and 20–30 min. for extra-virgin, canola, and MRAFO oils. For example, our 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR data acquired on canola oil indicated that its total omega-3 fatty acid (predominantly linolenate) content was reduced from 10.61 ± 0.03 to 10.60 ± 0.02, 10.57 ± 0.01, 10.53 ± 0.06, 10.19 ± 0.02, 9.25 ± 0.03 and 8.27 ± 0.10 molar % (mean ± SEM) at the 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min. LSSFE time-points respectively, i.e. an overall loss of 2.34% (proportionately 22%) of its prior molar content at the extreme 90 min. one.
