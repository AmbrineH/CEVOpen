 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the total mean mmol./mol. FA concentrations (of n = 6 replicates) of saturated and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes generated in all oils evaluated at the 20 and 90 min. LSSFE time-points, the former representing an extreme for pan shallow-frying practices. These data again confirm that the MRAFO oil generated the lowest aldehyde concentrations when subjected to simulated laboratory frying episodes. Intermediate levels of total saturated and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes were produced in the other MUFA-rich oils (extra-virgin and canola oils, although each had MUFA contents lower than that of the MRAFO product); however, these were lower than those formed in the PUFA-rich corn and sunflower oils, as expected. At the 20 min. heating time-point, total saturated and α,β-unsaturated aldehyde levels determined in the MRAFO oil were only 9 and 13%, respectively, of those determined in sunflower oil, and only 9 and 14%, respectively, of those in corn oil.
