<p id="Par17" class="p">As expected, the MUFA-rich MRAFO, extra-virgin and canola oils generated much lower levels of peroxidised PUFA-derived 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans–</italic>alka-2,4-dienals than those observed in PUFA-rich ones such as sunflower oil (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>); full details are available in section S2. Moreover, in some cases, the time-dependent production of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals from peroxidised MUFA sources was also found to be preceded by an intermediate lag phase, and for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, these are particularly notable for the canola and MRAFO oils investigated (20–30 min. in each case). That for extra-virgin olive oil was also visible, but less well defined; plots of total oil 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanal concentration 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> heating time also featured this intermediate lag phase. Information detailing the mean concentration orders of magnitude of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals generated in each oil tested are also provided in section S2.
