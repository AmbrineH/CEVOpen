 <underline class="underline">H</underline>O function doublet resonance (
 <italic class="italic">j</italic> = 8.1 Hz) confirmed that it was assignable to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, since it was directly connected to two vinylic proton multiplet signals located at δ = 6.59 and 5.95 ppm (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). This pattern of coupled resonances is consistent with that of 
 <italic class="italic">cis(Z)</italic>-2-butenal (
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-crotonaldehyde), which has corresponding signals at δ = 10.10 ppm (
 <italic class="italic">d, j</italic> = 8.1 Hz), 6.70 (
 <italic class="italic">dq</italic>) and 5.97 ppm (
 <italic class="italic">ddq</italic>) [Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1(c)</xref>], and therefore this 10.05–10.08 ppm ISB resonance was assigned to 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-2-alkenals, which are also established secondary LOPs, including 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-2-butenal
