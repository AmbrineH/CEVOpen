<p id="Par97" class="p">Agglomerative hierarchal clustering (AHC), principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson (linear) correlation analysis of the extensive culinary oil NMR-based aldehyde concentration dataset was performed using 
 <italic class="italic">Metaboanalyst 3.0</italic> software module options. Datasets (mmol. aldehyde/mol. FA) were analysed either untransformed and unscaled, or alternatively after cube root- or glog-transformations, and Pareto scaling. AHC dendograms were generated employing Euclidean distance and Wardâ€™s linkage clustering algorithm. Heatmap and correlation feature diagrams were also obtained using this software module.
