<p id="Par86" class="p">FFRPCSs were purchased from a total of 12 local fast-food restaurants. To accurately weighed quantities of each sample (1.00–6.30 g), 1.00–8.00 ml volumes of C
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>HCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were added (predominantly 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 1.0 ml per g), and these mixtures were then mechanically homogenised using an electric pestle rotor (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Subsequently, the homogenates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for a period of 10.0 min. at 4 °C. Exactly 0.60 ml volumes of each clear supernatant were removed and then treated with either 0.06 or 0.12 ml aliquots of a 1.00 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> mol./L stock solution of the 1,3,5-TCB internal standard (final concentration 0.84 or 1.54 × 10

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> extractions of FFRPCSs were performed either singly, or as 3 or 4 replicates of these samples as indicated in Table
