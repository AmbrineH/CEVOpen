<p id="Par80" class="p">All oils were heated at 180 °C for periods of up to 90 min. according to a LSSFE, and these experiments were conducted by a ‘blinded’ laboratory researcher. Each 90 min. heating cycle was completed n = 6 replicated sessions for all oils investigated. This shallow frying simulation involved the heating of a 6.00 ml volume of culinary oil in an air-dried 250 ml glass beaker within a thermostated silicon oil bath maintained at a temperature of 180 °C throughout the total heating period. Aliquots (
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 0.25 ml) of oil samples were collected at the 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min. heating time-points for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR analysis. Immediately following collection, the lipid-soluble chain-terminating antioxidant 2,5-di-
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butylhydroquinone (DTBHQ) was added to each oil sample (at a final added concentration of 2.00 mmol.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in order to block or retard the further generation of aldehydes and their CHPD and HPM precursors during periods of storage and sample preparation at ambient temperature. Samples were prepared for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR analysis within 2 hr. after collection, and were stored in sealed containers within a light-excluded zone whilst awaiting analysis.
