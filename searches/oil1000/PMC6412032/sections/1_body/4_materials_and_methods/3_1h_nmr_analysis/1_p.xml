 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR measurements on the above samples were conducted on a 400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer (Leicester School of Pharmacy facility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK) operating at a frequency of 399.94 MHz and a probe temperature of 293 K. All spectra were acquired as described in

Typical pulsing conditions were: 128 or 256 free induction decays (FIDs) using 65,536 data points and a 4.5 s pulse repetition rate, the latter to allow full spin-lattice (T
