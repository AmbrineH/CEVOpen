 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR analyses of culinary oil and potato chip determinations of aldehydic LOPs are provided in section S12 of the supplementary materials section. These include evaluations of the accuracies and precision of each of these assay determinations, together with corresponding lower limits of detection (LLOD) and quantification (LLOQ) values for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-alkenals, 
 <italic class="italic">trans,trans</italic>-alka-2,4-dienals and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanals. These parameters were evaluated in both neat C

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solutions, and also unheated (control) culinary oils either ‘spiked’ with 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-octenal and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexanal, or unspiked. ‘Between-frying cycle’ and repeat determination coefficients of variation (CV) for these LOP assays are also provided.
