 </sup>, i.e. PSI = [0.025(% monoenoic FA)] + [1.00(% dienoic FA)] + [2.00(% trienoic FA)] + [4.00(% tetraenoic FA)] + [6.00(% pentaenoic FA)] + [8.00(% hexaenoic FA)]. However, for all oils investigated here, contributions to the PSI from tetraenoic, pentaenoic and hexaenoic FA sources were negligible.
