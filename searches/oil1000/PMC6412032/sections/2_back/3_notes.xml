 <p class="p">S.M., B.C.P. and D.P. performed experiments involving the thermal stressing of culinary oils, the collection and analysis of FFRPCS Samples, sample preparation and 
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectral data acquisition, together with NMR data processing, analysis, and interpretation. M.G. contributed towards all these work-tasks, together with experimental design, the univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of experimental 
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR datasets, discussion, and also preparation and finalisation of the manuscript. K.L.G. performed all experiments regarding the frying of potato chips in a domestic deep-frying device, the replicated time-dependent sampling of DBRDFE potato chip and oil samples, and their preparation for 
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR analysis. K.L.G. and P.J. performed culinary oil heating experiments and associated sample collection, preparation, data processing and discussion tasks. M.G. also fully supervised the complete study.
