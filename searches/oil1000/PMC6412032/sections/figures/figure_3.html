 <p> 1H NMR analysis of aldehydic LOPs in C 2HCl 3 extracts of fast food restaurant potato chip samples. (a) and (b) Expanded aldehydic-C HO proton (9.32–9.90 ppm) regions of the 1H NMR spectra of C 2HCl 3 extracts of two fried potato chip servings purchased from fast-food restaurants (FFRPCSs), which reveal the presence of trans-2-alkenal-, trans,trans-alka-2,4-dienal- and n-alkanals as major aldehydic LOPs therein. Typical spectra are shown. Abbreviations: as Fig.  1, with F representing formaldehyde in (b). (c) Correlation matrix heatmap diagram revealing strong positive correlations between FFRPCS sample trans-2-alkenal, trans,trans-alka-2,4-dienal and n-alkanal concentrations (µmol.kg −1, n = 12). Also shown are significant positive correlations between each of these aldehyde classification levels and those of FFRPCS PUFA contents, and negative ones between these and FFRPCS SFA contents, as might be expected. Acylglycerols and aldehydes present in FFRPCS samples predominantly arise from the uptake of heated culinary frying oils by and. Abbreviations: SFA, MUFA and PUFA, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (as molar % contents); n-Alk, t-2-Alk and t,t-A-2,4-D, n-alkanals trans-2-alkenals and trans,trans-alka-2,4-dienals (as µmol.kg −1). Data were generalised logarithmically (glog)-transformed and Pareto-scaled prior to analysis. *Indicates inclusion of all possible PUFAs, including omega-3 and -6 FAs. </p>
