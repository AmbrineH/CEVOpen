 <p> 1H NMR Analysis of Potato Chips deep-fried according to domestically-based deep repetitive frying episodes (DBDRFEs). (a) Partial (9.40–10.10 ppm regions of) 1H NMR profiles of C 2HCl 3 extracts of potato chip samples deep-fried in sunflower (SFO), extra virgin olive (EVOO) and MRAFO oils exposed to a repetitive cycle of 8 sequential 10 min. duration deep-frying episodes (consecutively labelled 0–8, with 0 representing those acquired on control unfried potato chips) in a commercially-available domestic deep fryer unit at 170 °C. Potato chip samples were fried, collected and extracted by the method described in section 4.5. (b) Corresponding partial spectra of the culinary oils employed for these consecutive deep-frying sessions (0–8, as specified above). Abbreviations: SFO, EVOO and MRAFO represent sunflower, extra virgin olive and monounsaturated-rich algae oils respectively; aldehyde-C HO function resonance assignments 1, 2, 5 and 6 correspond to those in Fig.  1. </p>
