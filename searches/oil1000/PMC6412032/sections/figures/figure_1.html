 <p> Expanded aldehydic-C HO proton (9.44–10.12 ppm) regions of the 400 MHz 1H NMR spectra of ( a) sunflower, ( b) corn, ( c) extra-virgin olive, ( d) canola, and ( e) MRAFO oils exposed to thermal stressing episodes at 180 °C for periods of 0, 20 and 90 min. according to laboratory-simulated shallow frying practices (samples were collected for 1H NMR analysis at the 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min. time-points). Typical spectra are shown. Abbreviations: Number labels correspond to the -C HO function resonances of 1, trans-2-alkenals; 2, trans, trans-alka-2,4-dienals; 3, 4,5-epoxy- trans-2-alkenals; 4, combined 4-hydroxy/4-hydroperoxy- trans-2-alkenals; 5, cis,trans-alka-2,4-dienals; 6, n-alkanals; 7, 4-oxo- trans-2-alkenals; 8, low-molecular-mass short-chain n-alkanals, particularly propanal and n-butanal; and 9, cis-2-alkenals, a previously unidentified unsaturated aldehyde classification. All resonances visible are doublets, with the exception of 6 and 8, which are triplets ( j = 1.69 and 1.78 Hz respectively). The intensity axis in (e) has been expanded for purposes of clarity. </p>
