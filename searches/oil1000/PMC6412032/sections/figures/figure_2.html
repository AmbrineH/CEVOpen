 <p> Time-dependence of mean ± SEM concentrations of aldehydic LOPs (mmol./mol. FA) generated in culinary oils investigated when heated according to LSSFEs: ( a) trans-2-alkenals; ( b) trans, trans-alka-2,4-dienals, (c) 4,5-epoxy- trans-2-alkenals; (d) combined 4-hydroxy/4-hydroperoxy- trans-2-alkenals; ( e) cis,trans-alka-2,4-dienals; (f) n-alkanals; (g) cis-2-alkenals. (h), Heatmap diagram showing the time-dependent generation of trans-2-alkenals (t-2-Alk), trans, trans-alka-2,4-dienals (t,t-A-2,4-D), 4,5-epoxy- trans-2-alkenals (4,5-E-t-2-A), 4-hydroxy-/4-hydroperoxy- trans-2-alkenals (4-OH/OOH-t-2A), n-alkanals (n-Alk) and the previously unidentified cis-2-alkenal classification (UIA) in sunflower, corn, canola, extra-virgin olive, and MRAFO oils exposed to LSSFEs. Generalised log- (glog-) transformed aldehyde concentrations (mmol./mol. FA) are shown in the right-hand side y-axis: deep blue and red colourations represent extremes of low and high concentrations respectively. </p>
