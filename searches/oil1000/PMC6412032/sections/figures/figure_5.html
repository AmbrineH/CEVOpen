 <p> Plots of mean ± 95% CI total FA level-normalised concentrations of (a) trans-2-alkenals, (b) trans.trans-alka-2,4-dienals and (c) n-alkanals present in potato chip (black) and sunflower frying oil (red) samples exposed to consecutive DBRDFEs (0–8) conducted according to the approach described in section 4.5. (d), Corresponding plot of mean ± SEM total lipid hydroperoxide levels (combined CHPDs and HPMs, determined via electronic integration of their broad -OO H proton resonance, δ = 8.13–8.61 ppm) versus repetitive frying episode number in sunflower oil. The mean values represent those determined from duplicate potato chip and oil samples collected immediately following each frying episode in the 8 x sequential oil reuse cycle. </p>
