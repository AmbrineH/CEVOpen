The AEP was orally administered at approximate doses of 12 mg/kg, 34 mg/kg, 108 mg/kg, and 336 mg/kg of body weight/day. Subsequently, the animals received different injections of DMH. The results showed that the simultaneous administration of both compounds reduced the induction of DNA damage in the colon. However, AEP had no effect on the formation of ACF.</td>

The leukocyte count was determined in blood drawn from the tail vein, and DNA in these cells was assessed using the comet assay. Animals pretreated with the compounds were less sensitive to irradiation. Those that received the therapy after irradiation showed a slight, but not significant, increase in the total leukocyte count compared to the negative control.

At the end of the experiment, the histological alterations in the liver were investigated and their hepatocytes (HEP) were isolated to count the number of micronucleated hepatocytes (MNHEPs). This simultaneous treatment significantly modulated the pathological damages generated by aluminum chloride (sinusoidal dilatation, congestion of the central vein, lipid accumulation, and infiltration of lymphocytes) and reduced the frequency of MNHEPs. In conclusion, propolis may have an anticlastogenic effect and might antagonize the toxicity of AlCl (3).</td>

    <italic class="italic">Camptotheca acuminata</italic>). On this occasion, they determined that propolis and some flavonoids could reduce the cyto and genotoxicity induced by irinotecan in cells of mice with Ehrlich ascites tumors (EAT); and at the same time, protect normal blood, liver, and kidney cells. The pre-treatment with propolis and/or flavonoides resulted in a substantial inhibition of the growth of EAT cells and significantly reduced the frequency of micronuclei. These results suggest that propolis have a significant immunomodulatory effect and can decrease the toxicity of the antineoplastic in normal cells.

The topical application of EEP reduced the lipid peroxidation, the total number of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity, and functional activity of macrophages. A significant decrease in the number of micronucleated reticulocytes was observed.

On the other hand, analysis of cytotoxicity showed that a concentration of 50μg/mL presented a significant proliferative effect when associated with radiation, decreasing the percentage of necrotic cells. Concerning the clonogenic capacity, AF-08 also evidenced a significant stimulating effect on cell proliferation.
