The genotoxic activity of PhIP was strongly reduced in a dose-related manner by broccoli (raw and cooked). Similarly, the genotoxicity of AAF showed a reduction, although in a lower potency by cooked broccoli.

Using the comet assay, none of the extracts revealed to be genotoxic by itself, and both showed protection, more advisable on larvae extracts, against MMS-induced genotoxicity. As for the genotoxic/antigenotoxic effects of Brassica vegetables, they are commonly attributed to isothiocyanates. The extracts were screened in search of these compounds by means of a headspace-solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These findings demonstrate that both extracts could be useful against damage caused by genotoxic compounds; with the larvae extract being the most promising.
