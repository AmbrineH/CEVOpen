The result was that MNNG produced DNA single strand breaks in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as was determined by the increase in the tail moment of the comet. In contrast, when the cells were pretreated with I3C, a significant protection was induced in the DNA. Thus, concluding that I3C can be considered a relevant chemopreventive agent capable of inducing the DNA repair.</td>

The results showed that none of the concentrations used of the ITCs caused DNA damage per se. The three ITCs showed a genoprotective effect of oxidative damage induced by N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and/or N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA); however, the most important protection corresponded to I3C and PEITC against NPYR.</td>

The conclusions were that both the PEITC and the I3C showed a weak protective effect (27%) against the NDBA and NPIP. In contrast, HepG2 cells treated with the combination of vitamin C and each of the ITCs presented a stronger genoprotection of oxidative damage induced by these carcinogens. This evidence suggests that a possible mechanism of action of ITCs (alone or in combination with vitamins) could be regulating the bioactivation of NDBA and NPIP through cytochrome P450.</td>

The mixture of pesticides at an environmentally relevant concentration (5 microM each) produced DNA damage in the lymphocytes while with a pre-incubation and co-incubation of SUL, a significant genoprotection was observed in a concentration dependent manner(between 10 microg/mLâ€“20 microg/mL). These data suggest that the exposure to low levels of these pesticide mixtures can induce DNA damage, and the presence of SUL in the diet can reduce the incidence of this genetic damage, especially in farm workers.</td>
