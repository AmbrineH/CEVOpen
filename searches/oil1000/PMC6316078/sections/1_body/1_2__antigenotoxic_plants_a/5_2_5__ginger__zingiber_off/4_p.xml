<p class="p">The comparison of these studies, whose results were contradictory, was possibly the reason why Jayakumar and Kanthimathi (2012) [

Using the comet assay, it was evidenced that the concentration of the ginger (50g/mL) decreased 68% of the DNA damage of the 3T3-L1 cells produced by H

These results confirmed that ginger is the best spice with this genoprotective potential and that a possible mechanism of action is related to its antioxidant capacity [
