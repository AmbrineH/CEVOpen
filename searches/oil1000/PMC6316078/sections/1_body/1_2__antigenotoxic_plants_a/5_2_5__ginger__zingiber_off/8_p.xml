<p class="p">In the last research (2017), they observed that 6-G also significantly reduced DNA strand breaks caused by mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP); a metabolite of di (2-etylhexyl) phthalate that is widely used as a plasticizer in medical devices. In this case, the comet assay was the technique used to monitor breaks in the DNA chain induced by MEHP in endothelial cells of the human umbilical vein (HUVEC), as well as the quantification of malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase to explore its possible mechanism of action. In this sense, 6-G decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and increased the level of glutathione and the activity of superoxide dismutase, whereby, joining these results with those obtained in the previous studies, strongly indicate that the mechanism may be related to an antioxidant activity [
