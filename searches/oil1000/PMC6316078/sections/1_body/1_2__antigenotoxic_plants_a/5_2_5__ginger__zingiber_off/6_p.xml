<p class="p">With respect to 6-Gingerol (6-G), the main component of ginger, only three in vitro studies have been carried out to evaluate its antigenotoxic potential. The first one evaluated the chemoprotective effect of 6-G against patulin (PAT)-induced genotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Both the comet assay and the micronucleus test were used to evaluate this possible property; likewise, for further exploration of the underlying mechanisms of action, the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated. The results showed that 6-G significantly reduced DNA strand breaks and micronucleus formation caused by mycotoxin. In addition, the pretreatment with 6-G effectively suppressed the formation of intracellular ROS and attenuated the GSH depletion induced by PAT in this cell type. These data are evidence that the antioxidant activity of 6-G might play an important role in its antigenotoxic capacity [
