<p class="p">The rhizome contains fats (3%–6%), carbohydrates (60%–70%), protein (9%), crude fiber (3%–8%), water, and volatile oil (2%–3%). The characteristic flavor of ginger is due to zingerone, shogaols, gingerols, and volatile (essential) oils that comprise up to 3% of ginger on a fresh weight basis. The quality and quantity of biologically active constituents of ginger depend on its cultivation practices and postharvest treatment. The chemical components of the ginger rhizome can vary considerably, depending on the location of cultivation and whether the product is fresh, dried, or processed. The pungency of fresh ginger results from a group of phenols, the gingerols, of which [6]-gingerol (1-[40-hydroxy-30-ethoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) is the most abundant. Shogaols, which are dehydrated forms of gingerols resulting from thermal processing, also give dry ginger a pungent flavor. Fresh ginger may contain a 5-deoxy derivative of ginger called paradol. Ginger contains about 1% to 3% volatile oil that imparts a distinctive odor to ginger and which is composed mainly of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, including camphene, borneol, zingiberene, sesquiphellandrene, and bisabolene. All phytochemicals together contribute to its beneficial effects on health [
