<p class="p">Recently, the anticlastogenic effect of ginger essential oil (GEO) on the antioxidant status and chromosomal damage in mice exposed to gamma irradiation was studied by means of the micronucleus assay, chromosomal aberration, and unicellular electrophoresis analysis. The results confirmed that GEO significantly decreased the frequency of micronuclei, inhibited the formation of chromosomal aberrations, and protected against cellular DNA damage in bone marrow cells as revealed by the comet assay. These data support the use of GEO as a compound with radioprotective potential, whose possible mechanism of action is related to its antioxidant property [
