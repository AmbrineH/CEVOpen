<p class="p">Several studies have shown the chemical composition of different parts of the herb (leaves, flowers, stems, bark, or fruits) and its essential oil. In general, the leaves contain sesquiterpenes, lignan glycosides, alkaloids, mucins, bitter substances, tannins, and resins. While the main ingredients of laurus essential oil are eucalyptol, eugenol, linalool, geraniol, and alpha-pinene [
