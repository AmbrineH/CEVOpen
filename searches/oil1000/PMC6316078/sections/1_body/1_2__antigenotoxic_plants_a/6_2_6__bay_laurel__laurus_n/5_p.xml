<p class="p">Later, Türkez and Toğar (2013) conducted two studies to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Laurus nobilis</italic> leaf extract (LNE) against the genetic and oxidative damage induced by aluminum phosphide (AlP), a colorless and flammable pesticide that is commonly used to control insects, nematodes, weeds, and pathogens in crops, forests, ornamental nurseries, and wood products. Initially, the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) were quantified in cultured human blood cells in the presence of a metabolic activator (S9 mix). Subsequently, the frequency of micronuclei, as well as the total antioxidant capacity and total oxidative status levels, were determined in rats treated with both compounds for 14 days. Both investigations showed that: (a) The pesticide increased the number of SCE and CA compared to the control group, while the combined application of LNE (25 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L) plus AlP induced a significant decrease in the rates of these parameters. (b) AlP also increased the frequency of MN and altered the levels of TAC and TOS, and (c) this damage was significantly reduced by combining both compounds, since LNE reduced the oxidative stress and suppressed the genetic damage induced by AlP in bone marrow cells in vivo. In conclusion, the results suggested that the protective effect of LNE could be attributed to the laurel’s ability to eliminate free radicals [
