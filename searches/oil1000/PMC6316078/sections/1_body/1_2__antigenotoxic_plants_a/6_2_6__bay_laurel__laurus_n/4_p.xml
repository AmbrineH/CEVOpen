 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for laurel and its phytochemicals:</bold> The bay laurel has not been a plant of great scientific interest in relation to its chemopreventive aspect, especially in research aimed at evaluating its antigenotoxic capacity. Like other plants, there is little scientific evidence in the literature about this latter capacity and most of this evidence has been developed in in vitrotests. These studies began in 2011 when the efficacy of a laurel leaf extract (LE) against the toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in a primary culture of rat hepatocytes was tested by means of a micronucleus assay. The extract (concentrations of 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L) was added to a culture with TCDD for 48 h. Subsequently, the oxidative damage was evaluated by measuring the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the total oxidative stress (TOS); as well as the DNA damage using the test mentioned before. The resuts were that the group of hepatocytes cultured with TCDD decreased the TAC and significantly increased the TOS and the frequency of micronucleated cells. In contrast, those cultures exposed to the combination of extract plus TCDD, where the levels of TOS did not change, the TAC increased significantly and the LE counteracted the toxic effects induced by TCDD in a dose-dependent manner [
