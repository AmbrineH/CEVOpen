 <xref rid="B175-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>] employed a combination of rosemary and citrus bioflavonoid extracts to inhibit harmful UV effects on human HaCaT keratinocytes and in human volunteers after an oral intake. Survival of HaCaT cells after UVB radiation was higher in treatments using the combination of extracts than in those performed with individual extracts, indicating potential synergic effects. The combination of extracts also decreased UVB-induced intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS), prevented DNA damage in HaCaT cells, and reduced chromosomal aberrations in X-irradiated human lymphocytes [
