<p class="p">These results probably motivated Zegura et al. [

Applying the same technique as in the previous studies, both extracts proved protection of the DNA from oxidative damage induced by t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in HepG2 cells. However, the most efficient protection was VivOX against indirect carcinogens. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of the extracts is related to their antioxidant capacity [
