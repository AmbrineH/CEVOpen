The results confirmed that MMS was a positive compound to induce high frequencies of spots in Drosophila larvae. In contrast, all the extracts diminished the spots induced by this mutagen. Another observation was that the greater antigenotoxic effects corresponded to the extracts of nutmeg and rosemary in approximately 50% [
