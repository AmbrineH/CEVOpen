<p class="p">With respect to the rosemary phytochemicals, two different investigations were carried out in 2010, with the main objective of evaluating their anticlastogenic potentials. The first corresponds to an in vivo study, where the carnosic acid (CA) presented this property against the DMBA-induced confirmed clastogenesis induction. In general, the oral pre-treatment of CA for five days to DMBA-treated hamsters significantly reduced the frequency of bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPE) and the chromosomal aberrations. The CA was confirmed to have an antioxidant capacity and an effect on the modulation of phase I and II detoxification enzymes, and mechanisms of action, which, combined, can play a relevant role for its chemopreventive potential [

In this case, doxorubicin (DXR, 0.5 microg/mL) was used as a genotoxic agent. The cultures were treated with different concentrations of RA (0.28 mm, 0.56 mm, and 1.12 mm) alone or in combination with DXR; the result was that RA exerted no genotoxic effect, but significantly reduced the frequency of micronuclei and the extent of DNA damage induced by DXR at the three concentrations tested. Again, these results suggest that the antioxidant activity of RA may be involved in the reduction of DNA damage [
