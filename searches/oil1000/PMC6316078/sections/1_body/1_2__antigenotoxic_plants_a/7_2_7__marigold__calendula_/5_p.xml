<p class="p">In relation to the second study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of a calendula flower extract on oxidative stress and aflatoxins (AFs)-induced genotoxicity by the micronucleus assay. The animals treated with the extract for one week before the AFs treatment showed a significant decrease in oxidative damage markers, in the number of micronucleated cells, and DNA fragmentation [

The results of both studies suggest that calendula extracts have antigenotoxic effects for their high content of phenolic compounds. Some studies have shown that carotenoids and flavonoids are the bioactive compounds commonly found in the flowers at 0.078% and 0.88% respectively. Among the carotenoids are α, β, and γ-carotene, violaxanthin, rubixanthin, citroxanthin, flavoxanthin, galenin, lycopene, valentiaxanthin, auroxanthin, microxanthin, β-zeacarotene, mutatoxanthin, lutein epoxide, and lutein; while the most common flavonoids are isorhamnetin 3-0-glycoside, isorhamnetin, rutinoside, quercetin, calendofloside, calendoflavoside, calendoflavobioside, isoquercetin, quercetin, rutoside, and kaemferol [
