 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for marigold and its phytochemicals:</bold> Despite presenting a wide range of pharmacological actions related to the phytochemicals of their chemical composition, just as laurel, marigold has not fully awakened the scientific interest to confirm its genoprotective potential. There are only two in vivo studies in which the antigenotoxic capacity of extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. officinalis</italic> against the action of some mutagens has been analyzed so far. In the first one, Dimer-Leffa et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>] investigated the genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity of two types of extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. officinalis</italic> against the damage produced by MMS. Male CF-1 mice treated with ethanolic (250 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg) or aqueous (90 mg/kg) extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. officinalis</italic> for two weeks prior to the administration of MMS showed that no mutagenic effect was induced with any dose of both extracts in blood and bone marrow samples from animals analyzed by the comet assay and the micronucleus test, respectively. In contrast, the unicellular electrophoresis showed a protective effect of both types of extracts, repairing the DNA damage caused by MMS; however, with the MN test, only the aqueous extract revealed this same genoprotective effect [
