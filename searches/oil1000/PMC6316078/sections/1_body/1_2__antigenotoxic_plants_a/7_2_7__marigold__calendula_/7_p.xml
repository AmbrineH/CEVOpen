<p class="p">In 2006, lutein from marigold flowers was extracted and purified with the purpose of evaluating its antimutagenic effect through the Ames test (in the presence and absence of S9), as well as its anticlastogenic potential using the chromosomal aberration test in cells taken from a Chinese hamster ovary. In addition, its antioxidant activity was analyzed by means of the photo chemiluminescence (PCL) assay. The results were that lutein showed greater antioxidant activity than Î²-carotene and lycopene. In the same way, there were no mutagenic events in any of the doses evaluated (334 micrograms/plate, 668 micrograms/plate, and 1335 micrograms/plate); on the contrary, it presented a dose-dependent antimutagenic effect against mitomycin C, 2-aminofluorene, and cyclophosphamide. A similar phenomenon was observed with the chromosomal aberration test, confirming its anticlastogenic capacity in the three concentrations used (66.8 mg/L, 133.5 mg/L and 267.0 mg/L) [
