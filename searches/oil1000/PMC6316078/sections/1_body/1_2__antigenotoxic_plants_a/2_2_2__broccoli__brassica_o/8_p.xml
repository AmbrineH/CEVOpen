<p class="p">Using the micronucleus assay, the mutagenicity of the pesticide propoxur and its inhibition was determined by the administration of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) in Swiss mice. A single intraperitoneal administration propoxur induced the micronucleus formation in bone marrow cells after a 24-h and 48-h exposure. In contrast, the administration of I3C (500 mg/kg body weight) showed a significant reduction of the propoxur-induced MN formation after 48 h of a single application.</p>
