<p class="p">In relation to the only clinical study, a controlled intervention study was conducted with 14 participants (10 women and four men) to assess the chemopreventive nature of GLS. Human volunteers were administered daily with GLS for four days. At the end of the period, heparinized blood samples were obtained to evaluate their antigenotoxic potential against hydrogen peroxide using single-cell gel electrophoresis and the micronucleus assay. The previous intake of GLS resulted in a significant reduction of damage on DNA and micronucleus formation induced by H
