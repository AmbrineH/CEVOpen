<p class="p">With respect to its phytochemicals, more than 120 glucosinolates (GLS) have been characterized so far. All of them share a similar basic structure that consists of a Î²-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-thioglucose group, a sulphonated oxime group, and a side chain derived from methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophane, or a branched-chain aminoacid. GLSs are not bioactive in the animal that consumes them until they have been enzymatically hydrolysed to an associated isothiocyanate by the endogenous myrosinase enzyme that is released by disruption of the plant cell through harvesting, processing, or mastication. The most characterized and studied GLS compounds are sulphoraphane, phenethyl isothiocyanate, allyl isothiocyanate, and indole-3-carbinol, but many other isothiocyanates that are present in lower quantities may also contribute to the biological chemopreventive properties of broccoli [
