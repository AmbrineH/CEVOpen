<p class="p">In relation to the other studies where both tests (comet and micronucleus assay) were applied, Hassan et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] analyzed the dietary supplementation of spirulina (SPN) on the modulation of DNA damage and the alteration of the gene expression during aflatoxicosis in Sprague-Dawley male rats. They observed that SPN reduced the oxidative stress generated during the disease produced by aflatoxins. Therefore, it was possible to inhibit the damage in the genetic material, confirming a down-regulation of Fas gene expression and a relevant decrease in the percentage of fragmented DNA and micronucleated erythrocytes.
