 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for spirulina and its main phytochemical (phycocyanin):</bold> It is curious that, despite spirulina being consumed for centuries, there is only one antigenotoxic study carried out in the eighties, when the radioprotective effect of an extract of

Probably, the result of observing a significant decrease in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced by gamma radiation was the reason to start different studies on its genoprotective effects in this century.
