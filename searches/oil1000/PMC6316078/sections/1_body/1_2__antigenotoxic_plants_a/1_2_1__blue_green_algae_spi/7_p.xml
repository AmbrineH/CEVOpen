<p class="p">In recent years, Egyptian researchers evaluated the protective capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. platensis</italic> against a genotoxic agent of physical origin that, nowadays, affects a large number of people in the world; cellular phone radiation. They explored the radioprotective capacity of SPN in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that were exposed to the effects of GSM 900-MHz cellular phone radiation for 6 h on a daily fashion during 30 days. Mobile phone radiation exposure evoked a marked increase in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, in comparison to the control group. Conversely, SPN significantly reduced the level of DNA damage and oxidative stress resulted from electromagnetic phone radiations. These results suggest that a continuous exposure to mobile phone radiation for a long time leads to a significant toxic effect on the bone marrow. Similarly, the oral administration of 
 <italic class="italic">S. platensis</italic> can be a useful alternative for radioprotection [
