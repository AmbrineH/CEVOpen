<p class="p">With respect to phycocyanin, the main phytochemical of spirulina, there are only two studies that have shown a possible chemopreventive effect. In the first one, the antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of selenium-containing phycocyanin (Se-PC) purified from

 <italic class="italic">S. maxima</italic> (Sm) and its protein extract (PE), mainly constituted by C-phycocyanin, on micronuclei and bone marrow cytotoxicity induced by hydroxyurea (HU) in pregnant mice and their fetuses. At the end of the study, a significant increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPE) in all HU-treated animals was observed. In contrast, a low number of MNPE in the groups only treated with Sm and PE and in the lots combined with hydroxyurea plus the alga and its protein extract was also observed [
