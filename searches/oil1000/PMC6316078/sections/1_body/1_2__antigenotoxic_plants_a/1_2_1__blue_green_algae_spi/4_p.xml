 <italic class="italic">S. fusiformis</italic> on the genotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) and mitomycin C (MMC) in mice, was evaluated. The results showed that a five-day-oral pre-treatment with three doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) of this alga significantly reduced the chromosomal damage and lipid peroxidation induced by CP and MMC [

 <italic class="italic">S. maxima</italic> on the micronuclei (MN) induced by maleic hydrazide (MH) in Tradescantia. These researchers used the herbaceous plant as a study model considering that it has six pairs of relatively large chromosomes in their somatic cells that make it a suitable experimental material for micronucleus assessment. Their results showed that when two doses of aqueous extracts of spirulina (100 mg/mL and 500 mg/mL) were applied to Spirulina inflorescences immediately before the application of MH, the genotoxic damage caused by this mutagenic agent was reduced by around 60%. They also observed that no aqueous extracts of spirulina increased the MN level [
