<p class="p">The evidence shown in previous studies have suggested that spirulina can be considered a good antigenotoxic. That consideration has motivated other researchers, such as Chamorro-Cevallos and collaborators, to evaluate its genoprotective effect in other experimental models. They analyzed the antimutagenic potential of

 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] using the dominant lethal test. In both investigations, mice of both sexes were orally administered spirulina in three doses (200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg body weight) for two weeks before the intraperitoneal administration of mutagens for five consecutive days. At the end of the experiment, the results showed that the alga inhibited the genetic damage to germ cells, while it significantly reduced the pre- and postimplant losses in males, and the postimplantation losses in the treated females.
