<p class="p">Later, Farombi and Fakoya [
 <xref rid="B157-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>] investigated the antioxidant effect and the capacity of the elimination of free radicals of two fractions of the ethanolic extract (HSCF, fraction soluble in chloroform, and HSEA, fraction soluble in ethyl acetate) obtained from the dried flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">H. sabdariffa</italic>; as well as the anticlastogenic potential of both fractions against sodium arsenite, using the same technique as in the previous study. The results showed that both HSCF and HSEA were better scavenger agents of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, OH, and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in comparison to quercetin and alpha-tocopherol. Its antioxidant potential was 70% at concentrations of 380 microg/mL, 500 microg/mL, and 1000 microg/mL. On the other hand, rats pretreated with HSCF and HSEA significantly reduced the induction of MNPE by sodium arsenite after 24 h in 60% and 70%, respectively. These results suggested that extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">H. sabdariffa</italic> have a strong antigenotoxic activity and a free radical scavenging potential on active oxygen species [
