 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for roselle and its phytochemicals:</bold> In recent decades, 
 <italic class="italic">Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic> has received considerable attention in the nutritional field (especially its flower that is used in the preparation of fresh water, tea, desserts, and gelatins) and for its various medicinal uses. However, it has been the plant with the least studies devoted to its genoprotective potential. Practically, there are only three research studies in the literature that have evaluated extracts of the plant (ethanolic, methanolic, and aqueous), with the purpose of demonstrating its antigenotoxic capacity.
