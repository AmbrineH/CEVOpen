<p class="p">Recently, Vilela et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B159-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>] analyzed the presence of phenolic compounds in extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">H. acetosella</italic> leaves (EHa) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and determined the antigenotoxic effect of these extracts against the damage produced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in mice. The HPLC results showed the presence of caffeic acid, gallic acid, gallocatechin, coumaric acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. On the other hand, using the micronucleus test and the comet assay, they showed that the animals treated with EHa (dose of 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) plus the alkylating agent significantly decreased the DNA damage [
