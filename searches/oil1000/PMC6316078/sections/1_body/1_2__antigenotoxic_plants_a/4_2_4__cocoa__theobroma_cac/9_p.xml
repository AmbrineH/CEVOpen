 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] studied alpha-particle induced and medium-mediated bystander effects in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells through micronucleus (MN) assay. They showed that signal transduction from irradiated cells to bystander cells occur within a short time after irradiation. They also evaluated the effects of ROS (reactive oxygen species)-scavenging catechins in the medium before irradiation. At the end of the study, they observed decreases in the percentage of bystander cells with MN formation and thus proved the protection effect of catechins on bystander cells from radiation [
