<p class="p">Therefore, the antigenotoxic evidence analysis will be focused on its main catechins ((−)-epicatechin, (+)-catechin, and (−)-epigallocatechin). For the evaluation of these flavonoid phenols, three experimental models have been employed (sister chromatid exchange, micronucleus assay, and single cell electrophoresis). In the first one, the protective effect of (+)-catechin and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (both extracted from green tea) was evaluated against the damage produced by four trihalomethanes (chloroform (CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), dichlorobromomethane (CHCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Br), dibromochloromethane (CHClBr
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and bromoform (CHBr
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>)) and paraquat (PQ) in two different types of cell cultures. In summary, the results showed that the addition of crude catechin to the SCE assay system mainly suppressed the ability of CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and CHBr
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to induce SCEs in rat erythroblastic leukemia cells and that this reduction depended on the crude catechin dose. Likewise, both polyphenols in concentrations above 1.0 microM were able to decrease the frequencies of SCEs induced by PQ in these cells [
