 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for cocoa and its phytochemicals (theobromine, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and catechin):</bold> Although cacao products, such as chocolate, are commonly consumed for pure pleasure and chocolate is the main source of cocoa, which contains a largeamount of polyphenols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01954-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), cacao is not among the main sources of polyphenols consumed by humans. In fact, there are data indicating that this agricultural product represents less than 10% of polyphenolsâ€™ intake. This same tendency is observed in the studies focused on its antigenotoxic potential, which started in this century. In 2001, the anticlastogenic effect of cacao liquor extract (CLE) against the formation of micronuclei induced by mitomycin C (MMC) in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells of mice was investigated. The results were that the frequency of both types of micronucleated cells was significantly reduced when the CLE was orally administered to the animals 6 h before the intraperitoneal injection of MMC. Subsequently, in 2016, the inhibitory potential of cacao (roasted and unroasted) against the genotoxicity induced by tetracycline in Swiss albino mice were both evaluated and compared. Results showed that instant cacao had the highest antigenotoxic potential to reduce micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte formation induced by tetracycline. Both findings suggested that cacao is significantly effective in micronuclei reduction and damage prevention to DNA. The same study also showed that one of the mechanisms of action could include the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by MMC and tetracycline [
