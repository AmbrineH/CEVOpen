<p class="p">Considering that cocoa contains antioxidants that might inhibit the harmful effects of ROS, the effect of cocoa extract (CoE) consumption integrated as a bioactive compound into ready-to-eat meals on oxidative stress at the level of DNA in overweight/obese subjects was analyzed. Fifty volunteers participated in a four-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel nutritional intervention. Half of the volunteers received meals supplemented with 1.4 g/day cocoa extract, while the other half received control meals, both within a 15% energy restriction diet. Using lymphocytes from both groups, the endogenous strand breaks, oxidised bases, and resistance to H

However, the samples from both groups when compared showed a decrease in oxidized bases. Therefore, the subjects who started the intervention with higher levels of damage showed a greater reduction in the oxidized bases after four weeks in comparison to those who had lower initial levels; which suggests that a better protective effect could be present for a longer period of time [
