<p class="p">In this sense, only two studies have been carried out; in the first, the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA were analyzed in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated in TA100, TA98, TA97a, and TA1535 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> strains, without and with the addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. Its antimutagenic capacity was tested by using a high non-toxic dose (150 micrograms/plate) against the direct action agents (sodium azide (SA), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQNO), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), and nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD)) and indirect action agents (cyclophosphamide (CP), benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P), aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (AFB
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>), 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF)).In summary, BISA did not alter the mutagenic activity of SA and NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA, and 2-AF were all markedly reduced. These results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be altered by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens [
