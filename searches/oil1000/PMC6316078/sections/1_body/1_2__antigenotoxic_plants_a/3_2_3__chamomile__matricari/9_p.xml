<p class="p">The second study, developed by Anter et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], evaluated the antigenotoxic effect of APG and BISA against the hydrogen peroxide using the wing spot test of 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. All the concentrations used showed a significant genoprotective effect and also induced apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells. This study suggests that the antioxidant activity of these phenols could be partially responsible for their beneficial activity [

With respect to Chamazulene, there is no scientific evidence that confirm this chemopreventive potential, although possibly, by its chemical structure, this property could be favored. In this sense, it has been suggested that this sesquiterpene possesses anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] and that it is involved in the radical scavenging activity [
