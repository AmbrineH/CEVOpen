 <italic class="italic">Camellia sinensis</italic>) and infusions of six randomly selected herbal teas on the mutagenicity of eight heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S-9 assay. The majority of the extracts (in concentrations equivalent to 50 mg of tea leaves/plate) showed potent antimutagenic effects against HAA; even decaffeinated tea produced the same effect as that observed on “regular” teas. However, only some of them potentiated the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4,3-b] indole (Trp-P-2) and 2-amino-3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-3H-imidazo [4,5-f] quinoxaline (4,7,8-TriMeIQx) [
