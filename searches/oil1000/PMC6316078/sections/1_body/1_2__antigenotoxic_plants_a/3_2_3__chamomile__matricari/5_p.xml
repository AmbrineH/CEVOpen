Their results showed that: (a) In the first experiment, the DAU did not produce alterations in the kinetics of cell proliferation, but a reduction in the mitotic index. Unlike the MMS that did not show any alteration of these parameters, (b) both studies confirmed that CEO is not a genotoxic agent; on the contrary, it has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect (5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) on the rate of SCE (both in somatic cells and in spermatogonia) induced by both mutagens, and (c) that the mechanism of action of the CEO waspossibly related to its antioxidant capacity, which is very similar to that observed with vitamin E [
