<p class="p">The present study (Part 2) synthesizes the most accurate evidence of the antigenotoxic capacity of some plants and/or vegetables and the main resin of natural origin gathered by bees against different toxic compounds that cause damage to genetic material. In the same fashion, the investigations presented confirm the use of these plants and resins in popular medicine to control genetic damage, existing within chronic degenerative diseases. The resin and plants described could offer novel alternatives to the limited therapeutic options that exist for disease reduction, whose development involves alterations in the genetic material (such as cancer). Thus, these vegetables and their phytochemicals should be considered in future studies.</p>
