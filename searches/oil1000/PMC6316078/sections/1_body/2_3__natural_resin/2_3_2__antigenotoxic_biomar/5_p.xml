<p class="p">3. Finally, one must consider that all compounds, substances, or plant extracts that would be used in a clinical study must be previously evaluated in different investigation phases, with the purpose of confirming their pharmacological and/or therapeutic results, but especially, their toxic capacity. Thus, the route for the agents analyzed in the clinical prevention of cancer is long, and generally begins with the antigenotoxic identification of the candidate agent, followed by the evaluation of its potency by means of diverse tests and with the analysis of its mechanism and/or mechanisms of action. Once this is confirmed, it will be possible to evaluate its properties as a chemopreventive agent in phase, I, II, and III clinical assays to reduce the incidence of cancer. Among the main characteristics of the agents tested with chemopreventive potential is that of their preferably non-toxic, effective at low doses, low-cost, and easily available. These characteristics have opened the way for analyzing different natural compounds (such as genistein, apigenin, luteolin, lycopene, resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate) through clinical assays. In general, the preclinical studies of the agents mentioned, as well as others, have yielded positive results; however, when they have been examined in clinical assays, the results have been variable; that is, on occasion, they have shown positive results in different percentages, but in other cases, the data or results are not conclusive.This suggests that more complete and robust clinical assays should be carried out, taking care with the majority of the affectations in the selected population [
