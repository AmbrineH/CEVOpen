<p class="p">The information on plants and vegetables compiled in the present manuscript demonstrates the importance of their genoprotector potential and confirms that this corresponds to a minimal amount of these, approximately only 30,000 species of edible plants throughout the world, where only about 150 species are cultivated and consumed in the human diet [

In the same manner, the impact is evidenced of these scientific assays (sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus, and comet assay) in the field of toxicological genetics for evaluating the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effect of these compounds and/or extracts deriving from plants, vegetables, and fruits, in preclinical as well as in clinical assays.
