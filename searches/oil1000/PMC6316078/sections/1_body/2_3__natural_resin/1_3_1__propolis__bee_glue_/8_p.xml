<p class="p">Considering that baccharin is not the only phytochemical present in propolis, the same group of Oliveira (2013) [

 <xref rid="B204-nutrients-10-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>] explored the protective activity of artepillin C (3, 5-diprenyl p-coumaric acid-), one of the major phenolic compounds found in Brazilian green propolis. De Azevedo Bentes Monteiro Neto and colleagues analyzed the antigenotoxicity of artepillin C against the damage produced by DXR and MMS in male Swiss mice using the micronucleus and comet assays. Different doses of artepillin C (0.4 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, and 1.6 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously with DXR (micronucleus test; 15 mg/kg) and MMS (comet assay; 40 mg/kg). The results showed that artepilin C itself was not genotoxic in any trial. In contrast, the number of micronucleated reticulocytes was significantly lower in the animals treated with artepillin C and DXR in comparison with the animals treated only with DXR. In the same way, the tested doses of artepillin C significantly reduced the extent of DNA damage in liver cells induced by MMS [
