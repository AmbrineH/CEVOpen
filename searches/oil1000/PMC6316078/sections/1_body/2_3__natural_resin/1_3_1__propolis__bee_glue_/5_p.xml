<p class="p">The second group, with the greater number of studies carried out, has been directed by Benković V. and Oršolić N. Their contributions have revolved in evaluating the antigenotoxic, radioprotective, antitumor, and immunostimulatory potential of propolis in different presentations and administrations against diverse mutagenic and/or carcinogenic agents, using the comet assay, the micronucleus test, and the quantification of the number of chromosomal aberrations both in in vivo and in vitro conditions. The results of these contributions are as relevant as those from the previous group, because its protective effect was significant and comparable with other antioxidants, such as quercetin, naringin, and caffeic acid [
