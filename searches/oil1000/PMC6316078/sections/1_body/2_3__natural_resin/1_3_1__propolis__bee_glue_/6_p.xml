<p class="p">In the last group, Turkish researchers from the Atatürk University evaluated the effectiveness of this resin in modulating the aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) induced genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in the liver of rats (2010); and under in vitro conditions, analyzed this same property, but against 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced toxicity in hepatocytes (2012). Using the micronucleus test in both studies, they found that the rats treated daily for 30 days with a combination of propolis (50 mg/kg) and AlCl(3) significantly reduced the number of micronucleated hepatocytes (MNHEPs). Similar results were observed when three concentrations of propolis (25 μM, 50 μM, and 100 μM) were added to plain culture or simultaneously with TCDD (5 μM and 10 μM) [
