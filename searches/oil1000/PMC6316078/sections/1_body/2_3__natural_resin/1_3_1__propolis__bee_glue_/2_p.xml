 <bold class="bold">Antigenotoxic evidence for propolis and its phytochemicals:</bold> There are different colors of propolis depending on the geographical area of origin and the type of plants or trees used for their extraction. The combination of colors varies from black, ochre, red, brown, light yellow, green, to a large number of brown tones; yellow and green being the most common.

In general, all propolis have similar organoleptic characteristics; however, its quality may change slightly depending on the form of extraction. Due to its more than 300 components identified to date and its broad spectrum of biological activities, it has been considered a promoter agent for human health and an ideal candidate for possessing genoprotective properties.
