<p class="p">Therefore, in the same way as broccoli, cocoa, and laurel, this natural resin has been the subject of study for several groups of researchers exploring its antigenotoxic potential. The evaluations on this property are relatively recent, starting in 2005, when the effect of an aqueous extract of propolis (AEP) on the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and DNA damage induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in the Wistar rat colon by comet assay was analyzed. AEP was orally administered at 0.01%, 0.03%, 0.1%, and 0.3% in the drinking water (ie, in approximate doses of 12, 34, 108, and 336 mg/kg body weight/day). The animals also received various injections of DMH and were sacrificed at different stages in order to evaluate the development of ACF in the distal colon and damage to the DNA. The results showed that the combined administration of AEP with DMH significantly reduced DNA damage induction in the distal colon. It was also observed that AEP had no effect on the formation of DMH-induced ACF in the rat colon [
