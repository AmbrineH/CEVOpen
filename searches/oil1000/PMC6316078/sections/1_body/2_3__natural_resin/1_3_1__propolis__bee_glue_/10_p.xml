Like the previous studies with baccharin and artepillin C, the results were quite favorable because the animals treated with the combination of CR and MeHg reduced the formation of comets in leukocytes and hepatocytes. In addition, the doses used of CR (0.10 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) restored the glutathione levels. Taken together, all these findings indicate that the consumption of flavonoids, such as CR, baccharin, and artepillin C, can protect humans against the adverse effects of some genotoxins, including MeHg, MMS, and DXR [
