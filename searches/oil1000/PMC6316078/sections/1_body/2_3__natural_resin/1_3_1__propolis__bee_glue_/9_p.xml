<p class="p">Cultures of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79 cells) were treated with different concentrations of artepillin C (2.5 μM, 5.0 μM, 10.0 μM, and 20 μM) and combined with MMS (comet assay; 200 μM, and micronucleus assay; 400 μM). The study confirmed that all concentrations of artepillin C showed protective activity in relation to MMS-induced genotoxicity; a phenomenon that can be attributed to its antioxidant properties [
