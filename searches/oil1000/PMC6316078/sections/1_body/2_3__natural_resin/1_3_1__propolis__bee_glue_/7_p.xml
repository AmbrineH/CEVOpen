<p class="p">In relation to the propolis phytochemicals, different Brazilian researchers are the main authors who have generated scientific evidence about their antigenotoxic properties. The scientific group coordinated by Pollyanna Oliveira is the one that has carried out the largest number of studies since 2011. Initially, they explored the antigenotoxicity of baccharin both in vivo and in vitro using the micronucleus and comet assay. In the first case, they investigated the ability of this important constituent of

The results of both studies showed statistically significant differences in the DNA damage at the highest dose and concentration in comparison to the control group with the two tests used. With these results, baccharin can be considered a chemopreventive agent, whose possible antioxidant effect was responsible for reducing the genomic and chromosomal damages. Likewise, this chemical compound was also responsible for the antigenotoxicity also demonstrated by
