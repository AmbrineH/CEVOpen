The first group, from the Faculty of Medicine of Turkey, evaluated the protective effect of ethanolic extracts of Turkish propolis (EETP) against DNA damage induced by H

The results of both experiments showed a significant reduction of the damage generated by thegenotoxic agents in the cultures treated with the extract. Their findings suggest that the chemopreventive activity of EETP may occur under different mechanisms, including the antioxidant action.
