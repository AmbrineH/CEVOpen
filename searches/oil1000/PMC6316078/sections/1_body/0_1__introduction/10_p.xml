<p class="p">There are countless studies in this field, though all of them would be impossible to mention; however, we can refer to some in order to illustrate the usefulness of the antigenotoxic tools used in the population. This present report aims to gather a good deal of data based on works conducted in some plants, which have demonstrated antigenotoxic capacity, as well as some phytochemicals extracted from vegetables and plants, and that have been evaluated in five of the different models used in genetic toxicology (salmonella mutagenicity test, sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus, and comet assay). With these goals in mind, the authors of this paper attempt to provide information and bibliographic support to researchers who can explore the potential of these studies in this area of study.</p>
