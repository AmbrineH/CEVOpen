<p class="p">Numerous studies have been carried out in last decades in order to identify compounds that might protect humans against DNA damage and its consequences. There are continual efforts all over the world to explore the rich biodiversity of edible (fruits, vegetables) as well as medicinal plants and other edible non-toxic plants in pursuit of the most effective phyto-antimutagens. These bioactive compounds can be classified according to a chemical, biogenetic, or pharmacological criterion. In general, phytochemicals have been organized into five groups, such as carotenoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, nitrogen-containing compounds, and organic sulfur compounds (
