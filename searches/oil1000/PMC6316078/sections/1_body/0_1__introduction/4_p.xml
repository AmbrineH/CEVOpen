<p class="p">Since the genotoxic agents are involved in the initiation and promotion of several human diseases, the significance of novel bioactive phytocompounds in counteracting these mutagenic and carcinogenic effects is now gaining credence. Such chemicals that reduce the mutagenicity of physical and chemical mutagens are referred to as antimutagens. However, taking into account that all mutagens are genotoxic, but not all genotoxic substances are mutagenic, the compounds that reduce the DNA damage caused by genotoxic agents are also called antigenotoxic agents [
