<p class="p">Carcinogenesis is a process that involves changes, such as irreversible cell transformation, through a series of stages (initiation, promotion, and progression). It has been observed that 90%–95% of carcinoma cases are associated with chemical agents, 5%–10% with physical agents, and between 2%–5% with biological agents. Moreover, teratogenesis involves induced damage in the organism’s development; that is to say, at any time during the gestation period [

It is important to remember that the ability to induce damage of these genotoxic agents is influenced by the dose, time, or route of exposure, together with the genetic constitution of the individual, which can define susceptibility.
