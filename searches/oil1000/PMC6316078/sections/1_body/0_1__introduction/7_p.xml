<p class="p">In general, the antimutagens have been classified as desmutagens and bio-antimutagens; the first group considers substances that promote the elimination of genotoxic agents from the organism as well as substances that inactivate the mutagens partially or fully by enzymatic or chemical interaction before the mutagen attacks the DNA (these must be considered only as apparent antimutagens). On the other hand, bio-antimutagens (also known as true antimutagens) can suppress the process of mutation after DNA is damaged by mutagens. They act on the repair and replication processes of mutagen-damaged DNA, resulting in a decline in mutation frequency [
