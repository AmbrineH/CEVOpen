<p class="p">Genotoxicity is the ability of different agents to produce damage to genetic material. However, the damage induced in the genetic material includes not only DNA, but also thecellular components related to the functionality and behavior of chromosomes within the cell. An example of this are the proteins involved in the repair, condensation, and decondensation of DNA in the chromosomes, or other structures, such as the mitotic spindle, responsible for distribution of the chromosomes during cell division [

The agents capable of causing genetic toxicity are described as genotoxic or called genotoxins; and, according to their origin, they are classified into three categories: Physical, chemical, and biological. The first category includes the ionizing and electromagnetic radiation, temperature, and ultraviolet light. The second group consists of a wide range of compounds with multiple effects, highlighting the heavy metals, pesticides, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylating agents, acridine, acrylamide, aliphatic epoxides, organic solvents, asbestos particles, food additives, and xenobiotics resulting from certain “lifestyles”, such as smoking or drinking (alcoholism). The last category considers some parasites, bacteria, plants, viruses, and fungi (specifically those that synthesize secondary metabolites, such as mycotoxins) [
