<p class="p">At the same time, genotoxic agents may also be classified according to their effects or mode of action into mutagens, carcinogens, or teratogens, resulting in three types of processes: Mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and teratogenesis. Mutagenesis considers, basically, two types of genetic alterations. Alterations (mutations) that may occur at the level of a minimum unit of information (gene) or higher-level units, such as structural groups (chromosomes), to what is called micromutation or macromutation, respectively [

In the case of macromutations, the clastogenic agents are defined as those capable of inducing chromosome breaks, and aneunogen agents are those who produce the loss of whole chromosomes or chromosome sets. Mutations may occur on somatic and/or germ cells, with latter case inheritable if they are transmitted to the progeny. There is increasing evidence that mutation in somatic cells are not only involved in carcinogenesis, but can also cause genetic disorders, such as arteriosclerosis, heart diseases, and several other chronic degenerative diseases (
