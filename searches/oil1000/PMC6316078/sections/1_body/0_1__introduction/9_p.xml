<p class="p">Genetics toxicology is a multidisciplinary science that studies the interaction of physical, chemical, and biological agents with the genetic material, the response mechanisms to the damage, and their impact on the organisms. Due to its wide application in environmental and human monitoring, it has also been used to evaluate the antigenotoxic effects of the plants, vegetables, fruits, and substances of recent formulation. There are different assays, in vitro and in vivo (

Each test has its advantages and disadvantages, but, overall, the use of sensitive assessment methods that are rapid, simple, and able to evaluate the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effect on somatic and germ cells as well as proliferating and non-proliferating cells have been considered [

Among the tests that most excelled in the last decades, we can mention the bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), sister chromatid exchange, evaluation of chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus assay, and, more recently, the comet assay or single cell electrophoresis [
