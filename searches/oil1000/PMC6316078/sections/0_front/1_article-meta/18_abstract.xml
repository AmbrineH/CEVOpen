 <p class="p">Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The agents capable of causing damage to genetic material are known as genotoxins and, according to their mode of action, are classified into mutagens, carcinogens, or teratogens. Genotoxins are also involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic degenerative diseases, including hepatic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular disorders; diabetes; arthritis; cancer; chronic inflammation; and ageing. In recent decades, researchers have found novel bioactive phytocompounds able to counteract the effects of physical and chemical mutagens. Several studies have shown the antigenotoxic potential of different fruits and plants (Part 1). In this review (Part 2), we present a research overview conducted on some plants and vegetables (spirulina, broccoli, chamomile, cocoa, ginger, laurel, marigold, roselle, and rosemary), which are frequently consumed by humans. In addition, an analysis of some phytochemicals extracted from those vegetables and the analysis of a resin (propolis),whose antigenotoxic power has been demonstrated in various tests, including the Ames assay, sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus, and comet assay, was also performed.</p>
