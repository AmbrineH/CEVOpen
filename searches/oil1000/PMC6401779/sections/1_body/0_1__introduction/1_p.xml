<p class="p">Plasticizers are among the most important additives required for the processing of polymer materials, especially polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, which accounts for more than 60% of the total yield of plastic auxiliaries [

 <xref rid="B2-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Traditional petroleum-based phthalate plasticizers are the most widely used globally. The yield and consumption of traditional phthalate plasticizers account for a large proportion of the total plasticizer production and sales, but they are gradually limited due to potential threats to human health and environment. Strict regulations on environmental protection and safety have been formulated and carried out. The development of environmentally-friendly non-toxic plasticizers and biodegradable bio-based plasticizers to replace phthalates has been a research hot spot. Non-toxic green plasticizers with high performance, oil resistance, extraction and migration resistance used in electrical insulation, food packaging, and medical and health products are constantly being developed, produced and applied. Plasticizers are functional additives, which are used to improve flexibility, plasticity, processability, and elongation of polymers, especially in PVC products [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. When a plasticizer is added to a polymer, the intermolecular subvalent bond force is weakened, the crystallinity is lowered, the relative movement between the molecular segments is increased and the plasticity of the material is improved. Therefore, plasticizers are mainly used to decrease hardness, softening temperature, elastic modulus, and embrittlement temperature of polymers, while improving their flexibility and elongation. Non-phthalate plasticizer alternatives include citric acid ester, phosphates, polyesters, halogenated alkanes, and epoxy compounds [

With the increase in peopleâ€™s awareness of environmental protection, especially the discovery of potential threats to human health by phthalate plasticizers and environmental pollution problems, the global hygienic requirements for plastic additives are increasing. The use of non-phthalate plasticizer alternatives has been gradually introduced [
