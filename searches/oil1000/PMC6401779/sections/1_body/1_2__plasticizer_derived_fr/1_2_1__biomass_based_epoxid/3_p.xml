<p class="p">Our group synthesized a series of epoxidized castor oil polyol esters, epoxidized soybean oil polyol esters, and epoxidized tung oil methyl ester via alcoholysis and epoxidation, and investigated their plasticizing effect on PVC films [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the synthesis route of epoxidized castor oil polyol ester. Dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results show that these epoxidized vegetable polyol esters present excellent plasticizing effect on PVC and can be used as main plasticizers to completely replace DOP in flexible PVC films.
