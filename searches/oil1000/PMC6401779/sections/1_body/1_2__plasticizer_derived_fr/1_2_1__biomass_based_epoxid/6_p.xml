<p class="p">Cardanol is an important chemical raw material, which has been widely used to prepare various plasticizers. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows the chemical structure of various of cardanol based plasticizers. Epoxidized cardanol glycidyl ether, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>j and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, is synthesized from cardanol via substitution reaction and epoxidation reaction [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. It is used to partly replaced DOP in soft PVC films. Epoxidized cardanol glycidyl ether improves flexibility and toughen soft PVC films and shows similar volatility, extraction and exudation resistance compared with DOP. Our group also synthesized a kind of epoxidized cardanol based plasticizer using quaternary ammonium phosphotungstate as catalyst [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Its chemical structure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. Epoxidized cardanol-based plasticizers exhibit similar plasticizing efficiency with DOP. In addition, excellent solvent resistance and lower volatilization of epoxidized cardanol-based plasticizers maintain the long stability property of PVC products. The obtained cardanol-based plasticizer is biologically safe without acute toxicity, which makes it possible to be used in food packing and toys.
