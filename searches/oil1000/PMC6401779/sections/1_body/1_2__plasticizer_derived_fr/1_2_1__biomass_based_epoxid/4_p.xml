<p class="p">Vieira et al. investigated the effect of polyesterification of rice fatty acid on properties of natural polymeric plasticizer with the usage of monopropylene glycol, octanol and diethylene glycol [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The experiment shows that elongation at break of PVC materials plasticized with natural polymeric plasticizer reaches 371.2%. To learn more about rice fatty acid, Machado et al. obtained two natural epoxidized plasticizers from peracetic acid (NP-Ac) and peroctanoic acid (NP-Oc). Even though both enhance the performance of PVC materials, natural epoxidized plasticizers derived from NP-Ac possess better ability than NP-Oc. This phenomenon may result from a higher degree of epoxidation in the process of reaction with acid [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Chaudhary et al. found that almost all kinds of epoxidized fatty acid esters (EFAE) are compatible with PVC and the efficiencies increase with decreasing molecular weight [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The alternatives achieve the balance of flexibility retention and mechanical properties after heat aging, especially compared with phthalate and trimellitate plasticizers. Espinosa et al. found that fatty acids obtained from rapeseed oil could serve as another cheaper raw source to produce plasticizers via thiol-ene addition and epoxidation reaction [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Silverajah et al. reported a comparative study on PLA/epoxidized palm oil blend about their mechanical and characterization [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. They found that 1 wt % of epoxidized palm oil (EPO) is enough to enhance the flexibility and strength of PLA along with the flexural and impact properties. To obtain the best performance, EPO(3), a mixture of EPO and soybean oil is added. Pure PLA presents a tensile modulus value of 1054 MPa while that of EPO(3) is 1214 MPa. Mulla et al. studied the reaction between PLA and EPO by casting process at different weight ratio and found that the elongation at break reaches its best (about 210%) when the ratio of PLA/EPO blend is 80/20 [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Chieng et al. studied the cold-crystallization temperature when PLA is blended with EPO [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The results show that the mobility of the polymeric chains is enhanced. Furthermore, mild interfacial adhesion between PLA and EPO is obtained after adding 1 wt % epoxidized palm oil. Benzene groups containing bio-based plasticizer is also investigated. Chen et al. synthesized and used epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl ester to replace DOP [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The synthesis route of epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl ester is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The addition of epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl ester significantly enhances thermal stability, compatibility, and flexibility of PVC films, presenting plasticizing effect and thermal stabilization of PVC films. PVC films plasticized with epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl ester show good elongation at break (332.9%) and remarkable increase in flexibility and plasticization than DOP. In addition, the tung-maleic triglycidyl esters, which has similar chemical structure with epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl, is also reported [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the chemical structure and synthesis route of epoxidized castor oil based diglycidyl, which shows similar plasticizing effect and thermal stabilization on soft PVC films.
