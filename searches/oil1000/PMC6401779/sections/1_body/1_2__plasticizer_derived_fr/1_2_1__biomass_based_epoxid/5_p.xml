 <xref rid="B34-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Benaniba et al. studied the stabilizing effect of ESO on the thermal degradation of PVC [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The results suggest that ESO improves the thermal degradation of PVC. Atek et al. investigated the migration of epoxidized sunflower oil from plasticized PVC into food simulants [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is carried out to investigate the migration of ESO. Linoleic acid (C18:2) is used as external standard. The study provides new method to detect the loss of plasticizer in plasticized PVC materials. Lardjane et al. reported that both nature and the content of plasticizers acted as influential factors in the migration of epoxidized sunflower oil [
