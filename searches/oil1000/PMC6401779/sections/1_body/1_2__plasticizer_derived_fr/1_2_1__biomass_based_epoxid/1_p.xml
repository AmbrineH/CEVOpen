 <xref rid="B12-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Compared with other plasticizers, the epoxy group in the epoxidized plasticizer structure could absorb and neutralize the hydrogen chloride released by PVC during light or thermal degradation, which restricts or delays the continuous decomposition of PVC, endows PVC products with good light and thermal stability and extends their service life. Besides, it has been approved for food packaging and medical equipment materials in many countries and regions due to the extremely low toxicity of epoxidized plasticizers, which has made its production and price grow in recent years. Biomass-based epoxidized plasticizers mainly include epoxidized vegetable oils, epoxidized fatty acid esters and epoxy group containing cardanol derivatives. Currently, vegetable oils and epoxidized fatty acid esters have been used on the market [
