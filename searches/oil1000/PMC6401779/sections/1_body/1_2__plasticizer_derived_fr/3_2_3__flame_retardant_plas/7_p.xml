 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f016" class="xref">Figure 16</xref> shows the synthesis route of 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid groups and diethyl phosphate groups containing castor oil-based plasticizer (THEIC-MA phosphate). THEIC-MR-phosphate enhances the flame-retardant performances of PVC blends by promoting the formation of char residue in solid phase, and dilution and isolation of oxygen in gas phase. Cone tests show that the time to ignition increases, combined with the decrease of heat release rate (HRR) value, indicating that THEIC-MR-phosphate effectively improves flame-retardant performance of PVC materials and delays fire process.
