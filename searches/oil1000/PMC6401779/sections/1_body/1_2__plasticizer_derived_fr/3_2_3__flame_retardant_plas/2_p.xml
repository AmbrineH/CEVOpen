<p class="p">Phosphate plasticizer is the main plasticizer for PVC and has the following characteristics: good flame-retardant performance, better compatibility, good mold resistance, poor weather resistance, high toxicity and high price. Phosphate esters are normally prepared by esterification of phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus trichloride with an alcohol or a phenol. Commonly used phosphate esters are triethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate,

Phosphate esters are usually used as flame retardant plasticizers, especially in PVC products, because PVC products will not present self-extinguishing when the PVC products contain less than 20 wt % of phosphate plasticizer [

There are many kinds of phosphate type plasticizers: tributyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), tricresyl phosphate (TCP), tris(2-chloro-isopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCP), and triaryl phosphates [
