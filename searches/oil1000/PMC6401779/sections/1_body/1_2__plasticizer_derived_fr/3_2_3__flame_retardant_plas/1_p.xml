<p class="p">Phosphate plasticizer is a functional plasticizer, which has both plasticizing effect and flame retardant effect on PVC products. Phosphate esters have good compatibility with various resins and synthetic rubber such as PVC, cellulose, polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS). They have been used as cellulose plasticizers for more than 100 years. With the high density of urban construction and the rapid development of transportation, the flame-retardant performance requirements of various products are increasing. Phosphate ester plasticizers have been widely used, especially in fireproof and non-flammable products such as the preparation of rubber, plastics, military products, textiles, electrical appliances, conveyor belts and various building materials. The largest producer and consumer country of flame retardants is the United States. Phosphorus-based flame retardants in China have a large gap compared with the United States in terms of production capacity, output and variety. The proportion of phosphorus-based flame retardants in Chinese plastic additives is low. Therefore, adjusting the product structure of plasticizers and flame retardants, and increasing the proportion are essential conditions for the development of phosphate ester plasticizers in the future.</p>
