<p class="p">Glycidol can be derived from glycerol, which is a major compound generated during the production of biodiesel from the transesterification of plant oils and lipid-rich surplus streams from slaughterhouses and the rendering industry [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> show the two kinds of hyperbranched esters: alkyl terminal hyperbranched polyglycerol (alkyl-HPG) and butyl-esterified highly branched polycaprolactone. PVC plasticized with alkyl-HPG presents enhanced transparency and thermal stability compared to PVC/DOP blends. Besides, alkyl-HPG plasticizer ia biologically safe without acute toxicity and has a lower degree of migration in leaching tests. Butyl-esterified highly branched poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with various degree of polymerizations are prepared by ring-opening multibranching polymerization using glycidol as a single monomer and subsequent end-group modification, with structure of hyperbranched esters showing similar plasticizing effect on PVC and solvent extraction resistance as alkyl-HPG. In the case of the elongation at break, PVC plasticized with highly branched poly(ε-caprolactone)/glycidol copolymeric plasticizer shows the largest value of 397%, which is even greater than that of PVC/DEHP by 21%.
