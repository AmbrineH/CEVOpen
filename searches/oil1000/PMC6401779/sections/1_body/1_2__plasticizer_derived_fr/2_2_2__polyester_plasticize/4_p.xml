<p class="p">Different starch sources and plasticizers influence films differently, especially the physical-chemical and mechanical properties. Zullo et al. prepared several types of plasticizers (glycerol, urea and formamide) and examined the influence of starch sources (maize, potato and wheat) on physical-chemical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic starch films [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The research shows that the composition of formamide and urea enhances physical-chemical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic starch films. Pushpadass et al. used native corn starch as raw material to produce 0.4–0.6 mm thick films [
 <xref rid="B54-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Amylopectin and amylose account for 76.9% and 23.1% of native starch but the percentage only changes to 71.3–76.6% and 23.4–28.7%, respectively, during the extrudation process, which means that the degradation is not severe.
