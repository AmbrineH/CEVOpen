 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>, palm oil monoglyceride (POM) is obtained by alcoholysis of palm oil [
 <xref rid="B55-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Palm oil-based polyester plasticizer (POMP) is produced from POM and maleic anhydride via esterification. The obtained polyester plasticizer shows excellent compatibility with PVC and significantly improves thermal stability of PVC blends. When DOP is replaced by POMP gradually in the PVC blends, tensile strength decreases from 12.6 to 6.1 MPa, and the elongation at break decreased from 210.81% to 60.96%, illustrating that plasticizing effect of POMO is lower than DOP. This study provides general method for producing vegetable oil-based polyester plasticizer.
