<p class="p">Fakhoury et al. pointed out that non-degradable materials damage the environment daily, thus bioplastics with the addition of glycerol or sorbitol are increasingly important [

The mechanical, physicochemical and physical properties of blends of manioc starch and gelatin are investigated during the process. As a result, glycerol and sorbitol, as plasticizers, increase the elongation at break and water vapor permeability (WVP) of manioc starch and gelatin blends. Moreover, sorbitol, poly(glutaric acid-glyceryl monooleate) (PGAGMO), poly(succinic acid-glyceryl monooleate) (PSAGMO) and PMMA are also modified and used as bio-based plasticizer of hydroxyl polymer [
