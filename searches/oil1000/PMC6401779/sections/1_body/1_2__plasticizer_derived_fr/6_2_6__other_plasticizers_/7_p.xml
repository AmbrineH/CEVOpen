<p class="p">Internal plasticizer is the part of polymer that has plasticizing effect on polymer by increasing distance of polymer chains, decreasing the interaction force of main chains of polymer and increasing the possibility of mutual movement of polymer chains [

 <sub class="sub">g</sub> of self-plasticization PVC deceases from 85.6 °C to 49.3 °C. The decrease of tensile strength and increase of elongation at break for self-plasticization PVC illustrates the internal plasticizing effect. Nonmigrating plasticized PVC plasticized with mannich base of waste cooking oil methyl ester is also investigated via the same method [
 <xref rid="B124-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. No plasticizer loss for self-plasticization PVC materials in leaching tests gives these materials potential to be used in food packaging and toys.
