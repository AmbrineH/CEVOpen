 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f021" class="xref">Figure 21</xref> shows its synthesis route. It is synthesized from tung oil via transesterification, Dielsâ€“Alder reaction and epoxidation. PVC blends plasticized with C21 dicarboxylic acid ester as main plasticizer and auxiliary stabilizer show excellent thermal stability and plasticizing performance, combined with improved migration and volatility stabilities compared to dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) samples.
