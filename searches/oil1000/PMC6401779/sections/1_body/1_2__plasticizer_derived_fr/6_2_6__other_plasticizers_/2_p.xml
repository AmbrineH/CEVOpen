<p class="p">More and more plasticizer products derived from cardanol, a renewable main by-product of the cashew industry have been applied in manufacturing [

 <xref rid="B112-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. The results show that partial miscibility occurs between PVC and cardanol acetate, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a, while epoxidized cardanol acetate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>h) leads to complete miscibility with PVC. Therefore, cardanol acetate is used as second plasticizer to replace toxic phthalate plasticizers. Greco also studied the mechanical, solubility and durability properties of cardanol-derived plasticizers and they exhibit better performance [
