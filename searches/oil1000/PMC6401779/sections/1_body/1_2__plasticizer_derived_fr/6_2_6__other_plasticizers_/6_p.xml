 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f024" class="xref">Figure 24</xref> shows synthesis route of benzyl ester of DCO fatty acid (BE), which is used as auxiliary plasticizer to prepare soft PVC materials. Tensile strength, percentage elongation and thermal degradation properties are improved after blending BE in PVC formulations. Good anti-leaching properties and plasticizing performances of BE make it an environmentally-friendly plasticizer.
