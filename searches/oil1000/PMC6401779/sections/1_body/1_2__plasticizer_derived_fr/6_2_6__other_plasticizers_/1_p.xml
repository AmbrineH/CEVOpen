 <xref rid="B106-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Yin et al. prepared glucose from liquefaction of cellulose and utilized laser desorption ionizationâ€“mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) method to evaluate the performance [
 <xref rid="B107-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. The results show that glucose esters have great miscibility with PVC and the maximum elongation at break is reached when the content of glucose ester is 40 wt %. Cataldo et al. claimed that biodiesel can be used as an effective low-temperature plasticizer, which can be applied in winter tires [
 <xref rid="B108-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. Isosorbide dioctoate as plasticizer for PLA presents a better miscibility than dioctyl terephthalate. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-01303-f020" class="xref">Figure 20</xref> shows the synthesis of isosorbide dioctoate. The light transmittance reduces when the content of isosorbide dioctoate increases in PLA blends but still shows high transparency. The plasticizing performances indicates that isosorbide dioctoate has great potential to replace traditional phthalate plasticizers [
 <xref rid="B109-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. The effect of oligo(isosorbide adipate) (OSA), oligo(isosorbide suberate) (OSS) and isosorbide dihexanoate (SDH) on PVC plasticizers are investigated; the blends plasticized with SDH are similar to DIOP blends, while a film plasticized by OSA or OSS exhibits higher glass transition temperature [
