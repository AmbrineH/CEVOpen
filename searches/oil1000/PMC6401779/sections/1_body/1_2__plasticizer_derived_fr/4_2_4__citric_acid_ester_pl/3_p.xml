<p class="p">Zuraida et al. used citric acid and water as secondary additive to prepare bio-plastic starch (BPS). FT-IR results show that the addition of CA at 30 wt %, intensifies the properties of BPS to the degree 40% higher than that of BPS with additional water [

 <xref rid="B87-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. The results show that CA increases the water vapor barrier property (WVBP) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of corn starch-based edible films. However, when the percentage of CA increases from 10 to 20 wt %, the UTS decreases from 6.57 to 1.80 MPa. Thus, triethyl citrate plasticizer can be used to prepare “Green” films, which possess better intercalation and an exfoliated structure [
