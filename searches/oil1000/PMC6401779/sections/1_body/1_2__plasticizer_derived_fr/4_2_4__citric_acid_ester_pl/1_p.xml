<p class="p">Citric acid ester plasticizers are important, environmentally-friendly plasticizers because of their safety, non-toxicity and precipitation resistance. They have been approved in the United States, the European Union and other developed countries to be used in plastic products in close contact with the human body and meet high hygiene requirements such as for food packing, children’s toys, medical equipment and sanitary products. Therefore, citrate plasticizers have become the first choice for safe and non-toxic plasticizer products in the plastics industry globally. There are more than 50 kinds of citric acid plasticizers, and about 15 kinds of products have been produced at large-scale by the industrialized manufacturing industry. Acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) and tributyl citrate (TBC) have been studied in-depth and industrialized due to excellent performances. ATBC has good water and light resistance, good thermal stability without color, and maintains good flexibility at low temperatures. TBC has good compatibility with cellulose resin, PVC, PP, and its plasticizing effect is remarkable. In addition, TBC has antibacterial and flame-retardant properties, which further expand its applicability. However, the price of the plasticizer is relatively high, so it is mainly used in fields with high requirements for non-toxic safety of products such as food packaging materials, children’s toys, medical equipment and packaging.</p>
