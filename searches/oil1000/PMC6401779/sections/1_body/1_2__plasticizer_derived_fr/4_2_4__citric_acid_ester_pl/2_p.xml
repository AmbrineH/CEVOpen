<p class="p">Citric acid has been commercially produced through large-scale fermentation, thus undoubtedly is considered a raw material for producing plasticizers for PLA, PVC and other materials. Shi et al. prepared a novel plasticizer named glycerol co-plasticized thermoplastic starch (CGTPS) by melting and blending citric acid (CA) [
 <xref rid="B79-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The results show that esterification occurs when the content of CA increases. In comparison with commonly used glycerol plasticized thermoplastic starch (GTPS), the CGPTS shows partial esterification and lower molecular weight. Moreover, the interaction between plasticizers and starch becomes stronger, thus resisting retrogradation and enhancing its mechanical properties. According to Chabrat et al., the presence of citric acid has positive effects on mechanical and morphological properties of blends made from wheat flour and glycerol [
 <xref rid="B80-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. They claimed that citric acid functioned as compatibilizer, enhancing blend compatibilization. Schilling et al. studied the suitability of citric acid (CA) for Eudragit RS PO system [
 <xref rid="B81-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The results show that the monohydrate form apparently benefits the extrusion of Eudragit RS PO, while the anhydrous form is less effective. Flexibility of Eudragit RS PO films increases with the addition of CA monohydrate (CAMH). Thus, CAMH serves as a great assistant for Eudragit RS PO system. Olivato et al. obtained starch/poly films by using maleic anhydride (MA) and CA [
 <xref rid="B82-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The results show that CA enhances esterification/transesterification reactions better than MA and more CA can increase the elongation at break of films. In addition, this process produces films that may become the substitute of non-biodegradable plastics. Shi et al. examined the influence of CA on swelling degree, crystallinity and cytotoxicity of PVA/starch films [
 <xref rid="B83-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. FT-IR spectroscopy shows esterification between CA and starch occurs at 140 °C; esterification is much easier between PVA and CA. The tensile strength of the film reaches its maximum when the content of CA is 30 wt % of PVA/starch films. Besides, the results show that there is no apparent toxicity on cells when the content of CA is less than 20 wt % of PVA/starch films. Crosslinking is another precious character of citric acid. Seligra et al. took CA as crosslinking agent to produce starch–glycerol films, which are biodegradable and non-retrogradable [
 <xref rid="B84-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. The obtained films remain amorphous for more than 45 days. The method avoids retrogradation of starch–glycerol films and maintains the degradability. Garcia et al. changed amounts of critic acid to examine the crosslinking effect [
 <xref rid="B85-polymers-10-01303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The calculation results of water vapor permeability (WVP) show that the increase of content of citric acid would reduce the diffusion coefficient and WVP. In other words, such reduction apparently suggests the occurrence of crosslinking. Thus, crosslinking is an effective approach to improve the properties of starch products.
