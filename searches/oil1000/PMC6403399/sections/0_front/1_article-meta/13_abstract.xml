  <italic class="italic">Vigna unguiculata</italic>, one of the most important legumes, mainly in underdeveloped countries, is susceptible to post-harvest losses in storage by 
  <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The work evaluated the toxicity, inhibition of oviposition, instantaneous rate of population growth (r
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>) and the development of fumigated 
  <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> with the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Vanillosmopsis arborea</italic> and its major constituent, 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol. The experimental units consisted of 0.8 L flasks treated with concentrations of 1.2–11.2 μL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>
  <sub class="sub">of air</sub> of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> or its major constituent applied to disks of filter paper. 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Bisabolol was quantified as 409.33 mL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of the essential oil. The development rate of 
  <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> was evaluated by daily adult counts. Oviposition was evaluated at lethal concentrations (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LC
  <sub class="sub">25</sub>, LC
  <sub class="sub">10</sub> and LC
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>). The LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
  <sub class="sub">95</sub> of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol were 5.23 and 12.97 μL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of air and 2.47 and 8.82 μL L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of air, respectively. At some concentrations, the 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol was more toxic to males than to females of the insect. Increased concentrations of the essential oil reduced the r
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>, rate of development, oviposition, and number of eggs of 
  <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> and therefore have potential for pest control.
