<p id="Par24" class="p">The assay was organized in a completely randomized design with four replications. Each plot was made up of a glass flask (0.8 L capacity) with 100 g of cowpea grains with a moisture content of 10.7% wet basis (w.b.), free of pests and insecticides. The working solutions of the essential oil were prepared with hexane as solvent and applied with a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) onto filter paper discs in Petri dishes (diameter 6.5 cm). The Petri dishes were covered with organza-type fabric to prevent direct contact of the insects with the oil and placed on the beans per flask. In the present study, four lethal and sublethal concentrations of the oil, LC

The insects were placed in the flasks, which were immediately closed with a screwable metal cap and sealed with parafilm and kept in climatic chambers with a temperature of 30 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 70%. After 48 h, the Petri dishes with the essential oil were removed, ending the exposure period for the insects. The metal caps were then removed and the organza flasks returned to the climatic chamber at a temperature of 30 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 70% for 45 days. The number of live insects and the final weight of the grain mass were evaluated after this period. The instantaneous growth rate of the insects was calculated with the Walthall and Stark equation
