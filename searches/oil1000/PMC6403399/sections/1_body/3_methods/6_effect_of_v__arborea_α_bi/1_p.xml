<p id="Par23" class="p">The fumigant effect of 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil and its isolated component on 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> oviposition was studied with a lethal concentration and three sub-lethal ones per treatment (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub>, LC
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The control had untreated grains. A total of 25 μL of each oil solution, component and solvent (hexane) was applied on filter paper discs (diameter of 4.4 cm). These discs were placed in Petri dishes (6.5 cm diameter) covered with organza and placed on 100 g of cowpea in glass vials (0.8 L capacity). Ten pairs of 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic>, with one-day emergence, were added to each flask. The insects were kept in a climatic chamber at 27 ± 2 °C. After 48 h, the insects were removed and the number of eggs on the beans counted.
