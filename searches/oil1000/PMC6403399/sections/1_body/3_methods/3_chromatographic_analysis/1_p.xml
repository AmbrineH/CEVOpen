<p id="Par20" class="p">The concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol in the 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil was analyzed by Shimadzu GC2010 gas chromatograph (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The GC configurations were an initial column temperature of 100 °C increasing from 30 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> until 280 °C was reached, the injector temperature was set at 220 °C, and the detector temperature was set at 300 °C. The separation rate of the samples (1.0 μL) injected was 1:5 with nitrogen as the carrier gas and a flow rate of 1.2 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol in the essential oil was determined based on the calibration curve constructed from injections of the analytical standard of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol purchased from Engetec (São Paulo, Brazil) with purity of 99.9%. The total run time was 6 min.
