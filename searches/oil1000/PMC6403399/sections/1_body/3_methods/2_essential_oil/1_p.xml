 <italic class="italic">Vanillosmopsis arborea</italic> essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation in a five-liter capacity Clevenger in the Laboratory of Product Technology of the Agricultural Sciences Campus of the Federal University of Cariri. The plant material (leaves, branches and wood) was collected at the Araripe National Forest in Ceará, Brazil (7°19′52.0″S, 39°26′15.9″W). The material was placed in a round bottom flask immersed in 1.5 L distilled water. The extraction time was 2 h, time taken for the oil to accumulate in the water in the condenser, subsequently being separated and stored at 4 °C.
