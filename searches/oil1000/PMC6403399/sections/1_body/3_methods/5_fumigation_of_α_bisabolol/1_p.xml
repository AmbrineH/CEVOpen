 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol was purchased from Engetec (Engenharia das Essências, Brazil). Toxicity assays for LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">95</sub> were performed at the 1.2 to 11.2 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> concentrations. Each filter paper disc (4.4 cm) was treated with 25 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol solution diluted in hexane in a Petri dish (6.5 cm in diameter) covered with organza and inserted into the base of glass flasks with 0.8 L capacity. Twenty unsexed and 20 sexed 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> adults (toxicity for males and females) were placed per flask to expose the insects to the fumigant activity of the compounds for 48 h. Each treatment had four replications. The control had 25 μL of pure hexane.
