MAIA Ltda., Brazil) and applied with a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) on filter paper disks with a 4.4 cm diameter placed in Petri dishes (6.5 cm in diameter). These plates were covered with organza-type fabric and placed in the base of the flasks. The pure solvent (hexane) was used as the control. The flasks were closed with a screw cap and sealed with parafilm (PM996, American, NV, USA), after the insects were distributed, to prevent oil vapor from leaking during the exposure period. The flasks were kept in a climatic chamber (Model 347 CD, Fanem, São Paulo, Brazil) at 27 ± 2 °C for 48 h. After this period, dead and living insects were counted. This procedure was also performed to evaluate the toxicity for 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> males and females with 10 adult insect couples per sample. The average number of dead insects was corrected to adjust their natural mortality and to calculate the efficacy of the essential oil and their respective components by Abbott’s formula
