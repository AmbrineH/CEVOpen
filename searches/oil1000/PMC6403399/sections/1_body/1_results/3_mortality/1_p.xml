 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> mortality from 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil was lower than that of its major component 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol in almost all concentrations except for 1.2, 1.6, and 11.2 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> air, which were similar to each other. The 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol was more efficient and caused higher 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> mortality in five of the eight concentrations tested (2.0 to 8.4 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of air) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). When analyzing the mortality of male and females of 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic>, it was noticed that the mortality of males at concentrations of 1.2, 1.6, and 8.4 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> air was similar between 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil and its major constituent. 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Bisabolol was more toxic to male at the other concentrations. On the other hand, the female mortality with 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol was similar in low (1.2 and 1.6 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of air) and high concentrations (5.6, 8.4, and 11.2 μL L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> air). 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Bisabolol were more toxic to female at the other concentrations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
