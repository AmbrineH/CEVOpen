 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil is rich in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-bisabolol and may be an alternative for the the management of 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> and other insect-pests in stored products. This oil has a fumigating insecticidal effect on adults reducing female oviposition, population growth rate, and development of this insect. The pure major constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil, the 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-Bisabolol, caused higher mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">C. maculatus</italic> males than 
 <italic class="italic">V. arborea</italic> essential oil with a mortality proportional to the concentration increase.
