<p class="p">For 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> images were processed using the ZEN software (2012, version 8.1.6.484, Zeiss). For channel alignment, a multi-colored bead slide was imaged using the same image acquisition settings. For STORM datasets localizations were detected and rendered using ThunderSTORM (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>) with default settings. Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) values were obtained using NanoJ-SQUIRREL after reconstruction of original data separated into two different stacks composed of odd or even images (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). NanoJ-SQUIRREL and ThunderSTORM are available in Fiji (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>). Statistical analysis (ordinary one-way ANOVA) was performed using Prism7 (GraphPad). Single-particle tracking data was analyzed using Trackmate (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>) in Fiji and MSDanalyzer (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>) in MATLAB (Mathworks). Images sequences for movies were bleach corrected (Fiji) and drift corrected (NanoJ).
