<p class="p">The NanoJ-Fluidics syringe pump array was installed on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope equipped with 405, 488, 561, and 642 nm lasers (50, 200, 200, and 160 mW at the optical fiber output). All steps after cell transfection were performed on the microscope, using NanoJ-Fluidics (

One day after splitting, cells were transfected with UtrCH-GFP and pCD4-TagRFP-T using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were imaged 1–2 days post transfection in culture medium using an Attofluor cell chamber (ThermoFisher), covered with the lid of a 35 mm dish (ThermoFisher), that was kept in place using black non-reflective aluminum tape (T205-1.0 AT205, THORLABs).
