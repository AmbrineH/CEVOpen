<p class="p">Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of live COS7 cells was performed at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope with 488 nm and 561 nm laser illumination at 0.5% of maximum output. A 100x TIRF objective (Plan-APOCHROMAT 100x/1.46 Oil, Zeiss) with additional 1.6x magnification was used to collect fluorescence onto an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor), yielding a pixel size of 100 nm. TIRF STORM imaging of anti-CD4 Alexa Fluor 568 in fixed cells was performed on the same system. 50,000 frames were acquired with 33 ms exposure and 561 nm laser illumination at maximum output power with 405 nm pumping when required (0.5–1% of maximum output when the blinking density was bellow 1 particle/μ m2). STORM imaging was performed in GLOX buffer (150 mM Tris, pH 8, 1% glycerol, 1% glucose, 10 mM NaCl, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 μg/ml catalase). Single-particle tracking was performed in medium at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope in TIRF mode by acquiring 250/500 frames at 45 FPS with 642 nm laser illumination at 5% of maximum output. Live fixation during phase contrast imaging was performed in medium at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope at 0.066 FPS with white LED illumination. For live-fixation, medium was replaced by either ice-cold or 37°C pre-warmed 4% PFA in PEM buffer.
