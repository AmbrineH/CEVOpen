<p class="p">The plasmid expressing the calponin homology domain of utrophin fused to GFP (GFP-UtrCH) was a gift from William Bement (

The plasmid expressing the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) fused to TagRFP-T was constructed for this study by fusing the CD4 (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>) genes by overlapping PCR, with a 10 amino-acid linker (GGGGSGGGGS) encoded in the overlap primers, and cloning the resulting fragment into pcDNA3.1+ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using HindIII and XhoI restriction enzymes (Promega). This plasmid is available from Addgene (

The plasmid expressing GPI-GFP was a kind gift from Ari Helenius. The plasmid expressing the artificial transmembrane probe was constructed based on Patrick Keller's L-YFP-GT46 (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>) by adding the beta-barrel fluorophore mHoneydew on the cytosolic side to increase size (
