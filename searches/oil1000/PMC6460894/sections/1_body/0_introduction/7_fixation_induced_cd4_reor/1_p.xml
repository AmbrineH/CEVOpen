<p class="p">We posited that fixation-induced changes in CD4 organization could be related to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). To determine if the actin cytoskeleton was affected we compared the actin organization in the cells pre- and post-fixation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton at 23 and 4°C when compared with fixation at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref>). Independent of the fixation condition the post-fixation actin organization is different from the live-cell actin organization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref> yellow arrowheads). With the decrease in fixation temperature there is a step-wise decrease in the fidelity of the fixed-cell actin structure in relation to the one observed in live-cells. At lower fixation temperatures, actin filaments disappear and there are gaps in the actin structure, possibly related to cell detachment from the substrate or actin cytoskeleton disruption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref> red arrowheads). These artifacts are less prevalent in cells fixed under conditions that preserve the actin cytoskeleton structure.
