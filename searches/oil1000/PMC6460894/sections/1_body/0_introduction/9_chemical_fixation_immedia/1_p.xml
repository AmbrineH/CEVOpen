<p class="p">We determined how long cellular processes such as the motion of intracellular vesicles or lamellipodia persist during chemical fixation with PFA and whether this process was temperature dependent. Live COS7 cells were imaged in phase-contrast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>). Upon exchange of the medium with 4% PFA pre-warmed to 37°C all cellular motion stopped immediately as determined by correlating images with the previous frame for the entire field of view (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref>) or selected regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figures 5C,D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Movies 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">2</xref>). The plateaus in correlations pre- and post PFA addition correspond to cellular motion and noise during imaging. Chemical fixation with ice-cold 4% PFA inhibited cellular motion equally fast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figures 5E</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">G</xref>). The increased fluctuations in correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figures 5F,G</xref>) were caused by a shift in the focal plane, also observed in the image sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Movies 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">4</xref>).
