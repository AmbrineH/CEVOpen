<p class="p">The increased resolution and detailed analytic information provided by SMLM requires rigorous scrutiny of collected data (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). The succession of steps from the native organization of a receptor in the plasma membrane to the final super-resolution image can be significantly influenced by artifacts, particularly if imaging requires chemical fixation (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Ideally, chemical fixation preserves the macroscopic structure of the sample as well as the native nanoscale organization of target proteins. However, true preservation at the subcellular level is not trivial, as known from electron microscopy studies (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Furthermore, chemical fixation does not immediately immobilize membrane-associated proteins (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Thus, given the increase in resolution afforded by super-resolution microscopy, the effect of fixation has been the focus of several recent studies (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Importantly, there are multiple chemical fixation methods, differing by the fixative used (e.g., paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, glyoxal or methanol), the buffer composition (e.g., phosphate buffered saline, cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer or PIPES-EGTA-magnesium buffer), and physical conditions (temperature and duration) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). There is, at this stage, no standardized sample preparation protocol to study membrane protein organization. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no correlative study to understand how, in the same cells, fixation-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton may affect membrane protein organization.
