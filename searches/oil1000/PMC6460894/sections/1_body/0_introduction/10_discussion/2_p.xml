<p class="p">We cannot exclude that membrane disruption and reorganization (such as membrane permeabilization or steep temperature mismatches between live-cell and fixation buffers, respectively) also plays a role in exacerbating the differences we observe. The importance of membrane composition and organization for surface protein distribution is well-known (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). Nonetheless, an indirect actin-related effect cannot be disregarded. The link between membrane composition and actin regulation is also recognized (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). For example, it is known that the pool of actin monomers is modulated by phosphoinositides (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>), or that alterations in the levels of cholesterol can change the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion properties (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). However, our objective is to inform the reader on the possible outcomes that common sample preparation approaches (as multi-target IF or the use of intracellular epitopes, or different fixation temperatures) may have. If possible, cell membrane permeabilization and steep temperature changes should be avoided for their effect on the sample. Additionally, thermal drift affecting the optical system may reduce image quality or introduce artifacts.
