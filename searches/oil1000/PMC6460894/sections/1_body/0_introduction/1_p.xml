<p class="p">Super-resolution microscopy is a fundamental tool for exploring and understanding nanoscale biological assemblies. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques in particular, such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>), are the optical imaging gold standards to study membrane protein organization (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). SMLM techniques provide high spatial resolution (~ 20 nm) and allow for statistical, nonbiased analysis of membrane protein nanoscale organizations (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). The organization of receptors into micro- and nanoclusters at the plasma membrane is a common feature and an important regulatory mechanism for cell signaling and activation (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Thus, analyzing the nanoscale level organization of these molecules is critical to understand basic regulation of cellular signaling but also to understand the function of these proteins in disease. For example, CD4 plays an important role in immune cell activation through its ability to enhance T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling by binding to the antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Besides its importance in immune signaling, CD4 is also the primary cellular receptor for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). The importance of super-resolution in the study of membrane receptor organization and function cannot be overstated. A recent example is the characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics and stoichiometry of the interactions between CD4 (and co-receptors) and HIV-1 in the context of viral entry, impossible to achieve without molecular imaging approaches (
