<p class="p">Here, we analyze how the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton changes with different chemical fixation protocols and how these changes correlate with the membrane organization of the membrane receptor CD4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). We show that conditions that have detrimental effects on cytoskeleton organization correlate with changes in the membrane organization of CD4. We suggest that careful sample preparation and handling during all steps leading to the final image is essential for all scientists.
