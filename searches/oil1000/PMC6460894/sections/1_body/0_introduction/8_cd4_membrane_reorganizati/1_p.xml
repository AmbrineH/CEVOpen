<p class="p">The difference in membrane receptor organization could be the result of the dependence of fixation efficiency on temperature. Employing our live-to-fix approach, we sought to determine how quickly the addition of PFA-containing PEM buffer immobilizes membrane associated proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). An artificial transmembrane protein with a ~30 kDa cytosolic and extracellular domain (mHoneydew and YFP, respectively) was expressed in COS7 cells and individual proteins tracked with uPAINT (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>), i.e., by adding low concentration (~20 pMol) of Atto647N labeled anti-GFP nanobodies (Chromotek) to the medium (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s (mean). Exchanging the cell culture medium with 37°C pre-warmed 4% PFA in PEM immediately reduced the diffusion speed of transmembrane proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel, arrow) and, after 10 min fixation, 97% of proteins were immobilized (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>). Addition of cold (4°C) 4% PFA in PEM had similar effects on measured diffusion coefficients and mobility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we tested if the same was true for a GPI-anchored protein that lacks any cytosolic domain that might interact directly with the cytoskeleton. GPI-anchored GFP was tracked via anti-GFP nanobodies. Addition of warm (37°C) or cold (4°C) 4% PFA in PEM buffer to live cells reduced the mobility of tracked individual particles without immobilizing them completely (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4D</xref>, middle panel, arrow). In contrast to the transmembrane probe, only some particles were immobilized after fixation for 10 min. The reduction of diffusion coefficients as measured by velocity or mean square displacement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4E</xref>, left and middle panel) was not significantly different based on temperature. The mobile fraction was reduced to 36 and 32% (mean) after warm and cold fixation, respectively. Thus, changes in diffusive behavior were more dependent on the type of membrane protein tracked, rather than the fixation conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figures 4C,E</xref>), which is in agreement with previous publications (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). However, even with only 4% PFA and without any cross-linking fixatives, we observed a rapid immobilization of transmembrane proteins that would prevent artificial clustering by subsequent antibody labeling approaches. Comparison of trajectories during the 10 s before and after addition of the chemical fixative showed an immediate shift of the histogram of diffusion coefficients determined via MSD toward lower values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4F</xref>). While there was no striking difference between pre-warmed and ice-cold fixative, we observed a trend toward a faster decrease in mobility at the higher temperature.
