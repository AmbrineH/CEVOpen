 <p> Schematics of the experimental workflow to correlate actin morphology with CD4 membrane organization. We analyse on the same cells how the actin cytoskeleton morphology changes with different chemical fixation protocols and how this correlates with the membrane organization and mobility of CD4. Cortical actin (white and gray circles); arrows represent protein mobility; GPI anchored GFP (GFP-GPI); artificial transmembrane protein with cytosolic and extracellular domains (mHoneydew and YFP, respectively - TM); CD4 fused to TagRFP-T (CD4-RFP). </p>
