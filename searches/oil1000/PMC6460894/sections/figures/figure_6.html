 <p> Model of changes induced by chemical fixation on membrane architecture. Optimized fixation with PFA preserves the cortical actin cytoskeleton structure in a state resembling live imaging and rapidly stops diffusion of transmembrane proteins. Suboptimal fixation conditions induce deformations of membrane and cytoskeleton and could thereby introduce artifacts. While the mobility of membrane probes is reduced similarly to optimized chemical fixation the overall organization could be altered due to interruptions of the cytoskeleton. GPI anchored GFP (GFP-GPI); artificial transmembrane protein with cytosolic and extracellular domains (mHoneydew and YFP, respectively - TM); CD4 fused to TagRFP-T (CD4-RFP). </p>
