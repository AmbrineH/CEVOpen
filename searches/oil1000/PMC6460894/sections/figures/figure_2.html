 <p> Effect of suboptimal fixation conditions on actin and CD4 organization. (A) NanoJ-Fluidics protocol to perform the live-to-fixed cell correlation under different suboptimal fixation conditions. (B) Epifluorescence and SIM imaging of COS7 cell expressing Utr(CH)-GFP and CD4-TagRFP-T live (Live) and fixed (Fixed) with 4% PFA in PBS at 23°C and corresponding NanoJ-SQUIRREL error maps (Error map). (C) same as in (B) but fixation was performed with 4% PFA in PEM at 4°C. (D) same as in (B) but fixation was performed with 4% PFA in PEM at 37°C. Scale bars are 10 μm. </p>
