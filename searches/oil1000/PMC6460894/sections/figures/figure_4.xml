  <p class="p">Single-particle tracking of membrane probes during live fixation. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Experimental workflow for live and fixed cell single-particle tracking. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Trajectories of a transmembrane probe with cytosolic and extracellular domains, tracked via fluorescently-labeled nanobodies on live cells (left). Middle panel show a typical trajectory with Brownian motion at the start (arrowhead) and immobilization upon addition of 4% PFA in PEM buffer (arrow). All transmembrane proteins appear immobilized in fixed cells. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Quantification of diffusion coefficient D based on velocity (left), mean-square displacement (middle) and percentage of mobile (D&gt;0.05μm
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s) particles (right). No significant difference between chemical fixation at 4 or 37°C was observed. 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> Trajectories of GPI-anchored probe tracked via fluorescently labelled nanobodies on live cells (left). Middle panel show a typical trajectory with Brownian motion at the start (arrowhead) and reduced mobility upon addition of 4% PFA in PEM buffer (arrow). Some GPI-anchored proteins are immobilized in fixed cells while a fraction remains mobile. 
   <bold class="bold">(E)</bold> Quantification of diffusion coefficient D based on velocity (left), mean-square displacement (middle) and percentage of mobile (D&gt;0.05μm
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s) particles (right). 
   <bold class="bold">(F)</bold> No significant difference between chemical fixation at 4 or 37°C was observed despite a trend toward faster fixation at warmer temperatures. Scale bars are 5 μm (left, right) and 500 nm (middle panels).
