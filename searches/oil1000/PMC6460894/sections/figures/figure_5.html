 <p> Cellular motion is immediately stopped by chemical fixation with PFA (A) Live COS7 cell imaged with phase contrast microscopy. (B) Image correlation between subsequent frames indicates an immediate stop of cellular processes at t = 0 min when the medium was replaced with warm 4% PFA. (C) Correlations for regions of interest with vesicles (purple) or lamellipodia (green). (D) Time-lapse of images before and after addition of the chemical fixative. Cellular features become static within 30 s. (E) Live COS7 cell imaged with phase contrast microscopy. (F) Image correlation between subsequent frames indicates an immediate stop of cellular processes at t = 0 min when the medium was replaced with cold 4% PFA. (G) Correlations for regions of interest with vesicles (purple) or lamellipodia (green). (H) Time-lapse of images before and after addtion of the chemical fixative. Cellular features become static within 30 s. Scale bars are 10 μm (A,E) and 3 μm (D,H). </p>
