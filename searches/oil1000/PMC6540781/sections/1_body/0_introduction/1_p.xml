The author highlighted two types of mouthwashes with consistent antiplaque and anti-gingivitis effects: chlorhexidine gluconate and mouthwash containing essential oils, such as menthol (0.042%), thymol (0.064%), methyl salicylate (0.060%) and eucalyptol (0.092%), which are commercially available. Despite the potent bactericidal action of chlorhexidine, there have been many reported side effects, mainly when used for long periods, such as taste alteration, supragingival calculus formation, extrinsic tooth staining and desquamation of oral mucosa (
