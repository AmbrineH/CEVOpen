<p class="p">A recently made commercially available mouthwash includes, in addition to essential oils, a combination of other natural products such as 
 <italic class="italic">Propolis</italic> resin extract, 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago lanceolata, Salvia officinalis</italic> leaves extract. It contains no artificial or chemically synthesized ingredients and is therefore entirely natural. There exists no randomized controlled trial that supports the safety and effectiveness of its specific formulation.
