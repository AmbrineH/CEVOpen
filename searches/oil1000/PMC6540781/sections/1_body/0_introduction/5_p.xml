<p class="p">The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and anti-inflammatory effect of the latter all-natural, commercially available polyherbal mouthwash in patients with periodontitis, by comparing it with a placebo mouthwash, after 3 months of use. This was accomplished by measuring the differences, between the two groups, in the following clinical outcomes: full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), full mouth plaque score (FMPS), probing depth (PD) level ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm (
