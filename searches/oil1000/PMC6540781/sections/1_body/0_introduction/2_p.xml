<p class="p">The increasingly widespread use of the mouthwashes for long periods has led research into the direction of finding effective and safe products, with a greater focus on herbal drugs. Plant extracts can be used as an alternative to chlorhexidine digluconate as their polyphenols compounds exhibit antimicrobial effects. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, out of a total of 9 articles, investigated the efficacy of daily rinsing with a green tea-based herbal mouthwash in terms of plaque index (PI) and/or gingival index (

They demonstrated that the herbal mouthwash was not significantly different compared to the standard chlorhexidine-based mouthwashes in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation. Three main groups of plant polyphenols (stilbenes, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins) were found to exhibit activity against caries, periodontitis and candidiasis in pre-clinical studies, however, there was a lack of strong evidence, regarding randomized clinical trials (
