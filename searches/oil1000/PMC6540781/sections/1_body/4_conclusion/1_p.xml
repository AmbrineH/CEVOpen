<p class="p">Common oral diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis are based on microorganisms; herbal mouthwashes have an integral role in controlling the oral microbiota, and therefore are a useful adjunct in preventing periodontal disease. The use of the polyherbal mouthwash for 3 months significantly reduces inflammation (FMBS) and plaque accumulation (FMPS), showing a beneficial effect in patients with moderate or severe periodontitis. The most important finding is that, in bleeding and plaque score, participants using the all-natural polyherbal mouthwash showed significant improvement compared with the control. Noteworthy is that no adverse events or side effects were reported or observed in both groups at each time period. Further studies, in the near future, will be planned to compare it with the chlorhexidine mouthwash or other natural mouthwashes with proven efficacy.</p>
