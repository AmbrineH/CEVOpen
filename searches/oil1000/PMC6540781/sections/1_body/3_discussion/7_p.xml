<p class="p">The present single blind randomized controlled study shows a significant PI reduction in the TG and CG group. The considerable improvement of plaque control in both groups could be attributed to the Hawthorne effect; the subjects modified their oral hygiene routine due to the awareness of being observed (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McCarney et al., 2007</xref>). However, FMPS has a significant difference between the two groups (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.005), being significantly decreased in the TG. Our results are in agreement with other studies which investigated the anti-plaque and antigingivitis effects of a commercially available mouthwash containing essential oils with proven efficacy in individuals with and without periodontal disease (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cortelli et al., 2009</xref>). However, although some herbal mouthwash showed side effects, mainly a mild mouth burning sensation (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This study highlights the superior efficacy of the tested polyherbal mouthwash, over an essential oil mouthwash, as an agent without side effects, having considerable properties in controlling oral inflammation and microbiota. At this regard, a very recent comparative 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study demonstrated that chlorhexidine-based mouthwashes are still the most effective in regulating microbial homeostasis (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ardizzoni et al., 2018</xref>). However, chlorhexidine has several side effects that must be pondered when prescribing mouthwashes containing this molecule. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, the need to develop alternative, innocuous but effective solutions are highly motivated. Therefore, despite the limitation that the polyherbal mouthwash was not compared to the “gold standard” chlorhexidine mouthwash and was only compared to a placebo, its all-natural ingredients have to be kept in great attention, since the preliminary evidence of effectiveness and safety is very promising.
