<p class="p">A recent study investigated whether the adjunctive use of a mouthwash containing three natural essential oils (
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon flexuosus</italic> oil, 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus Zygis</italic> oil, 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) following sub-gingival debridement and scaling and root planning (SRP) could improve the clinical results regarding changes of the clinical parameters of PD, CAL and bleeding on probing (BoP) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Azad et al., 2016</xref>). Significant improvements of AL, PD, and BoP occurred in both groups after 3 months (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001); PD and BoP being significantly lower in the TG. In accordance with Azad study, our trial shows a significant improvement of PD (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) and CAL (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in both groups, which can be explained because each subject in both groups had a preliminary scale and polishing at T0. Contrarily, no difference in PD and CAL between the two groups was revealed. This finding may be explained by the fact that PD reduction and gain in CAL are the expected result of mechanical instrumentation alone (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haffajee et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, mouthwashes do not seem crucial for these latter clinical outcomes. In support of our findings, another 3-month double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial studying clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouthwash in periodontal patients did not demonstrate any significant differences in full-mouth PD and full-mouth CAL between the test and placebo group (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cosyn et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, plaque and bleeding indexes showed a significant reduction over time (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029); but, contrary to our data, there were no statically significant differences between the two groups (
