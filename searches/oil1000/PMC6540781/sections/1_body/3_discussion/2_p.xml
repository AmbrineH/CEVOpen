<p class="p">The effectiveness of other herbal mouthwashes compared to a placebo mouthwash in patients with gingival or periodontal disease has been shown. Despite this, the topic is still controversial, due to some studies not using standardized methodology or having very short follow-ups. The effectiveness of three herbal extracts (
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus communis, Urtica dioica, Achillea millefolium</italic> on plaque and gingivitis) was studied by comparing it to a placebo mouthwash for 3 months, finding no beneficial effects (
