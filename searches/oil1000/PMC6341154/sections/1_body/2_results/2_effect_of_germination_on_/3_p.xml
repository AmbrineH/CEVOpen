 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) increase from days 0 to 3 of germination, and due to the restrictions in experimental conditions, Cys was not detected in this study. Additionally, Tyr firstly increased and then decreased during the germination, and reached the highest value at Day 2. Generally speaking, total amino acid (TAA), total essential amino acid (EAA), and no essential amino acid (NEAA) tended to be on the rise.
