<p class="p">The secondary structure and chemical composition of Gsp were changed by germination. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, the soluble protein content of Gsp in 0, 1, 2, and 3 days germination was 0.22, 0.27, 0.29, and 0.30 mg/g, respectively, showing that germination could significantly increase the protein content of soybean. SH content was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) lower at 1d than that in 0d, as well as S‐S content. As the continuation of germination, DH and water absorption capacity of Gsp increased gradually, while oil absorption capacity appeared declined. For the solubility of Gsp in different pH values, the lowest solubility was at pH 7.0, and the highest solubility was at pH 3.0.
