 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, a strong S‐phase arrest in HL‐7702 cells was been found after BaP treatment. Compared with BaP group, the treatment with BaP (63 mg/L) plus Gsp (25 mg/L) led to a significant (

Meanwhile, cell population slight accumulation was observed on the G0/G1 phase in the tested cell lines. The results suggest that Gsp weakened cell cycle arrest ability of BaP on HL7702 cells.
