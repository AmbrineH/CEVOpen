 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the small molecular weight proteins in control group were slightly lighter than that in the 3‐d germinated samples. During germination, the soybean proteins were digested into the smaller molecules proteins which distributed in 34–43, 43–55, and 72–95 kD.
