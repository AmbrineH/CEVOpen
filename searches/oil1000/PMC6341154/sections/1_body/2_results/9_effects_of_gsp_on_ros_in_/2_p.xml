<p class="p">Accumulating evidence indicates that intracellular ROS can trigger apoptosis, we next determined whether Gsp protected HL‐7702 cell from BaP‐induced apoptosis through decreasing the generation of ROS. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>, cells exposed to BaP displayed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity signals, compared with control group. Gsp markedly inhibited the generation of intracellular ROS induced by BaP, indicating that Gsp could inhibit apoptosis induced by BaP through decreasing intracellular ROS levels.
