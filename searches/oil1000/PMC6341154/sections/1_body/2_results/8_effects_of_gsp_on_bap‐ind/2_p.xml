<p class="p">As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>, BaP resulted in about 4.47% of the cells going into early apoptotic phase, and 45.49% of cells was going into late apoptotic phase. However, both the early and late apoptotic cells were significantly decreased by Gsp treatment. Taken together, these results revealed that the pretreatment with Gsp could protect HL‐7702 cell from BaP‐induced apoptosis.
