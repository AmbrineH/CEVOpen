<p class="p">The functionality properties (EAI and FC) of protein are very important for the practical performance as emulsifying agents. Emulsifier is used to stabilize the emulsion depends on the oil–water interfacial area, and the emulsifying capacity also depends on the size of the droplets during agitation (Ritzoulis et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In food systems, foams are often very complex, including several phases such as a mixture of gases, subdivided solids, subdivided liquids, multicomponent solutions of water, polymers, and surfactants (Richert,
