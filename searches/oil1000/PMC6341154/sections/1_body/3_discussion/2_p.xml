<p class="p">Soybean has various biological functions; however, the effects of germination on the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, and cytoprotective properties of soy protein remain unclear. The present study found that germination could not only change secondary structure of soybean proteins, but also promote physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity. In addition, Gsp could effectively inhibit cell damage induced by BaP. Gsp percentage decreased slightly as the germination time goes on (Table
