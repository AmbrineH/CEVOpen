<p class="p">It has reported that germination can change the secondary structure of soybean proteins, and protein was digested into smaller molecules and reused for new protein synthesis for plant growth during germination (Chen &amp; Chang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Solubility and the degree of hydrolysis are one of the most important characteristics of proteins. Solubility decreases at pH around proteinʼs PI. Consistent with these previous studies, our results found that germination could significantly (

 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Amino acids are very rich in soybean. The present study observed that germination further improved the amino acids levels of soybean, except a conditionally essential amino acid Cys (Table
