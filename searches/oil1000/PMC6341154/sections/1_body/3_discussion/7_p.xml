<p class="p">BaP is universally acknowledged to be a cancerogen. It is widely presented in a large number of high‐temperature‐processed foods and leads to the severe organism injury. It is reported that plant flavonoids and polyphenols can prevent from BaP damage (Kasala et al.,

Our study found that Gsp could protect HL‐7702 cells from BaP through increasing cell viability, relieving cell cycle arrest, inhibiting apoptosis, and reducing ROS levels (Figure
