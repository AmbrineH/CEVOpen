<p class="p">The present study demonstrated the physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity of Gsp through examining sulfhydryl, disulfide bonds, amino acid composition, degree of hydrolysis, oil and water absorption capacity, emulsifiability, and foaming capacity, and assessing radical scavenging activity (DPPH, ABTS,

This study provided a fundamental basis for substantiating dietary of Gsp used for resistance to oxidation and hepatic injury.
