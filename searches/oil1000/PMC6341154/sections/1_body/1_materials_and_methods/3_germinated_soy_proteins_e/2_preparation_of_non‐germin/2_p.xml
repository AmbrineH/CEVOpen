<p class="p">The same batch of mature and full soybean grain which was germinated for 0, 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, and the corresponding length of soybean sprouts was 0, 0.5–1, 1–3, and 3–5 cm (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Soybean sprouts were dried at 40°C in the electricity heat drum wind drying oven to constant weight (about 10 hr; GZX‐9146 MBE, Shanghai Boxun Medical Biological Instrument Corp., Shanghai, China) and grounded into fine powder (60 mesh) by using an IKA
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> all basic mill (IKA Works Inc., Wilmington, USA) for 3 min. Then, the soybean flour obtained from the above method was used to protein extraction by the method of alkali extraction and acid precipitation (Robles‐Ramírez, Ramón‐Gallegos, Reyes‐Duarte, &amp; Mora‐Escobedo, 
 <xref rid="fsn3822-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Briefly, the soybean flour was defatted with hexane and suspended in distilled water (1:20), and pH was adjusted to 9.0 with 1 mol/L NaOH. The extraction was stirred for 45 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000
