<p class="p">Cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/ml. After 12 hr, cells were treated with different concentrations of Gsp (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 125 mg/L) or 63 mg/L BaP for 24 hr. Subsequently, 100 μl of 0.5% (w/v) MTT was added to each well and incubated for 4 hr. Then, removed MTT and added DMSO to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher, USA).
