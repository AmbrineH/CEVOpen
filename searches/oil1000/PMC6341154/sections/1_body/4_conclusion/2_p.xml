<p class="p">The present work demonstrated that germination could digest soybean proteins into the smaller molecules and enhance functionalityÂ properties and antioxidant activity of soy proteins. Additionally, Gsp could protect cells from damage induced by BaP through increasing cell viability, inhibiting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and reducing ROS levels, showing that Gsp could be used for resistance to oxidation and hepatic injury, as a functional foods and dietary supplements. However, we only primarily assessed the cytoprotective properties of Gsp in this paper, the possible underlying mechanisms required to research in further studies.</p>
