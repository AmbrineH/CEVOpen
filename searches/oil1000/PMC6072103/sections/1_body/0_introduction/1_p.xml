<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex (Bcc) is a group of genetically distinct but phenotypically very similar bacteria that were originally isolated as plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. During the late 1980s Bcc bacteria emerged as an important cause of opportunistic or nosocomial infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Bcc organisms are particularly virulent pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis, a rapid decline in lung function and reduced median survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. A significant minority of CF patients become infected with Bcc bacteria at some point, for example a recent study at an Irish adult cystic fibrosis centre suggested a prevalence of around 6% and mortality caused by the most virulent species (

 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic>) of 55% [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Cross-infection with the Bcc between CF patients is important but it is believed that most infections have an environmental origin [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]; all 20 species of the complex can be isolated, in varying frequencies, from CF or non-CF patient sputum and at least 17 of these species can also be isolated from the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The pathogenic potential of the complex varies between species with
