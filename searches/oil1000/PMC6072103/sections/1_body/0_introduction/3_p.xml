<p class="p">This study builds on current knowledge through a novel sequence of four components: characterisation of a collection of clinical isolates of the Bcc in terms of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antibiotic susceptibility; assessment of antimicrobial activity of a range of essential oils against these Bcc isolates; assessment of anti-Bcc antimicrobial activity of essential oil components; and characterisation of the mechanism of action of essential oil components against the Bcc.</p>
