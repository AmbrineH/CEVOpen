<p class="p">If the bacterial membrane is compromised, release of cytoplasmic constituents of the cell such as nucleic acids occurs. Through the detection of absorbance at 260 nm, the amount of nucleic acid content released from the cytoplasm can be measured giving an indication of loss of membrane integrity [

In the case of geraniol, maximum leakage occurred in the first 60 min, whereas in the case of tepinen-4-ol, gradual release occurred over a period of 180 min and then a rapid increase by 240 min. The cell concentration was 3.2Ã—10
