<p class="p">Bactericidal activity for most antibiotics depends on the bacterial growth phase, often requiring ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Whether this is true for the EO components geraniol and terpinen-4-ol, however, is unknown. The kill-rate for cells in two different growth phases was therefore studied: exponential and stationary phase populations of

 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic> strain LMG 16656 were challenged. Compared with the killing curves observed for stationary phase cultures treated with terpinen-4-ol (0.25%), log phase cultures are killed slightly more swiftly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201835.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Approximately 180 min in contact with terpinen-4-ol was required to kill all log phase cells, whereas 240 min was required to completely eradicate 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic> in the stationary phase. In the case of geraniol (0.5%) treatment, complete kill was observed after 180 min for both growth phases (

 <sub class="sub">10</sub> reduction, whereas log phase cultures at the same time points reduced to 2 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and 3 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, respectively.
