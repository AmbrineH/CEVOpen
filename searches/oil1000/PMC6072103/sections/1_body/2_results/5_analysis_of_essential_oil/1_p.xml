The principal components for each oil were identified as follows: marjoram, eucalyptol; tea tree, terpinen-4-ol; rosewood, linalool; lemongrass, Î±-citral. Similarity index (SI) and reverse similarity index (RSI) mass spectral match factors for all the compounds except dihydrolinalool were above 800, allowing good identification of compounds.
