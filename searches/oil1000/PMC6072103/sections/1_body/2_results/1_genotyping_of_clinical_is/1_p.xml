<p class="p">MLST data were obtained for the 51 clinical strains and used to assign them to 11 different species groups and 18 sequence types (STs, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). There were no novel Bcc ST types when compared with existing MLST data (PubMLST,

The STs identified in the collection were either previously reported from CF patients (STs: 3, 15, 25, 31, 40, 72, 97, 116, 125, 206, 240, 267, 319) or from the environment (3, 88, 125, 154, 165, 290, 291). Three STs (15, 116, 206) identified in the collection were also previously reported from UK CF patients. In the PubMLST data set, ST 88 was reported only from the UK environment, but the present study reported isolation from a CF patient. ST40 was reported from a non-CF patient from the UK and from CF patients in other countries. Average nucleotide identity analysis of the housekeeping genes used in MLST indicated that all strains provisionally identified as “other species” were most similar (greater than 96% ANI) to
