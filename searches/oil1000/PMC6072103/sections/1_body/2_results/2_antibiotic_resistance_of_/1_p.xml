<p class="p">The library of Bcc clinical isolates was tested for resistance to a range of commonly used antibiotics: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tetracycline, trimethoprim and tobramycin. MICs were obtained for each antibiotic and each strain (

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>. Bcc isolates are commonly multiply antibiotic resistant and intrinsically resistant to colistin. All 51 of our isolates were resistant to tobramycin and colistin, while a majority were resistant to all other antibiotics tested except meropenem (22% of isolates resistant). Ceftazidime and aztreonam also had some activity against the Bcc strains: 43% and 33% of strains were susceptible, respectively. Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were only active, to an intermediate or susceptible levels respectively, against single (and different) ST206 strains. Although trimethoprim was active against only two strains, an intermediate level of activity was shown on nineteen strains. Meropenem was active against the largest number of strains compared to other antibiotics tested. The mean level of resistance (i.e. the proportion of the 8 antibiotics tested that strains were resistant to) was 75% ± 17 SD. Eight strains belonging to
