<p class="p">A range of EO components, present in the bacteriocidal oils, was tested against the Bcc test panel: alloaromadendrene (-), camphene, camphor (R), caryophyllene(-)(trans), 1,8-cineole, citral, geraniol, geranyl acetate, ledene(+), limonene (+) (R), linalool (±), linalyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, myrcene, α-pinene(-), β-pinene(-), p-cymene, sabienene hydrate, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol, terpinyl acetate (±), verbeneol. Only two of the essential oil components tested at concentrations of 8% (v/v) or less showed any activity against the investigated strains: terpinen-4-ol, which is the main water soluble component of tea tree oil and also present in marjoram oil ([

Both terpinen-4-ol and geraniol showed activity against all the strains tested (
