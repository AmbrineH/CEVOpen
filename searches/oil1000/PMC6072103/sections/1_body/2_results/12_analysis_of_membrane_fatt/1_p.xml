<p class="p">Alteration of membrane fatty acid profiles of various Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of EOCs have previously been reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. We therefore examined the effect of terpinen-4-ol and geraniol on

 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic> membrane fatty acid profiles. GC FAME analysis of membrane fatty acids showed clear peaks corresponding to methyl esters of C14:1 (myristoleic), C16:1 (palmitoleic), C16:0 (palmitic), C17:1, C18:0 (stearic) and C18:1n9c (oleic) acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201835.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref>). Clear differences in most of these were observed in the chromatograms obtained for samples treated with terpinen-4-ol or geraniol, specifically C14:1 (myristoleic), C16:1 (palmitoleic), C17:1, C18:0 (stearic) and C18:1n9c (oleic) acids. In each peak area was substantially reduced in either the sample treated with terpinen-4-ol or geraniol or in both treatments.
