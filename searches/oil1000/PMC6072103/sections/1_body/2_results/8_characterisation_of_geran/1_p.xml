<p class="p">Several outer membrane permeabilizers such as EDTA have been shown to improve the susceptibility of the resistant pathogen

The MIC of EDTA against Bcc members was 20 mM and there was no difference in the growth of the Bcc in the presence of 5 mM or 10 mM EDTA. However, while 5 mM EDTA alone had no apparent antimicrobial effect, incorporation of EDTA into susceptibility studies using the broth dilution method reduced the concentration of terpinen-4-ol and geraniol required to kill the Bcc by two-fold, and so these lower concentrations (0.125% and 0.25%, respectively) were used in time kill studies with EDTA (Figs

When terpinen-4-ol and geraniol alone were used, 4 h and 3 h, respectively were required for the cell count to fall below the detection level.
