<p class="p">Fifteen EOs had some activity against the tested strains on ISA. To examine the possibility of medium-specific effects all EOs were also tested on TSA and only one positive effect on ISA that was not reproduced on TSA was noted, for geranium EO against a clinical strain. In general more activity was seen on TSA than on ISA, i.e. additional positives against clinical isolates were seen for TSA: 6 for juniper, 2 for geranium, 5 for rosemary. Therefore results presented here (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>) are for ISA as these are more likely to be robust / medium independent. Of the fifteen EOs that showed activity, six were most active against Bcc members, showing activity on all strains tested: lavender, lemongrass, marjoram, peppermint, tea tree and rosewood (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>). Fennel, geranium, juniper and rosemary were active against some but not all strains. Pine, black pepper, rosemary, sweet orange, camomile, cedarwood, bergamot, ylang ylang and frankincenseâ€”were ineffective against all Bcc members tested. The six most active EOs were selected for further study (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>). As with antibiotics, activity of these EOs was highly strain-specific and no consistent patterns of genomovar / species level differences were observed.
