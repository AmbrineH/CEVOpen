<p class="p">Fifty-one strains of clinical origin and six strains from the Bcc reference panel were tested for susceptibility to the six most active EOs chosen from the disc diffusion assay (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>). MICs and MBCs are summarised in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 10</xref> and listed for each strain in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201835.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>. The MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (minimum concentration required to inhibit half of strains tested) for lemongrass and rosewood oils was 0.5% (5 mg / ml), indicating Bcc members were highly susceptible to these oils. Marjoram, lavender, tea tree and peppermint had a similar but lower efficiency (2%; 20 mg /ml) against 50% of the Bcc strains. The concentration required to inhibit 90% of the strains tested (MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>) ranged from 1% (10 mg /ml; lemongrass and rosewood) to 4% (40 mg / ml; marjoram). For all EOs except lavender and peppermint, mean MBC, MBC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and MBC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> values were less than 4x higher than the corresponding MIC values and therefore these oils can be defined as bacteriocidal rather than bacteriostatic [
