<p class="p">As the internal environment of bacteria is rich in potassium ions, leakage of this ion from cells can be used to monitor membrane damage. The addition of either terpinen-4-ol or geraniol caused a significant increase in potassium leakage from 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> cells as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201835.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>. Leakage caused by geraniol was rapid, mostly occurring in the first 30 min after addition. Leakage caused by terpinen-4-ol was slower but reached approximately the same level by 240 min. There was no obvious difference between the cells suspended in water and water with Tween80 with regard to the potassium release, indicating that the low concentration of Tween80 used as an emulsifying agent for the EOs and EOCs did not significantly damage cell membranes.
