<p class="p">Of the 15 EOs tested, the following six were found to most effective against the Bcc: lavender, lemongrass, marjoram, peppermint, tea tree and rosewood. Of these six, lemongrass and rosewood oils were found to have the highest levels of activity with MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> values of 0.5% and 1.0% respectively. Comparison of MIC and MBC values suggested that all of the 6 oils with significant activity against the Bcc are bacteriocidal in action. A previous agar dilution assay of 47 EOs against a range of Gram-negative rods found these six EOs all to be highly active antimicrobials, with MICs below 2%, but only lemongrass was one of the 3 oils active against

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A previous assessment of the effects of essential oils on the Bcc tested three of the same oils as the current study and found that tea tree oil was highly effective against 5 out of 18 strains tested; while an EO from a hybrid lavender related to 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula augustifola</italic> was only weakly effective [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The same study also found that rosemary oil was one of the most potent anti-Bcc EOs (against 10/18 strains), though we found it to be only moderately effective, perhaps indicating the importance of batch-to-batch variation.
