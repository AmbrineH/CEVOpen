<p class="p">One important caveat about the potential use of EOs as therapeutic drugs is the difficulty in ensuring batch-to-batch control of the component chemicals (EOCs) and their relative concentrations. It may make more sense from this point of view to focus on selected defined EOCs and their potential for anti-Bcc activity, although such an approach may of course lose the advantage of potential antimicrobial synergies between two or more EOCs found in a single oil (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]). We have examined a range of EOCs in this study and report that only 2 of them, the alcohols terpinen-4-ol and geraniol, had significant anti-Bcc activity. It is notable when comparing the activities of geraniol and linalool or terpinen-4-ol and Î±-terpineol, two pairs of highly similar alcohols, that the position of the hydroxyl group seems to be important in determining activity, as previously noted [
