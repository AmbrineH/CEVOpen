<p class="p">The 51 Bcc clinical isolates were all typed by MLST to species level and grouped into 18 STs. No novel STs were reported and those isolates provisionally described as ‘other Bcc’ in the collection were most similar to 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic>. As expected, STs previously identified as environmental isolates, either within or outside the UK, were identified as causing infection in UK CF patients. This strain collection was felt to be representative of the diversity of strains that might be encountered in patients with very severe CF-related lung disease in the UK during the collection period.
