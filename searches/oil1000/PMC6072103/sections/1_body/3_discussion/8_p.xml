<p class="p">This study began by confirming widespread and heterogenous multidrug resistance in a Bcc clinical isolate collection. Assessment of antimicrobial activity of a range of EOs and EOCs against these Bcc isolates identified six EOs with significant activity and demonstrated that terpinen-4-ol and geraniol were effective anti-Bcc agents. Detailed mechanistic studies suggest that these 2 EOCs are effective against non-growing cells in an efflux dependent manner and that the observed anti-Bcc activity is based on membrane disruption. Whether or not any of these EOs or EOCs ultimately prove useful as therapeutic drugs, for example to treat Bcc infections in CF patients, will depend on a number of factors including pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Geraniol would generally seem to be of very low toxicity and its use in cosmetic fragrances already results in substantial human exposure [
