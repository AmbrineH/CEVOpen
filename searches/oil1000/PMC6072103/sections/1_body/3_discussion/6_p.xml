<p class="p">As with other Gram negative pathogens, efflux pumps play an important role in multi-drug-resistance in Bcc bacteria and in resistance to antimicrobial chemicals more widely [

The time-kill experiments reported here suggest that energy-dependent efflux mechanisms are involved in determining the accumulation of terpinen-4-ol or geraniol inside Bcc cells and therefore that it may be possible to increase the anti-Bcc activity of these EOCs using an efflux inhibition strategy.
