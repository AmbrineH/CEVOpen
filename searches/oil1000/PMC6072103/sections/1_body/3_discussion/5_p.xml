 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. We found that geraniol and terpinen-4-ol were effective against both stationary phase and log phase cultures, although at least in the case of terpinen-4-ol log phase cells were slightly more susceptible. There was no noticeable difference in the decline of mid-exponential phase cells of the Bcc upon challenge with terpinen-4-ol (
