<p class="p">Many antimicrobial compounds that act on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, including chlorhexidine Tea Tree oil and Lemongrass oil, induce the loss of 260 nm-absorbing materials assumed to be nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Potassium leakage is also a useful indicator of membrane damage as it leaks out of the cells very rapidly, and can be easily detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The results from both of these assays strongly suggest that geraniol and terpinen-4-ol are membrane-disrupters. In agreement with this, changes in the membrane fatty acid composition were readily apparent by GC analysisâ€“specifically in the following fatty acids C14:1 (myristoleic), C16:1 (palmitoleic), C17:1, C18:0 (stearic) and C18:1n9c (oleic).
