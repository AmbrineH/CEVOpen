 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] were calculated by ranking MICs for all 57 clinical and reference strains in ascending order. The MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was taken as the median value. The MIC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> was the value of the 51
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> (0.9 x 57) in the list, and represented the concentration of antibiotic that would inhibit 90% of the isolates tested.
