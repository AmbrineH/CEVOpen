<p class="p">The MICs of the six most active EOs (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) were determined against the clinical and reference isolates using the broth microdilution method, essentially as described by BSAC [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Broth cultures of each strain were prepared at a concentration of approximately 1×10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu/ml as described previously. Tween80 was added to ISB at a final concentration of 0.001% (v/v) to emulsify the EOs [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. EOs were added to ISB containing Tween80 to give a final EO concentration of between 8% and 0.125%. The contents of each tube were vortex mixed at high speed for 30 s to ensure that the EO was evenly dispersed throughout the broth. 100μl of bacterial culture and 100 μl of EO dilution were then added to the wells of a 96-well microtitre plate. After the bacteria were incubated for 24 h, the MIC was determined by observation of the lowest concentration where there was no visible growth. Subcultures of 10 μl were taken from the clear wells of the microtitre tray (and from control wells) and spot-inoculated onto ISA allowing determination of minimum bacteriocidal concentrations (MBC; the lowest concentration at which no growth on antibiotic-free medium was observed).
