<p class="p">MICs and MBCs for each of the EOCs listed above were determined for all strains using the broth dilution assay as described previously. Stock solutions were prepared in ethanol and vortexed thoroughly for 30 s. The maximum concentrations of camphor and camphene tested were 1% (v/v) while for other compounds this was 8% (v/v). The final concentration of ethanol in the broth was never more than 1% (v/v). Aromadendrene and ledene were tested on the reference strains only (and showed no inhibitory effect).</p>
