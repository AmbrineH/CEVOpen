<p class="p">A standardised inoculum was prepared for each strain tested. After overnight incubation in Isosensitest broth ISB at 37°C, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min and suspended in sterile distilled water. Turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard by adding sterile distilled water, giving a cell density of ~ 1×10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu ml
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. This suspension was further diluted by a factor of 10 and then 1 μl of diluted broth culture, providing a final inoculum of approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cfu, was spot inoculated onto agar plates within 15 min of preparation of the inoculum. Inoculated plates were incubated for 16–18 h at 37°C before determination of MICs. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth.
