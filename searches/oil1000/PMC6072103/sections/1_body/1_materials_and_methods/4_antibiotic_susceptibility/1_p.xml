<p class="p">Agar dilution assays were performed for 8 commonly-used antibiotics: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tetracycline, tobramycin, and trimethoprim. All antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (UK) except meropenem, purchased from Sequoia Research Products, UK. Antibiotics were serially diluted in 2-fold steps and then 2 ml of each dilution of antibiotic was added to 18 ml of Isosensitest agar (ISA) and mixed thoroughly before pouring. Two control plates containing no antibiotics were prepared; one was used to check the sterility of the medium and the other was used as a growth control. Plates were used within 24 h of preparation.</p>
