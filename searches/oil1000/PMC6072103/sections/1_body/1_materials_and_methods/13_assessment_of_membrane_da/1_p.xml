<p class="p">Loss of potassium ions was studied according to the method of Codling 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Bacteria cultured on TSA slants were streaked onto freshly prepared TSA plates and incubated overnight at 30°C, then harvested by centrifugation (3000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 15 min) and washed three times with ultra pure water (Elgastat UHP filtered deionized water). Bacteria were adjusted to 2 mg dry weight of cells per ml in ultra pure water. Terpinen-4-ol and geraniol solutions were prepared at double the required concentration (0.5% and 1% (v/v), respectively), so that the addition of an equal volume of cell suspension produced a final concentration of 1 mg dry weight of cells per ml. The bacteria were exposed to terpinen-4-ol and geraniol at 37°C and 10 ml samples were removed at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240 min. Cells were removed by filtration using 0.2 μm pore filters and the filtrates were analysed for K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> content using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. EOC-free controls with and without Tween80 were prepared under the same conditions to determine normal K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> flux over the time course of the experiment. The positive control was a lysed cell suspension obtained by thermal shock (80°C for 30 min). Experiments were conducted in triplicate. The potassium concentration in the supernatant was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Philips PU9200X). The instrumental parameters were as follows: potassium hollow cathode lamp, wavelength 766.5 nm; fuel and flow, acetylene at 2 l min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; oxidant and flow, air at 10 l min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; type of flame, slightly oxidizing; monochromator, 1.8/1.6.
