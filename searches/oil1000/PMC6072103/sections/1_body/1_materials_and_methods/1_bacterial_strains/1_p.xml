<p class="p">Fifty-one clinical isolates were collected between 2003 and 2007. These were obtained from 41 CF patients (from various parts of the UK) when they visited the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, UK for lung transplantation. Where multiple isolates of the same species (based on PCR-RFLP analysis) were identified from the same patient, only the first confirmed as from the Bcc was included in the study. Multiple isolates from the same patient belonging to different species were included in the study. As controls, six laboratory strains, from the panel of Bcc strains referred to by Mahenthiralingam

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These control strains were selected to represent different species of the Bcc and were sequenced as reference strains, obtaining 100% identity with the sequences listed in the MLST database. Strain LMG16656 / J2315 (
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) is representative of a lineage of

 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The strain is metabolically versatile and possesses numerous virulence and drug resistance functions.
