<p class="p">Cells from the working culture (100ml) of 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cenocepacia</italic> were collected by centrifugation (3000 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 15 min), washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. Terpinen-4-ol and geraniol were added to the cell suspension at final concentrations equivalent to their MBCs and then the suspension was incubated at 37°C with agitation. Samples (10 ml) were then taken at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min and filtered through a 0.2 μm pore filter. The concentration of the constituents released was determined by UV absorption measurements of each filtrate at 260 nm. Results were expressed as percentages of 260 nm-absorbing material in each interval with respect to the total release by heat treatment (as described above). The experiment was carried out with three replicates for each sample. Cells treated only with Tween80 were also included to study the effect of this surfactant on the leakage of cellular constituents.
