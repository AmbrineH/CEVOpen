<p class="p">A plate-count-based method was adopted to allow sensitive assessment of viability, since Hershberger et al. [

To 1 ml of ISB in a 24-well tissue culture plate, to which the MBC concentration of terpinen-4-ol or geraniol had already been added, 1 ml of a 1:100 dilution of a 0.5 McFarland standard suspension of either stationary or mid-exponential phase culture (final concentration of 5x10

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was added. The plates were then incubated at 37°C. Samples (50 μl) were removed after 0, 30, 60, 120, 240 min incubations; at each time point an undiluted sample (20 μl) and ten-fold dilutions (10
