<p class="p">Disc diffusion assays were performed in triplicate for the EOs listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> on 57 strains of the Bcc (51 clinical isolates and 6 reference strains) using two media, TSA and ISA, according to BSAC criteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. A standardised inoculum was prepared for each tested Bcc strain as described above for antibiotic susceptibility testing, but the 0.5 McFarland suspension was diluted 1:100 instead of 1:10. Within 15 min of the preparation of the inoculum, the plates were inoculated: 100 μl of diluted bacterial suspension was placed on the agar plate and, using sterile cotton swabs, spread evenly over the entire surface of the agar. Plates were allowed to dry for 10 min then, in triplicate, 5 μl of each neat EO was pipetted onto a sterile 6 mm diameter filter paper (Whatman No 4) disc and applied to the agar surface. Assay plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. For each disc, the diameter of a zone of inhibition was measured and a zone of diameter &gt; 7 mm was considered as positive.
