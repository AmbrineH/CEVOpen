<p class="p">The chemical composition of oils was determined by GC/MS using a Trace 2000 GC (Thermo Finnigan) interfaced with a Voyager single quad MS apparatus (Thermo Quest). Parameters are listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Mass spectra and retention times of essential oil components were identified by comparing them with those of authentic standards from the mass spectra of National Institute of Standards and Technology library. Chromatographic profiles of oils were compared against ISO standards as follows: lemongrass, ISO 4718:2004; tea tree, ISO 4730:2004; marjoram, ISO 4728:2003; rosewood, ISO 3761:2005.
