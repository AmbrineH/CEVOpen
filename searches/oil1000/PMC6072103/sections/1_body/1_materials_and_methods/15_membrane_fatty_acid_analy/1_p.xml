<p class="p">Bacteria from the working culture were incubated for 24 h at 28°C on TSA with and without terpinen-4-ol or geraniol. Fatty acids were determined as methyl esters from whole-cell hydrolysates, according to the procedure of the SHERLOCK microbial identification system [
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. 40 mg of cell dry mass was subjected to derivatization in screw-cap Teflon test tubes. For the preparation of esters, cells were saponified at 100°C for 30 min with 1 ml of reagent I (45 g of sodium hydroxide, 150 ml of methanol, 150 ml of distilled water), methylated at 80°C for 10 min with reagent II (325 ml of 6 M hydrochloric acid, 275 ml of methanol), extracted with 1.25 ml of reagent III (200 ml of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, 200 ml of methyl 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl ether), and base washed with 3 ml of reagent IV (0.27 M sodium hydroxide, 0.68 M sodium chloride). The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were analysed by GC using an Agilent 5890 autosampler gas chromatograph, equipped with a DB-WAX column; parameters are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201835.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The FAME peaks were identified by comparison to those of a standard FAME solution (Supelco, 37 component FAME standards) and were integrated using the Varian Star Chromatography Workstation version 5 (Varian Inc.).
