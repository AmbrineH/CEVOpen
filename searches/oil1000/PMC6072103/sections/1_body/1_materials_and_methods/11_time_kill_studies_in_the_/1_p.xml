<p class="p">EDTA was added to the 1 ml of broth containing terpinen-4-ol or geraniol described in the previous section, so that a final concentration of 10 mM EDTA was present. Terpinen-4-ol was tested at a concentration of 0.125% (v/v) and geraniol at 0.25% (v/v); concentrations chosen based on the MICs of the EO components in the presence of EDTA. Cells not treated with EDTA and cells treated with EDTA alone were included as controls. The incubation, collection of samples and plate counts were carried out in the same manner as that of time kill studies in the presence of a carbon source.</p>
