<p class="p">Future analysis of the microbial communities of GI features should include high resolution studies of storm events that generate urban runoff as well as investigate the impact of different vegetation cover. To continue illuminating the microbial “black box” of urban ecosystem processes, metagenomic sequencing coupled with stable isotope analysis can identify key genes specific to biogeochemistry as well as composition of GI microbial communities. Additional analyses will be essential for characterizing the specific ecosystem services of GI features such as the containment or bioremediation of urban contaminants.</p>
