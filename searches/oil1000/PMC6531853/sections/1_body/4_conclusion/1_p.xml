<p class="p">Our description of the microbiome of urban GI features has improved our understanding of the factors influencing bacterial community composition and the role of GI features in an urban ecosystem. GI design that integrates connectivity to urban street runoff can be a key constraint on the bacteria present in Technosol communities; in contrast, they may not have overwhelming effects on microbial-mediated ecosystem processes. Biogeochemical parameters were not reduced in highly connected, highly engineered GI features. Therefore, design and management of GI features that support high levels of soil organic matter will be important for sustaining the functions of GI features in highly stressed urban environments. One important consideration is the maintenance of healthy plant communities as part of the management and sustainability of GI features and functions. Storm events and resulting urban runoff will have strong impacts to GI sites and bacterial community, particularly in ROWB, and further investigation can address specific differences between SSIS and ETP designs.</p>
