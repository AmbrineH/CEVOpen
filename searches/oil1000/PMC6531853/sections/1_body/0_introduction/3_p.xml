<p class="p">Analysis of the microbial communities in GI features is fundamental to understanding the role of the microbial community and as a guide for future GI designs. The microbial community of Technosols can be an indicator of the nature and extent of anthropogenic impact on GI features, including pollutants in urban runoff. Studies across a range of locations and soil types show that the Phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria regularly dominating the soil microbiome, including in urban soils (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huot et al., 2017</xref>). These Phyla provide a baseline for evaluating the composition of bacterial communities in Technosols. In GI features, anthropogenic impacts such as exposure to petroleum products, heavy metals, salt, animal feces, pesticides, fertilizers, and garbage in urban runoff can shift abundances of bacteria within the Technosol microbiome (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Adeniji et al., 2017</xref>). These changes can be attributed to introductions of atypical soil microbiota as well as enrichment of specific, indigenous bacteria. For example, gram-negative bacteria typically increase in soils contaminated with petroleum (

 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> contributes to this increase because species within this genus are able to metabolize petroleum products (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nikhil et al., 2013</xref>). Some gram-positive bacteria, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Micrococcus</italic>, have also been observed to increase in the presence of petroleum contamination (

Knowing whether these, and other bacteria, are found in GI features is important because it can help to guide urban planning for the purposes of improving urban biodiversity or bioremediation, such as influencing the location, design, construction of GI features. Previous studies have characterized correlations between anthropogenic impacts on soil microbial communities, however, limited research has explored the dynamics influencing the Technosol microbial communities in GI features (
