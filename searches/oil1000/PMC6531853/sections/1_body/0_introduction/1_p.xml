<p class="p">Urban centers are rapidly growing at the sacrifice of natural or green spaces. Approximately 82% of the population in North America resides in an urban area with 400–1000 people per square kilometer (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McGranahan et al., 2005</xref>). This increase in population density contributes to greater generation of pollutants and waste, which amplifies the potential for elevated exposure to pollutants for residents. Globally, population estimates project that approximately 68% of the world’s population will reside in urban areas by 2050 (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). This growing threat to environmental resources and public health is a driving force for communities to adopt sustainable practices that improve and maintain urban environmental health. A solution has been to redesign the urban landscape with the objective of multifaceted benefits for the urban center, such as green infrastructure (GI). A strong motivation specific for green infrastructure is to mitigate disruptions in the local watershed hydrology caused by impervious surfaces and reduced natural vegetation (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Capps et al., 2016</xref>). GI features are designed using a combination of natural and constructed materials to capture urban runoff and facilitate other functions provided by natural systems (
