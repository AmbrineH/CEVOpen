<p class="p">Microbial biomass C and N and metabolic functioning (potential net N mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, denitrification potential) were all positively correlated with C-org, N-total, pH, MC, TPH, and watershed contributing area (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Denitrification potential and microbial biomass C and N were higher in ETP followed by SSIS then VS (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The pH was markedly lower in the UF (4.1) than in the VS, ETP and SSIS (6.7, 6.4, 6.39, respectively). All Technosols had similar soil texture with more than 70% sand (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Levels of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Ni) and TPH at GI sites did not exceed regulatory or published levels for polluted soils (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deeb et al., 2018</xref>). However, ETP had significantly (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) greater levels of TPH, Pb, and Zn than SSIS and VS, which did not differ significantly. ETP sites had higher levels of organic carbon that likely drove higher levels of microbial biomass and activity in these sites compared to the SSIS and VS sites. For most biogeochemical parameters evaluated, SSIS had higher levels of activity than VS sites, but these differences were not always statistically significant.
