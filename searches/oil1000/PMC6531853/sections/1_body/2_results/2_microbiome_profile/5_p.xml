<p class="p">When Technosols were compared with natural urban surface soils, some differences in community composition were apparent after normalizing for sequence variation (3,567 sequences for each sample). Of the 163 bacterial Orders present in both groups of samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>); 56 Orders had a greater abundance in Technosols than in the urban surface soils. Most notable in both sets of samples was the Class Chloracidobacteria, Order RB41 (Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.1415). The Order Acidobacteriales had a slightly greater abundance in the urban surface soils than in the Technosols (Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0548). Technosols and urban surface soils had differences in the most abundant (top 10%) Orders in the bacterial community. The two groups of samples only shared 6 of 25 Orders while few abundant Orders were significantly different (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Actinomycetales was in the top 10% of both Technosols and urban surface soils and were, similarly, abundant (Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.1693). Rhizobiales were equally represented and just under 10% of the average bacterial community for both urban surface soils and Technosols. Bacillales were included in the top 10% of Technosols and not in the urban surface soils, but the difference was not statistically significant. For Technosols, Pirellulales, and Synechococcales were in the top 10% and in significantly greater abundance than in the urban surface soils. (Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test = 0.0278 and 0.0255, respectively). While the less described bacteria DA052_Ellin6513 and ABS-6_NA were significantly more abundant in urban surface soils than Technosols.
