<p class="p">Soil bacteria are known to contribute to bioremediation of environmental pollutants, therefore identifying bacteria in GI can help to evaluate the bioremediation potential of GI designs (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiao et al., 2016</xref>). Of these Orders, only Actinomycetales varied with GI design; there was significantly lower abundance in SSIS than in VS (Tukey’s HSD, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007) and no difference with ETP sites. These patterns are consistent with levels of TPH, which were significantly higher in ETP sites than in SSIS and VS sites. The levels of TPH were low enough to not present a human health risk; furthermore, at this low level there was limited influence on the bacterial community with only Actinomycetales correlated with TPH levels. Additionally, GI features have evidence of enteric bacteria contamination, which is likely from the introduction of animal feces. The Orders Bacillales and Clostridiales are often considered enteric bacteria and were common in GI sites. Other enteric bacteria are within the Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Actinobacteria. These Phyla, including the identified lower taxa, were present in GI sites with only minor shifts in abundance across GI designs. Actinomycetales (within the Phylum of Actinobacteria) were less abundant in SSIS and VS (significant only for VS, Tukey’s HSD, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02). Results for animal introduction of bacteria are also consistent with lower levels of microbial biomass in SSIS and VS than in ETP features.
