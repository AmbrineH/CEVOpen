<p class="p">The GI bacterial communities all had levels of diversity in a range that is similar to the diversity associated with non-urban soils (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McGuire et al., 2013</xref>;

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018</xref>), and phylogenetically similar organisms were present in all the GI sites. Once normalized for sequencing depth (44,702 sequences for each sample), and removing outliers (ETP1, UF, and Urban Reference-GI.11.25), VS had significantly greater observed and estimated (Chao1) richness than SSIS (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, Tukey HSD, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.009). The SSIS had an average of 8722 OTUs and a Shannon diversity index of 7.6792 H′, the ETP had an average of 9143 OTUs and 7.8133 H′, and VS had an average of 9688 OTUs and 7.9383 H′. The UF had 7528 OTUs and 7.5868 H′ (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The bacterial Orders observed in all Technosol samples, from greatest to least, were RB41 and iii1-15 (both Phylum Acidobacteria), Saprospirales, Rhizobiales, Cytophagales, Pirellulales, Pedosphaerales, Opitutales, Xanthomonadales, and Actinomycetales (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). On average there were fewer Pedosphaerales (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.015) and more Actinomycetales (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007) in VS than in the other designs. No other abundant nor prevalent bacterial Order significantly varied in abundance between GI designs. GI designs had unique bacterial community beta diversity when considering both the phylogenetic relatedness of bacteria present as well as the abundance of each taxon. The variation across the samples is best explained by the Weighted Unifrac but the clustering observed is not significant (PERMANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.105), while the Unifrac and Bray Curtis distance matrices had significant clustering by GI design (PERMANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001 and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007, respectively, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). While GI designs had similar communities, within the VS GI design, the urban reference site bacterial community was unlike the other VS sites in the PCoA analysis. One key difference was the high relative abundance of Synechoccales, which was rare in the other VS sites.
