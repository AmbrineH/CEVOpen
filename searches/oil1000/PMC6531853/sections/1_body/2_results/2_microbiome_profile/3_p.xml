<p class="p">There were significant trends between specific biogeochemical parameters and the top 10 Orders of bacteria in the GI sites (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), however, none of the biogeochemical parameters were consistently correlated across bacterial Orders or GI design. Chromatales and A21b were among the 10 abundant Orders across all GI designs. Chromatales had significant positive correlation (
