<p class="p">In a companion study (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deeb et al., 2018</xref>), GI site samples were analyzed for a series of soil chemical variables; organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-total), pH, salts, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), Pb, Zn as well as moisture content (MC) and texture. A suite of additional measurements for biogeochemical parameters (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, potential net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, and denitrification potential) were also completed (
