<p class="p">Sequence data were received as paired forward and reverse reads with adapters removed. Subsequent processing was accomplished using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology analysis tool (QIIME v1.9.1; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caporaso et al., 2010</xref>). Sample specific barcodes and poor quality sections of sequences were trimmed away and remaining sequences were filtered to remove overall poor-quality reads: minimum length of 200 basepairs, average quality score of &gt;25, no more than 6 homopolymers or ambiguous bases. The resulting sequences were then clustered, using the Usearch algorithm (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Edgar, 2010</xref>), into operational taxonomic units (OTUs, minimum cluster size of 4 for filtering) and were aligned with FastTree then assigned a taxonomic identification at 97% threshold for PyNAST alignment using the Greengenes v13.8 database. Non-bacterial (e.g., mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Archaea) sequences are common in 16S amplicon libraries; therefore, they were identified and filtered from the GI sample sequences. Throughout processing the sequence data, the sequence average for each sample remained about 50,000 sequences (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) Sequence counts of replicates were averaged to better represent the bacterial community of each GI design (R Core Team analysis package Phyloseq;
