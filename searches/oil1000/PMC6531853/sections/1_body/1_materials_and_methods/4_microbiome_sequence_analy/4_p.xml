<p class="p">Results from this study were compared with a previous sampling of natural (not-engineered) urban surface soils from non-GI features in NYC (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huot et al., 2017</xref>). The sequence data from these urban surface soil samples also targeted the bacterial community using the V1–V3 16SrRNA region and were sequenced using Illumnia MiSeq by the same laboratory (Molecular Research Lab, Shallowater, TX, United States). The primary GI sequence data (22 sequenced samples averaged by location, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 17) and the urban surface soil sequence data (28 sequenced soils averaged by location, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 9) were re-analyzed as a single batch. The analysis methods were the same as described above except that new OTU clusters were identified using the Uclust algorithm to reduce computational demand (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Edgar, 2010</xref>). Sequences for all samples were normalized to control for sequencing variation between samples as well as machine runs for the different data sets. Differential abundances for bacterial Orders were evaluated by averaging the number of sequences for the Orders at each site then comparing the proportion of the urban surface soil bacterial community to the proportion within the Technosol bacterial community. Significant differences were determined by completing a Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test for unbalanced samples on the average sequence abundance of each site for each Order between urban surface soil and Technosols.
