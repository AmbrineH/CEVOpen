<p class="p">The biogeochemical parameters measured (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deeb et al., 2018</xref>) were compared to the bacterial community to investigate relationships between community composition and function (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ssekagiri et al., 2018</xref>). Predominant bacterial Orders related to biogeochemical parameters were determined with linear correlations; significance determined with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values of less than 0.05 adjusted for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate (fdr; 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the most abundant bacteria at the Order level (Orders with greater than a total of 50 sequences for all samples) were evaluated for associations with biogeochemical factors common to pollutants using ANOVAs followed by Tukey HSD tests.
