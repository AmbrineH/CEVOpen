<p class="p">Several biodiversity metrics were calculated using the normalized sequence data. The top 20 Orders were calculated and represented along with the combined local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD, using default Hellinger dissimilarity distance) using the MicrobiomeSeq R package (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ssekagiri et al., 2018</xref>). The LCBD was qualitatively used to describe the bacteria community profiles, with scale of LCBD indicating a sample’s similarity (small) to other samples or difference (larger). Alpha diversity represents bacterial diversity within each sample and GI design; richness of unique organisms is presented as the observed OTUs and estimated richness of OTUs (Chao1), while the Shannon diversity index accounts for unique OTU richness and abundance. Beta diversity represents the bacterial diversity between GI samples, calculated with a Bray-Curtis and Unifrac (weighted and unweighted) distance matrix of the bacterial community similarities represented by a principal coordinate analysis, PCoA (Phyloseq). A PERMANOVA was completed to test the significance of cluster of samples, specifically by GI design.
