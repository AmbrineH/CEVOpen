<p class="p">Samples were collected from Technosols of GI features in two New York City Boroughs within the Jamaica Bay, NY watershed. Sites (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 22) were selected to represent the variety of NYC GI designs for right-of-way bioswales (ROWB); enhanced tree pits (ETP; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5) and street-side infiltration swales (SSIS; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5), as well as vegetated swales (VS; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 11) and an urban forest (UF; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). All GI features were constructed with Technosol from the same source with a high sand content (70–85%). Modifications to the road drainage system (i.e., curb cuts, inlet modifications, and catch basin modifications) directly channel runoff to ROWB (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Both ETP and SSIS are prototypes of bioswales and were constructed within sidewalks adjacent to streets, directly connected to street drainage. The ETP design is a smaller surface area than the SSIS and has an integrated runoff detention chamber. The VS are vegetated areas of variable size and shape, constructed in open areas (e.g., parking lots, parks) to provide surface, soil, and gravel storage for infiltration of urban runoff. The area of ETP are typically 9.3 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (6.1 m by 1.5 m), with a 0.6 m engineered soil layer over 0.6 m of gravel, recycled glass, or storage chambers. The surface area of SSIS are typically 18.6 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (12.2 m by 1.5 m) and do not contain a storage layer with gravel, recycled glass, or storage chambers. One ETP site (GI.0.14, ETP1) had a 0.3 m wide gravel strip along the curb instead of soil and a larger surface area (∼19 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The VS sample sites had an average surface area of 269.8 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and were most commonly located at large street intersections and parking lots. One VS site served as an urban reference site (GI.11.25). The UF site was sampled as a reference of a non-Technosol urban soil and was an irregularly shaped forest stand of native hardwood trees (oak and hickory) established in 1935.
