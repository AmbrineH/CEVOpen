<p class="p">The area of impervious urban surface creating runoff water to be managed by a GI feature differed across the GI sites in this study. ETP sites had 156–411 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and SSIS sites had 207–1847 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of impervious area contributing potential urban runoff. Since VS sites had unstructured design criteria including the size of the GI feature, the area of impervious surfaces each VS site served varied from 73 to 7606 m
