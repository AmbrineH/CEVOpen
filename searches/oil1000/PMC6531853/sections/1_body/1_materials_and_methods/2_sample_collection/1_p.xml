<p class="p">GI sites were sampled over a period of 48 h in July, 2016. No rain was recorded while sampling or for 48 h prior and the July air ranged from 22 to 30°C. Multiple surface samples were collected at each GI site from random locations within the site (distributed throughout the center, periphery, etc.) at a depth of 0–10 cm. All surface samples from a single GI site were pooled into a larger collection barrel and mixed thoroughly as a collective representation of that site. Final samples were then collected as a subset of the larger composite collection barrel representing each site and stored at 5°C until DNA extraction (within 24 h of collection). Bacterial DNA was extracted from soil (0.25 g) using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, United States). The DNA was stored at -20°C until it was shipped overnight for sequencing. Isolated DNA was amplified for the 16S rRNA gene, V1-V3 region (for details see
