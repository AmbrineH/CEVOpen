<p class="p">The relationships between OM, bacterial community composition and biogeochemical function are particularly interesting for bioremediation potential of GI features. GI sites with relatively high OM also had higher TPH concentrations: TPH was the highest at ETP followed by SSIS and VS, likely associated with the sorption of TPH on OM (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deeb et al., 2018</xref>). ETP had the greatest variation and amount of TPH, with the trend of sites with higher levels of TPH had a decline in bacterial richness. Increases in the Phyla Xanthamonadales, Rhizobiales, and Rhodobacterials are associated with the degradation of TPH contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (

In our study, Xanthamonadales and Rhizobiales were in the top 10% of both Technosol and natural urban surface soils, however, there was no significant difference in abundance between GI designs. The consistent prevalence of both Xanthamonadales and Rhizobiales may be due to their strong association with surface vegetation, which can also correlate with OM. At all GI sites there was surface vegetation. However, inconsistent survival of tree species and herbaceous plants make further research necessary draw to conclusions about the relationship between vegetation type and amount, OM levels, microbial community and the dynamics of organic contaminants such as TPH.
