<p class="p">Design of the GI features influenced the bacterial community composition within the soil, with the VS having distinct bacterial communities compared to the ETP and SSIS features. The ETP and SSIS are more excessively engineered features, with direct connections to urban runoff from streets. While VS are constructed with variable size, shape, and integration with urban runoff management. Bacterial communities are also known to differ with varied pH (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill et al., 2017</xref>), however, in this study pH did not vary enough between the GI designs to identify a significant effect on bacterial diversity nor composition. Core similarities between the bacterial communities of ETP and SSIS were likely influenced by the consistent texture (high sand content) of the Technosols, area, and increased connectivity.
