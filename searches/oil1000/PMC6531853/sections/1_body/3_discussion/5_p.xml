<p class="p">Similar to previous descriptions of the urban soil microbiome, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria are among the most abundant bacterial Phyla of Technosols (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The bacterial communities of Technosols revealed similar diversity to previously studied natural soils. This is likely to be important for their ability to sustain ecosystem functions and is encouraging given that Technosols are not entirely naturally derived. The Orders Bacillales and Clostridiales are often considered enteric bacteria and were common in GI sites. This biological contamination is likely related to animal excretion in GI. Of the taxa associated with common urban pollutants, Actinomycetales and Bacillales were notable members of both Technosols and natural urban surface soils. The Order Actinomycetes had the greatest presence in ETP and is associated with common urban pollutants, a GI design greater connectivity to urban runoff with smaller area to manage and retain the runoff (
