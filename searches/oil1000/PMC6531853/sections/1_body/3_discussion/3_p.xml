<p class="p">Technosols had relatively high levels of OM compared to non-urban soils (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vasenev and Kuzyakov, 2018</xref>); thus, in this study, microbes were not likely competing for carbon resources. Consequently, higher OM did not lead to higher diversity in the ETP, although it did lead to higher microbial biomass (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deeb et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that influences on bacterial diversity may differ from the influence on overall microbial biomass. For VS, there was a positive relationship between microbial biomass C and N content and diversity; yet, there was a negative relationship for ETP and no relationship for SSIS. These results suggest a key difference between VS and ROWB is in the designed connectivity to urban runoff. This connectivity combined with size of the GI design, may be strong influences on microbial community structure and function.
