<p class="p">The differences in bacterial community composition, with the VS features having the most distinct communities, raise questions about relationships between microbial community structure and function. ETP sites had higher levels of organic carbon that drove higher levels of microbial biomass and metabolic functioning in these sites compared to the SSIS and VS sites. For most biogeochemical variables, SSIS had higher levels than VS sites, but these differences were not always statistically significant. Interestingly, organic matter, microbial biomass, and soil moisture, which should be strong drivers of community composition, do not solely explain differences between the ETP, SSIS, and VS features. There is great uncertainty about urban ecosystem functioning due to multiple unknowns (i.e., local urban development, vehicle or pedestrian traffic, or vegetation survival, etc.) associated with construction and design of GIs (
