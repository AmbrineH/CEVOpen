  <p class="p">Alpha diversity metrics of the rarefied sample dataset with key biogeochemical parameters. ETP1 and UF are not replicated so there is no regression model but they are included for comparison. Observed is the number of unique OTUs within samples, Chao is the estimated richness of OTUs in a sample, Shannon are diversity indices that balance the richness (Observed unique OTUs) with the abundance of each OTU. Within the GI sites, OM is the organic matter measured and Microbial Biomass C and N are the C and N within the living portion of the soil sampled.</p>
