  <p class="p">A summary of how the bacterial community differs in urban soils. Natural (
   <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 9) urban surface soil still has anthropogenic influence, but is not purposefully manufactured like Technosols in GI (
   <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 17). Equal proportion or representation in the soils is represented by the x = y line, values represented above this line indicate the Order was more prevalent in Technosols and values below the line represent Orders more prevalent in urban natural soils.
