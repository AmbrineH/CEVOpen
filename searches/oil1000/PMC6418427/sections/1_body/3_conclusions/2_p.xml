<p class="p">Based on our findings in the present study, 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO was very effective against 
 <italic class="italic">LAB</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Listeria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacter</italic> growth unlike LPOS‐containing coatings. LPOS is recommended to be used in combination with other preservation methods, as it was effective in inhibiting gram‐negative bacteria. Decreases in lipid oxidation indices and also free fatty acid content were more pronounced in whey protein coatings involving EO and also EO–LPOS. LPOS as an active gram‐negative microorganism inhibitor and EO as a gram‐positive bacterium inhibitor as well as an oxidation inhibitor are seriously recommended as preservative agents against chemical and microbiological spoilage in cheese. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO in combination with LPOS can be applied as a natural antimicrobial agent for extending the shelf life of washed and ripened cheeses.
