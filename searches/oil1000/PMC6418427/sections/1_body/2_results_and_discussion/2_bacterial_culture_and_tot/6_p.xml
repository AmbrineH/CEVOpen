<p class="p">Despite controversies about the antimicrobial mechanisms of EOs, several targets in the microorganisms are identified as the sites of the EOs’ action (Nazzaro, Fratianni, De Martino, Coppola, &amp; De Feo, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Although it has been reported that EOs are more effective against gram‐positive bacteria in comparison with gram‐negative bacteria (Hyldgaard, Mygind, &amp; Meyer, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Seow, Yeo, Chung, &amp; Yuk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), our results have shown similar trends in all species; thus, the growth of all bacteria was inhibited. As gram‐negative microorganisms have an outer membrane rich in lipopolysaccharide, they could prevent entry of various antimicrobial components of essential oil. The presence of hydrolytic enzymes in the periplasmic space causes degradation of antimicrobial substances. On the other hand, according to the absence of periplasmic space in gram‐positive bacteria, the hydrophobic essential oils can pass directly through phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane and induce ion increment permeability, intracellular constituent leakages, and impedance of enzyme systems (Seow et al.,
