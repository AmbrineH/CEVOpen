<p class="p">Considering the data analyses, except for LAB and Enterobacter (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a and b), the LPOS‐coated cheese samples showed antibacterial activity up to the end of the 90‐day storage period. The number of all bacteria was steady in all types of cheeses during storage in both the EO‐ and EO–LPOS‐coated cheese samples. The enzyme LP shows the most bactericidal efficacy against gram‐negative bacteria, while the most bacteriostatic efficacy is related to gram‐positive bacteria (Yener et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). According to Munsch‐Alatossava et al.'s (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) findings, a gram‐positive bacterium will be less susceptible to the antibacterial effects of OSCN– (hypothiocyanite in its base form), because of the presence of cell wall outside the cytoplasmic membrane, so lower amounts of HOSCN (hypothiocyanite in its acid form) will leach into the cytoplasm and finally result in bacteriostatic effects. The outer membrane pores of gram‐negative bacteria will allow the negatively charged OSCN– to penetrate the periplasmic space together with the neutral HOSCN, which is able to leach through outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, high intracellular concentrations of HOSCN/OSCN– will be reached and lead to more bactericidal effects in cytoplasmic area and protein dysfunctions eventually. Several bacterial species have the ability to eliminate or neutralize free HOSCN/OSCN– molecules and make themselves more resistant to LPOS (Munsch‐Alatossava et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Renye &amp; Somkuti, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The degree of resistance to LPOS is species‐dependent; however, incubation conditions such as aerobiosis/anaerobiosis and the growth phase stage render bacteria more or less susceptible to LPOS; gram‐negative catalase‐positive bacteria, such as

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is supplied exogenously; and gram‐positive catalase‐negative bacteria, such as streptococci or lactobacilli, are generally inhibited, but not killed, by the LPOS (Munsch‐Alatossava et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). According to these, LPOS is generally used in combination with other preservation methods.
