<p class="p">The ANOVA results revealed that cheese type × storage time interaction had a significant effect on TBARS and POV (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The trend shows that both oxidation indicators increased until day 30. Also, the following decrement of TBARS and POV during storage had no association with cheese types, except in POV of WL cheese which showed a significant correlation between storage time and POV even at 60 days (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a and b). The reduction in POVs was also reported in an investigation by Lee, Yang, and Song (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), who prepared packaging of Gouda cheese based on fish skin gelatin containing 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa oleifera Lam</italic>. leaf extract. The decrement of TBARS and POV is a consequence of unstable peroxide decomposition to secondary products such as ketones, hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Our results showed that the fabricated coating on the Gouda cheese could effectively inhibit the production of primary lipid oxidation products in this cheese type. Our results are similar to those of Nascimento et al. (

 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera Lam</italic>.‐containing fish oil had lower POV than those with other synthetic antioxidants during storage.
