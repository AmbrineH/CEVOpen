<p class="p">The peroxide value was measured to assess the lipid oxidation of Gouda cheese during storage. The antiperoxidation evaluation was followed by an adaptation of the TBARS assay, which relies on the colorimetric detection of the malondialdehyde formation by polyunsaturated lipid degradation as a result of reactive oxygen species. Eventually reaction of the malondialdehyde with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) represents a colored compound.</p>
