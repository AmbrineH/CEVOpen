<p class="p">The effects of cheese type × storage time interaction on the pH and FFA content were similar and are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c and d. As demonstrated, during storage, the pH and FFA content were also significantly increased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which is most apparent in the WL‐type cheese. The treatments did not change the pH value of Gouda cheese during storage (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). The pH ranged between 5.28 and 5.61 during 90 days of storage time, which represents the poor postacidification process of samples. pH reduction during the ripening period is mainly due to the metabolism of the retained lactose to lactic acid by nonstarter lactic acid bacteria. Higher levels of dissolved CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the cheese atmosphere enable buffering activity according to the lower CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> permeability. Substantially, increment of pH of the cheese samples is the consequence of alkaline compound formation due to protein degradation by proteolytic enzymes during the ripening period in the WL and WE samples. Fatty acids constitute over 90% of total edible fats and oils. There are many naturally occurring fatty acids with very different chemical and physical characteristics. Free fatty acids (FFA) are likely to contribute to the flavor and odor of Gouda cheese (Sulieman, Ohag, Hassan, Alreshidi, &amp; Veettil, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c demonstrates the mean value of fatty acid composition of laboratory‐made Gouda expressed as g/100 g of the total fatty acids. The results showed that FFA production rate is increasing during storage, which is due to the lipolysis phenomenon. Milk fat hydrolysis which is called as lipolysis is a complex phenomenon which is the results of the activity of natural lipases of the milk, the lipolytic enzymes of the starter and non‐starter lactic acid bacteria, and lipases of the psychrotrophs during cheese manufacture and storage time (Soleimani‐Rambod, Zomorodi, Naghizadeh Raeisi, Khosrowshahi Asl, &amp; Shahidi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The amounts of free fatty acids (FFA) were used as indicators of lipolysis in the cheese samples. The free fatty acid composition of samples was significantly affected by edible coatings. Lipolysis was more pronounced in the C‐, W‐, and WL‐type cheeses during the final days of storage time. The lower amount of WE and WLE FFA content could be related to the inhibitory effect of different applied coatings on the lipolysis rate of Gouda cheese samples.
