<p class="p">A similar trend in the TBARS assessment was obtained in all treatments. Lee et al. (

 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO accompanied by LPOS film had less contact with oxygen. These results reveal that the oxygen barrier property of the coating was intensified by the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO and LPOS, in which further inhibition of the lipid oxidation of the cheese by decreasing the oxygen content in the packaging was achieved.
