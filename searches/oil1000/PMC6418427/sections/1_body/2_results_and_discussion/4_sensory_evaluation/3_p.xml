<p class="p">Proteolysis and lipolysis play an important role in the sensory of special Gouda‐type cheese. To a large extent, the ripening procedures are catalyzed by (residual) milk and rennet enzymes, and by enzymes from (adjunct) starters and possible nonstarter lactic acid bacteria present in the cheese. Under these conditions, casein is degraded by residual chymosin, and to a lesser extent by plasmin and by proteinases, into larger peptides. These are further degraded, finally yielding free amino acids and amino acid degradation products. Peptides, amino acids (Moghaddas Kia, et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), and (volatile) components, also from fat (Sulieman et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) and citrate conversion, together determine the full flavor (taste and aroma) of Gouda cheese (Fox et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Sensory evaluation scores are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Our findings about the positive sensory effects of using 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO in cheese preparation are in line with those reported previously by Ehsani et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and Hassanien, Mahgoub, and El‐Zahar (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). They found that 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> EO‐enriched cheese samples had significantly higher color, odor, flavor, texture, and general acceptability scores than control cheese (Ehsani et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Also, Hassanien et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that Domiati soft cheeses supplemented with black cumin oil showed higher sensory scores compared to control cheese (Hassanien et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). On the other hand, it has been reported that lactoperoxidase system (LPOS), alone and in combination with some plants and their derivatives, can provide beneficial effects for the food industry. For instance, Sharifi, Khanzadi, Hashemi, and Azizzadeh (
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss EO and LPOS, when used in combination in alginate solution, had stronger antibacterial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> O157:H7 in rainbow trout fillets during 16 days of storage in comparison with each alone.
