<p class="p">The weight ratios of LPOS components for lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase, glucose, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide were 1.00, 0.35, 108.70, 1.09, and 2.17, respectively. Following that, the components were dissolved separately in 50 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), and then, the concentrations of the components were altered on the basis of 15.5 mg LPO (Cissé, Montet, Tapia, Loiseau, &amp; Ducamp‐Collin,
