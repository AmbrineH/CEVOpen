 <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum (B. persicum)</italic> or black cumin is a plant from the Apiaceae family which might have been originated in the area between central Asia and northern India. 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> seed, which is called “zireh kuhi,” “zireh kermani,” or “zireh siyah,” is utilized as a culinary spice. Generally, the main components of 
 <italic class="italic">B. persicum</italic> are cuminaldehyde; p‐mentha‐1,3‐dien‐7‐al; p‐mentha‐1,4‐dien‐7‐al (=c‐terpinene‐7‐al); and terpene hydrocarbons including c‐terpinene, p‐cymene, β‐pinene, and limonene (Mortazavi, Eikani, Mirzaei, Jafari, &amp; Golmohammad,
