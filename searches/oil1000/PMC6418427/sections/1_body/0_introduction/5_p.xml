<p class="p">Furthermore, lactoperoxidase system (LPOS), an antimicrobial enzyme having a broad antimicrobial spectrum, is an effective agent in biological systems such as milk, saliva, and tears of mammals. This enzyme often has bactericidal effects on gram‐negative bacteria and bacteriostatic effects on gram‐positive bacteria. Also, it has antifungal and antiviral activities. Three components of LPOS consist of lactoperoxidase (LPO) enzyme, thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide (H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). Lactoperoxidase oxidation of thiocyanate (SCN−) occurs by using hydrogen peroxide and produces intermediate antimicrobial materials such as hypothiocyanite (OSCN−) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN). These materials have the potential of inhibiting the microorganisms’ growth by oxidizing sulfhydryl (–SH) groups in their enzyme systems (Munsch‐Alatossava, Gursoy, Lorilla, Gauchi, &amp; Alatossava,
