<p class="p">Nowadays the utilization of coating in cheese packaging is one of the common approaches to preserve the quality of cheese during shelf life. Furthermore, nature‐ripened Gouda cheeses are coated regularly during ripening and storage time (Wemmenhove et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Different natural components including polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids (alone or in combination) can be utilized as edible coating materials. The efficiency of an edible coating in preserving food quality is mainly related to its moisture and gas barrier properties (Aloui &amp; Khwaldia, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Whey proteins, a biodegradable coatings and films material, are a major by‐product of the cheese industry. Heat‐denatured whey proteins produce transparent and flexible films with excellent water vapor, gas and oil barrier properties (Ramos, Fernandes, Silva, Pintado, &amp; Malcata, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Incorporating antimicrobial compounds into biopolymer edible coatings could improve the quality and shelf life of food products (Aloui &amp; Khwaldia, 
 <xref rid="fsn3888-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Rather than incorporating the antimicrobial agents directly into food, blending them in film or coating solutions induces a functional effect on the food surface. Due to the consumers’ concerns about health, there is particular interest in food industry to use natural food preservatives such as antimicrobial enzymes and bacteriocins (Shokri, Ehsani, &amp; Jasour,
