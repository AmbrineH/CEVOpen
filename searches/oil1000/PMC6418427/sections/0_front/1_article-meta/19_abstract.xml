 <p class="p">This study aimed to prepare an inhibitory edible coating for Gouda cheese based on whey protein containing lactoperoxidase system (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>) and 
  <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum</italic> essential oil (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>) in order to control postpasteurization contamination. Using a full factorial design, the effects of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content> and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content> on microbiological characteristics and chemical indices of manufactured Gouda cheeses were evaluated during 90 days of storage time. 
  <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> lactic acid bacteria</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Enterobacter</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Escherichia</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> species were considered as potential pathogenic and spoilage indicators of produced Gouda cheese samples. Chemical properties of cheeses were assessed using the free fatty acid, peroxide value, and thiobarbituric acid experiments. The results showed that bacteria counts remained constant in cheese samples coated with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content> and also 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>. However, the survival of gram‐positive lactic acid bacteria and 
  <italic class="italic">Enterobacter</italic> spp. was more pronounced in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>‐based coating. The most effective treatments on oxidation stability parameters in cheese samples were 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>‐ and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content> coatings. By the addition of 
  <italic class="italic">B. persicum </italic>
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content> and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>, further inhibition of the lipid oxidation of the cheese samples was achieved. Lipolysis, as a result of lipid degradation, was more pronounced in the control, whey‐coated, and whey–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>‐coated samples in comparison with whey–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>‐ and whey–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content>–
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>‐coated samples during the final days of storage time. These results indicate that antibacterial, lipid oxidation, and oxygen barrier properties of the coatings were developed by the addition of 
  <italic class="italic">B. persicum </italic>
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</styled-content> and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">LPOS</styled-content>.
