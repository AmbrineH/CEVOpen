<p class="p">Soil samples were collected with the aid of a sterile soil auger from a depth of between 0–20 cm. Samples were stored in jute bags and transported to the greenhouse of the National Root Crops Research Institute, Umudike. The soil samples were collected in April from farm land (longitude N 05°33.5′ and latitude E 06°45.2′) close to a flare site (longitude N 05°32.7′ and latitude E 06°45.8′) in Obiakpu Autonomous Community, Ohaji/Egbema L.G.A, Imo State. The control soil, of a comparative type, was collected from farmland where there was no gas flaring activity located at (Longitude N 05°28.513′ and Latitude E 007°32.536′) Umudike, Ikwuano L.G.A, Abia State, Nigeria. The two soils are of the same textural class (sandy loam). The sand fraction was 77.8%, silt 7.8% and clay 14.3% for the gas flared soil while that of the non-gas flared soil was 74.1%, 6.3% and 19.5%, respectively. Soil samples were weighed into plastic containers and mixed with different amounts of biochar, namely 0 t ha

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 20.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 28.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respectively. Water was added to the mixture and the soil allowed to mineralize for two weeks (at a temperature of 29 °C and relative humidity of 75%). Subsequently, two viable seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> were planted per container in August, 2016 and the experiment was repeated three times with three replicates per experiment. Plants were watered once every two days. Eight weeks after germination, leaves harvested from the same treatment in the 3 replicates were bulked together, thereafter air-dried for 5 days and dried in the oven to a constant weight at 60 °C.
