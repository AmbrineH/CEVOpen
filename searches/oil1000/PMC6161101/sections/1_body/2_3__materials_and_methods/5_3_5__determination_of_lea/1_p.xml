<p class="p">Nitric acid was used for digestion of cation minerals. A portion of 200 mg of leaf sample was weighed into dry digestion tubes. Five millilitres of nitric acid was added, swirled and allowed to stand overnight. Tubes were placed into a digestion block with the temperature gradually increasing from room temperature to 120 °C over about 2 h with periodical swirling of each tube. Thereafter, the temperature was increased to 180 °C until about 0.5 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of liquid remained. The digestion tubes were removed from the block and cooled at room temperature. The digest was diluted with ultrapure water, homogenized with a vortex mixer and allowed to stand for a few hours prior to analysis. The mineral concentration was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Optima 8000, Perkin Elmer).
