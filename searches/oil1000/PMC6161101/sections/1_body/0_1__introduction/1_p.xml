<p class="p">Crude oil accounts for more than 50% of the global energy supply [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The process of energy generation derived from crude oil produces numerous undesirable environmental impacts such as oil spills, venting and flaring [

 <xref rid="B3-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Gas flaring is a usual occurrence in countries that lack the infrastructure to capture, store, utilize, or market natural gas like Nigeria. Nigeria flares more than 70% of associated natural gas from over 120 flaring sites in the Niger Delta. This has earned Nigeria the status of one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG) worldwide [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Several campaigns by the World Bank have failed to have an impact on this statistic, and gas flaring continues to increase. In 2011, Global Gas Flaring Reduction [
