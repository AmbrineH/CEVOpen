<p class="p">Techniques such as the use of chemicals, microorganisms, and plants have been exploited to remediate polluted soils [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Some of these approaches have the potential to further contaminate the environment, hence the need for the search for natural and more environmentally sustainable soil remediation approaches. Biochar is the product of pyrolysis of biomass in limited or no oxygen supply [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It is derived from recalcitrant carbonized organic matter that is often produced from agricultural wastes [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], such as plant biomass and excreted animal waste. It has the potential to increase crop yield, reduce GHG emissions, thereby mitigating climate change, as well as increasing long-term soil carbon sequestration [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Biochar application can improve soil aeration [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and water retention [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and reduce nutrient leaching [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, the effect of biochar depends on soil type, local environmental conditions, type of biochar used and the temperature of pyrolysis of biochar used. The study here has been conducted to compare and evaluate the effects of biochar remediation, using different rates of application, on the nutritional quality of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> (commonly known as fluted pumpkin) cultivated on a gas flared soil and non-gas flared soil. A range of vitamins and minerals have been measured to provide insight into the possible changes, induced by gas flaring on the availability of vitamins and minerals provided by the consumption of
