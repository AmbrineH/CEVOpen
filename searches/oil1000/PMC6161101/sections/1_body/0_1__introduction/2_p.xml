 <xref rid="B6-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reported that the thermal effects of gas flaring could be detected over 2 km from the flare site. Flaring releases pollutants such as greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, black carbon and particulate matter [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and heavy metals [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. These all have serious negative impacts on climate, vegetation, animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Greenhouse gases such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and methane, are key contributors to climate change [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Some atmospheric pollutants from gas flares, such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon and sulphur (NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CO and SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), particulate matter and hydrogen sulphide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S) acidifies and depletes the soil of its nutrients [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Acidic pH negatively affects the growth and survival of many terrestrial plants and crops as well as aquatic life [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Orimoogunje et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] reported that the soils around gas flare sites were rapidly losing their fertility. This loss of soil fertility was due to acid rain, arising from the interaction between gas combustion products, and atmospheric moisture which has been suggested to be responsible for the abandonment of farmlands [
