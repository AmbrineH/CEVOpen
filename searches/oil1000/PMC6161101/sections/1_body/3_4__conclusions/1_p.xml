<p class="p">This study compared the nutritional differencesbetween 
 <italic class="italic">Telfairia occidentalis</italic> grown on gas flared and non-gas flared soil remediated with palm bunch biochar. Application of biochar was found to increase leaf moisture, ash, crude fibre and fat content of 
 <italic class="italic">Telfairia occidentalis</italic> leaves with a decrease in leaf carbohydrate content of plants grown on gas flared soil. Increases in leaf vitamin and mineral content was observed in plants cultivated on gas flared soil treated with 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of biochar. Biochar application could increase the mineral composition of vegetables and hence their nutritional quality.
