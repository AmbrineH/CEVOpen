 <xref rid="plants-07-00057-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Comparative study of the effects of biochar application on the mineral composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> cultivated on gas flared and non-gas flared soils showed that the nitrogen concentrations were all higher than the control with 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> treatments being significant (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00057-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The result suggests that increased concentrations of biochar treatment possibly reduced nitrogen uptake in the plants which could decrease protein synthesis and hence supply of essential amino acids to the body [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Calcium, Mg and Na concentrations of 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated plants were significantly higher compared to the controls with maximal concentrations obtained for the 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> treatment, indicating that consumption of these plants provides a source of Ca, Mg and Na required for human health [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The findings of this study are in agreement with that of Lou et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], who reported increased potassium, calcium and magnesium in cabbage treated with aqueous extract of Sanli wheat straw biochar. The results of this study suggest that soil enrichment with biochar could positively enhance the mineral composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic>, depending on the amount of biochar added to the soil.
