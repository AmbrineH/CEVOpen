<p class="p">The effect of biochar remediation on the proximate composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> cultivated on gas flared soil showedthat 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated plants had the highest protein content of 18.8%, while the control had the least, 11.8% (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00057-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Protein content of the leaves treated with 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 20.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 25.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of biochar were comparable. Protein and moisture content of the 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> treated plants were significantly (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and control treatments. Plants treated with 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar had the lowest fat content (3.4%). Crude fibre content of 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 28.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated plants were comparable, while 20.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> had the highest carbohydrate content of 54%, but was similar to the control.
