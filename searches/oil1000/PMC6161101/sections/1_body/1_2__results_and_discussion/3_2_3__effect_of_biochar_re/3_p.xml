<p class="p">A comparative study of the effect of biochar remediation on the proximate composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> cultivated on gas flare and non-gas flare soils (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00057-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) showed that protein composition of 28.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> treated plants from the gas flared site soil was significantly lower than the control. Moisture content of leaves from the gas flared site was significantly greater for 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 28.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and control treatments. Ash and crude fibre concentrations were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) different for 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 20.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and control treatments for both soils. Fat content was significantly higher for 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 20.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 28.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and control treatments in the gas flared plants, compared to the non-gas flared plants. Proximate analysis was used to assess the nutritional value and quality of this material [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Dietary proteins are necessary for the synthesis and maintenance of body tissues, enzymes and hormones [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our result suggest that the vegetables cultivated with 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar had the highest protein content, and if consumed could be a good source of protein. High ash content in foods indicates high mineral content [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The leaves from 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated group were low in mineral content. Consumption of these leaves may not favour maximum mineral supply in the body hence there is need for additional sources of mineral. A high dietary fat content is usually undesirable because it can lead to cardiovascular disorders [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The lowest levels of fat were for leaves grown in 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treatment. Low carbohydrate levels in 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated leaves suggest that this is sufficient to support normal health and could be a nutritional benefit in reducing the high serum lipid values of diabetic patients [
