<p class="p">The differences in vitamin composition between 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> plants cultivated on gas flared (Egbema) and non-gas flared (Umudike) soils showed no statistical differences in any of the vitamin concentrations measured in 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> from the untreated gas flared and non-gas flared soils (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00057-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The vitamin concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> grown on gas flared remediated soil were higher than those on non-gas flared soil for 7.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treated plants, suggesting that 13.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> biochar treatment promoted vitamin synthesis. The result agrees with that of Lou et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-07-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] who reported increased vitamin C concentration in cabbage grown with an aqueous extract of maize straw biochar.
