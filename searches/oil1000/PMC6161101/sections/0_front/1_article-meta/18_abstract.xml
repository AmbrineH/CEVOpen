 <p class="p">This study evaluates the effects of remediation of gas flared soil by biochar on the nutritional composition of cultivated 
  <italic class="italic">Telfairia occidentalis</italic> leaves, relative to non-gas flared soil. Gas flared soils are degraded due to the presence of heavy metals, noxious gases, carbon soot and acidic rain. Biochar produced from oil palm fibre was applied at five different amounts: 0 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 7.1 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 13.9 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 20.9 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 28.0 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to containerized soils (both gas flared and control soil), inside a greenhouse, which were allowed to mineralize for two weeks. Two viable seeds of 
  <italic class="italic">T. occidentalis</italic> per replicate were sown. After eight weeks of growth, leaves were harvested, dried and chemically analyzed. Application of biochar significantly increased leaf ash and crude fibre content of 
  <italic class="italic">Telfairia occidentalis</italic>. Plants from soil treated with 13.9 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of biochar had the highest concentrations of vitamins A, B
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>, B
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, B
  <sub class="sub">6</sub>, C and E irrespective of soil type. Maximum increase in leaf vitamin and mineral content was obtained from leaves cultivated on gas flared soil treated with 13.9 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 7.1 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of biochar respectively. The results show that biochar treatment can increase leaf mineral concentrations and that this effect is dependent on the amount of biochar application.
