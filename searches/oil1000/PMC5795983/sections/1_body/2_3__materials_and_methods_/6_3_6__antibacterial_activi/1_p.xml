<p class="p">Experiments were performed with standard strains from ATCC and clinical isolates (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) obtained from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, São Paulo State University (UNESP-Botucatu Campus). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the use of isolated microorganisms was approved by the Institutional Committee on Human Research (number 47186415.0.0000.5411-8 March, 2015), according to the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, and the strains were submitted to biochemical tests for phenotypic confirmation of the species [
 <xref rid="B67-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The following microorganisms were used: methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) (ATCC 33591), methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA) (ATCC 25923), 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 43895) and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853). Susceptibility assays were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] on 96-well microplates (Costar) with Mueller Hinton broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) culture medium. The sample of essential oil was dissolved in DMSO (Synth, 160,000 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 2.44 to 5000 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The final DMSO concentration was 3% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Bacterial strains were grown (37 °C for 18–24 h) in brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco) and, after standardization by 0.5 McFarland scale, were inoculated (around 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in wells at concentrations previously prepared. After incubation (37 °C for 18–24 h), the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each strain was visually recorded after addition of 50 μL of resazurin (0.01%) in respective wells. Polymyxin B (Latinofarma, Cotia, Brazil) was used as a positive control for Gram-negative bacteria and Cephalothin (Latinofarma) for Gram-positive bacteria. Controls of sterility of the broth, culture control (inoculum), essential oil and DMSO (3%) were performed.
