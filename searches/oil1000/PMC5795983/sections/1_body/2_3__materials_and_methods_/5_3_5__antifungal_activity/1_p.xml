<p class="p">Tested strains were obtained from ATCC and the Laboratory of Fungi Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, São Paulo State University (UNESP-Botucatu Campus). No ATCC strains were molecularly identified and deposited at GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The following microorganisms were used in the evaluation of antifungal activity of the essential oil: 
 <italic class="italic">Candida krusei</italic> (ATCC 6258), 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 36801), 
 <italic class="italic">Candida guilliermondii</italic> (ATCC 22017), 
 <italic class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</italic> (ATCC 90018), 
 <italic class="italic">Candida orthopsilosis</italic> (ATCC 96141), 
 <italic class="italic">Candida metapsilosis</italic> (ATCC 96142), 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (ATCC 90012), 
 <italic class="italic">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic> (strain TLM17LM2, GenBank accession number KX774393, yeast form), 
 <italic class="italic">Microsporum canis</italic> (strain RS5, GenBank accession number KT443098) and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> (ATCC 11480). A microdilution broth susceptibility assay for yeasts and filamentous fungi was performed, as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [

 <xref rid="B66-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], with some adaptations. Assays were performed on 96-well microplates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with RPMI-1640 supplemented with glutamine without sodium bicarbonate (Cultilab, Campinas, Brazil). A sample of essential oil was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Synth, São Paulo) and a serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 2.44 to 5000 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The final DMSO concentration was 3% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). For inoculums, adjustment of yeast (
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. brasiliensis</italic>) was performed using microscopic enumeration with a cell-counting hematocytometer (Neubauer chamber, Knittel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) from the initial growth at RPMI-1640 medium. 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. was grown at 37 °C for 48 h, 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> at 37 °C for 72 h and 
 <italic class="italic">P. brasiliensis</italic> at 35 °C for 10 days. After counting, the inoculums were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cell mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Filamentous fungi, 
 <italic class="italic">M. canis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</italic>, were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) for 7 days at 25 °C before counting. Cell counting in a Neubauer chamber was also performed, and microplates were inoculated with a final concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cell mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The tested systems were incubated in a humid atmosphere, with agitation, at 37 °C for 48 h for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. and 72 h for 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans. P. brasiliensis</italic> was incubated for 14 days at 35 °C with agitation and 
 <italic class="italic">M. canis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</italic> for 10 days at 25 °C without agitation. The experiment was performed in six replicates and the growth inhibition was determined by measuring turbidity of the cultured medium at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as positive control. Controls of sterility of the broth, control culture (inoculum), essential oil and DMSO (3%) were performed.
