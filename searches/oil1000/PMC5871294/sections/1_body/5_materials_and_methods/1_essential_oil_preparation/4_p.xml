<p class="p">Essential oil analysis was performed using gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies Model 5975 C). The gas chromatograph was also provided a capillary column 60 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 mm. The oven program was as follows: temperature increase from 60°C at a rate of 5°C/min up to 250°C and finally held for 10 minutes. The transfer line temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min with a split ratio equal to 1/50. The quadrupole mass spectrometer was scanned over 35 to 465 amu with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and an ionization current of 150 mA.</p>
