<p class="p">The injector and mass spectrometry transfer line temperatures were set at 250°C. Kovat’s indices (KI) was determined by using retention times of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C9-C5) that were injected after the essential oil under the same chromatographic conditions. Tentative identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their relative retention time and mass spectra with Wiley 275 and Adams data libraries for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry as well as those reported previously.
