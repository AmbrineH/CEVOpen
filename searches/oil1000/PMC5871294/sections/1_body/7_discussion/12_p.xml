<p class="p">Antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</italic> essential oil were strong against vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecium</italic> as well as both vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and vancomycin-sensitive 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. Earlier finding showed MIC for 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</italic> essential oil to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was 10 μL/mL. (This was collected from Darab, Fars, rich in α-terpinenyl acetate and 1,8-cineol.) This value (MIC) was ≥15 μL/mL in other 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species.

 </sup> These evidences suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</italic> essential oils are more powerful against these bacteria in comparison to other reported species.
