<p class="p">The growth of the standard and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was inhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</italic> essential oil at concentrations of 0.0.13 and 0.32 μL/mL, respectively. In a previous study, MIC for this essential oil to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was 2.5 ± 0.3 and for 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus hydrangea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus santolinifolia</italic> it was 15 μL/mL.

 </sup> Thus, it seems that our samples are more effective than previous samples. The proper effects of this essential oil on these resistant bacteria may be related to different antibacterial mechanisms of essential oils in comparison to β-lactam antibiotics.
