<p class="p">Our study suggested that the MIC
 <sub class="sub">95</sub> for 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was &gt;128 ÂµL/mL, but in other studies the reported MIC was 20 mg/mL
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> and 0.25 mg/mL, and this value was 0.5 to 1 mg/mL for other

 </sup> The importance of this finding is related to the role of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in progressive noteworthy hospital infections. Also, it possesses inherent multifactorial resistance to several antimicrobials by different mechanisms such as bacterial outer-membrane barrier, multidrug efflux transporters, and endogenous antimicrobial inactivation. Consequently, screening for novel antibacterial against 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is currently considerable.
