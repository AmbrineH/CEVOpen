<p class="p">A systematic evaluation of the interaction of the obtained AgNPs and essential oils in various ratios was carried out in order to emphasize the appearance of synergistic effects in the antibacterial activity of the mixtures. Only an additive effect was computed between the chitosan stabilizing agent and the AgNPs. A remarkable synergistic effect was present in the chitosan-stabilized AgNP–thyme oil mixtures at the 40:1 ratio against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. A similar biological effect was evidenced in the mixtures with clove oil at 20:1 and 40:1 ratios against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Only an “indifferent” effect was present in the case of the antibacterial activity of chitosan-stabilized AgNP–thyme oil mixtures against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, while the formulation with clove oil exhibited a synergistic effect, with the maximum value recorded at the 5:1 ratio.
