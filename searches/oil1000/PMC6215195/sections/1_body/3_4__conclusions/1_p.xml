<p class="p">In the present work, silver nanoparticles stabilized with various types of chitosan were fabricated by a simple, cost-efficient, environmentally friendly electrochemical method. The obtained nanoparticles were quasi-spherical in shape, with an average size of 65 nm and good monodispersity, as observed in a DLS diagram and TEM images. The FTIR spectra show the presence of the polymeric chain attached to the metallic surface.</p>
