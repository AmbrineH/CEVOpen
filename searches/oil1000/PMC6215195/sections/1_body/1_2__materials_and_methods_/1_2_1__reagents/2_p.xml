<p class="p">Essential oils from thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>) and clove (
 <italic class="italic">Szygium aromaticum</italic>) were purchased from Young Living Essential Oils (Lehi, MT, USA) and were used without further purification. The oils were stored at 5 Â°C, and stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were prepared and used in the same day to minimize volatilization and change in chemical properties.
