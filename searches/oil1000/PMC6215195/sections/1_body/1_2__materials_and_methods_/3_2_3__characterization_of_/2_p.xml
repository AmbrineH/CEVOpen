<p class="p">Particle size distribution and the average hydrodynamic diameter were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques, using a ZetasizerNanoZS ZS ZEN 3600 instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) and disposable square polystyrene cuvettes DTS0012 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The determinations were performed on the AgNPs suspensions (as obtained from synthesis). The same instrument, the Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN 3600, was used to perform zeta potential measurements, based on the electrophoretic mobility measurement technique of laser doppler velocimetry (LDV). Folded capillary cells DTS 1060 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) were used for zeta potential analysis.</p>
