<p class="p">The morphology of the Ag nanoparticles was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Bright field micrographs of the sample were obtained with a FEI TEM Tecnai G2F20 TWIN instrument (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A few drops of the aqueous suspensions of the AgNPs (as obtained from synthesis) were dropped on Tedpella carbon-coated Cu grids. The excess liquid was removed by filter paper.</p>
