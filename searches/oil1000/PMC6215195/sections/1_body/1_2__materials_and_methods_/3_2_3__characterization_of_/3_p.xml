<p class="p">Samples were also analyzed by transmission Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), using a Tensor 37 (Bruker, Munich, Germany) and the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet technique. The measurements were recorded in the 4000–400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> range. The KBr pellets were produced as follows: a volume of approximately 100 µL of AgNPs aqueous dispersion was added to ~2 g KBr; the mixture was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 6 h; the dry KBr powder, containing AgNPs, was then used to obtain pellets.
