<p class="p">Synthesis of Ag nanoparticles: AgNPs were synthesized using an electrochemical method with a sacrificial anode [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The synthesis was adapted for commercially available instruments in order to design an easy scalable and cost-saving method able to be implemented in industry. The used device was a laboratory Colloid Master 1000 model, (Colloidmaster GmbH, Isselburg, Germany), based on “True ppm” technology patented by the company. The instrument operates with automatic settings of time and current intensity applied, in order to produce standardized Ag dispersions at nominal concentrations of 6, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm. In the present study, a preliminary experiment was performed on a sample prepared in conditions to obtain a nominal concentration of 6 ppm, in order to confirm the Ag concentration using the inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES), using the instrument Optima 2100 DV ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). A value of 5.83 ppm was found.
