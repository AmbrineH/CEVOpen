<p class="p">The two silver bars working as electrodes were connected to the voltage source of the instrument and placed in a 250-mL glass beaker. An adequate volume of dispersing fluid (distilled water or stabilizer solution) was added. In the modified synthesis method, solutions of various concentrations of stabilizing agents were used to replace the water. The reaction was performed for a period of time ranging from 1 h to 4 h, at room temperature, in the dark, and without stirring. Samples with various concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm) were prepared. Further characterization of products revealed no significant variation in the shape and size of the particles; thus, 25 ppm samples were used for further studies.</p>
