<p class="p">In order to evaluate the synergism between the AgNPs and essential oils, quantitative parameters of antimicrobial activity were determined by the MIC method on selected bacterial strains, using AgNP–essential oil mixtures at various volumetric ratios. The other details of the method are preserved as previously described for Ag dispersion tests. The synergistic effect is analyzed by using the determination of the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), calculated as the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration for the two components of the mixture, FIC (A) and FIC (B), respectively [
