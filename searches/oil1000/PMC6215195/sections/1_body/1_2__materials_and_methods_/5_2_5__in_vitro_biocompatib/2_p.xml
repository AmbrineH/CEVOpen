<p class="p">The cytotoxic effects of the tested AgNP samples on cells were evaluated using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Measurements were performed by using a cytotoxicity detection kit (TOX-7, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The absorbance was read at 490 nm using a microplate reader Tecan Genios, with the optical density (OD) being directly correlated with the cell membrane lysis and cell death.</p>
