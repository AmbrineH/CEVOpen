<p class="p">The normal dermal fibroblast cell line CCD-1070 Sk (CRL-2091) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) was used to test the influence on normal cells of the exposure to the prepared AgNPs. The fibroblast cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Thermo Fisher, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) with pH 7.4, containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g sodium bicarbonate, and 1% PSA antibiotic (penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA). The cells were developed in flasks of 75 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and kept in a humidified atmosphere (95% humidity) containing 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C. For evaluation of the effect of silver nanoparticles on cell viability, dermal fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL in 24-well plates and incubated with different concentrations of nanoparticles for 24 h. Assessment of cell viability was performed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. After the exposure interval, the cell medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/mL MTT and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance was read at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, GENious, Grödic, Germany). Survival rate was expressed as a percentage of the control (untreated cells were represented as 100% viability). Experiments were performed in triplicate.
