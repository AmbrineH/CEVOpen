<p class="p">In most of the cases, for the AgNPs synthesized without a stabilizer, a bimodal distribution of size is recorded; a small population of large aggregates of hundreds of nanometers in size could be observed in intensity mode. The stabilization with the polyelectrolyte chitosan (high molecular weight, HMW, or low molecular weight, LMW) was used to prevent the aggregation of particles. No major difference was noticed between the two types of polymers in the stabilization efficiency; changes in size and size distribution of samples were recorded during a period of 4 weeks of storage (data not shown). The AgNPs prepared in polymeric solutions exhibit smaller average size; for example, in the case of dispersions prepared at 25 ppm concentration, particle diameters were 61.9 nm and 65.4 nm for samples obtained in 0.5% and 0.2% chitosan solutions, respectively, compared to the value of 98.2 nm for the sample synthesized in pure water. The polydispersity index (PDI) ranges from 0.205 to 0.398, which is higher than the accepted value of 0.200, but is close to it nevertheless. Considering the specificity of the electrochemical method used in synthesis and the use of chitosan with medium molecular weight on average, the PDI obtained indicates good monodispersity for polymer-stabilized nanoparticles.</p>
