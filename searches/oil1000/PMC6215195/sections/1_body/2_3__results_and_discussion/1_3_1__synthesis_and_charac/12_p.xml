<p class="p">In order to evaluate the influence of the essential oils on the stability of chitosan-coated AgNPs, a short-term stability test was performed. Samples of chitosan-stabilized AgNPs with and without essential oils (20:1 ratio) were kept at room temperature in the dark, and size and size distribution was measured after 3 days using the DLS method (data not shown). No significant changes were recorded for the average size of particles, and the DLS diagram did not present additional signals showing larger aggregates.</p>
