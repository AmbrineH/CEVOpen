<p class="p">The zeta potential of bare AgNPs was negative (average value âˆ’11.2 mV). AgNPs stabilized with chitosan exhibited positive zeta potentials, with values larger than 50 mV and up to 75 mV, according to the degree of functionalization. The electrostatic repulsion between particles increases at higher values of zeta potential, and thus results in the improvement of the colloidal stability. The positive value of zeta potential is considered as an advantage in the interaction of the particles with the negatively charged bacterial wall, leading to a better internalization.</p>
