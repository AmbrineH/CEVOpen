<p class="p">Polymers (various types of chitosan) were used for surface functionalization to prevent aggregation and increase the stability of the nanoparticles. The formation of the AgNPs in the reaction medium during the electrochemical synthesis was evidenced by measuring optical properties. Absorption spectra of bare and chitosan-stabilized AgNPs are presented in
