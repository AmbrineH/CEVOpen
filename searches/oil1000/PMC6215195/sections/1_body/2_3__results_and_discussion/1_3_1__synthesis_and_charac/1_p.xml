<p class="p">Silver nanoparticles were obtained using a facile, ecofriendly procedure based on the electrochemical method in order to avoid the use of harmful reduction reagents. The bare AgNPs were obtained in distilled water as the dispersion media, without any stabilization agent, and were further used as the reference material in the evaluation of the effect of surface functionalization on the interaction with cells.</p>
