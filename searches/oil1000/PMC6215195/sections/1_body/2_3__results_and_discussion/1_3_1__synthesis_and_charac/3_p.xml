<p class="p">In the spectra recorded for samples of AgNPs prepared in distilled water, both in the presence and absence of polyelectrolytes, absorption peaks at approximately 410 nm are present, corresponding to the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signal of the AgNPs. The SPR absorption band is quite symmetrical and enlarged; the broadening of the signal could be the result of the formation of quasi-spherical particles or a rather large distribution of sizes. Further characterization of the shape and size of the nanoparticles was performed through TEM and DLS methods.</p>
