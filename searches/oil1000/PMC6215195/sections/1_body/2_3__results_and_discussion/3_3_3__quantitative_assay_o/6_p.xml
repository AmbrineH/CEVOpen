<p class="p">Nevertheless, a further study to investigate a possible beneficial effect in the case of using higher concentrations of chitosan mixed in the Ag colloidal dispersion was performed. The interaction between the Ag dispersion and the biopolymer chitosan was analyzed by computation of the fractional inhibitory concentrations index (FICI) from the MIC values of AgNPâ€“chitosan mixture, according to the equation described in the literature [
