<p class="p">The addition of thyme oil to the dispersions of AgNPs stabilized with chitosan (the low molecular weight type) produces a decrease in the MIC values of AgNPs recorded for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains, but the effects are indifferent for all the ratios ranging from 5:1 to 40:1. Synergistic effects were observed in the cases of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, but at mixtures less concentrated in essential oil compared to the formulation with bare AgNPs.
