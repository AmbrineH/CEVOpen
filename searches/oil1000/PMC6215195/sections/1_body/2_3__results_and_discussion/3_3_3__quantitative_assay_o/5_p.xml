<p class="p">No significant variation was recorded when chitosan-stabilized AgNPs were used compared to the unmodified Ag particles with similar sizes. The chitosan polymer is reported to possess an intrinsic antibacterial activity, but the results have been obtained mainly for chitosan nanoparticles or hydrogels. In our experiments on the inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> growth, both types of chitosan used in this study (high molecular weight, HMW, and low molecular weight, LMW) exhibited the same MIC value of 3.125%, which is far larger than the concentration of the polyelectrolyte present as the stabilizer in the AgNP dispersion.
