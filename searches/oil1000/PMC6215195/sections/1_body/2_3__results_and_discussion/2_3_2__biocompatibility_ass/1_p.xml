<p class="p">Since the major concern in using metallic nanoparticles for the fabrication of medical and personal care products is the reported toxicity, our approach is to improve the biocompatibility of AgNPs by coating with a polymeric shell. Thus, chitosan was selected to act both as a stabilizer and to decrease the toxicity of the particles. Chitosan is currently recognized as a highly biocompatible polymer, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for wound dressing applications and for dietary use in some European countries and Japan [

Many papers have reported that the viability of normal cells after exposure to AgNPs decreases in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but no general conclusion could be applied as major differences have been recorded depending on the type of cells, protocol of the experiment, and size and functionalization of the Ag nanoparticles used. The most common use of Ag colloidal dispersions as antibacterial agents is as active compounds in creams, ointments, wound dressings, and hydrogels for topical administration. The normal cells with which the Ag nanoparticles interact in this case are dermal, thus the influence of the AgNPs on the viability of the normal dermal fibroblast cell line CCD-1070 Sk was evaluated as relevant for toxicity assessment.
