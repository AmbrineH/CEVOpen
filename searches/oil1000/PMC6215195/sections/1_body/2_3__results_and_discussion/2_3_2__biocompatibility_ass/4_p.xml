<p class="p">As expected, unmodified AgNPs produced reduction of the cell viability at concentrations higher than 2 ppm, of up to 86% compared to the control for the 10 ppm concentration. For the AgNPs stabilized with HMW chitosan, when using the 0.2% concentration of the polyelectrolyte, an increase in cellular viability was recorded for the concentration of particles up to 5 ppm. With the increase of the chitosan in the stabilizing solution, better functionalization of AgNPs was expected, leading to superior biocompatibility, as was observed in the results of the MTT assay. No significant changes were recorded in the viability of treated cells compared to the control across the whole range of AgNP concentrations used for HMW chitosan at 1% in the stabilizing solution. Similar results were obtained for the other type of chitosan used (LMW), with lower molecular weight.</p>
