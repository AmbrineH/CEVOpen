 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, in such chemical processes, the nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to the high surface energy inherent to the synthesis. In all of the methods, a noble metal precursor must be reduced to its metallic form first and then the formed metallic atom cluster must be able to form a stable sol. To inhibit the irreversible coagulation of particles, a stabilizing agent is usually required [
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Both the stabilizer and the reducing agents used for the preparation might exhibit environmental toxicity [
