<p class="p">Exposure to nanoparticles for medical purposes involves intentional contact or administration; therefore, understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their effect on the body is crucial before clinical use can occur [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The most important limitation in the widespread application of Ag nanoparticles in therapy is the public concern regarding their toxicity [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Physical parameters such as surface area, particle size, surface charge, and zeta potential are very important for providing mechanistic details in the uptake, persistence, and biological toxicity of nanoparticles inside living cells [

 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Recently, many studies have indicated that environmental factors, such as ionic strength, pH, or ionic type could also induce transformations of AgNPs that are expected to affect their properties [
