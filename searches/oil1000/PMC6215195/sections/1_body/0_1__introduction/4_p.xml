<p class="p">Preparation of AgNPs by green synthesis approaches has advantages over conventional methods involving chemical agents associated with environmental toxicity. Green synthesis methods include mixed-valence polyoxometalates, polysaccharides, Tollens process, irradiation, and biological components. The mixed-valence polyoxometalates method involves the use of polyoxometalate derivatives which act as both a reducing agent for silver ions and a capping agent for the nanoparticles produced [

 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Electrochemical synthesis for the fabrication of AgNPs is one of the most used methods, especially for industrial purposes, since it is an ecofriendly, cost-saving, and facile technique to generate localized nanostructures. The possibility of selecting the experimental parameters allows a high degree of control of size and characteristics of the generated nanostructures [
