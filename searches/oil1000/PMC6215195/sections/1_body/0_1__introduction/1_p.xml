<p class="p">Antibiotics have been very effective in controlling bacterial infections in the early part of the last century, thus being considered one of the most important findings in medical practice. Unfortunately, their inappropriate use has rapidly resulted in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Since the first infection with methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) was reported in the United Kingdom in 1962, the phenomenon of resistance has worsened, because now there are already bacteria resistant to nearly all available antibiotics [

With increasing concerns of microbial infections, there is a growing interest in the development of new, effective antimicrobial agents. The former strategy of combatting resisting microorganisms was based on the development of new antibiotics, but this way has been abandoned by many pharmaceutical companies due to financing and regulatory difficulties, aggravated by the rapidity with which the resistance to newly synthesized antibiotics is developed [
