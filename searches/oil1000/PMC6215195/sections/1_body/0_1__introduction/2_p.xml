<p class="p">Nanoparticles with antibacterial properties have been extensively studied during the last decade [
 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], with particular interest in the mechanisms of action against the multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria [
 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This has promoted research in the well-known activity of silver ions and silver-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Silver is an excellent antimicrobial agent because of its broad-spectrum biocidal activity and limitation of the development of resistant microbial strains [
 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Its antiseptic properties have been known since antiquity. Currently, it is widely used in ionic-silver-releasing materials in medical devices, wound dressings, surgical equipment, personal care products, cosmetics, sporting goods, food and water storage, water filters, foods packaging, and so forth. Topical ointments containing some form of ionic silver are also used in many preservative applications (i.e., burn-associated injuries, eczema, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Likewise, metallic silver is used in nanoparticulated materials, which naturally dissolve and oxidize in biological media, rendering partially oxidized nanoparticles with chemisorbed ionic silver on their surfaces.
