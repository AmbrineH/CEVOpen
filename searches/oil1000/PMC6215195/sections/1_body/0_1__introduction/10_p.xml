<p class="p">In the present study, we considered the electrochemical method as a simple, fast, and inexpensive technique to produce colloidal silver with suitable size and size distribution. The rational design of novel AgNPs stabilized with biopolymeric compounds was utilized to ensure a stable, nontoxic metallic Ag nanostructure that combined with essential oils could generate an improved antibacterial efficiency.</p>
