<p class="p">As reported in previous literature, different 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species, including 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">hirtum</italic>, showed high levels of cytotoxicity against cell lines. In particular, the treatment on four different cell lines (Vero, African green monkey, kidney; Hep-2, human epidermoid larynx carcinoma; RSC, rabbit skin; and HeLa, human cervix epitheloid carcinoma) showed IC
