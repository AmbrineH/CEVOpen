<p class="p">The three EOs were successfully used as an oily matrix component of NLC and the biocompatibility of the resulting nanosystems was also tested. A431 and HaCaT cells were exposed to test solutions containing the amount of NLC that gives equivalent EO concentrations as those tested as free EOs, and results are shown in
