<p class="p">In this study we aimed to evaluate the biosafety of the three EOs of the Lamiaceae Family (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic>) as well as of the respective prepared NLC (LNLC, ONLC, RNLC), and to compare their biological effects on two cell lines, namely HaCaT (a normal cell line) and A431 (a tumoral cell line). For that, HaCaT and A431 cells were exposed to a set of concentrations of EOs (see methods for details) during 24 h, and cell viability was accessed using the metabolic indicator Alamar Blue. HaCaT and A431 cell viability results (expressed as percentage of control (non-exposed cells)) of the treatment with the pure EOs are reported in
