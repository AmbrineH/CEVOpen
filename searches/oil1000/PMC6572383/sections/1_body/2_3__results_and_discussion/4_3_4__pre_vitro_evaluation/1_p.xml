<p class="p">In order to characterize the potential mechanisms related to cytotoxicity effects, 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> as pure EO were investigated for their potential capability to interact with model membranes through calorimetric technique. Each oil is characterized by a mixture of different components that influence biomembrane structure [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It is known that compound–membrane interaction is a dynamic phenomenon, influenced by different factors such as compound’s chemical structure and membrane organization. Furthermore, it can also be affected by compound internalization and absorption at the membrane–water interface.
