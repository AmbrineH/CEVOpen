<p class="p">The above considerations highlight that the amount of the surfactant mixture was able to significantly affect the physicochemical properties of EOs NLC but not the EE% of the EO, that was very high (~96%) for all EOs, in accordance with previous findings [

Furthermore, our findings allowed us to select the ratio 4:1 of the mixture Kolliphor/Labrafil, as the ideal surfactants combination leading to the formation of NLC with small particles (&lt;100 nm) and a very broad size distribution (PDI &lt; 0.15), related to a very stable and promising system, as reported by Patravale et al.
