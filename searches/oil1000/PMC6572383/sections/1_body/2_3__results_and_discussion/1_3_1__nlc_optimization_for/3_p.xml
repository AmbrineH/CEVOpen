<p class="p">The results of DOE experiments on NLC prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">intermedia</italic> “Sumian” showed that nanoparticle features are affected by the amount of surfactant and cosurfactant. In particular, a wide variation in response was obtained, with Zave values ranging from 70 nm to 200 nm, while PDI ranged from a minimum of 0.11 to a maximum of 0.35. Coefficient regression values were found to be higher for Zave when compared to PDI. The highest coefficient value found for the surfactant (β1) demonstrates a very high significant effect (
