<p class="p">It is worthy to note that, surprisingly, by decreasing the amount of co-surfactant, an insignificant effect was observed on mean particle diameter. Thus, the exerted energy during nanoparticle production would be enough for coating nanoparticlesâ€™ surface, even using less co-surfactant, thus resulting, contrary to previous literature findings, in reduced sized nanoparticles [
