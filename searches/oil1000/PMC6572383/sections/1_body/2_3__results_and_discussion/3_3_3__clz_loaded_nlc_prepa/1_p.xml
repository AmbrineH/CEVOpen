<p class="p">Based on the obtained results on EOs-NLC, the optimized formulations prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> were selected for CLZ delivery. As reported in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceutics-11-00231" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, drug loading induced a 2-fold increase of mean particles size without affecting their homogeneity. A greater CLZ incorporation capability in NLC prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> EO was shown in respect to RNLC. However, the low values found for the EE% could be due to steric hindrance imparted to CLZ because of the spatial orientation of the phenyl rings, thus limiting not only the in vitro performance as reported by Sabzevari et al., but also the interactions with other components during the formation of NLC [
