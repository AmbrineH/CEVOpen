<p class="p">It is worth noting that even if 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> EO allowed the encapsulation of a greater amount of CLZ (45.81 mg) into the NLC compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> (25.12 mg), it promoted a slower drug release compared to CLZ-RNLC. Indeed, after 24 h a similar amount of CLZ was released from both formulations (almost 4 mg), but after 120 h from the beginning of the experiment, less than 10% of CLZ was released from LNLC while RNLC released almost 40% of the encapsulated drug. These data demonstrate the possibility to prepare lipid nanoparticles with different release profiles, depending on the selected EO used as oily matrix component. In particular, the interesting behavior of CLZ-RNLC is not only related to its ability to provide a sustained prolonged CLZ release, but also to the possibility to economize the amount of the loaded drug, determining the formation of a nanosized colloidal suspension characterized by a long-term physical stability, as previously demonstrated.
