<p class="p">In order to achieve more information on CLZ-RNLC long-term stability, we compared results of the creaming velocity obtained with LUMiSizer

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a the transmission profile across CLZ-RNLC sample in the analytical centrifuge recorded at a given time step during the centrifugation is depicted. The creaming velocities were calculated by Stoke’s law, using the experimental mean nanoparticles size obtained by PCS measurements (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c). Plotting the creaming velocity at different RCF, we obtained a linear increase with the value of RCF, thus confirming that particles migration instability phenomenon follows Stoke’s law. In addition, the closeness between the actual values measured for CLZ-RNLC to the predicted creaming velocities calculated by Stoke’s law using the mean nanoparticles diameter obtained by PCS, confirms that the instability phenomenon could be described by this theoretical model and can be used to extrapolate the creaming velocity at regular gravity of 1 RCF.
