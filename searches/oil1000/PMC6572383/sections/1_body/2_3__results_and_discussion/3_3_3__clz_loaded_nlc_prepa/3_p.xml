<p class="p">In order to confirm the stability of the optimized NLC, we exploited the dispersion analyzer LUMiSizer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. The innovative technology offers the possibility to achieve more time-saving information on sample stability (in terms of particles separation) compared to the traditional visual observation tests that take extensive period to determine the long-term stability of a colloidal suspension. LUMiSizer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> is able to detect fast stability ranking and shelf-life estimation of undiluted dispersions at their original concentration, in minutes/hours instead of months/years, exploiting centrifugal force to accelerate the occurrence of instability phenomena (sedimentation, flocculation or creaming) [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Considering the evolution of the obtained transmission profiles, the stability of the samples can be evaluated. Indeed, under centrifugal force, a stable colloidal dispersion allows the formation of a regular line, while aggregated particles show a typical step-profile, since the centrifugal acceleration induces different sedimentation speeds of particles with different diameter. In this work, the long-term stability of unloaded and CLZ-loaded NLC prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> EO was evaluated measuring the nanoparticles migration phenomena at high RCF, thus obtaining the creaming velocity by tracking the front movements at a specific transmittance with time (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the stability of the NLC formulations decreases in the order: CLZ-RNLC &gt; RNLC &gt; CLZ-LNLC &gt; LNLC. In particular, both unloaded and CLZ-loaded NLC prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> EO showed a greater stability compared to the NLC prepared with 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> EO that showed an increase in creaming velocity directly dependent on the RCF. As we previously reported, different oils are able to differently interact with other components in the formation of drug delivery systems [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that different EOs are able to induce the formation of NLC with different features, which may influence the stability of the colloidal dispersion. This hypothesis should be further investigated in the future, in order to deeper understand NLC features from a morphological point of view.
