 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> EO as potential synergistic oily components. In vitro release profiles of CLZ from the prepared NLC are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. NLC systems were able to promote a prolonged CLZ release, without any initial burst effect, thus confirming drug incorporation into the inner core of nanoparticles, without residual amount of drug absorbed on their surface. These results are in accordance with literature findings concerning drug release profile from NLC. Indeed, as we previously demonstrated, the presence of the liquid oily component in the solid lipid matrix allows the formation of irregular spaces in which the drug can be better accommodated, thus providing a controlled drug delivery [
