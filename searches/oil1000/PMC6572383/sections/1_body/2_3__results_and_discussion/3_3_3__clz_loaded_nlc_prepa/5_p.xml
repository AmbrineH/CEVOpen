<p class="p">The results obtained by the accelerated stability studies, allowed us to establish the potential shelf life of the prepared NLC colloidal suspension, according to the highest industry norms and regulations ISO 13318-1 and ISO 13318-2 (concerning nanoparticle accelerated stability studies). In particular, since the nanoparticle separation, due to the occurrence of creaming phenomena, was not relevant for sample RNLC and CLZ-RNLC, we could reasonably estimate a shelf life of 12 months at 25 Â°C, at least. It is worth noting that the obtained stability results were in perfect agreement with PCS measurements of samples analyzed after 2 and 6 months of storage, showing the absence of significant variations in mean size and polydispersity values (
