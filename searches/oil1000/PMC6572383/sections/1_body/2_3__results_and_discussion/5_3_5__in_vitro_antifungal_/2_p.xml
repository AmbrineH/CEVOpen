<p class="p">A primary overview at these results shows that 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> is the most sensitive strain to the majority of the tested solutions, while 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> seems to be the most resistant one among the three reference strains. Regarding the tested pure EOs (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic>), although little information is provided in the literature, the MICs and MLCs determined for each strain are in accordance to previous findings by Bona et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] within the range of 2â€“4% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) for both EOs in reference and clinical isolated strains of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. Interestingly, 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> as pure EO was found to be more active than 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). This could be probably due to the highest amounts of terpenes in 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> EO (linalool 30% and linalyl acetate 38%) compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> (1,8 cineol 50%), whose antifungal activity against several strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, including 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>, have been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. However, conflicting results are described in literature concerning 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> antifungal activity, such as the lack of anti-candidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> L. samples collected from National Parquet El Hamma (Algiers) reported by Djeddi et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that geographic factors, in addition to seasonal ones, strongly affect the variability of the antifungal activity of this plant, as properly suggested by Ksouri et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Our findings also demonstrated that the antifungal activity of both EOs is retained when they are loaded into the NLC formulations (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00231-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), probably on account of the elevated stability of the lipid matrix that prevents EO dispersion within the exterior medium or within the yeast cells, if cellular internalization is considered. Interesting results were obtained for CLZ-loaded NLC, as the co-existence of drug and EO lead to an improvement of the antifungal activity. As reported by Langevel et al., different studies presented the occurrence of a moderate synergism between EOs and drugs such as antibiotics (most likely due to membrane interactions of the EO compounds), in which case EOs provide an interesting option to reduce the use of antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In particular, CLZ-LNLC provides an increase of the antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> EO of four-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, two-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and eight-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>, while CLZ-RNLC provides an increase of the antifungal activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic> EO of eight-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, four-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and four-fold for 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>. Moreover, the antifungal activity of free CLZ is also increased when loaded into both EO-NLCs for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>.
