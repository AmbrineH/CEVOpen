<p class="p">Based on the encouraging results obtained testing EOs with model membranes, preliminary studies on the antifungal activity of CLZ-loaded EO-NLCs were performed, evaluating the susceptibility of three 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. strains to these formulations. In order to achieve a proper understanding of the effect of each component, loaded and unloaded EO-NLCs were tested, as well as the free drug and the pure EOs. The tested formulations, as colloidal suspensions, presented natural turbidity even after several dilutions, thus we the OD screening measurements after the microplate incubation were very inconclusive. Therefore, the content of the first five dilutions of each formulation was transferred to PDA plates. Colonies formed after 24 h of incubation at 35 Â°C were counted in order to monitor yeast growth and compared to the starting count of the inoculum. Our observations showed that the concentration values that killed the yeast inoculum (no colonies growth and counted) and the immediate lower concentration value allowed the growth of the inoculum (no increase on cell counting). Thus, we considered that the MIC and MLC values were the same for each formulation within the tested concentration ranges. The MICs and MLCs determined for
