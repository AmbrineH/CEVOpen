<p class="p">An accurate highly accelerated qualitative description of the colloidal suspensions stability was performed by means of the multisample analytical centrifuge LUMiSizer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (LUM GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The instrument employs the patented STEP
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>-Technology, which permits the obtainment of Space- and Time-resolves Extinction Profiles, thus measuring the intensity of the transmitted light during centrifugation, as a function of time and position, over the entire sample length.
