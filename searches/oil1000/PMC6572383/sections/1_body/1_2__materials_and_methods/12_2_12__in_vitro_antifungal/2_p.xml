<p class="p">After incubation, the yeast growth was screened by OD measurement at 525 nm and the content of first five dilutions tested of each formulation was transferred into to PDA plates and incubated for a new 24 h period at 35 Â°C. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, considered as the lowest concentration of each solution causing full growth inhibition, and minimum lethal concentration (MLC) values, considered as the lowest concentration of each solution causing fungal death, were determined after visual counting of yeast colonies.</p>
