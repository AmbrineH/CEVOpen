<p class="p">The in vitro antifungal susceptibility test for the selected CLZ-NLC formulations was performed based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference protocols M27-A3 broth microdilution (BMD) method [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] for yeasts, with minor adaptations, using sterile, disposable, multiwell microdilution plates (96 U-shaped wells). The test was performed using three reference strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., namely 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6258 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 90098. For comparative purposes, in addition to the CLZ-LNLC and CLZ-RNLC formulations, LNLC and RNLC systems were also tested, as well as free EOs (L and R) and free CLZ. Briefly, inoculum suspensions were prepared at appropriate densities in RPMI 1640 broth (with L-glutamine, without bicarbonate, and with the pH indicator phenol red) from 24h PDA cultures. Stock solutions of free EOs, CLZ and NLC formulations were prepared in MilliQ water using Tween 80 as a co-solvent, sterilized by filtration and then diluted in RPMI 1640 broth. Free EOs and all NLC formulations were tested at different concentrations in the range 0.03125–2%
