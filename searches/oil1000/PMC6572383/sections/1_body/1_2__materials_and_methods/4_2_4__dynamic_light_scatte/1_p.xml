<p class="p">Mean particle size (Zave), polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential values (ZP) of all unloaded and CLZ-loaded NLC were determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano S90 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). For measurements, samples were properly diluted (50 µL) in 1 mL of ultra-purified water. Each value was measured at least in triplicate and results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</p>
