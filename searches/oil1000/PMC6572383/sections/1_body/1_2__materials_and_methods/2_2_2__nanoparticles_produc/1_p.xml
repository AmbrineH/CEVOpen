The formulation was mixed for 1 min at 11,000 rpm. An external water bath heated at approximately 70 °C was used to maintain the sample temperature. The hot oil-in-water (

The final formulation was then cooled to room temperature leading to the lipid phase recrystallization and finally the lipid nanoparticles were formed [
