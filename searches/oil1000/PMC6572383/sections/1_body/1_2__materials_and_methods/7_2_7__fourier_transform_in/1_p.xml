<p class="p">Freeze-dried NLC obtained with the addition of trehalose (NLC:cryoprotectant ratio 1:10), freezing suspensions at −80 °C and lyophilizing in a freeze-dryer (Lyph-lock 6 apparatus, Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) for 48 h were analysed by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR). FT-IR characterizations of pure CLZ and freeze-dried CLZ-loaded NLC were prepared by using different essential oils were performed using a FT-IR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX I, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an ATR accessory of diamond Zn/Se. For each sample, 16 scans at a resolution of 2 cm
