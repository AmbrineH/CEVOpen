<p class="p">CLZ release from NLC was evaluated by Franz-type diffusion cells (LGA, Berkeley, CA, USA). Before the experiment, the cellulose membranes were moistened by immersion in water for 1 h at room temperature before being mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells. The receptor was filled with water/ethanol (50/50,

The receiving solution was constantly stirred and thermostated at 35 °C to maintain the membrane surface at 32 °C. 500 µL of each formulation was applied in the donor compartment on the membrane surface under non occlusion conditions and the experiments were run for 7 days. At fixed time intervals, 200 µL of the receptor phase were withdrawn and replaced with the same volume of receiving solution. Samples were analysed spectrophotometrically to determine CLZ content.
