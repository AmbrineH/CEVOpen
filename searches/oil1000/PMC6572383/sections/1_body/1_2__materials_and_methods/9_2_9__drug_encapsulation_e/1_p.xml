<p class="p">The amount of the encapsulated CLZ was determined after ultracentrifugation, pellet disruption in Tetrahydrofuran anhydrous (THF), vortex and UV spectrophotometry (Spectrophotometer UV-Vis 1601 Shimadzu, Unilab, Catania, Italy). The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was calculated by the ratio between the amount of drug entrapped in the nanoparticles and the total amount of drug used for their preparation (Equation (1)). The loading capacity (LC%) was calculated by the ratio between the amount of drug unencapsulated in the nanoparticles and the total amount of lipid used for their preparation (Equation (3)):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">LC% = [(amount of encapsulated drug)/(amount of lipid used in the formulation)] Ã— 100
