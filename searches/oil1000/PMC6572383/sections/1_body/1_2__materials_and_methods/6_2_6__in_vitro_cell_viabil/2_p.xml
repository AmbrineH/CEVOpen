<p class="p">Cytotoxicity assay: The cytotoxicity of all samples (pure EOs and NLC systems) was evaluated through the Alamar Blue
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> method. A stock solution of each EO was prepared by diluting each one with DMSO (1:1

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Before the cell treatment, test solutions were obtained by diluting the stock solution in FBS-free culture media, to give concentrations ranging from 0.001% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) to 0.5% EO (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). In order to analyze the cell viability of NLC, each formulation was diluted in FBS-free culture media oils. Cells were treated with different concentrations of the pure EOs and NLC for 24 h. After this period, samples were removed and Alamar Blue solution (10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) in FBS-free medium) was added (100 µL/well). After 5 h of incubation, the absorbance was read at 570 and 620 nm using a Multiskan EX microplate reader (MTX Labsystems, Bradenton, FL, USA), and the cell viability was calculated using the equations recommended by Alamar Blue manufacturers, as described in [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Cell viability is expressed as % of control (non-exposed cells), as mean ± SD, from a set of three independent experiments (each one with quadruplicates).
