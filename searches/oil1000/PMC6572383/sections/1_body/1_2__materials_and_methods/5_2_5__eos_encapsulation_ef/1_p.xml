<p class="p">The amount of EO in the NLC was determined as encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UV spectroscopy [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], using a UV-Vis 1601 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) over wavelengths from 250 to 450 nm (λ max = 260 nm). EE% were calculated after dilutions (1:100) of NLC in methanol, centrifugation and filtration, using the following Equation (1):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">EE% = [(amount of EO entrapped)/(total amount of EO used)] × 100
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
