<p class="p">Biomembrane models were prepared using the TLE method. Briefly, DMPC (25 mg) was dissolved in chloroform in a Pyrex glass test-tube. The organic solvent was removed at 30 °C on nitrogen stream rotavapor (Rotavapor-M Büchi HB-140, VWR International, Milan, Italy). The formed phospholipid films were dried using a Büchi spray dryer (Büchi TO-51) for 24 h, then hydrated by adding different volumes (999, 995, 990, 980 µL) of isotonic PBS pH 7.4. The tube was alternatively vortexed (Heidolph REAX 2000, VWR International, Milan, Italy) and warmed in a water bath at 40 °C for 3 min twice. The temperature was kept higher than that of DMPC gel-liquid crystal phase transition (24 °C) thus allowing the complete hydration of the phospholipids. In order to evaluate the influence of the two selected EOs (

Afterwards, each sample was diluted 1:10 with PBS. The final concentration of the EO in the obtained MLV was in the range of 0.2–0.01% (
