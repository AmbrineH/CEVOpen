<p class="p">DSC studies were performed on diluted MLV as above described. The prepared samples were sealed in an aluminium pan and submitted to DSC analysis to determine the influence of the selected EOs on the thermotropic parameters of phospholipid bilayers used as biomembrane models. A Mettler Toledo DSC 1 STARe system equipped with a PolyScience temperature controller (PolyScience, Niles, IL, USA) was used to perform calorimetric analysis. The detection system was an HSS8 high sensitivity sensor (120 gold–gold/palladium-palladium thermocouples) and a ceramic sensor (Mettler Full Range; FRS5) with 56 thermocouples. The signal time constant was 18 s and the digital resolution of the measurement signal was less than 0.04 μW. Calorimetric resolution and sensitivity determined by TAWN test were respectively 0.12 and 11.9. The sampling rate was 50 values/s. The sensitivity was automatically chosen as the maximum possible by the calorimetric system, and the reference was an empty pan. The calorimetric system was calibrated, in temperature and enthalpy changes, by using indium by following the procedure of the DSC 1 Mettler TA STARe instrument. The reference was an aluminium pan containing 100 μL isotonic PBS (pH 7.4). Each sample was submitted to heating and cooling cycles (two times), in the temperature range 5–55 °C, at a scanning rate of 2 °C/min for heating and 5 °C/min for cooling. We evaluated the results of the second heating. Thermotropic parameters were calculated with Mettler STARe Evaluation software system (version 15.01) installed on an Optiplex 3020 DELL. Pure EOs and NLC were studied with DSC in the same range of temperature used for MLV investigations, results are reported in
