<p class="p">In order to optimize NLC composition, an experimental design was performed by using StatSoft7. A full factorial design was employed for the study, based on two factors and three levels (2
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> full factorial planning). The design was highly suitable for the investigation of quadratic response surface and for generating a second order polynomial model, applied to describe the principal effects and interaction among the identified variables. The independent variables studied in this design such as the concentration of surfactant (A) and the amount of co-surfactant (B) were investigated at three different levels (low, middle and high) and were represented by (−1), (0) and (+1): (i) Surfactant: 3%
