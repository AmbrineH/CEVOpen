<p class="p">Based on these considerations, the aim of the present work was to develop and optimize Mediterranean EOs-loaded NLC for the combined delivery of clotrimazole (CLZ) thus exploiting their potential synergistic effects to the benefit of resistant topical candidiasis treatment. Based on our recent findings, we selected 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">intermedia</italic> “Sumian” and 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">hirtum</italic> as intrinsic and active oily liquid component for the optimization of NLC by design of experiment (DOE). The quality by design (QbD) was developed focusing on the quali-quantitative surfactants mixture, for all the selected EOs. NLC were characterized in terms of mean nanoparticles size, polydispersity, structure and long-term physical stability exploiting LUMiSizer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> technology. In order to deepen the cytotoxicity effects of EOs on microorganism we also performed calorimetric study on biomembrane models. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the biosafety of the selected EOs, pure and loaded into NLC, and to compare the biological effects on two cell lines, namely HaCaT (normal cell line) and A431 (tumoral cell line) selected on the basis of the potential topical application. In vitro antifungal activity against three reference strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., namely 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> was evaluated.
