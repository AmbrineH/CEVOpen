<p class="p">Recently, the worldwide incidence of serious systemic infections has extremely increased, most of these due to fungi of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, thus causing severe opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, especially those affected by cancer, diabetes and AIDS [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Nowadays, the conventional treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> infections requires the use of azoles (clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole), polyenes (amphotericin B, nystatin) and echinocandins [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, different strains of various 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species are developing resistant mechanisms to the treatment with these drugs [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In addition, conventional antifungal drugs often show toxic side effects to human cells [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Based on these considerations, researchers’ efforts in developing novel approaches to improve the effective treatment of fungal infection is growing, with a renewed interest in plants and traditional medicine. In this field, increasing attention has been paid to essential oils (EOs) as promising natural compounds for their different activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, immune-modulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. It has been reported that their broad-spectrum activity against a variety of microorganisms is probably due to the alteration of the membrane and cell wall of microorganisms, with consequent loss of cytoplasmic material [
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. EOs pharmacological activities, mainly related to their complex chemical composition and high concentrations of phenols, make these compounds particularly interesting for both the treatment and the prevention of candidiasis [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, EOs low water solubility, high volatility and high instability (oxidation and hydrolysis), strongly limit their practical use in foods, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In order to overcome these drawbacks, nanotechnologies have been proposed as a potential valid strategy for EOs encapsulation [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Recently it has been reported that the encapsulation of 
 <italic class="italic">Caryophyllata</italic> EO in SLN improved the rate of microbial killing, reducing the concentration for inhibiting and killing micro-organisms, demonstrating the advantages and efficiency of SLN in combating microbial pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. SLN containing 
 <italic class="italic">Zataria multiflora</italic> EO were successfully prepared, having a mean size of 650 nm, with 93.2% of the essential oil released after 24 h [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> EO-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers NLC were developed exploiting a synergistic effect between the EO and oleic acid, whose synergism enhanced cell proliferation to confer an advantage in the treatment of wound healing [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia arborescens</italic> was successfully incorporated into SLN without affecting the in vitro EO antiherpetic activity [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Lai et al., also demonstrated the capability of SLN of greatly improving the 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia arborescens</italic> oil accumulation into the skin, and that oil permeation occurred only when the oil was delivered from the control solution [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. We recently found that 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">intermedia</italic> “Sumian” and 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">hirtum</italic> can be successfully used as matrix components and active ingredients of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), thus exploiting their relevant anti-inflammatory (or antioxidant) activity, enhancing their biocompatibility and reducing the cytotoxicity of the pure oils [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Other authors also reported the possibility to exploit different drug delivery systems for the encapsulation of EOs, such as polymeric poly(varepsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocapsules [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], chitosan nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-11-00231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>].
