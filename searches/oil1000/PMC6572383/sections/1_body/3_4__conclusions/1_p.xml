<p class="p">Taken all together, our results allow us to infer that the nanoencapsulation of the selected antifungal drug into NLC systems prepared using Mediterranean EOs as intrinsic oily components represents a promising strategy to improve CLZ effectiveness against candidiasis. In particular, our results open the debate concerning the possibility to exploit the intrinsic properties of
