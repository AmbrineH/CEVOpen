 <p> Creaming velocity prediction of CLZ-RNLC. ( a) Evolution of transmission profiles at 3000 RCF. ( b) Volume based size distribution of CLZ-RNLC suspension. ( c) Transient variation of the front position in panel ( a). The fitter straight line is determined as the creaming velocity. ( d) Comparison of the measured creaming velocities and the theoretical values from Stokeâ€™s law at different RCFs. </p>
