<p id="Par16" class="p">The essential oil chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010 Plus), and helium (He) as carrier gas. A capillary column Factor Four/ VF-5 ms, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 mm film thickness was used. The carrier gas flow rate was 1 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The initial oven temperature was 60 °C. After heating for 2 min, it increased at a constant rate of 2 °C per minute up to 110 °C; then 3 °C per minute to 150 °C; and 15 °C per minute to 290 °C to a final, isotherm 290 °C for 17 min. The injector and detector temperatures were respectively 250 °C and 310 °C. The mode of injection was split and the injection volume was 1 mL. Mass spectra were produced by electron impact (70 eV). Quantitative analysis of the essential oil composition was made on a gas chromatograph, coupled with HP5890 Series II ionization detector, using the same operating conditions and the same type of column as the CG/EM analysis (except for the injector and detector temperatures, which were of 220 °C and 250 °C, respectively). The percentage of each constituent is calculated by the integral of the area under the respective peaks to the total area of all the constituents of the sample. The various constituents of the essential oil were identified by visual comparison of their mass spectra with those in the literature [
