<p id="Par18" class="p">The antimicrobial activity of PAEO and its major component was performed from the disk diffusion test on Mueller Hinton Agar, as detailed on the Antibiogram item. Sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were soaked with PAEO (20 μL) and 98% Carvacrol (20 μL) (Sigma). The antimicrobial effect was detected by the formation of inhibition zones around the disks soaked with PAEO and carvacrol. The halos were measured in millimeters, labeled as bioactive those larger than 15 mm. As positive and negative control, tetracycline (30 μg) and disks soaked with 20 μLTween 80 solution 3% were used, respectively.</p>
