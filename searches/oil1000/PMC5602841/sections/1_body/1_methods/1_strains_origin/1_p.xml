 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains isolated from pasteurized milk (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12) and shrimp (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 23) were used. All strains are part of the bacterial catalogue available at Center for Applied Molecular Bioprospecting and Experimentation (NUBEM - INTA College) and had the following biochemical characteristics: Gram-positive cocci, catalase-positive, manitol-positive and coagulase-positive. The strains, maintained in Tryptone Soy Broth with 20% glycerol, were plated onto Mannitol Salt Agar (35 °C for 48 h) and isolated Tryptone Soy Agar for performing microbiological analyzes.
