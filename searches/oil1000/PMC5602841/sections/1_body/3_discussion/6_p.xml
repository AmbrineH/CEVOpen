<p id="Par33" class="p">All strains (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 35) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were sensitive to PAEO and carvacrol. Most strains isolated from milk showed sensitivity to tetracycline with halos of 21–25 mm (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 11; 91.6%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). When subjected to the test with carvacrol, 100% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12) demonstrated halos size of an equal sensitivity or greater than those of positive control. Moreover, inhibition halos of an equal or greater than those of positive control were observed in 66.6% of the tested strains from milk with OEPA.
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains isolated from shrimp showed sensitivity to tetracycline and most of them presented halos between 31 to 40 mm (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 13, 56.52%) in size (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). When tested with carvacrol and OEPA, 39.13% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 9) and 13.04% (n = 3) strains showed, respectively, halos sizes greater than or equal to control. Thus, the carvacrol was also more effective when used against the strains of shrimp samples. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of PAEO seems to be related to the concentration of carvacrol (88.17%), whereas all strains were susceptible to both compounds tested and the largest halos were observed when using carvacrol.
