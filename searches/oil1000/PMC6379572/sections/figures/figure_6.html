 <p> Morphological changes of lipid droplets in the liver of HPS mutant mice Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets in the liver cells of ( A) WT, ( B) pa, ( C) ru, and ( D) ep mutant mice. Scale bar: 25 Î¼m. ( E) Quantitation analysis of the numbers of lipid droplets per area. The images were analyzed with NIH ImageJ software; n=9, *** P&lt;0.001. (F) Quantitation analysis of the mean diameters of lipid droplets. The total number of lipid droplets analyzed: 2388 lipid droplets from WT mice, 2744 lipid droplets from pa mice, 2079 lipid droplets from ru mice, 4102 lipid droplets from ep mice, *** P&lt;0.001. </p>
