<p class="p">In recent years, more and more studies have shown that various lipids in plasma are directly related to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Amongst them, multiple lipid classes have different atherosclerosis-associated effects, such as Cer, DAG, SM, PA, LPS, and Cho, and they promote the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis in various ways. Briefly, LPS and Cho promote foam cell formation and thrombosis [

TAGs containing saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid side chains have an atherogenic effect, while TAGs containing PUFA side chains have an anti-atherosclerosis effect [
