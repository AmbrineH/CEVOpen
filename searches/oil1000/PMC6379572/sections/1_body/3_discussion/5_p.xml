<p class="p">Our results also indicate that different HPS proteins perform different functions in the process of lipid metabolism. The main site of lipid metabolism is in hepatocytes, where lipids are mainly stored in lipid droplets, which are independent organelles that include a lipid-rich core and surrounding phospholipid monolayers. The lipid droplets are generated from the phospholipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum and are formed by budding. Their synthesis and transport are complex processes that involve many proteins. Carboxylesterase 3 and CIDEB (cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-like effector B) are known to be involved in the transport of lipids from lipid droplets to VLDL [
