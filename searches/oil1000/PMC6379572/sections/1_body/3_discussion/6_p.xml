<p class="p">Experimental results of Oil Red O staining in the three mutant mice showed that the mean diameter of lipid droplets decreased in the hepatocytes of 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice. While the number of lipid droplets significantly increased and the mean diameter of lipid droplets significantly decreased in the hepatocytes of 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice. Since these HPS proteins are involved in the vesicle trafficking process from endosomes to lysosomes and lysosomal-associated organelles, these three HPS proteins may be involved in the formation or fusion of the lipid droplets. According to the lipid droplet phenotypes, we speculated that HPS9 and HPS6 may play some role in the formation of lipid droplets or lipids transportation toward lipid droplets. Loss of HPS9 or HPS6 may lead to the formation of smaller lipid droplets. HPS1 may play a role in the fusion of lipid droplets, and may also be involved in lipids sorting out from lipid droplets or lipids degradation through autophagy. The underlying mechanism requires further study. Moreover, these results also imply that other HPS proteins may also perform certain functions in lipid metabolism.
