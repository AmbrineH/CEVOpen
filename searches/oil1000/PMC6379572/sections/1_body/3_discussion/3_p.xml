<p class="p">There is no direct evidence for the correlation of 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mutant with atherosclerosis. However, in a study of melanosomes, HPS9 and HPS6 were shown to act in the same pathway during melanogenesis [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. It can be seen from our lipidomic results that Cer, DAG, TAG, and SM were reduced in 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mice compared with WT mice whereas TAG (containing DHA) was increased (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These plasma lipid changes in 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mice are similar to those in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice. The similar results from the Oil Red O staining of liver from 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice are additional support to their similar effects on lipid metabolism. Therefore, we speculate that 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mice may have an anti-atherosclerotic phenotype upon an atherogenic diet. However, this speculation requires future investigation.
