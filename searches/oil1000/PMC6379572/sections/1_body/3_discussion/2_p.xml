<p class="p">The underlying mechanism of different anti-atherosclerotic phenotypes of HPS mutants after stimulation with a high-cholesterol diet is unknown [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The different changes in plasma lipids observed in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice are consistent with their phenotypes that promotes or resists atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This provides a possible explanation for the differential anti-atherosclerotic effects exhibited by different HPS mice after stimulation with a high-cholesterol diet.
