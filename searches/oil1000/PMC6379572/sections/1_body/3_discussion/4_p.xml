<p class="p">Additionally, atherosclerosis is considered to be associated with NAFLD and IR. The increase in PA, LPS, TAG, SM, and Cho in the plasma of 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice and the phenotype of hepatic lipid droplets accumulation may also indicate its role in promoting atherosclerosis. Therefore, our results provide an early warning to HPS patients. For example, HPS1 patients should pay more attention to diet in an effort to avoid the risk of atherosclerosis caused by a high-fat diet. It also suggests that the early monitoring of plasma lipid levels is very important to prevent cardiovascular disease.
