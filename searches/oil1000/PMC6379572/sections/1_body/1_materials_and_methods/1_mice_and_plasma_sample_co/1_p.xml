Swankâ€™s laboratory. All these mutants arose from spontaneous mutations in the C57BL/6J background. These mice were bred at the animal facility of the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of IGDB. The mutant mice were maintained as homozygotes through intercrosses of heterozygotes. The genotypes of these mutants were confirmed by PCR genotyping methods based on the nature of the mutations [
