<p class="p">Lipids were extracted from plasma (20 µl) using a modified Bligh and Dyer’s extraction procedure (double rounds of extraction) and dried in the SpeedVac [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Lipidomic analyses were carried out on an Exion UPLC system coupled with a QTRAP 6500 PLUS system (Sciex) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In brief, polar lipids were separated on a Phenomenex Luna Silica 3 µm column (i.d. 150 × 2.0 mm) under the following chromatographic conditions: mobile phase A (chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide, 89.5:10:0.5) and mobile phase B (chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide:water, 55:39:0.5:5.5) at a flow rate of 270 µl/min and column oven temperature at 25°C. Individual polar lipid species were quantitated by referencing to spiked internal standards including phosphatidyl choline (PC)-14:0/14:0, d31-PC16:0/18:1, phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE)-14:0/14:0, d31-PE-16:0/18:1, phosphatidyl serine (PS)-17:0/20:4, d31-PS-16:0/18:1, phosphatidic acid (PA)-17:0/17:0, PA-17:0/20:4, phosphatidyl glycerol (PG)-14:0/14:0, d31-PG-16:0/18:1 glucosylceramide (GluCer)-d18:1/8:0, ceramide (Cer)-d18:1/17:0, C14:0-lysobisphosphatic acid (LBPA), d31-phosphatidyl inositol (PI)-16:0/18:1, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-d17:1, sphingolipids (Sph)-d17:1, sphingomyelin (SM)-d18:1/12:0, lyso-phosphatidylserine (LPS)-17:0, LPC-17:0, LPE-17:0, LPI-17:0, LPA-17:0 obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, U.S.A.) and PI-8:0/8:0 from Echelon Biosciences, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A.). GM3 species were quantitated using GM3 d18:1/17:0 synthesized in-house as an internal standard. All polar lipids were analyzed in the ESI mode. PC, Cer, GluCer, SM, S1P, and Sph were detected in the positive ion mode, while remaining polar lipids were detected in the negative ion mode.
