<p class="p">Glycerol lipids including diacylglycerols (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG) were quantitated using a modified version of reverse-phase HPLC/MRM in the ESI-positive ion mode [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Separation of neutral lipids were achieved on a Phenomenex Kinetex-C18 2.6 µm column (i.d. 4.6 × 100 mm) using an isocratic mobile phase containing chloroform:methanol: 0.1 M ammonium acetate, 100:100:4 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 170 µl for 17 min. Levels of short-, medium-, and long-chain TAGs were calculated by referencing with spiked internal standards of TAG(14:0)3-d5, TAG(16:0)3-d5, and TAG(18:0)3-d5 obtained from CDN isotopes, respectively. DAGs were quantitated using d5-DAG16:0/16:0 and d5-DAG18:1/18:1 as internal standards (Avanti Polar Lipids).
