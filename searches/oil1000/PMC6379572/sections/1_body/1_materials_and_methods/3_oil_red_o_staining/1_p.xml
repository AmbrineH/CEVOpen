<p class="p">The WT, 
 <italic class="italic">pa, ru</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mutant mice were starved for 12 h and their livers were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The lipid droplets of livers were stained with Oil Red O. Briefly, 5–10 μm cryosectioned livers were fixed in ice-cold 10% formalin for 5–10 min, rinsed with distilled water for three-times, and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma, Cat# O0625-25G) solution (0.5% Oil Red O in propylene glycol) for 8–10 min in room temperature for 15 min. Then the slides were differentiated in 85% propylene glycol solution for 2–5 min and rinsed with distilled water for two-times. Nuclei were stained with Mayer’s Hematoxylin for 30 s, washed in running tap water, and mounted in aqueous mounting medium. The images were obtained by Nikon microscope (model eclipse Ci-L) and Nikon microscope camera (model DS-Ri2).
