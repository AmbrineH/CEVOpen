<p class="p">The human body maintains the metabolic homeostasis of lipids through precise regulatory mechanisms. Once the lipid homeostasis is disturbed, arterial lesions may occur. Therefore, an in-depth study of the metabolic processes of lipids will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Hepatocytes are the main sites of lipid metabolism, and play an important role in lipid metabolism. The lipid metabolism process in hepatocytes directly affects the content of various lipids in plasma [
