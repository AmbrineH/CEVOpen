<p class="p">Many studies in recent years have shown that several Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] proteins are involved in the vesicular transport of intracellular cargoes to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (LROs) [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. HPS is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency, and ceroid deposition in several tissues. HPS may cause lung fibrosis, colitis, and cardiomyopathy in some cases [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The main pathogenesis of HPS is the disrupted biogenesis and/or function of LROs, including melanosomes, Weibel–Palade bodies (WPB), and platelet-dense granules (DG) as well as secretory lysosomes [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15–19</xref>]. Based on the important role of these HPS proteins in intracellular vesicle trafficking, we hypothesize that HPS proteins are likely to be involved in lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, thereby affecting lipid content in plasma. In one pilot study, five genetically distinct HPS mutants were studied for this purpose. After consuming an atherogenic diet for 14 weeks, 
 <italic class="italic">Hps6</italic> mutant mice (ruby-eye, 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic>) had significantly less atherosclerotic lesions than the wild-type (WT) control. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Hps1</italic> mutant mice (pale ear, 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic>) had lesions similar to WT animals. After 48 weeks, 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice showed greater than 50% survival. In contrast, no animals from the 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice or the WT C57BL/6 strains survived. Even before 40 weeks, the survival rate of 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice was lower than that of the WT control group [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. These data implied that different HPS proteins play different roles in lipid metabolism.
