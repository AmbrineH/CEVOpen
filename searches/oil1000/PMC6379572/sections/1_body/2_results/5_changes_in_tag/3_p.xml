<p class="p">The increase in TAG containing a DHA (22:6) side chain in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice may contribute to the atherosclerosis resistance effect observed in these mice. The increase in TAG in 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice, especially TAG containing saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, may relate to an atherogenic phenotype. Several lipids containing a MUFA or a saturated fatty acid are decreased in the 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> group, although there is no significant change compared with the WT group in terms of the total TAG. These observations suggest that the distinct effects of various HPS mutants are not only related to the total TAG levels but also to the fatty acid chain length and the degree of unsaturation.
