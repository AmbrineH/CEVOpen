<p class="p">Our results showed that the total TAG level was significantly increased in the 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> group. In 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice, although no significant change in total TAG was observed, TAG species with a fatty acid chain containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6) were increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A,B). It was reported that fats containing saturated fatty acids of chain length 12:0â€“16:0 increased the serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), while the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduce the LDL-C level [
