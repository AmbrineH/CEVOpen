<p class="p">Similarly, IR and inflammation are also potential pathogenic factors of atherosclerosis. TAG species containing saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids correlate positively with IR whereas TAGs containing essential fatty acids correlate negatively with IR [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (n-3, PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3), and DHA (C22:6 n-3) have been proven to exhibit a protective effect on heart disease and can reduce inflammation. The inflammatory response of endothelial cells plays an important role in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis [

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] demonstrated that linolenic acid stimulated the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB and activator protein 1, and significantly enhanced the mRNA level of the inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. By comparison, oleic acid and the n-3 fatty acid DHA were demonstrated to inhibit cytokine-induced expression of VCAM-1 and other indices of endothelial activation in cultured cells [
