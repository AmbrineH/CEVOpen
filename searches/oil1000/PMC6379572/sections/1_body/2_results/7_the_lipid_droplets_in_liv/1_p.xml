<p class="p">Hepatocytes play a central role in lipid metabolism and are the major sites for the production of plasma lipoproteins. We stained the frozen sections of liver tissues of WT and the three mutant mice by Oil Red O staining. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows a representative picture of the lipid droplets (red) in the liver cells of each mouse. The results showed that there was no significant change in the number of lipid droplets in the 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice, while the number of lipid droplets in the 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice significantly increased compared with that of WT mice. The diameter of the lipid droplets was significantly reduced in all the three mutant mice. Especially, the mean diameter of lipid droplets is the smallest in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice. This indicated that in these three mutant mice, the lipid metabolism in the liver has different degrees of abnormality, suggesting that these three HPS proteins play certain functions during the formation or fusion of lipid droplets.
