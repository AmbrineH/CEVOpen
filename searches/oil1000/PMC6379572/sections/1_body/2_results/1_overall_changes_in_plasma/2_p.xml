<p class="p">The changes in the plasma lipid profiles for various mutants together with WT mice were analyzed and the overall changes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. In particular, we focussed on the lipid classes with statistically significant changes in the mutants compared with the WT mice. Of 22 classes of lipids measured, DAG was reduced and CE was increased in 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mice. PI and DAG were reduced, while PE, LPE, and CE were increased in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice. PA, LPS, TAG, Cho, LPE, GluCer, and CE were increased in 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice (
