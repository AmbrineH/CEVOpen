<p class="p">The data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> provide an overview of the changes in various lipid compositions in the plasma of different HPS mutants. The proportion of every single lipid class detected in terms of total lipids was further calculated for the mutant and WT mice as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The most abundant lipids in plasma were CE and PC followed by Cho, TAG, and LPC. In three mutant mice, the proportion of the above mentioned lipids did not change significantly compared with those in the WT mice. Only the proportion of CE in 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> mice significantly increased. For those lipids found in small proportions, the DAG ratio was reduced in all three mutants. In 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice, the proportion of PI, Cer, and PS was significantly decreased, while the proportion of LPE was significantly increased. Moreover, the PI and PS ratios were significantly decreased in 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice. The reduced proportion of Cer in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice may be responsible for the distinct phenotypes observed between the 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice.
