<p class="p">In our study, there was no significant change in total plasma Cer amongst the three mutant mice compared with the WT mice, but some special species of Cer, Cer d18:0/24:1, Cer d18:1/18:0, were significantly reduced in the 
 <italic class="italic">pa</italic> group, and Cer18:0/16:0 was significantly reduced in the 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Ceramides have been shown to be associated with apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and promote apoptosis of a variety of cells, including endothelial cells. Endothelial cell apoptosis is recognized as an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. Several studies have recently found that Cer is associated with atherosclerosis. ApoE-deficient mice, a well-known atherosclerotic model, have significantly increased plasma lipids after exposure to cigarettes, including Cho, ceramides, and cerebrosides [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Inhibition of the enzyme involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis in ApoE-deficient mice reduced plasma levels of SM, Cer, and S1P, resulting in a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesions [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The decrease in Cer18:0/16:0 in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice compared with WT may be related to the atherosclerosis-resistant property in the mutant mice. This result was in agreement with the decrease in the proportion of Cer in 
 <italic class="italic">ru</italic> mice, further supporting the potential atherosclerosis-protective effect in this mutant.
