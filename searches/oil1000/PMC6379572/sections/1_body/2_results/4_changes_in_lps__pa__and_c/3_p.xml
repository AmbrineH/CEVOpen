<p class="p">The Cho level was increased in 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice compared with WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>E). Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, and drug treatment that lowers plasma cholesterol levels can reduce cardiovascular morbidity. Aggregated LDL is absorbed by macrophages, resulting in cellular cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. A sustained increase in plasma cholesterol levels is associated with increased cholesterol deposition in the intima, which initiates and promotes the progression of atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Therefore, the elevation of LPS, PA, and Cho in the plasma may put 
 <italic class="italic">ep</italic> mice at high risk of developing atherosclerosis.
