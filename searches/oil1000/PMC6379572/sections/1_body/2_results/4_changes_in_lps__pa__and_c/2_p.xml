 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>C,D). Macrophages and dendritic cells are specialized phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells that provide immune surveillance and bridge the innate and adaptive immune system. Particular antigens are engulfed by phagocytosis, while soluble antigens are internalized by macropinocytosis. On the plasma membrane of macrophages and immature dendritic cells, the content of PA increased. PA has been shown to promote actin polymerization by increasing the concentration of monomeric actin and controlling the cleavage of filaments. Actin polymerization has a driving effect on the phagocytosis and macropinocytosis of the above antigens [
