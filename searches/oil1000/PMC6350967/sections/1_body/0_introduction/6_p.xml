<p class="p">While several species of the family 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntiaceae</italic> have been investigated, there is a dearth of information on the biochemical properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> (phytochemical composition, essential oils, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic activities). This study aimed to estimate the total phenol, flavonoid, flavonol, proanthocyanidin, tannins, alkaloids, saponins and phytate contents in the water, acetone and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes as well as the vitamins A,E and C content and essential oils composition. The study also investigated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and the cytotoxic profile of the plant in order to justify its traditional use and add to the body of knowledge.
