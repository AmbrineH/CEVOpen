<p class="p">Since ROS are very important in cellular homeostasis and body physiology, regulation of ROS via the body's endogenous antioxidants is a safe means to keep ROS production in check. However when this fails (which happens in diseases), reversing the process through other means becomes very important. Over the years antioxidant supplementation has been used for the prevention and management of ailments caused by oxidative stress[

Their mechanism of actions includes inhibition of the catalytic enzymes involved in ROS production, Scavenging of ROS, and upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defence [
