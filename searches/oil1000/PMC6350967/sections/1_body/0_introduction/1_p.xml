<p class="p">Oxidative stress (OS) occurs as a result of an imbalance between generated reactive metabolites also known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's antioxidant system. It is a normal physiological condition created to maintain redox homeostasis. However, persistence in the imbalance can cause cellular damage and eventually disease. ROS are known to act on some signalling pathways, modulating physiological responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. ROS are generated through the electron transport chain in the mitochondria, and the cytochrome P450 [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Proteins and lipids are some of the major targets for attack, and their modification can lead to some diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. ROS has been linked to a number of diseases, most of which are chronic diseases. They include atherosclerosis[

 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], diabetes[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], cancer[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] etc. Most of these diseases have a background inflammation, which is chronic in nature and involves the release of ROS. In some cancers, ROS is known to promote cell survival and proliferation [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] as well as play a role in drug resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. ROS is equally involved in the expression of inflammatory markers [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] some of which play a role in cell proliferation and metastasis[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] as well as mediate immunity [
