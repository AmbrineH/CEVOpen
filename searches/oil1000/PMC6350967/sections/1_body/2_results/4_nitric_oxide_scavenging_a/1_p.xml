<p class="p">In this study, the extracts and standards (vitamin C and gallic acid) show a concentration- dependent scavenging activity. The ethanol extract showed the highest antioxidant activity at 52.54% Â± 0.1. It was higher than the standards used in this study. The IC50 values of the various extracts (ethanol, 0.97mg/ml; acetone, 1.04mg/ml; aqueous, 1.12mg/ml) were comparable to vitamin C (1.18mg/ml) and gallic acid (1.18mg/ml). The result of the nitric oxide scavenging activity is depicted in
