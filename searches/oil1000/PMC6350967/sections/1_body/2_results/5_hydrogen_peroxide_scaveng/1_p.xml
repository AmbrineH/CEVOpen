<p class="p">In this study, the extracts and standards (vitamin C and gallic acid) show a concentration- dependent scavenging activity. The result showed that the aqueous extract had the highest scavenging activity at 98.63% Â± 0.01. It was equally higher than the standards used. All the extracts and standards used recorded high inhibitory activities. The acetone, aqueous, ethanol, vitamin C and gallic acid had IC50 values of 0.375, 0.374, 0.379, 0.376 and 0.379mg/ml respectively. These results show that all the extracts used are capable of inhibiting hydrogen peroxide radical.
