<p class="p">The results of the DPPH scavenging activity of the extracts are as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209682.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>. The results showed that ethanol extract had the highest scavenging activity of the extracts at 73.79% Â± 0.01. Although none of the extracts in this study had a higher activity than vitamin C and gallic acid used as standards. The acetone, aqueous, ethanol, vitamin C and gallic acid had IC50 values of 0.511, 0.518, 0.510, 0.436 and 0.439mg/, respectively. The study showed that the various extracts have compounds capable of donating protons to the free radicals. This confirms the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> to exhibit DPPH free radical scavenging activity.
