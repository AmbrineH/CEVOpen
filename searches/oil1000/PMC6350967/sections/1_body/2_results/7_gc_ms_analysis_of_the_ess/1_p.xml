 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209682.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). 46 compounds were identified in the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic>. They include beta-copaene (7.54%), octasiloxane 1,1,3,3,5,5,9,9, 11,11,13,13,15,15- hexadecamethyl- (4.75%), Cyclotrisiloxane, hexamethyl- (3.83%), alpha-pinene (3.12%), alpha.-Ionone (2.45%), and 5-Methyl-2-trimethylsilyloxy-acetophenone (2.33%). The composition of compounds in the essential oil consisted of monoterpenes, cyclic terpenes, sesquiterpenes, fatty acids, phenols, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. Some of these compounds are known to exhibit some biochemical activity. Beta-ionone and terpinolene, two of the compounds found in the essential oil of
