<p class="p">The reducing abilities of the different extracts determined by Phosphomolybdenum (total) scavenging activity were measured spectrophotometrically by their absorbances and summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209682.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>. The extracts and standards (vitamin C and gallic acid) show a concentration- dependent scavenging activity. In this study, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> exhibited the highest total antioxidant capacity at 67.87% ± 0.004. The acetone and the ethanol extracts had activities of 66.15% ± 0.006 and 65.97% ± 0.001 respectively. The scavenging activity of the three extracts was not significantly different and was higher than that for vitamin C and gallic acid. The IC50 values of 0.297, 0.3158, 0.2959, 0.2961, 0.2952 mg/ml were recorded for the acetone, aqueous, ethanol, vitamin C and gallic acid respectively. This study confirms the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes, and its ability to mop up free radicals.
