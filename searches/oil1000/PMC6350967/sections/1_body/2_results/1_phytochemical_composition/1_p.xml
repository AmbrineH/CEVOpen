<p class="p">In this study, the amount of the various phytochemicals investigated varied significantly among the various extracts studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209682.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The total phenolic content of the different solvent extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes showed variable yields in this study. The yields were 101.81mg/g, 82.54mg/g, 54.98mg of GAE equivalent per gram of dried extract of acetone, aqueous and ethanol respectively. The acetone extract of the 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes yielded significantly higher phenolic contents than the aqueous and ethanol extract (P &lt; 0.05).The aqueous extract was also significantly higher than the ethanol extract (P&lt; 0.05). The total flavonoid content of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> exhibited a higher yield of 57.93mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of dried extract. The acetone and aqueous yields were 20.37, 17.01 mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of dried extract respectively. The ethanol extract showed significantly higher yields than the aqueous or acetone extract (P&lt; 0.05). The acetone extract had a higher flavonol content at 16.11mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of dried extract compared to aqueous extract of 10.84mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of dried extract. The ethanol extract was negligible at 1.9mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of dried extract. The acetone and the aqueous extracts showed significantly higher yields when compared to the ethanol extract (P&lt;0.05). The acetone extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes gave the highest yield of total proanthocyanidin content at 10.4mg of catechin equivalent per gram of dried extract. The catechin equivalent per gram of dried extract of the aqueous and ethanol extracts were 9.2 and 6.4mg, respectively. The total tannin content of the acetone, aqueous and ethanol extracts were 18.38,5.84 and 8.32mg of GAE equivalent per gram of dried extract, respectively.
