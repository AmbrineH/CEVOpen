<p class="p">Vitamin C estimation was done by the method described by Igwe and Okwu [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. A 1g of the pulverised plant was put in 20ml of 0.4% oxalic acid. It was then filtered using a Whatman filter paper, and 1ml of the filtrate was mixed with 9ml of indophenol reagent. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 520nm. The vitamin C standard was also prepared in the same way at varying concentrations, and a standard curve plotted. Results were expressed in mg/100g using the following equation based on the calibration curve:
