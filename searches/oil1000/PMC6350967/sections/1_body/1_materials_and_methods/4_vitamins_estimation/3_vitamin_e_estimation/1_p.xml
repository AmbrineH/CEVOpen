 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. 20ml of ethanol was added to 0.5g of the pulverized sample and then left on a shaker for 20mins. It was then filtered. 1ml of the filtrate was then mixed with 1ml of 0.2% of ferric acid in ethanol and 1ml of 0.5% α-α-dipyridine. The solution was made up to 5mls with distilled water. The absorbance of the solution was read at 520 nm. The vitamin E standard was also prepared in the same way at varying concentrations, and a standard curve plotted. Results were expressed in mg/100g using the following equation based on the calibration curve:
