 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. 20ml of petroleum ether was added to 1g of pulverized plant and put on a shaker for about 30mins. The petroleum ether was decanted and evaporated to dryness. 0.2ml of chloroform-acetic anhydride (1:1 v/v) was added to the residue. Later on 2ml of trichloroacetic acid- chloroform (1:1 v/v) was added. The absorbance of the solution was then measured at 620 nm. The vitamin A standard was also prepared in the same way at varying concentrations, and a standard curve plotted. Results were expressed in mg/100g and calculated from the following equation based on the calibration curve:
