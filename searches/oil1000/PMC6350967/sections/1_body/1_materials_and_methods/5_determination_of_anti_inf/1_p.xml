<p class="p">The RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the cell culture lab at the Department of Biochemistry, Nelson Mandela University. The RAW 264.7 cells were first suspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM/low Glucose solution) (Hyclone Laboratories, U.S.A) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin) at 37°C. The cells were stained with trypan blue and the number of viable cells counted using an inverted light microscope (Zeiss) and a Neubauer counting chamber (Hausser Scientific, USA Sigma Cat Z359629).The RAW 264.7 cells were then put into the incubator at 37°C for 24h under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 to allow for acclimatization.</p>
