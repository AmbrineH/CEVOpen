<p class="p">The RAW 264.7 cells were fixed in formaldehyde at two different concentrations (100μM and 25μM). The formaldehyde was removed by solubilizing in methanol (50μl), and the remaining RAW 264.7 cells kept in the freezer at -20°C for 10 min. The cells were then washed with 50μl of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, and 50μl of 3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X100 added before incubating at room temperature for 45min. Fifty microliters (50μl) of antibody was added at 1: 800 dilution and the cells incubated for a further 1h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS before Hoechst solution with 3% BSA was added. The presence of the COX-2 was observed using a fluorescent microscope (ImageXpress XLS Micro [Molecular Devices]). All tests were done in triplicates.</p>
