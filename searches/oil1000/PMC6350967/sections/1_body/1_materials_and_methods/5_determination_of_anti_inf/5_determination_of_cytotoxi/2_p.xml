<p class="p">The U937 and Jurkat cell lines used were obtained from the Department of Biochemistry, Nelson Mandela University, South Africa. The cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Hyclone Labs, U.S.A) medium supplemented with 5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Biowest, U.S.A). The cells were plated at a density of 2.5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate and cultured overnight in an incubator at 37°C. After 24h the plant extracts were added at various concentrations (12.5,25,50, 100, and 200 μg/ml for U937; 25,50, 100 and 200 μg/ml for Jurkat), then the cells were incubated for another 48h. MTT assay was performed as previously described and the plates incubated for 4h. The absorbance was determined using an ELISA reader (Multiscan MS, Labsystems) at a wavelength of 560nm. All the tests were done in triplicate. Cytosine arabinoside was used as a positive control. Cell viability of the treated cells was determined in reference to the untreated control cells using the following formula:
