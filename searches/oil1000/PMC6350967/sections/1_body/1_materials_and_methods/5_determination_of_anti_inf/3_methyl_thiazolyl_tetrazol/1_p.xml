<p class="p">The cytotoxicity assay was carried out on the LPS -induced cells and those with plant extracts and controls using the MTT assay
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>. One hundred microliters (100μl) of RAW 264.7 cells were aliquoted into wells of a 96-well culture plate, and One hundred microliters (100μl) of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1h. The cell viability was measured at an optical density of 560 nm in a microplate reader (Multiscan MS, Labsystems) All tests were done in triplicate.
