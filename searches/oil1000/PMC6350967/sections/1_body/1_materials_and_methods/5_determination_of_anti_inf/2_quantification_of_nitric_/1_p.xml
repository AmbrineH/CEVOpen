<p class="p">After 24h (the cells had adhered to the surface), 100μl of the cells each were taken and put in separate wells in a 96 well culture plate. Fifty microliters (50μl) of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), at either 100μM or 25μM, was added to each well together with 50μl of plant extracts (25 and 100μg/ml). The 96-well plates were then put back in the incubator at 37 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 24hrs. Aliquots (50μl) of the cells from each well were removed and added to 50μl of Griess reagent (Sigma Cat# 03553) in another 96-well culture plate and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The absorbance was read at 560nm in a microplate reader (Multiscan MS, Labsystems). All tests were done in triplicate.
