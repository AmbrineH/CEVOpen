<p class="p">The cladodes of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> were collected from the plant growing within the University of Fort Hare campus in Alice, South Africa. The plant was authenticated by Tony Dolds at the Albany herbarium in Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa. The cladodes were oven-dried at 40°C and pulverized using a milling machine. About 300g of each of the pulverized samples was extracted separately with 1L of each of the solvents, water, ethanol and acetone for 48 h. The extracts were filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at different temperatures using a rotary evaporator. The filtrate of aqueous extract obtained was quickly frozen at -40°C and dried for 48 h using a freeze dryer (Savant Refrigerated vapour Trap, RV T41404, USA). The extracts were stored away in a refrigerator at 4°C.
