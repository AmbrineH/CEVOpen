<p class="p">The total phenol was estimated spectrophotometrically by using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay method[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Here 0.5ml of the extract was added to 2.5ml of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent in tubes. It was then vortexed for 30s and allowed to stand for 10 min at 25°C. 2 ml of 7.5% anhydrous sodium carbonate was added to the solution and vortexed again for another 30s. The tubes were incubated in a water bath at 40°C for 30min for colour development, and absorbance read at 765nm using a spectrophotometer. The total phenolic content was then expressed as mg/g gallic acid (GAE/gm) equivalent using the following equation based on the calibration curve:
