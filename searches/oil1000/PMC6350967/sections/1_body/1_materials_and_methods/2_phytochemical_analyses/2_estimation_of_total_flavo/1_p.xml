<p class="p">The total flavonoid content was estimated spectrophotometrically by using the aluminium chloride colourimetric assay[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The solution was made up of 0.5ml of the plant extract, 2ml of distilled water in a tube and 0.15 ml of 5% sodium nitrite. The solution was left for 5 min at room temperature then 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride was added it and incubated for another 5 min. After incubation, 1ml of 4% sodium hydroxide was added and the solution made up to 5 ml with distilled water. It was then vortexed and incubated for 15 min to observe a colour change. Absorbance was measured at 420nm. The total flavonoid content was calculated as mg/g quercetin equivalent using the following equation from the calibration curve:
