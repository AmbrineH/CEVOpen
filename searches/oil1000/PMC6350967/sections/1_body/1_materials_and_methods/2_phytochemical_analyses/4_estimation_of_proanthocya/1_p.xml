 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. 0.5 ml of the prepared plant extract was added to 3 ml of 4% vanillin-methanol. 1.5 ml of hydrochloric acid was then added to the solution and vortexed. The solution was left for 15 min at room temperature. The absorbance was then read at 500 nm using a spectrophotometer. Total proanthocyanidins content was calculated as mg/g of catechin equivalents using the equation derived from the calibration curve:
