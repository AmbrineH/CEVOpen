<p class="p">The total tannin content was estimated using the Folinâ€”Ciocalteu method[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. 7.5 ml of distilled water was added to a tube containing 0.1ml of the plant extract. 0.5 ml of Folin-Ciocalteuphenol reagent and 1 ml of 35% Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution was then added. The whole solution was made up to 10 ml with distilled water. The mixture was vortexed and kept at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 725 nm using a spectrophotometer. A prepared set of standards of gallic acid was prepared in the same manner as the extracts as described earlier. The total tannin content was expressed as mg/g GAE using the following equation derived from the calibration curve:
