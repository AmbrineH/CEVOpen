<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis was performed to determine the chemical make-up of Opuntia stricta cladodes. Fresh Opuntia cladodes were first extracted of volatile oil using a hydro-distiller in a Clevenger’s-type apparatus in accordance with the British Pharmacopeia specifications (1980). The analysis was performed using Agilent 6890 GC coupled to Agilent 5975 MSD with a Zebron-5MS column (ZB-5MS 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 um). GC grade helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 mL/min; splitless one μL injections were used. The temperature of the injector was 280°C; the source 280°C, the oven 70°C, the ramp was 15°C/min. to 120°C, then 10°C/min to 180°C, then 20°C/min. to 270°C and held for 3 minutes. The compounds present in the essential oils were identified by matching their spectral mass against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 11 database.</p>
