 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> extracts caused a decrease in the expression of nitric oxide by lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages cell and COX-2 expression. This proves the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> extracts. However, while some extracts had an anti-inflammatory effect, a few others caused a slight increased production of nitric oxide and COX-2. The slight increase was more evident in the dry acetone extract (Figs
