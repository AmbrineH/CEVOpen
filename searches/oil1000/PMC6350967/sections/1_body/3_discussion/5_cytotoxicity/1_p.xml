<p class="p">While the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> contains some cytotoxic compounds, the non-cytotoxic effect of the cladodes of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> against U937 cell lines may just be that the compounds were not in sufficient amounts. This can also be explained by the low levels of phytochemicals it yielded in this study. This non-cytotoxicity was also observed by Gebresamuel and Gebre-Mariam [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] in their study of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia ficus indica</italic> cladodes. Recently Harrabi 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. reported the cytoprotective effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes extracts on HepG2 cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Apart from the level of the phytochemicals, seasonal variation, soil type, and other variables can also affect the level of these compounds in the plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]; while the literature quoted higher yields during the summer, the 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic> cladodes in this study were harvested in the winter. In a study done by Alves 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. on different 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia spp</italic>. including 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia stricta</italic>, seasonal variations affected the distribution of phytochemicals and nutrients in the plant, and none of the cladodes displayed cytotoxicity against the cell lines used[
