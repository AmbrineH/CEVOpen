The Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2) enzyme activity is known to be enhanced in the presence of vitamin C (TET2 mutation is common in AML), and as such vitamin C has been reported to induce differentiation in leukaemia stem cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0209682.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. vitamin E is an important antioxidant that has been reported to reduce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation[
