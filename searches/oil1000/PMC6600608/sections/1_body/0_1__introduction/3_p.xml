 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp. represents one of the most important phytopathogenic fungi, which infects grains and produces toxic secondary metabolites, resulting in harmful contamination of feedstuffs and foodstuffs. Furthermore, the two diseases caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp.—head blight (FHB) of small cereals (wheat, barley, oat) and ear rot of maize (FER)—lead to toxicological contaminations and economic losses [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Contamination of cereals with 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. is an important risk factor for health because of the high mycotoxin production potential derived from these contaminations, which by consumption leads to hepatic toxicity, immunosuppression, allergenic reaction, and teratogenic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects [

 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">F. culmorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> [
