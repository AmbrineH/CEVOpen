<p class="p">Recently, the use of EOs has been proposed as an alternative resource to synthetic chemical compounds against microbial attack or for the inhibition of weed germination [

Terpenic compounds of EOs have proven to be as effective as natural herbicides due to the fact that they lead to an inhibition of weed growth. Hence, pyrethrins as well as cineol, derived from cinmethylamine, are considered in the development of new pesticides. The antimicrobial or herbicidal effects may lead to enhanced properties by combining different properties of medicinal plants. Therefore, the aim is to achieve natural bio-pesticides from plant mixtures with different biological activity. Our previous study has shown the enhanced antimicrobial and allelopathic properties of the
