<p class="p">Crop contamination with fungal species during the vegetation period and postharvest, under inadequate storage conditions, such as high air humidity and poor or absent ventilation, is a common issue and results in significant economic losses [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Replacement of synthetic compounds used as protective agents during crop vegetation or storage, with natural, non-toxic, and environmentally-friendly compounds is desirable in organic agriculture. In this regard, essential oils (EOs) of aromatic plants are being explored as alternative herbicides or fungicides in organic agriculture and horticulture. Their major advantage is that they do not contaminate groundwater or persist in soil and, more importantly, they do not cause mammalian toxicity [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Various arguments regarding the mechanisms of volatile oils activity on the microbial cell have been developed over time. However, the fact is that they can affect both the integrity and the functionality of the cytoplasmic membrane. Their hydrophobic (lipophilic) character appears to be responsible for disturbing microbial lipid structures by increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, affecting the functionality of the cell [
