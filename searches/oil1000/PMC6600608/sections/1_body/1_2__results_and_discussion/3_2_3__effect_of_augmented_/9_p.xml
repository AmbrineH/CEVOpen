<p class="p">The DON content in the control sample after 14 days was 0.269 ppm, with the decrease in the mycotoxigenic load being 4.6%. This decrease is in line with the evolution of 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic>, whose development decreases over time with the occurrence of other fungal species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor</italic> sp. in wheat samples. The treatment with CEO, led to a considerably decreased DON content, compared with the control (39%) after 7 days. This decrease was even more pronounced after 14 days (81.04%). The treatment with CS leads to a similar profile to CEO treatment, however, the inhibition effectiveness of DON formation is lower compared to CEO treatment. In the case of treatment with CS mixture, the reduction in DON contamination of samples when compared to the control varied between 1.41% and 26.95%. Furthermore, the CS mixture showed the optimal protection against the synthesis of DON mycotoxin.
