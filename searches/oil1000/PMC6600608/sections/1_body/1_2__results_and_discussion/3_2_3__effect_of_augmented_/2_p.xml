<p class="p">After 7 days of fumigation, a significant decrease in the number of wheat kernels contaminated with 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> was observed when compared to the control experiment. The lowest value recorded in the CS1 mixture was an ICK value of 10%. This suggests a synergistic antifungal effect of CEO with SEO in controlling
