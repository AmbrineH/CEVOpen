<p class="p">It was observed that there is no linear dependence between the CS concentration and the DON content. The more concentrated mixtures (CS2) led to a higher mycotoxigenic load (0.278 ppm) compared to the more diluted (0.216 ppm) CS3 sample. The rate of growth inhibition after 14 days of CEO treatment and mixtures varied between 81.04%, in the case of CEO treatment, and 29.44% for the cereals treated with the CS2 mixture. It is important to emphasize that the SEO addition to the CEO did not induce the mycotoxins synthesis, as the inhibition effects of DON synthesis were lower for CS variants. Similar results on the inhibition of DON production with EO treatment belonging to Lamiaceae family have been previously reported, which showed that, after 22â€‰days of treatment with EOs, DON was undetectable in wheat samples [
