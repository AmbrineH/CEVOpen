<p class="p">In our research, contamination with 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> did not decrease after 14 days, highlighting that the treatment effect of CEO in fungal control, even by mixing with SEO, is maintained for only 7 days, after which a second treatment is needed. Additionally, the samples fumigated with CEO alone or combined with SEO in the CS1 and CS2 mixtures, and also in the control sample, the appearance of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus, Mucor</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> can be noticed. Promising results regarding the use of CEOs in mixtures has proven antifungal protection by mixing 800 ppm CEO with 250 ppm 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, from the Lauraceae family against 
 <italic class="italic">Byssochlamys fulva</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In the case of the CS3 mixture, a minimal fungus load with 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> sp. correlated with economic efficiency, which recommends this conceptual solution for the fungal protection of cereals in storage, is noted.
