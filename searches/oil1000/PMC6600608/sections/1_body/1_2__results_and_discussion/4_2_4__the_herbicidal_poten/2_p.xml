<p class="p">The CS mixture revealed a 100% germination inhibition effect for all three seed types analyzed when used in ratios of 10% CEO + 2% SEO. The CS2 mixture presented a 100% inhibition of germination of CALB and EGAL, and 77.8% of ARET. The lower concentration, CS3, inhibited the seed germination with values between 44% and 80%. In the case of wheat seeds, germination was inhibited 78.9â€“89.5%, depending on the CS concentration, see
