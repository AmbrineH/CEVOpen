<p class="p">Our study confirms previous results with regards to the herbicidal effect of EOs, which would recommend them as natural herbicides in organic farming. Regarding the allelopathic effect of EOs in connection with wheat germination, previous studies have shown that wheat cultivars were less affected compared to weed species, suggesting the possibility to use these natural compounds—in proper doses—as bioherbicides for weed control [
