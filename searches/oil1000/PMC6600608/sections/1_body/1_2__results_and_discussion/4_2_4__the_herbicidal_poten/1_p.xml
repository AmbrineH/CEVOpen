<p class="p">The herbicidal potential of CEO has been tested for weed seeds using the fumigation technique to inhibit germination. The herbicidal potential has been observed on monocotyledonous weed seeds, 
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crusâ€“galli</italic> (EGAL), and has been extended to wheat seeds (WHEAT). Among dicotyledonous weeds, this study focused on the problematic weeds known for their aggressiveness and competitiveness in the crop field, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> (ARET) and 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium album</italic> (CALB). To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first bio-herbicidal study of CEO from Romania and the results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02040-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The rate of inhibition of weed germination in the case of fumigation with CEOs in different concentrations (0.3%, 0.6%, and 1%) varied between 65% and 100%. At 1% CEO concentration, the herbicidal effect was maximal for all weed seeds. 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium album</italic> showed the highest sensitivity among the tested weeds, with 75% and 95% inhibition rate for the CEO at 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The effect of CEO on wheat seed germination presents various germination inhibition behavior with values between 66% and 83%. The maximum inhibition was recorded at 1% CEO.
