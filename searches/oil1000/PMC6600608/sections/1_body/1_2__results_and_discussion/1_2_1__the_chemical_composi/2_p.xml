<p class="p">Our results are consistent with previous investigations regarding the chemical composition of CEO that reported the linalool as the major constituent of CEO. However, the values vary greatly depending on geographic area, climate, and cultivation practice. For example, in CEO obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> seeds cultivated in Cuba, the content of linalool reached 54.56%, while the seeds from Brazil contained 77.48% linalool [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The group of Zamindar et al., 2016, found linalool (73.05%) as the main chemical compound in CEO, followed by α-pinene (9.18%), γ-terpinene (7.65%), and geranyl acetate (2.71%) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In a study published by Momin et al., 2012, the major component of CEO was linalool (60–70%), followed by α-pinene, limonene, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, borneol, citronellol, camphor, geraniol, and geraniol acetate [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Similar monoterpene composition (linalool 58.22%, geraniol 17.87%, and geranyl acetate 12,2%) was determined in Brazilian CEO [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. CEO analyzed in the study of Al-Snafi et al., 2016, obtained from seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</italic> was also defined by a relatively high amount of linalool (55.09%) followed by α-pinene (7.49%) and geraniol (4.83%) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In contrast, the chromatographic profile of the CEO obtained from Romanian seeds contained 45.387% linalool. From this point of view, we can say that the coriander oil produced in Romania has less linalool content in comparison to the rest. A different chemical composition was found in CEO extracted from seeds cultivated in Iran, where camphor was the main chemical compound (44.99%), followed by cis-2-tert.butyl-cyclohexanol acetate (14.45%), limonene (7.17%), and α-pinene (6.37%) [
