<p class="p">The CEO added in the culture medium inhibited the growth of new 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> mycelium starting at a concentration of 0.04%. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02040-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the new mycelial growth (NMG) values vary between 2.9 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, corresponding to the experimental sample treated with 0.02% CEO, and 0.2 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for 0.3% CEO. On the other hand, in the case of a sample with 0.2% CEO, the NMG value exceeded the NMG control value by 0.4 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. It seems that the presence of reduced amounts of CEO stimulates the 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> mycelia growth. Only from 0.04% CEO did we observe a decrease in the mycelinum area. The decrease was observed progressively with increasing CEO concentration. Thus, at 0.3% CEO, the NMG value reached only 0.2 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. As shown above, 0.4% CEO corresponded to minimal fungistatic effect (MCFs). The minimum concentration for fungicidal effect (MCFg) corresponded to 0.6% CEO. The MCFg value was confirmed only after transfers of mycelial disks and that the fungus hyphae had not been revived. This concentration was used for in vivo antifungal testing of the wheat kernel by fumigation with CEO. The antifungal effect of the CEO could be attributed to the linalool compound, which was reported to have an antibacterial effect [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and is responsible for the flavor of the coriander [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The previous studies showed that CEO has an excellent antifungal activity against seed borne pathogens of paddy: 
 <italic class="italic">Pyricularia oryzae, Bipolaris oryzae, Alternaria alternata, Tricoconis padwickii, Drechslera tetramera</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">D. halodes, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium moniliforme</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic>. The fungicidal effect of CEO against 
 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic> was 100% at a level of 2000 µg/mL and 25.55% at 500 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Zare-shehneh et al. (2014) showed that the MCFs against 
 <italic class="italic">P. lilacinum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> were 67.8 and 62.1 mg/mL, respectively [
