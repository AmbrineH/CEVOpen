After 7 and 14 days, respectively, the colonization of fumigated wheat grains was evaluated by placing 10 wheat kernels from each ratio on CYGA medium in Petri dishes incubated on day/night regime at 22 + 2 °C. After 4 days, the index colonization value of wheat kernels (ICK) was determined for each treatment [
