<p class="p">The identification of the chemical composition of CEO volatile compounds was performed in accordance with other specialized studies using 3 alternative methods: comparison with NIST 5 Wiley 275 libraries database, calculation of the linear retention index (LRI), and comparison with LRI from the literature data. The linear retention indices (LRIs) were determined in relation to a homologous series of n-alkanes (C8â€“C24) under the same operating conditions and calculated according to Van den Dool and Kratz formula and compared with the literature data [
