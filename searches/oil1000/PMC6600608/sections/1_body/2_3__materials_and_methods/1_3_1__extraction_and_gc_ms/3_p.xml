<p class="p">The chemical characterization of CEO was done using the gas-chromatograph equipment with mass spectrometer (GC-MS) Shimadzu QP 2010Plus with a capillary column with the characteristics: AT WAX 30 m × 0.32 mm × 1 μm. The carrier gas used was helium with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The settings used for the separation was: 40 °C for 1 min, a rate of 5 °C/min to 210 °C for 5 min. Injector and ion source temperatures were 250 °C and 220 °C, respectively. The injection volume was 1 μL at a ratio of 1:50.</p>
