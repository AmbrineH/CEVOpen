<p class="p">Weed seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> (ARET), 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium album</italic> (CALB), and 
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> (EGAL) were obtained from the seeds collection of the Department of Herbology, Faculty of Agriculture Timisoara. Seed samples were sterilized using a sodium hypochlorite solution (hypochlorite/water 1:9) for 3 min. Subsequently, the seeds were washed 3 times with distilled water for 3 min each time. A total of 10 seeds from each species were placed in a Petri dish, in layers separated by thin filter paper. Then, the seeds were treated with 6 mL of CEO (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) in the following concentrations: 0.3%, 0.6%, and 1%. To study the inhibition potential on germination of the weed seeds, the following mixtures of 3 mL CEO (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) + 3 mL SEO (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) were used: CS1 (CEO 10% + SEO 2%), CS2 (CEO 1% + SEO 0.2%), and CS3 (0.5% + SEO 0.1%). CS1, CS2 and CS3 were achieved by mixing EOs in volume ratios (

The Petri dishes were kept at 25 Â°C in darkness and verified daily and on the 7th day the inhibition was evaluated. Each treatment, including the control, was repeated three times (in total 36 Petri dishes were used).
