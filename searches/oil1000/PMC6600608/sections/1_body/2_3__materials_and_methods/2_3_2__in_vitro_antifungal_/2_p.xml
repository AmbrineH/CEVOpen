<p class="p">9 mm disks of 4-day-old 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> mycelium were transferred to the YCGA medium with different concentrations of CEO (three of each concentration taken as repetitions). Incubation was done under alternate light/dark conditions 12 h/12 h. On the 5th day, observations were made by measuring two perpendicular diameters for each new fungal growth. The new mycelia growth (NMG) was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">NMG (cm
  <sup class="sup">2</sup>) = [(DM2 × 3.14/4) − IMD]/100 
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where DM is the diameter of finally mycelium growth (mm) and IMD is the initial mycelium disc (0.63 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The experiment for antifungal activity assay was conducted twice.
