 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In order to study the fungal mycelium’s ability to grow and regenerate, a defined amount of CEO was added to the culture medium. The culture medium used was YCGA (yeast extract glucose chloramphenicol agar, 95765, Sigma-Aldrich), with the oil being added in different quantities to achieve the following concentrations: 0% (control), 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.06%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.6% CEO (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Minimum concentration with fungistatic effect (MCFs) is defined as the concentration starting from which the fungal growth is inhibited. By transferring the fungus to a fresh medium (without EO addition) a revival of hyphae and the mycelium growth is observed. Minimum concentration with fungicidal effect (MCFg) is defined as the concentration from which the fungal growth is inhibited and by transferring the inoculum to a fresh medium there is no hyphae or mycelium revival.
