<p class="p">Tween 20 was utilized as a surfactant to facilitate emulsion formation and stability, and 1% Tween 20 aqueous solution without essential oil served as the control group. The antibacterial effect increased with the essential oil concentration. The antibacterial effect of the unhomogenized essential oil on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was the strongest when the concentration was 0.4% (4 μL/mL); the total bacterial counts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (7.97 ± 0.23 CFU/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (8.18 ± 0.13 CFU/mL) were lower than those of the control group by 1.03 and 0.85 log CFU/mL, respectively. According to the results, the pomelo peel essential oil had a greater inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> than on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. This result is consistent with previous findings on antibacterial citrus essential oils and suggests that the essential oil and its compounds have a stronger inhibitory effect on gram-positive bacteria than on gram-negative bacteria [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In addition, the antibacterial effects observed at different homogenizer speeds and the same essential oil concentration indicate that the homogenizer speed has no significant effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) on the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, though the antibacterial effect increases with the homogenizer speed. When the essential oil concentration was increased to 0.4% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and the homogenizer speed was 24,000 rpm, the total bacterial counts of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were lower than those of the unhomogenized group and the 13,500 rpm group by 0.46 and 0.33 log CFU/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were calculated from the regression curve between various essential oil concentrations at different homogenizer speeds (0, 13,500, and 24,000 rpm) and the residual bacterial count. The MIC values of the unhomogenized group and 24,000 rpm group for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were 0.29% (2.9 μL/mL) and 0.27% (2.7 μL/mL), respectively. For 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, the MIC value of the essential oil emulsion homogenized at 24,000 rpm was 0.25% (2.5 μL/mL), whereas that of the unhomogenized group was 0.49% (4.9 μL/mL) (Table 5). According to the results of this study, homogenization at 24,000 rpm markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the essential oil emulsion on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, with the MIC being 1.9 times lower than that of the essential oil without homogenization. In a study by Inouye et al., the MIC value of citron oil, and its key compound limonene, for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was &gt;0.32% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Additionally, Moghimi et al. found that the MIC value of a nanoemulsion of Thymus daenensis essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was 10 times higher than that of pure essential oil, with the MIC values being 0.4 mg/mL and 4.0 mg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Emulsification enhances the antibacterial effect of essential oil on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, which may be related to the speed of homogenization. The higher the homogenizer speed is, the more complete the emulsification; the size of the oil droplets decreases, the stability of the oil droplets is enhanced, and the oil droplets are uniformly dispersed in the overall solution system, which enhances the ability of the oil to permeate the hydrophilic pericellular membrane of the gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and thus improves antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The results of this study are in agreement with previous studies, indicating that the antibacterial effects are greatly improved through the conversion of flavor or essential oils (e.g., oregano oil and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene) into nanoemulsions [
