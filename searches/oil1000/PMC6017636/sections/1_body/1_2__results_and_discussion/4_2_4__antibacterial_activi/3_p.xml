<p class="p">The 0.4% pomelo peel essential oil emulsion mixed with 0.03% water-soluble chitosan had a significant antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (

 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In addition, the MIC values of this mixture for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were 0.019% and 0.034%, respectively. As such, the MIC value of this mixture for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was higher than that of the 0.01% water-soluble chitosan, but the value for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was nearest to the 0.03% water-soluble chitosan. Therefore, we further analyzed the antibacterial activity and stability of this mixture at various pH values.
