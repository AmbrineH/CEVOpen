<p class="p">The antibacterial effects of chitosan at concentrations of 0, 0.01%, 0.03%, 0.05%, and 0.1% on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were lower than those of the control group by 1.06, 1.97, 2.40, 2.34, and 2.17 log CFU/mL, respectively; the effects on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were lower by 1.25, 1.79, 2.26, 2.55, and 2.08 log CFU/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The results showed that the combination of the essential oil emulsion and water-soluble chitosan can significantly enhance the antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. In addition, in comparison with the antibacterial effect of only water-soluble chitosan (no emulsified essential oil) on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, the MIC value of the combination of the essential oil emulsion and water-soluble chitosan was 2.4 times higher, with the MIC values being 0.046% and 0.019%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Moreover, the MIC value of the combination of the essential oil emulsion and water-soluble chitosan on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was 2.5 times higher, with the MIC value being 0.034%, compared with 0.086% of chitosan alone (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). This result may be related to a synergistic effect of water-soluble chitosan and emulsified pomelo peel oil on bacterial activity. This coincides with the results of Feyzioglu and Tornuk, who suggested that chitosan nanoparticles loaded with essential oil from summer savory provide significant reductions in bacteria (

 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>) in comparison with chitosan nanoparticles alone [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, in the current study, when the water-soluble chitosan concentration in the 0.4% essential oil emulsion was 0.1%, the antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was lower than that in the 0.03% and 0.05% groups. However, the differences were not significant (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), which may be because the high concentration of chitosan reduced the contact between the hydrophobic essential oil compound and the cell wall of the bacteria, obstructing the channels for the essential oil compound to enter the bacteria. Thus, the essential oil compound could not permeate the bacterial cells, resulting in lower bacteriostatic activity against
