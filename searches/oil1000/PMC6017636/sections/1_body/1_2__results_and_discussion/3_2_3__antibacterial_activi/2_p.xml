<p class="p">The results showed that the antibacterial effect of water-soluble chitosan on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> increased with the concentration of chitosan. At a concentration of 0.1%, water-soluble chitosan exerted the strongest antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The total bacterial counts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were lower than those of the control group by 0.96 and 1.07 log CFU/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The findings of this study are similar to those reported by Chen, et al., who used water-soluble chitosan with a DA of 50%; when the concentration was 1,000 ppm, the bacterial count of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was reduced by about 1.0 log CFU/mL after 12 h of cultivation [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In addition, Omura et al. reported that once the degree of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylation reached approximately 55%, chitosan had a good inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, with an MIC value of &gt;0.1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) (equivalent to &gt;1000 ppm) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan has been demonstrated against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with an MIC range of 100 to 2000 ppm [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In the current study, the MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were calculated from the regression curve between the concentration of water-soluble chitosan and residual bacterial count to be 0.046% and 0.086%, respectively (Table 5).
