<p class="p">This result is similar to the result of Hoque et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Clove isolation exhibited higher antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> at pH 9.0, compared with pH 5.0 and 7.0. In addition, essential clove oil exhibited higher antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>) at pH 9.0 than at pH 5.0 and 7.0 [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Regarding the effect of the pH value on the activity of essential oil, the pH value may influence charge modification on the cell membrane surface; thus, the charged constituents of the essential oil bind to the microorganism cell membrane, which may damage the cells [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. However, the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> inhibition rates of the essential oil emulsion alone were 78.11%, 92.7%, and 71.29%, indicating that neutral (pH 7.4) essential oil emulsions have the highest inhibitory effect, followed by acidic emulsions. Generally, a low pH increases the hydrophobicity of the essential oil, and the resistance of bacteria to this essential oil and its constituents decreases with the pH value; thus, it is easier for essential oils to dissolve in the lipids of the bacterial cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, according to findings regarding citrus essential oils, the principal component limonene, which belongs to the family of cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons, is believed to accumulate in the bacterial cell membrane, which results in the loss of membrane integrity and leads to dissipation of the proton motive force [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Previous studies on the inactivation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> by limonene demonstrated that it targets the phospholipids of cytoplasmic membranes and the lipopolysaccharide fraction of the cell wall at pH 7.0 and β-sheet protein out of the membrane at pH 4.0, which results in sublethal injury in the outer and cytoplasmic membranes [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Furthermore, water-soluble chitosan at 0.03% and pH 5.5 had the highest inhibitory effect; the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> inhibition rate was 85.47%, and the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> inhibition rate was 76.04% (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). For water-soluble chitosan in TSB solutions at different pH values (5.5, 7.4, and 8.5), the particle surface charge values were 5.4, −3.8, and −3.2 mV, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Cationic (NH
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>) forms of chitosan are present in acidic pH, while in neutral and basic pH, NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups are present. The number of NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups is related not only to chitosan concentration but also to the degree of acetylation, that is, it diminished when the degree of acetylation increased [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. This result indicates that water-soluble chitosan is positively charged at pH 5.5; thus, the inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> is significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than that at pH 7.4 and 8.5. This finding is similar to that of Xie et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. For the mixture of the essential oil emulsion and water-soluble chitosan, the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> inhibition rate (82.58%) of 0.03% chitosan with 0.4% essential oil at pH 5.5 was not significantly different, but in comparison with the 0.4% essential oil emulsion (90.04% and 95%) or the 0.03% water-soluble chitosan (65.26% and 61.83%) alone, the chitosan and oil at pH 7.4 and 8.5 had a synergistic antibacterial effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, with inhibition rates of 99.48% and 97.46%, respectively. Moreover, in comparison with the 0.4% essential oil emulsion (78.11%, 92.70%, and 71.29%) or the 0.03% water-soluble chitosan (76.04%, 62.61%, and 66.06%) groups, the chitosan and oil at pH 5.5, 7.4, and 8.5 had significant synergistic antibacterial effects on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and the values were 91.68%, 99.06%, and 95.06%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Despite the differences between the gram-positive and gram-negative species, the mixture of 0.03% water-soluble chitosan and the 0.4% essential oil emulsion at pH 7.4 had the highest antibacterial effect on both 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. In comparison with the total bacterial count of the control group, the values were 2.40 and 2.26 log CFU/mL lower (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, in comparison with the 0.4% essential oil emulsion and 0.03% water-soluble chitosan individually, the effects of this mixture in reducing the total bacterial counts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were 1.8 and 4.6 times higher, respectively, and for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were 2.2 and 4.8 times higher, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The results showed that the mixture had significantly enhanced synergistic antibacterial effects on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The results of this study are similar to those of Feyziglu et al., who investigated the synergistic antibacterial activities of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with summer savory essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> O157:H7. However, the mixture’s exact mechanism of action remains unclear [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The essential oil emulsion can enhance antibacterial synergy with water-soluble chitosan in neutral solution. This is not attributable to a specific compound or mechanism, but due to the presence of various chemical compounds with different structures in the pomelo peel essential oil [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In fact, the essential oils affect bacterial cells through different antimicrobial mechanisms, including attack on the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane, disruption of enzyme systems, damage to the genetic material in the bacteria, and formation of fatty acid hydroperoxidase induced by the oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids [
