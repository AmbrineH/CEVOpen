<p class="p">Essential oil was obtained from the fresh peel of the Taiwan Matou cultivar of the pomelo (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus grandis</italic> [L.] Osbeck cv. Matou Wentan) through steam distillation. The essential oil composition was analyzed through GC-MS, and 33 compounds were identified. According to gas chromatography (GC) quantitative analysis, the main constituents in descending order of content were limonene (87.5%, 940.07 mg/g), myrcene (3.1%, 23.65 mg/g), β-pinene (2.7%, 13.53 mg/g), α-pinene (6.0%, 4.66 mg/g), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-linalool oxide (f) (0.6%, 3.82 mg/g), and linalool (0.4%, 2.48 mg/g) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00840-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This is similar to the findings of previous investigations into pomelo peel oils, which reported that limonene (93.9%), myrcene (1.9%), β-pinene (1.1%), and α-pinene (0.5%) were the chief components [
