<p class="p">Use of essential oils and chitosan in the food industry is limited due to their poor solubility in water. In this study, a mixture soluble in a neutral water solution (pH 7.4) was successfully prepared through the homogenization of the essential oil and deacetylated water-soluble chitosan, which have strong synergetic antibacterial effects on food pathogens. The reduction in total bacterial counts of a mixture of a 0.4% pomelo peel essential oil emulsion and 0.03% water-soluble chitosan in a neutral water solution on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was higher than that of the 0.4% essential oil emulsion or 0.03% water-soluble chitosan alone by approximately 1.8 and 4.6 times, respectively, and, for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, by approximately 2.2 and 4.8 times, respectively. The composition of the essential oil of Taiwan Matou pomelo peel, obtained through steam distillation, was analyzed through GC-MS. A total of 33 compounds were identified, and the main constituent was limonene (940.07 mg/g). The results showed that a pomelo peel essential oil emulsion homogenized at 24,000 rpm had a stronger inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> than unhomogenized essential oil, with the MIC value being 1.9 times lower. Therefore, this study suggests using a mixture of emulsified pomelo peel oil and water-soluble chitosan to develop a novel natural food preservative, which could prevent the growth of pathogens in foods and extend their shelf life. Additionally, this study indicates that the processability of food, as well as the economic value of the byproducts of the Taiwan Matou pomelo and chitosan, could be increased.
