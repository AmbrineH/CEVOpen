<p class="p">Chitosan (DA = 25%) was purchased from Ohka Enterprises (Kaohsiung City, Taiwan). Water-soluble chitosan was prepared according to the methods described by Mima et al. and Kubota and Eguchi, with minor modifications [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The chitosan was added to 40% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) NaOH solution at a ratio of 1:10 and boiled for 4 h. After being washed in deionized water to achieve neutrality, the chitosan was treated again in the alkaline solution for further deacetylation; thus, a highly deacetylated chitosan product was obtained with a 93.0% DA. The deacetylated chitosan product (0.3 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of 1% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) aqueous acetic acid, mixed with 40 mL of 80% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) methanol, and the desired amount (0.18 mL) of acetic anhydride was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 h, 1.0 M, NaOH was added up to pH 8.0 to stop the reaction. Finally, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against deionized water for 3 days and then lyophilized to powder form to determine the degree of
