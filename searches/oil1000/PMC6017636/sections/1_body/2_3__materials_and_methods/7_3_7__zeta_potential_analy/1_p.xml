<p class="p">The zeta potential in water-soluble chitosan was determined with a Zetasizer (Nano ZSP, Malvern Instruments Corp., Worcestershire, UK), using the method described by Gohtani and Yamano with modifications [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The zeta potential measurements were performed in deionized water, which acted as a dispersant, by using a disposable folded capillary cell with the electrodes at 25 Â°C and an applied voltage of 150 V. The data were recorded as the average of three analyses.
