The species culture was prepared according to the method described by Carson et al., with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The bacteria from 1 inoculation loop were cultured in a spiral test tube with TSB at 37 Â°C for 6 h. The bacterial solution absorbance value was 600 nm, the detected value was 0.33, and the bacterial count was 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> CFU/mL, which was reduced through dilution with TSB to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL.
