<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined according to the method described by Skandamis et al., with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The essential oil emulsions of pomelo peel prepared under different homogenization conditions and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were cultured at 37 Â°C for 24 h for antibacterial activity testing. The data were recorded as the average of three analyses. The essential oil concentration and residual bacterial count were plotted to obtain the regression curve, and the minimum essential oil concentration (x) for inhibiting 90% of the bacterial count (y) was obtained according to the following regression equation:
