 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) NaCl in tryptic soy agar (Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h, and the colony counts in various diluted bacterial solution culture dishes were determined (only 30 to 300 colony counts were recorded in the experiments). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
