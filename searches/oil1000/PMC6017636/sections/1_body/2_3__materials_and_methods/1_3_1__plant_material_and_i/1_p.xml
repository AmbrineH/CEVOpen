The albedo of fresh pomelo peel was removed, the flavedo layer (1,000 g) was cut into small pieces by using a food processor (Cuisinart DLC-7 Super Pro, Japan), and the essential oil was obtained using a steam distillation device (KC-30, Kou Chou Instrument Co., Ltd, Taipei City, Taiwan) for 3 h. The steam, containing the essential oil, was passed through a cooling system to condense it to form a liquid, and then the essential oil and water were separated. Afterward, the oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in dark vials at 4 °C until analysis.
