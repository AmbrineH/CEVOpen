<p class="p">The degree of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylation in water-soluble chitosan was determined through high-performance liquid chromatography, using the method described by Niola et al. with modifications [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. A 10 mg sample was placed in a vacuum hydrolysis tube with 0.5 mL of 12 M H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and a standard mixture (6.9 mg of oxalic acid dihydrate and 0.25 mL of propionic acid dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water). The tube was closed and placed in a circulating heating bath at 155 °C, and after a 1 h reaction, the tube was placed in ice water for 30 min, and then allowed to reach room temperature. The mixture was completed with 10 mL of deionized water and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane. Ten microliters of this solution were directly injected into a Synergi C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column (4.6 × 250 mm, particle size, 4 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) in order to analyze the amount of acetic acid. The sample was analyzed in triplicate. The amount of liberated acetyl groups (mx) was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">mx = K×(Ax/Ais) × Mis
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>where K is the response factor; Ax and Ais are the areas of the acetic and propionic acid peaks, respectively, as the internal standard; and Mis is the amount of the internal standard. The percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylation was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">degree of 
  <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylation (%) = (161X/60 − 42X) × 100
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>where X = mx/M’; M’ = M-mi (mi = mass of inorganic material including curd protein and ash content); 161 is the mole weight of a 2-amino-2-deoxy-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucose unit; and 60 is the mole weight of the acetic acid.
