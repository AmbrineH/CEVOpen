The quantitative analysis of each sample was performed using the method described by Hosni et al. and Mohammadi et al., with minor modifications [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. GC analyses were conducted on a Shimadzu GC-14 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a flame ionization detector, and a Shimadzu C-R6A chromatopac integraph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). An Equity-5 nonpolar column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. The column temperature was programmed to rise from 75 to 200 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min. The injector and detector temperature were set at 250 °C. The flow of the carrier gas (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was 50 mL/min. The injection volume for all samples was 0.5 μL of diluted oil in n-hexane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The data were recorded as the average of three analyses.
