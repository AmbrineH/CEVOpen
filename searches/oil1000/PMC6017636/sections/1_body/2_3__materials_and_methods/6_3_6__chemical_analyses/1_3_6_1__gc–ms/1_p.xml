<p class="p">To an essential oil sample of approximately 0.05 g, n-hexane was added to a volume of 5 mL, and GC-MS was used for qualitative analysis of the essential oil composition. The qualitative analysis of the sample was performed using the method described by Deba et al. and Hosni et al., with minor modifications [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. GC-MS analyses were performed on an HP 6890 (II) gas chromatograph interfaced with an HP 5973 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with electron impact ionization (70 eV). A DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.3 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Folsom, CA, USA) was used. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 2 min and then increased at 5 °C/min to 250 °C. The carrier gas, helium, was injected at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The scan time and mass range were 1 s and 41–400
