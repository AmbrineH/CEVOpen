<p class="p">To prepare an emulsion of chitosan of different pH and essential oil, 1.0 N HCl and 1.0 N NaOH were added to approximately 30.0 g of TSB, and deionized water was added to reach a volume of 1000 mL; the pH was adjusted to 5.5, 7.4, and 8.5, respectively. The mixtures were sterilized at 121°C for 15 min and added to water-soluble chitosan to prepare TSB with 0.03% (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-molecules-23-00840" class="xref">Section 3.4</xref> was employed. Afterward, the TSB with chitosan was mixed with 0.2 mL of an essential oil emulsion (prepared through 24,000 rpm homogenization and 0.2 μm filtration), and the essential oil concentration was 0.4% (
