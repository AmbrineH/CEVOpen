<p class="p">Sterility control of essential oils and chitosan was performed using the membrane filter method of Owlia et al., with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. To prepare a chitosan and pomelo peel essential oil emulsion, sterilized tryptic soy broth (TSB, Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) was added to the prepared water-soluble chitosan on a sterile console, vibrated in a 75 °C water bath for 6 h to dissolution, and filtered by air exhaust through 0.4 μm and 0.2 μm filter membranes in turn, yielding TSB with chitosan at different concentrations (0, 0.01% (
