<p class="p">Chitosan, being produced from a major waste product of the marine food processing industry, is widely available. It is a biodegradable, nontoxic biopolymer of glucosamine and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine that is commercially produced by deacetylating chitin, the main structural component of crustacean shells. Chitosan exhibits a wide array of potential biological activities, such as antitumor, immunostimulatory, antibacterial, and antifungal activities [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan against a variety of bacteria and fungi is known to be due to its polycationic nature [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, its antibacterial activity is limited at a pH higher than 6.5, when chitosan starts to lose its positive charge and become insoluble in water [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Thus, many researchers have focused on the preparation of chitosan and chitosan derivatives that are soluble in water over a wider pH range through enzymatic and acid hydrolysis. In addition, chitosan is widely used as an antimicrobial agent when blended with other natural polymers [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, research into the antimicrobial activity of water-soluble chitosan with about 50.0% degree of acetylation blended with citrus essential oil emulsion is limited.
