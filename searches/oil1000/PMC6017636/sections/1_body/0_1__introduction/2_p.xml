 <italic class="italic">Citrus grandis</italic> Osbeck, also known as pomelo, is a popular seasonal fruit in Taiwan. It is regularly consumed in Asian countries as a whole fruit, juice, or preserved snack [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The annual yield of pomelo in Taiwan is 70,000 t [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The pomelo is a popular fruit for Chinese festivals; however, they are sometimes overproduced, have slow sales and are discarded after festivals. This fruit, and its processed products, produce considerable waste or byproducts during eating or processing, such as peels, seeds, and pulp, which account for approximately 50% of the original fruit weight [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. These byproducts could be a valuable source for functional food ingredients, such as flavonoids, dietary fibers, and essential oils [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Essential oil is the most important byproduct of citrus processing and is usually obtained from the peels. Essential oils are mixtures of aromatic volatile compounds produced by the secondary metabolism of plants and they can be used as natural antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Several reports have addressed the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, as well as the use of essential oils as antimicrobial agents in food products. However, many potential technological challenges remain associated with incorporating essential oils into food products, due to their low water solubility, poor chemical stability, and volatile nature [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-00840" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In recent years, many studies have used emulsification or nanotechnology to improve the characteristics of essential oils to enhance its usability and stability, in order to enhance its applicability to food [
