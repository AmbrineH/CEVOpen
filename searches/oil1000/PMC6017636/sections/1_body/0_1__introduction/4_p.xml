<p class="p">This study used Taiwan Matou pomelo peel as the raw material and performed industrially safe and nontoxic steam distillation to obtain the essential oil. The main composition was analyzed, and the effect of essential oil emulsions after different homogenization conditions was investigated, Then, the essential oil was blended with different concentrations of water-soluble chitosan with about 50.0% degree of acetylation and the antimicrobial activity was examined. Common foodborne pathogenic bacteria, the gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and the gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, were used as antimicrobial index strains. An emulsion mixture of pomelo peel essential oil and water-soluble chitosan is expected to be developed in the future, to be used in the food and catering industries as a natural water-soluble germicide or food preservative. This will increase the economic value of Taiwan Matou pomelo peel and chitin wastes.
