 <p class="p">In rural areas of Latin America, 
  <italic class="italic">Hyptis</italic> infusions are very popular. 
  <italic class="italic">Hyptis obtusiflora</italic> extends from Mexico throughout Central America to Bolivia and Peru. It has added value in Ecuador where it has been used by different ethnic groups. We aimed to learn about the traditional knowledge of ancient Kichwa cultures about this plant, and to contrast this knowledge with the published information organized in occidental databases. We proposed to use traditional knowledge as a source of innovation for social development. Our specific objectives were to catalogue the uses of 
  <italic class="italic">H. obtusiflora</italic> in the community, to prospect on the bibliography on a possible chemical justification for its medicinal use, to propose new products for development, and to give arguments for biodiversity conservation. An ethnobotanical survey was made and a Prisma 2009 Flow Diagram was then followed for scientific validation. We rescued data that are novel contributions for the ethnobotany at the national level. The catalogued main activity of anti-inflammation can be related to the terpene composition and the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. This opens the possibility of researching the extract of this plant as an alternative to allopurinol or uricosuric drugs. This is a concrete example of an argument for biodiversity conservation.
