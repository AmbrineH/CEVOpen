 <xref rid="B2-plants-07-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Plants of this genus are covered with glandular trichomes that produce essential oils that make them very popular in rural areas of Latin America where they are taken as an infusion to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders or skin diseases [
