<p class="p">Collective written research consent was granted by Ms. Luzmila Gayas, the community president of the Assembly of Pakayaku. Prior oral individual consent was obtained from the persons taking part in our survey. Planned house visits and walking routes accompanied by Kichwa interpreters and local inhabitants of Pakayaku were made. Interviews were semi-structured and included a series of open questions aimed to encourage discussion. All interviews were recorded. Four knowledgeable elders of the Pakayaku community acted as informants and agreed to reveal their wisdom of the karacha panga. The informants answered freely about several topics, namely the Kichwa common name, the parts of the plant used, the description of use, the harvest season, storage (if any), concoction, and treatment targets. After the field wok, data were added to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. All recorded uses were referred to a previously published classification [
