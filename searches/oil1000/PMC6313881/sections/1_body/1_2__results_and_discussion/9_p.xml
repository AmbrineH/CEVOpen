<p class="p">Innovative drug discovery in anti-inflammatories today is focused in non-purine structures which offer some advantages over existing commercialized molecules such as allopurinol. To date, the alternative drug had been febuxostat, but the USA (Food and Drug Administration) FDA recently issued safety alerts for its use [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-07-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. For this reason, it seems very interesting to carry out new research lines focused on the characterization of the chemical profile of the essential oil and the chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Hyptis obtusiflora</italic> in the Kichwa communities of the Bobonaza River Basin in particular and the Amazonian Ecuador in general. It is a very useful plant to be cultivated because it is an autochthonous element with an easy method of propagation, and the essential oil can give many medicinal benefits. The pharmacological activity of the components dealing with XO inhibition and anti-inflammatory processes must be quantified and standardized. This is a good case for demonstrating the possibilities that vegetal biodiversity can offer as a resource to improve human health and quality of life. Innovative products, to substitute classical lifelong anti-gut drugs (e.g., allopurinol or, more recently, flebuxostat) can be developed from the jungle biodiversity.
