 <xref rid="plants-07-00104-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The biological applications of some of the components isolated from close species are well known as anti-inflammatories or antinociceptives in several cases. Thus, 1,8-cineole has shown therapeutic benefits in inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [
