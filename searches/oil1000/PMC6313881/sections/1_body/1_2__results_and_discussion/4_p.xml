<p class="p">Our field work revealed that the Kichwa of the Bobonaza in Pakayaku used 
 <italic class="italic">Hyptis obtusiflora</italic> externally as a medicinal plant on the skin to treat stings, pimples, or injuries that insects cause, especially in the most vulnerable individuals of the population, i.e., the children. They use the juice of the leaf, and the guideline is a twice-a-day application. The people of the community value this remedy very positively. The transmission of this knowledge has occurred orally in the ayllus (families) through specific conversations among women. It is a current use and very often used at the frequency with which these injuries occur in the location where the climate promotes an abundance of insects. The plant is consumed just after collection; it has never been stored or preserved.
