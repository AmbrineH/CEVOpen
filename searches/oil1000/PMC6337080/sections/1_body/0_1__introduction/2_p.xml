<p class="p">Hemp health benefits are also associated with phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], which occur in variable amounts in almost all classes of plant-derived foods and agro-industrial residues. Epidemiological, clinical, and nutritional studies strongly support the evidence that dietary phenolic compounds are effective in the prevention of common diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and others [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. A large number of polyphenols has been identified in hemp, especially flavonoids such as flavanones, flavanols, flavonols, and isoflavones [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Hemp flavones and flavonols exert a wide range of biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuro-protective properties [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In addition, apigenin has been shown to play anxiolytic and estrogenic roles [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Several simple and complex lignanamides, also endowed with uncommon and varying bioactive properties, are among the most abundant (poly-) phenolics of hemp seeds and cake flour [
