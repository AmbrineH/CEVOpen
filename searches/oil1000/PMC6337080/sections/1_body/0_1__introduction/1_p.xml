Hemp oil is rich in nutrients and health-promoting components, including vitamins, mineral salts, amino acids, and phytosterols, etc. In this sense, the most interesting property is the relatively high content of α-linolenic essential fatty acid, belonging to the ω-3 series. In general, hemp seed oil is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic (18:2, ω-6) and α-linolenic (18:3, ω-3) essential fatty acids [
