<p class="p">This study reports on the physico-chemical, chemical, and biochemical characterization of hemp seeds, oil, and flour (
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> L.) from the monoecious genotype 
 <italic class="italic">Fedora</italic>, which is among the most popular hemp variety and it is listed within the EU database of admitted agricultural species [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The main aim of the research was to monitor the distribution of hemp seed components in the flour or in the oil, after fractionation by cold-pressing. In particular, both the saponificable and un-saponificable lipid fraction, accounting for 25â€“35% by weight of hemp seed, and the macro- and micro-elements, as well as the total polyphenols content and the antioxidant activity (DPPH method), have been determined. Finally, possible cultivar characteristic traits to be monitored for traceability were assessed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.
