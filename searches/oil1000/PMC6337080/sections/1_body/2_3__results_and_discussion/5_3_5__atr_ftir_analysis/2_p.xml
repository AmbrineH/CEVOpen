<p class="p">Only the spectra of seeds and flour presented the broad band centred at 3280 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> typical of N-H stretch of secondary amine. Consistently, the protein amide I due to C=O stretching vibrations (1637 cm

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) bands only occurred in the spectra of seeds and flour samples. The protein characteristic bands relatively intensified in flour spectra, due to oil depletion.
