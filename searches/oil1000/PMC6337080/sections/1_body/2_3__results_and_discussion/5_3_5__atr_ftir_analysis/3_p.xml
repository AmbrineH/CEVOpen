<p class="p">Carbohydrates possess strong and characteristic IR absorptions between 1200 and 750 cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> (fingerprint region) relevant to coupling and combination of stretching/deformation or vibrational modes of individual bonds in the molecular skeleton. Both seeds and flour had intense IR bands assigned to carbohydrates, although the profile in the fingerprint region was significantly different between the two samples. As expected, these bands were missing in the oil. However, such a preliminary suggestion requires opportune validation through dedicate investigations.
