<p class="p">The DPPH free radical-scavenging activity of extracts from hemp resources expressed as % inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00083-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), was consistent with the total polyphenol amount, being comparable between seeds and flour (51.5 and 46.8% inhibition, respectively), while it was much lower for oil extracts (8.2% inhibition). We built a calibration curve of inhibition, using Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> as the positive control of the assay. The equation of the calibration curve was y = 8.941x + 4.96, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.998, where y is % inhibition and x are the Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> milliequivalents. Thus, based on the DPPH free radical-scavenging activity, the polyphenol content in terms of Trolox
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> milliequivalents was 5.2, 4.7, and 0.36 for seeds, flour, and oil extracts, respectively.
