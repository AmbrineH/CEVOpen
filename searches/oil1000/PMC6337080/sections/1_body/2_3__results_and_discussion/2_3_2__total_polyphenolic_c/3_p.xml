<p class="p">Mainly due to the discrepancy among the molecular weight between the standard (i.e., gallic acid) and complex polyphenols, most part of which in hemp seeds and flour are classifiable as lignanamides [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], the FC tends to underestimate the total polyphenol content. In the case of olive oil biophenols, the values obtained with the FC and HPLC-based (the IOC one) methods differ each other by a factor of 2.3â€“2.6, according to a recent evaluation [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. For matrices other than the olive oil, this correlation factor should be determined case-by-case.
