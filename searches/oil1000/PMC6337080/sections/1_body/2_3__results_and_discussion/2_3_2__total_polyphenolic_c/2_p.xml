 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (gallic acid equivalents) total polyphenols, respectively, determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) method. Although the level of alcohol-soluble proteins is expected to be very low, FC-based determination of total polyphenols might be biased by several interfering components, including sugars and free amino acids, as well as by the use of unspecific standards. For this reason, polyphenols were semi-quantified also by RP-HPLC adapting the International Olive Council (IOC) method for the determination of the olive oil biophenols [

While for oil the determination of total polyphenols yielded very similar values between the two methods, they differed significantly for hemp seeds and flour.
