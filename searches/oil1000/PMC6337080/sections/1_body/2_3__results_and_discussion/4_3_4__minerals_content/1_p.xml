<p class="p">The determination of macro- and some trace elements in hemp seeds, flour, and oil is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00083-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Mg and K were the dominant macro-elements in analysed samples, followed by Ca and finally Na, which occurred at a much lower concentration. All macro-elements had a higher concentration in flour than the seeds and, as expected, both were richer in macro-elements than the oil.
