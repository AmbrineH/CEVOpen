<p class="p">Glycerolipids of hemp seeds, flour and oil were analysed as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by GC/FID (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00083-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). As expected, the fatty acid composition was similar among the three samples and linoleic acid was dominant in all samples, representing more than 56% of the fatty acids content (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00083-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Other unsaturated fatty acids were linolenic (14.55–15.02%), oleic (12.74–12.79%), and γ-linolenic (2.94–3.03%) acids. Major saturated acids were palmitic (7.03–7.35%) and stearic (2.62–2.78%) acids.
