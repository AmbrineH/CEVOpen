<p class="p">After saponification of glycerolipids, squalene, phytosterols, and tocopherols were determined by GC/FID as well. Among the phytosterols, β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were the most abundant. β-sitosterol is effective to reduce hypercholesterolemia, beyond possessing antiviral, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Plant sterols reduce plasma cholesterol levels by blocking cholesterol absorption through crystallization and co-precipitation. Within the intestinal lumen, phytosterols reduce cholesterol solubility by excluding it from lipid micelles, thereby preventing its absorption. In addition, sterols compete with cholesterol for intestinal uptake [
