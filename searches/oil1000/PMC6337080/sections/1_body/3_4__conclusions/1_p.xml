<p class="p">The results of our study confirm the nutritional features of hemp seed and oil but also highlight the possibility to utilise the waste resources (flour cakes) after oil extraction as a valuable source of natural antioxidants meant for preparing functional food products and nutraceuticals. The edible products, seeds, oil, and flour obtained from a single cultivar had a similar chemical and nutritional composition in terms of acidic and phytosterol profile, phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and content of macro- and micro-elements, even though the relative content of some specific compounds varied in oil, compared to seeds and flour.</p>
