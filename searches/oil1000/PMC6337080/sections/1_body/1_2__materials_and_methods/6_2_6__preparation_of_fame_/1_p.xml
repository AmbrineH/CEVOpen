<p class="p">Analysis of the FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) was performed according to Siano et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The samples of crude extracted oil and Soxhelet-extracted lipids from seeds and flour (about 0.2 g) were transferred into Pyrex test tubes with screw caps, and 2 mL of 1.25 N HCl-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH solution was added. Samples were incubated in a water bath at 90 °C for 60 min. FAME was extracted with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, after the addition of 2 mL of distilled water. The organic phase was filtered using Millex 0.45 μm PVDF disposable syringe filters (EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and 1 μL was directly injected into the gas chromatograph for analysis.
