<p class="p">Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) analyses were performed using a Spectrum 400 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a DTGS (Deuterated triglycine sulfate) detector. Overall, 32 scans/spectrum were acquired in the 4000–650 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> range with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Samples were analysed without any previous treatment. To test repeatability, analyses were performed in triplicate and average spectra were used. Spectra were elaborated using the PE Spectrum software version 10.5.1, purchased with the instrument.
