<p class="p">The elemental analysis of macro and trace elements were measured by ICP-OES with iCAP 7000 Series (Thermo Scientific), equipped with ASX-520 autosampler (CETAC™). A calibration curve was constructed using three standard solutions for each element. In order to prevent interference to calibration solutions, 100 µg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yttrium solution (Trace Cert, Fluka) was used as internal standard. The elements contents were calculated by using standard curves and the final concentrations were expressed as g element kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dry weight for macro-elements, while they were expressed as mg element kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dry weight for micro-elements.
