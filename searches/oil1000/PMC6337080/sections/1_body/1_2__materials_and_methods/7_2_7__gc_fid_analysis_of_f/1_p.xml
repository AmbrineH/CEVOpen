<p class="p">FAME, prepared as reported above, were analysed with a Trace GC gas chromatographer (Thermo Scientific, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an FID (Flame Ionization Detector), using an SP-2560 (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.20 μm) capillary column (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were introduced through a split-splitless injection system of an AS 3000 autosampler in split mode (ratio 1:100) at 260 °C. The oven temperature program started at 140 °C (held for 5 min) and linearly increased to 260 °C (4 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) up to the end of the analysis, according to previously described operating conditions (Siano, et al., 2016). FID temperature was 260 °C. The fatty acid composition of all samples was obtained by comparison with the retention times of the standard mixture FAME 37 components (Sigma-Aldrich) and was expressed as a percentage area.
