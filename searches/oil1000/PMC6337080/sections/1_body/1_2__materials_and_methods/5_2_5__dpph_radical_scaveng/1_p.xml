<p class="p">One millilitre of freshly prepared DPPH radical solution (0.125 mM) was added to 1 mL of the extract (0.2 g mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) prepared as described and mixed well to start the radical-antioxidant reaction. The absorbance at 517 nm was determined against a blank of pure methanol after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 min of reaction, and used to estimate the remaining radical levels according to the standard curve. The percent inhibition was calculated, after 15 min of reaction, according to Lee et al. [
