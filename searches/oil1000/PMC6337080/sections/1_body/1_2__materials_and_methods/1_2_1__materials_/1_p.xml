<p class="p">The edible hemp resources, hemp seeds, hemp flour cake, and cold-pressed hemp seed oil, obtained from the 
 <italic class="italic">Fedora</italic> cultivar, were provided by “Lentamente Società Cooperativa, Agricola” (Torrecuso BN, Italy). Seeds were collected during three consecutive years and refrigerated at −20 °C soon after harvesting. Hemp products were obtained from seeds mixed in equal proportions among the three collections, in order to average the composition over different harvests.
