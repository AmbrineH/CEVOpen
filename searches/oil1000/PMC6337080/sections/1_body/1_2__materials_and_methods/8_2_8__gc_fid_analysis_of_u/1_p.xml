<p class="p">All oil samples (crude extracted oil, Soxhelet-extracted lipids from seed and flour) were saponified according to the method of Caligiani et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The unsaponified components were extracted in diethyl ether and washed with water until neutral reaction occured. The ether phase was dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered on paper and finally dried under vacuum. The residue oil was dissolved in 50 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and analyzed using the above chromatographer equipped with an RTX-5, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Samples (1 μL) were introduced through the autosampler in 1:10 split mode at 250 °C. The oven temperature program started at 200 °C (held for 2 min) and linearly increased to 300 °C (20 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) at the end of the analysis. Plant sterol mix (Matreya, State College, PA, USA), was used as external standards for qualitative and quantitative determinations. Data were recorded and processed using the ChromQuest 5.0 software (Thermo).
