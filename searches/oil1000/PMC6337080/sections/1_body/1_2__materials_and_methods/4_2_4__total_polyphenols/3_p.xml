<p class="p">To this purpose, 2 mL aliquots of the polyphenol extracts were dried in a Savant speed-vac, re-suspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). One-tenth of the polyphenol extracts from seeds and flour, and half of the oil extract were separated by RP-HPLC using a modular HP 1100 chromatographer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a diode array detector (DAD). The stationary phase was a C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> reversed-phase column 250 × 2.1 mm i.d., 4 μm particle diameter (Jupiter Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), at 37 °C with a thermostatic oven. Separations were carried out at a 0.2 mL/min constant flow rate, applying a 5–65% gradient of the organic modifier (solvent B: Acetonitrile/0.1% TFA) in 5–65 min, following 5 min of isocratic elution at 5% B. At 66 min the % B increased up to 100%. Solvent A was 0.1% TFA in HPLC-grade water. Separations were monitored at λ = 450, 360, 320, and 280 nm wavelengths, and peaks were integrated using the HPLC ChemStation software vers. A.07.01 (Agilent). Samples were run in triplicate and the peak area was averaged among the technical replicates. Practically, polyphenols were separated, determined at 280 nm and quantified using caffeic acid as the internal standard, considering the same response factor for all of the phenolic compounds [
