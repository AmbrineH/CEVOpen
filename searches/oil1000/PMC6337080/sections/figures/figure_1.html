 <p> Reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) chromatograms of hydroalcoholic extracts from seeds ( A), flour ( B) and oil ( C) of hemp Fedora cv. The seed and flour extracts share a very similar chromatographic pattern, dominated by lignanamides [ 27]. As expected, the oil extracts exhibited a different chromatogram, which most likely included simple phenolics and cannabinoid derivatives [ 28]. </p>
