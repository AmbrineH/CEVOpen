 <sub class="sub">ab</sub>, chroma and hue values of flour made from red and black-eye varieties using different pre-treatment methods. Colour changes during roasting are ascribed to Maillard reactions occurring during roasting [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], influencing ΔE*
 <sub class="sub">ab</sub>, chroma and hue values of flour. The ΔE*
 <sub class="sub">ab</sub> specifies differences between colour of control sample (raw) and pre-treated flour [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The ΔE*ab (0.14) of black-eye seeded raw and soaked flour shows that differences between flour were not perceptible by human eye. However, the ΔE*ab (1.2) of red seeded raw and soaked flour shows that differences between flour were perceptible through close observation. Exclusive roasting, combined soaking, and roasting processes are shown to have an effect on the colour of flour in both varieties such that colour differences from raw flour were perceptible at a glance. Even though soaking prior to roasting reduced ΔE*ab of flour of both varieties, differences in colour between exclusively roasted and combined soaked and roasted flour were still easily perceptible (ΔE*ab, 4.2–4.7). Chroma indicates the degree in which a colour differs from the neutral colour of the same value whilst hue is defined as perception of colour of an object (i.e. red, orange, green, blue) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Just like ΔE*ab trends, pre-treatments caused significant differences in chroma and hue (p &gt; 0.05). Dry roasting resulted in higher chroma values than other processes whereas an opposite trend was observed for hue, with roasting decreasing hue values in both varieties. Colour differences are relevant as they affect consumer acceptability of products.
