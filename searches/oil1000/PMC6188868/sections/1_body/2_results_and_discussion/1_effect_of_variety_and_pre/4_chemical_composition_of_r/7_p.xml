<p class="p">Fructose and sucrose contents ranged from 0.18 to 0.33 g/100 g DW and 1.9 to 5.0 g/100 g DW, respectively. Soaking decreased sucrose in both varieties, but the effect was more pronounced in the black-eye variety, which initially had a higher sucrose content. The current findings agree with Adebowale, Awolala [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], who also observed a decrease in carbohydrate content by soaking as well varietal differences. Longland, Barfoot [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] found that soaking affected both fructose and sucrose concentrations, but only sucrose in a significant manner. Significant differences in sucrose content between varieties (p = 0.021) were observed as opposed to insignificant effects on fructose (p = 0.145). Conversely, a significant difference was present between pre-treatments regarding sucrose and fructose contents (p &gt; 0.05).
