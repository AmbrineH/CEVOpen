<p class="p">The starch content of the red variety decreased significantly (p = 0.000) due to pre-treatment contrary to trends in pre-treated black-eye flour. The exhibited opposite behaviour in varieties is attributed to differences in the rate of starch hydrolysis due to presence of fibre, possible presence of natural enzyme inhibitors during analysis and inherent differences in starch structure and composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Insignificant differences in starch content between pre-treatments (p = 0.792) were found, implying that differences observed in starch after pre-treatment were only due to varietal differences.
