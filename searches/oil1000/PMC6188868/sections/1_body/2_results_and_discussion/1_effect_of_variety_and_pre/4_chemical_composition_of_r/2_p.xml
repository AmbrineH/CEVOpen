<p class="p">Protein content of flour from both varieties ranged from 15.6–19.6 g/100 g DW using a factor of 5.7 to convert nitrogen to protein. In previous studies 6.5 was used [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The general use of 6.25 as N:P conversion factor is criticised because this disregards variations in non-protein nitrogen and variable percentages of nitrogen in individual proteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Yet the protein content of raw BG in this study is in line with the 17.8–19.7 g/100 g DW [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], but lower than the 25 g/100 g reported by Brough, Azam-AIi [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The protein content of the flour of the red variety was significantly higher than that of the black-eye variety (p = 0.00), implying that choice of variety matters [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Moreover, pre-treatments significantly increased the protein content of flour of both varieties (p = 0.001).
