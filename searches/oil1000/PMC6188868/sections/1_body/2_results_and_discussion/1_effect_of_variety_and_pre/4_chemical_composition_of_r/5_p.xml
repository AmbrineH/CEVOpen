<p class="p">The starch content in flour from raw red and black-eye seeds, i.e. 50.4 and 49.8 g/100 g DW, respectively, is comparable to the 39–50% reported by Poulter [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], but lower than the 56.9–58.3 g/100 g DW reported by Deshpande, Sathe [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. This dissimilarity is attributed to varietal differences [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], cultivation conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In comparison to other legumes, total starch content was comparable to the 41–44% in raw lentil, chickpea and red kidney beans [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], but higher than the 31–38% in raw cowpea [
