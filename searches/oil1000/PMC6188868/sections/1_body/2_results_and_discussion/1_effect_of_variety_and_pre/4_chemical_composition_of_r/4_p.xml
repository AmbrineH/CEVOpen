<p class="p">The fat content of flour, which ranged from 7.0 to 8.6 g/100 g DW, agrees with the 6.0â€“10.4 g/100 g reported by Yusuf, Ayedun [

As expected, no differences in fat content due to pre-treatments (p = 0.153) were observed. The low fat content in flour of raw seeds is ascribed to the larger amount of hulls as a result of poor dehulling efficiency, which lowered the fat content as hulls contain nearly no fat [
