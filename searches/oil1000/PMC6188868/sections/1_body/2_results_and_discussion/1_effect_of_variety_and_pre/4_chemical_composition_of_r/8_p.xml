 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], who reported an increase in ash content after dehulling. The effect of pre-treatment on ash content was significantly higher in the red variety than in the black-eye variety (p = 0.000). Within pre-treatments, only the roasted and combined soaking and roasted flour had comparable ash contents. The flour from soaked seeds had a lower ash content.
