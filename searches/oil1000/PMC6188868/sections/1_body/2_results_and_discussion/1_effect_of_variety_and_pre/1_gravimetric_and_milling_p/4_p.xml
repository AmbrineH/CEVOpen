<p class="p">Milling efficiency of raw coarse milled seeds increased after pre-treatment of seeds from 65% to 70–75% showing little distinction between varieties and methods, implying the applicability of all pre-treatments in circumventing HTM properties. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows the variation in particle size distribution of raw and pre-treated flour whereby a bi-modal distribution was evident in some red variety flours, agreeing with [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. From the distribution curve, parameters d
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and d
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>, which represent the diameter of 10, 50 and 90% of the population of the particles, are represented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Ten percent of all samples had a diameter between 7.1–11 μm, 50% between 30–51 μm and 90% between 125–175 μm. As there were insignificant differences in 90% of the particle size, we expect a negligible effect of particle size on the characteristics imparted to the food products.
