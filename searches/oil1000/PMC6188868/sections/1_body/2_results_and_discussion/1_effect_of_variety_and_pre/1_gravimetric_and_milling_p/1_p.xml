 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the variation of gravimetric and milling properties of raw pre-treated BG seeds. All pre-treatment methods decreased both the bulk and true density. This can be attributed to a higher rate of increase in seed volume than weight [
