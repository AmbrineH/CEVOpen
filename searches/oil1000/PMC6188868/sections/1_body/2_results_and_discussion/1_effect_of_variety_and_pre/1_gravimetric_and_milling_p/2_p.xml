<p class="p">According to Malik and Saini [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], a decrease in moisture content of seeds should be correlated to the decline in porosity as shown by the decline in moisture in all pre-treated seeds. However, an exception was in dry roasted red BG. Data of porosity are important to determine size reduction properties and the resistance to airflow during aeration and drying procedures such that a low porosity means a low heat transfer [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The significance of the observed results on porosity is that the raw and pre-treated seeds will differ in size reduction properties, which will affect homogeneity of particle size and the functional properties of flour.
