<p class="p">Raw seeds are very difficult to mill (HTM properties) as shown by a DE (%) of less than 15%, which increased to 83–88% when a dehulling pre-treatment was adopted. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows the images of raw and treated seeds, which display the differences in cotyledon and seed coat attachment. The low DE (%) of raw seeds is because the seed coat is strongly attached to the cotyledon, which makes removal difficult without pre-treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, treatment causes important changes. An insignificant effect of variety and pre-treatment (p &gt; 0.05) on DE (%) found suggests that all pre-treatment methods were equally useful in managing the HTM characteristic. The positive effect of soaking on DE (%) in the current study agrees with the 81–88% reported by Enwere and Hung [
