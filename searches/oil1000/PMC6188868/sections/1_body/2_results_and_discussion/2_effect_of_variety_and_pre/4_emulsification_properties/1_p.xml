<p class="p">Emulsification capacity (EC) of raw and pre-treated flour ranged from 29 to 50% as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. EC and emulsion stability (ES) are indices to evaluate emulsifying properties of flours. EC measures the amount of oil that can be emulsified per unit of flour, whereas ES measures the ability of the emulsion to resist changes to its structure over a defined period [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. EC is mainly determined by the solubility of the proteins, but insoluble proteins play a role as well, as do polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Protein can emulsify and stabilize an emulsion by decreasing the surface tension of the oil droplet and providing electrostatic repulsion on the surface of the oil droplet [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. EC of raw flours, i.e. 49.1 and 50.2%, was lower than the 65â€“69% of raw BG reported by Adebowale, Awolala [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In comparison to other legumes, EC was comparable to the 50% reported for pigeon pea [
