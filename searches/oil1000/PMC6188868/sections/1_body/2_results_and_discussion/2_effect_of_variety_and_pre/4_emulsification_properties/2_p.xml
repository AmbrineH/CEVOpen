<p class="p">ES of flours from raw seeds, i.e. 47.9 and 45.2%, were lower than the 70% reported for soaked BG flour by Adebowale and Lawal [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. All pre-treatments significantly decreased EC and ES (p &gt; 0.05), with roasting causing a greater decline, while soaking had little effect. Adebowale, Awolala [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] reported contrasting results on effects of soaking on EC of flour from black and cream BG varieties. Cold soaking decreased EC of cream variety flour, whereas an increase was observed in black variety flour. Currently, considering the varietal effect on EC, differences between combined soaking and roasting (46%), soaked flour (48%) and raw flour (50%) were small. Decreases in both EC and ES after roasting agree with Obatolu, Fasoyiro [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], who reported EC values ranging from 50.7% for raw to 20% for roasted beans and reported that processing resulted in significant reductions in EC for all treatments.
