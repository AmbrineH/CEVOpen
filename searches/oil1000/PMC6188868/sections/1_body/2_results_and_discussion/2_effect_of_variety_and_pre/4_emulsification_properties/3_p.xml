<p class="p">Good emulsification properties are important in many fat-containing food products, such as sausages, vegetable milk and milk-based products, as well as cake batters [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The negative effect of roasting on EC capacity and ES is ascribed to denaturation and dissociation of proteins and exposing hydrophobic regions, which increase surface tension [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Even though roasting reduced emulsification properties of BG flour, soaking prior to roasting seemed to mitigate the negative roasting effect. Soaking changes physical properties of flour, thereby decreasing the effect of heat treatments. The positive effect of soaking is ascribed to a change in thermal conductivity [
