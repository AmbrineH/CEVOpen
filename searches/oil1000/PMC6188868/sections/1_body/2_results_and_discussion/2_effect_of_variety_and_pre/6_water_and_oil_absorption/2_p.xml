<p class="p">Oil absorption capacity (OAC) of flours ranged from 0.56–0.68 g/g (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), which is lower than 1.3–2.0 ml/g DW reported by Diedericks and Jideani [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and Adebowale, Afolabi [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. In comparison to other legumes, the OAC was comparable to the 0.8 g/g reported for soaked cowpea flour [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], but lower than the 1.9 g/g for raw cowpea flour [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. All pre-treatments increased the OAC in the red variety, but the opposite trend was observed in the black-eye variety. The positive effects of roasting on the OAC of legumes, which were confirmed by Yusuf, Ayedun [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], and Onimawo and Akpojovwo [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], are ascribed to emerging new binding sites that result from the dissociation and denaturation of protein during roasting. Oil absorption is important in oil-containing solid products, such as meat, sausages and donuts [
