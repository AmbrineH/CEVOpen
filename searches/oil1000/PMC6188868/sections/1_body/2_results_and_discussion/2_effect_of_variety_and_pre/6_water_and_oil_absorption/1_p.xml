<p class="p">Water absorption capacity (WAC) of raw and pre-treated flours varied from 0.51 g/g to 1.12 g/g DW (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), which is lower than the 1.6 ml/gâ€”2.8 ml/g DW previously reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In comparison to other legumes, WAC of BG flour was lower than the 2.1 g/g reported for roasted cowpea flour [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Soaking and dry roasting in the current study increased WAC, in line with Yusuf, Ayedun [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] for BG and [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] for cowpea. A high WAC in flour is attributed to denaturation and dissociation of proteins during roasting, which leave more polar binding sites than native protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. A higher WAC enables bakers to add more water to doughs, improving handling and maintaining freshness in bread [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. When considering the average WAC for both varieties, differences between raw and soaked flour are marginal (0.52 and 0.54 g/g, respectively), and the same trend appears for the dry roasted and combined soaking and roasting treatment (1.0 g/g and 1.1 g/g, respectively). Further, only pre-treatments significantly affected the WAC (p = 0.000).
