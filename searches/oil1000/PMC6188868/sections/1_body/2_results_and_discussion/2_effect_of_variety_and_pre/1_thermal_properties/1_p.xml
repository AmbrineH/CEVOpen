 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], gelatinization temperatures are related to characteristics of the starch granule, such as the degree of crystallinity, starch composition and molecular structure of amylopectin. Gelatinization describes the irreversible disruption of molecular order within a starch granule when heated in excess water. The (T
