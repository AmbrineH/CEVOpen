<p class="p">Gelatinization improves stiffening abilities of flour. In food applications, good gelatinization properties are important for thickening of soups and porridge [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. During pre-treatment, lower gelatinization temperatures are therefore desirable, because of the lower energy requirements. However, differences in gelatinization temperature were fairly small, indicating a low variability in thermal properties of molecules, including starch granules that make up each variety [

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) were small, reducing the importance of this flour characteristic for food applications.
