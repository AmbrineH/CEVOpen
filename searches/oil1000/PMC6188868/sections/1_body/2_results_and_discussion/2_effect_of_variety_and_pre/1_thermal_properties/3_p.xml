<p class="p">Pre-treatments increased gelatinization temperatures, indicating alterations in starch granule characteristics. In all cases, a significant effect of variety on gelatinization temperatures (p &gt; 0.05) was observed. Basically, flour from the red variety had higher gelatinization temperatures than flour from the black-eye variety. Furthermore, a significant effect of pre-treatments on gelatinization temperatures (p &gt; 0.05) was revealed. Pre-treatments resulted in similar values peak (T
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>) temperatures for both varieties, indicating that heat treatment hardly affected (T
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>). Pre-treated flour increased enthalpy of gelatinization (Î”H) and the same statistical trend as for gelatinisation temperatures was observed.
