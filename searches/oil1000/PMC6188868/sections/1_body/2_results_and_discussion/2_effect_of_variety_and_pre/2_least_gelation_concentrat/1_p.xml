 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the Least Gelation Concentration (LGC) of flour, which is defined as the lowest concentration of flour to form a self-supporting gel [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Flour with a lower LGC has a greater gelling capacity. Gelation occurs due to protein denaturation, causing formation of hydrogen and ionic bonds stabilizing the gel and gelatinization of starch with other factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Current LGC values, which varied from 6 to 10%, were comparable to the 8% reported by Eltayeb, Ali [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], but lower than the 12, 16 and 28% previously reported [
