<p class="p">Generally, black-eye flours had the least LGC values as compared to the red variety flours. This is credited to thee higher starch content of flours from the black-eye variety. Moreover, differences are also ascribed to variations in the relative ratio of protein and lipids and the interaction between these components [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In both varieties, roasting had a negative effect on LGC, but the effect was more pronounced in the red variety. The higher LGC in roasted samples is attributed to protein denaturation and dissociation because of the high roasting temperature (179Â°C). Protein subunits resulting from dissociation might not be favourable to form hydrogen and ionic bonds [
