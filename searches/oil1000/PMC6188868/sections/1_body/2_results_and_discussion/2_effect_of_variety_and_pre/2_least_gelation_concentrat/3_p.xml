 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] showed that the sucrose concentration has a marginal effect on LGC. In the current study, sucrose is the only factor that was changed by soaking, explaining why LGC of soaked flour does not differ much from raw flour. Gelation is important in creating texture in many food products, such as yogurt, processed meats and gelatin-based products [
