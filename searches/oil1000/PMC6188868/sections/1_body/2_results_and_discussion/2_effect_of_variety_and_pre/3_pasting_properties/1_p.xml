<p class="p">Pasting properties of raw and pre-treated bambara groundnut varieties are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. Pasting includes the changes that occur after gelatinization upon further heating. These consist of further swelling of granules, leaching of molecular components such as amylose from the granules and eventual disruption of granules [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The properties of the swollen granules and the soluble materials leached from the granules control the viscosity parameters during pasting [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. All pre-treatments decreased peak viscosity, except in combined soaking and roasting of the black-eye variety.
