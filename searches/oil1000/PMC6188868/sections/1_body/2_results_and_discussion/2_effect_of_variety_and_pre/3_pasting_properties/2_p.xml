<p class="p">Peak viscosity indicates the water-binding capacity of the starch whereby the gelatinized starch reaches its maximum viscosity during heating in water [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Currently, insignificant differences were observed, implying that different treatments did not influence peak viscosity. High peak viscosity maybe suitable for products requiring high gel strength and elasticity. Moreover, a high peak viscosity indicates thermal stability of the flour, implying potential use in products requiring sterilization [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Trough viscosity measures the ability of the paste to withstand breakdown during cooling. It is the minimum viscosity value in the constant temperature phase of the Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) pasting profile. Trough viscosity decreased in flours of the red variety, whereas an insignificant increase was recorded for the black-eye variety. High trough viscosity implies that the flour has the ability to remain undisrupted when subjected to a hold period of constant high temperature and mechanical stress by rapid and continuous mixing [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The breakdown viscosity in the pasting profile indicate the degree of disintegration of granules or paste stability. Less stable starch paste is commonly accompanied with a high value of breakdown. The higher the breakdown value, the lower the ability to withstand heating and shear stress during cooking. As low breakdown values are associated with stable gruels, soaked flour of both varieties resulted in stable pastes, whilst flours from the combined soaking and roasting pre-treatment resulted in unstable pastes for both varieties.
