<p class="p">Pasting temperature provides an indication of the minimum temperature required to cook a flour (
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). High pasting temperatures indicate a high water-binding capacity, gelatinization tendency, and lower swelling property of a starch-based flour due to a high degree of association between starch granules. Pasting temperature did not change much in the flours of the red variety, but decreased in both varieties. Peak time was decreased in dry roasted and combined soaked and roasted flour of both varieties, whilst soaking slightly increased it.
