<p class="p">The final viscosity indicates the ability of the starch to form a viscous paste or gel after cooling. Final and setback viscosity decreased significantly in both varieties due to roasting, while an insignificant decrease was recorded in soaked flour of both varieties. Low final viscosity implies that flour will form a low viscous paste rather than a thick gel on cooking and cooling. Nutritionally, this means a high calorific density for a low volume [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. High setback values are associated with a cohesive paste. Therefore, the higher the setback viscosity, the lower the retrogradation during cooling and the lower the starting of retrogredation for a product made from the flour.
