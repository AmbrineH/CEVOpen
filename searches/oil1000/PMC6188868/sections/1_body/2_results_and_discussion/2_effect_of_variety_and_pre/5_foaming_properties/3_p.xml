<p class="p">FC has been related to the amount of protein, with native protein having better foaming abilities than denatured protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. This is due to the fact that proteins should be soluble in the aqueous phase, which happens most often at the isoelectric point [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Roasting is suggested to bring more hydrophobic areas of proteins to the surface, decreasing solubility. FC is important in food products such as cakes, soufflés and foams. Raw or soaked samples would be best for the production of this kind of products [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. However, milder pre-treatment (70–80 °C) has also been reported to improve FC and FS by promoting denaturation to the extent that some hydrophobic regions of proteins come to the surface and resist reabsorption into the aqueous phase, making the protein film more dense [
