<p class="p">FC of the black-eye variety was significantly higher than of the red variety. FC was increased by soaking, whilst a decline was observed for roasting, agreeing with Obatolu, Fasoyiro [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] for roasted yam bean. Soaking prior to roasting counteracted the effects of roasting significantly in the black-eye variety, but not in the red variety. The effect of soaking on roasting is ascribed to the difference in heat transfer during roasting caused by soaking [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. FS was comparable to the 80% after 1 h (with a FC of 70%) reported by Yusuf, Ayedun [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] and the 30% after 2 h [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. FS of raw and soaked samples after 2 h was higher than for cowpea flour (71%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Roasting significantly decreased FS compared to soaked and raw flour. Soaking prior to roasting reduced the negative effect of roasting.
