 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Foaming capacity (FC) of raw and pre-treated flours ranged from 3.3 to 22.9% as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. FC of raw red and black-eye varieties, i.e. 10.8 and 17.1%, respectively, agrees with the 17â€“18% reported by Adebowale, Awolala [
