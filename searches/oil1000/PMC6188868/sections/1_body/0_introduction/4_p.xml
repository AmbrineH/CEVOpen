<p class="p">A study by Onimawo, Momoh [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported low water binding capacities of raw BG flour as compared to cowpea and soya bean flours. In addition, low foaming properties and stability were also reported, suggesting unsuitability of BG flour for cakes and bread. In a study by Yagoub and Abdalla [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], combined soaking and cooking of BG seeds as well as roasting resulted in the least solubility of nitrogen, whereas soaking led to better solubility. Further, according Olapade and Adetuyi [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], foaming capacity was highest for a cold-water soaked flour (22%) while 13% was reported for roasted flour. Low foamability of roasted flour was attributed to ordered globular molecules due to the high temperature (190Â°C) employed during roasting [
