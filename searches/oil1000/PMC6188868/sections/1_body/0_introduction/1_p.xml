<p class="p">Impact analyses in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) indicated that indigenous legume crops can reduce vulnerability of rural households to food and nutrition insecurity [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. One such legume is bambara groundnut (BG) (
 <italic class="italic">Vigna subterranea</italic> (L.) Verdc.), which features in subsistence farming systems throughout semi-arid regions of SSA [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Bambara groundnut is an important source of affordable protein in the diets especially in regions where animal protein is comparatively expensive. The crop is richer in essential amino acids than other legumes and has a higher protein score (80%) than soya bean (74%) and cowpea (64%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This means that bambara groundnut has relatively more protein available for human metabolism than the other common legumes in Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, like other legumes, BG lacks sulphur containing amino acids [

 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Thus, blending bambara groundnut with a staple food, such as maize, which contains higher levels of cysteine and methionine, is a recommended nutritional strategy [
