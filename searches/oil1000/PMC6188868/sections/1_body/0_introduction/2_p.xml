<p class="p">Although BG is a crop with great nutritional and agronomic potential, it remains underutilized. Drawbacks to use BG and other legumes are the hard-to-cook (HTC) and hard-to-mill (HTM) phenomena [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The HTC phenomenon in legumes is characterised by an extended cooking time required to ensure adequate softening prior to consumption. In rural areas where BG is of significance, the predominant energy source for cooking is firewood. Due to limited firewood supply and the long time required for boiling, consumption of BG is hampered [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], thus warranting the need for alternative processing methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. A recent survey performed by our group Mubaiwa, Fogliano [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] revealed that soaking and or roasting are applied by some households as pre-treatment methods prior to milling of BG seeds into flour in an effort to circumvent the HTC problem. In previous studies, soaking [
