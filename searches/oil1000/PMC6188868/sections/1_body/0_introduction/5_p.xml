<p class="p">To improve the use of BG flour as a food ingredient, the functional properties and the characteristics imparted to food stuffs need to be assessed. Eventually, consumption of BG can be stimulated by processing seeds into a flour, easing the utilisation and providing more diversity in local diets. Improving the use of BG would mean an increase in food and nutrition security in SSA, while complying with local food preferences and habits. The aim of the paper is to investigate processing effects on chemical composition and functional properties of BG flour from different varieties. Such knowledge allows to decide if varietal differences should be accounted for and which pre-treatment results in the best flour for a particular application.</p>
