<p class="p">Pasting properties were determined according to Afolabi [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] using a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA 4500 Perten instruments, SIN 214 31208-45A, Australia). A suspension of 3 g of flour in 25 ml distilled water was subjected to controlled heating and cooling cycle under constant shear. During this cycle samples were held at 50°C for a minute, heated from 50 to 95°C at 6°C/min, held at 95°C for 5 min, cooled to 50°C at 6°C/min, and held at 50°C for 5 min. The pasting temperature, peak viscosity, trough viscosity, breakdown viscosity, final viscosity and setback viscosity (SB) values were obtained from the RVA curves and viscosity was expressed as centipoise units (Cp).
