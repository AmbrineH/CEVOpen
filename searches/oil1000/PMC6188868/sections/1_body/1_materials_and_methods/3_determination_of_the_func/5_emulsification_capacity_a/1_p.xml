<p class="p">Emulsification capacity (EC) and emulsion stability (ES) were determined according to Chaparro Acuña, Gil González [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] with some modifications. Flour samples (0.4 g), 20 ml of maize oil (0.9 ml/g) and 20 ml water (1.0 ml/g) (resulting in a 1% (w/v) mixture) were homogenized for 1 min using a Waring blender at low speed. Thereafter, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 1600 rpm and the height of the total content (TC) and the height of the emulsion layer (ELH) were measured. EC was determined by heating the sample at 80°C for 30 min.
