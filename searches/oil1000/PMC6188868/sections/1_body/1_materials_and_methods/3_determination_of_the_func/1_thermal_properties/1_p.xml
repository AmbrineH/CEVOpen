<p class="p">Thermal properties of flour were analysed using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) equipped with a thermal analysis data station (Perkin-Elmer Corp Norwalk. USA) according to Evageliou, Richardson [
 <xref rid="pone.0205776.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Flour (10–15 mg) was dispersed in distilled water (1:3 w/v) in hermetically sealed stainless steel capsules and incubated for 4 h to equilibrate moisture. Sample and reference pans (balanced to within ± 0.5 mg) were loaded at ambient temperature, cooled to 10°C, and held for 2 min before scanning to 120°C. Samples were scanned at a heating rate of 0.5°C/min using a Seteram microcalorimeter. Temperatures of characteristic transitions and enthalpy (ΔH) of transitions were recorded.
