<p class="p">A red and a black-eye seeded variety of BG were procured in Zimbabwe from the Director of Research and Specialist Services (DRSS) and Dee Spice Private Company, respectively. The varieties were grown in the 2016–2017 farming season, harvested and stored at ambient temperatures. Batches of 2 kg seeds each underwent different pre-treatments: i) no pre-treatment (raw), ii) soaking, iii) soaking followed by dry roasting and iv) dry roasting as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205776.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. Soaked seeds were prepared by immersing in excess deionised water for 24 h at 25°C followed by drying in an oven for 48 h at 50°C. Dry-roasted seeds were prepared by roasting in a Hot top Coffee bean roaster (KN-8828-2K, Pullman Espresso Accessories, Australia), following programme 6 for 10 min to standardize the roasting process. In programme 6, subsequent temperature ranges were maintained for 1 min (73–70°C, 70–80°C, 80–90°C, 90–106°C, 106–120°C, 120–132°C, 132–145°C, 145–162°C, 162–167°C, 167–179°C), followed by 5 min cooling. For the combined soaking and roasting treatment, seeds were soaked as in ii) and roasted as in iii). Next, all samples were mechanically dehulled using a SATAKE-TMO-5C dehuller. Dehulling efficiency (DE) was determined according to Enwere and Hung [

Next, pre-treated and raw seeds were coarse milled using a Rotormill (Condux Werk, Germany) to a flour that passed through a 1.5 mm sieve. Thereafter, about 25 g of coarse flour was fine milled using an IKA blender (Model A 11B S000, Germany) for 30 s before sieving through a 180-μm sieve to obtain flour. Milling efficiency (%) was determined by calculating the yield before and after fine milling and sieving.
