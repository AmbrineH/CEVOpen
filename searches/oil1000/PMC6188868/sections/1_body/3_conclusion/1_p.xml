<p class="p">All pre-treatment methods improved dehulling and milling efficiency of BG varieties cementing applicability in flour production. The decisive factor in selecting the preferred method for a specific food application has to focus on the sensorial, functional and nutritional properties of the flour. Colour was affected by roasting, such that roasted flour had a darker colour. Nutritionally, bambara groundnut flour compares with other legumes such as cowpea and chickpea. Varietal differences in chemical properties were minor, except for protein content and ash content, which were much higher in the red variety, making it considerably more nutritious. Consequently, pre-treatment is expected to have more effect on the functional properties of the red variety.</p>
