<p class="p">In this study, we demonstrated that propolis solubilized in different solvents and in liquid and solid form has a similar chemical composition when produced from the same raw material. To this aim, we prepared hydroalcoholic, glycolic (98% propylene glycol), glyceric and oily solutions as well as in powder form, named ESIT12, from the same propolis extract. A direct consequence of the same composition is a quite similar antioxidant activity when calculated for mg of polyphenols so we can produce finished products having a defined composition-activity relationship.</p>
