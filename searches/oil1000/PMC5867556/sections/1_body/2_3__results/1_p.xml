<p class="p">HPLC-UV-ESI-MS and tandem MS analyses [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] of the various propolis preparations in various solvents led to the identification of ~30 compounds in each sample (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), accounting for ~60â€“70% of the total molecular species. Identification was performed through the comparison of chromatographic retention times, and MS and tandem MS spectra, with the literature and with commercially available standard compounds, where possible. UV acquired at 260 nm and MS profiles are illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> also reports the quantitative data obtained with a UV detector by using a real commercially available standard or standard compounds possessing quite similar spectroscopic properties (for example, for quantitation of the various pinobanksin derivatives). The remaining unidentified part could be mainly represented by the family of triterpenoids and a small fraction of glycosylated derivatives [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In fact, triterpenoids are abundant and very common in all vegetable forms and they are generally present in any kind of extract [
