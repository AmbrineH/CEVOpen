   <bold class="bold">A brief history of cellular barriers. (A)</bold> The protoplasmic colloid model. The barrier is a hardened shell that forms when the dense colloidal protoplasm makes contact with the extracellular solution. Pictured here is artificial caviar made by the analogous process of spherification. Photo courtesy of J.L. Robertson. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> The paucimolecular model of Davson and Danielli, where the cell barrier is modeled as a lipid bilayer with a lipoid core flanked by layers of polar and charged proteins. From
