<p class="p">Cell membrane research over the last century has taken us from invisible boundaries to a structural lipid bilayerâ€”a low dielectric electrostatic barrier that is both fluid and flexible. Embedded within the membrane exists a completely different type of protein: membrane proteins that are hydrophobic in nature and present energetically favorable solutions for the passage of ions and molecules through selective pores or transport pathways. Now, with all of this structural information in place, we are faced with the question of how these proteins physically behave inside the lipid bilayer. The reactions of membrane proteins, from folding, binding, and conformational exchange, occur in this unique solvent environment that is essentially a layer of organized oil. It is so distinctly different from water and has a diverse chemical composition that changes from organelle to cell type to organism. Future research will need to account for the inherent complexities and diversity of membrane systems when working toward a quantitative understanding of membrane protein behavior in membranes. This is an important goal toward a thorough understanding of how the membrane and its protein constituents define the physiology of each living cell.</p>
