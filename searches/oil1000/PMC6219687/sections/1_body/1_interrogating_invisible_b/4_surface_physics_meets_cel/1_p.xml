This work sparked the interest of Agnes Pockels, a young woman who spent her time at home, caring for her parents and the household. Although she did not formally attend school, her brother was a university student studying physics, and she was exposed to the literature and textbooks that he would bring home. In her daily kitchen work, she would observe the behavior of oil on water while she washed the pots and pans, and this made her wonder about the molecular structure and physical properties of these thin films. With clear passion and determination, she built an apparatus for measuring the surface tension of the thin oil films on water out of the kitchen pans that she was so familiar with. She contacted Lord Rayleigh, and in 1891, he helped her to publish her first independent paper and one of the first studies of surface tension (

Several decades later, Irving Langmuir adapted Pockels’s apparatus for higher-resolution measurements to build the Langmuir trough and with this solidified the conclusion that olive oil forms lipid monolayers on the surface that are 13 Å thick (
