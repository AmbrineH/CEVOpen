<p class="p">Equipped with a light microscope, Robert Hooke examined the intricate assemblies of numerous biological samples, documenting these close-up observations in his book, 
 <italic class="italic">Micrographia</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hooke, 1665</xref>). One of the samples he examined was a material that was extracted from the underlayer of bark from a cork tree. He observed that the tissue was composed of a network of pores with thin “Interstitia, or walls” reminiscent of the “thin films of Wax in a Honey-comb.” He referred to these pores as “cells” and proposed that other tissues, in both plants and animals, may be organized in a similar fashion. He extensively studied animal structures such as the valves of the heart and veins but did not see any similar cellular compartmentalization. We now know that the reason he could visualize the cellular structures of cork but not animal cells was because he was seeing the dried up cell walls, easily visible by eye using a microscope. But even still, in plant cells, it was apparent that there was another invisible bounding mechanism that encapsulated the cytosolic solution of protein, salts, and small molecules. This was observed in some cells, where the protoplasm appeared to pull away from the cell wall and also contain the vacuoles and organelles within (

It was proposed that when this gel came into contact with the extracellular solution, there was a hardening at the contact layer, perhaps through aggregation of the colloidal matrix. For a modern-day example of this, consider the popular molecular gastronomy technique known as spherification (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). This is a method that is being used in the food industry to produce artificial caviar or the juicy popping bubbles found in bubble tea. These spheres are constructed by dropping solutions containing a sodium salt of the carbohydrate polymer alginate into calcium chloride. At the interface, calcium binds to the alginate and stabilizes the polymer network to form a hardened shell enclosing the liquid of interest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Therefore, there is a chemical precedent for this, but the question remained whether this was the actual mechanism of encapsulation in biological cells.
