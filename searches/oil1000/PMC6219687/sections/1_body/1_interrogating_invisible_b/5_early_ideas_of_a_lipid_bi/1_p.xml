<p class="p">The development of the Langmuir trough provided the key equipment for high-resolution investigations of the structure of cell membranes. If membranes were formed by oil, as Overton’s experiments indicated, then they should behave similarly to the olive oil experiments performed by Lord Rayleigh, Pockels, and Langmuir. In 1925, Evert Gorter and Françoise Grendel extracted cell membranes from erythrocytes to measure the surface properties of the cell membrane using the recently developed physics approaches. The choice of erythrocytes was key to this experiment because these cells do not contain major organelles, and so the lipid fraction extracted would be expected to represent only the plasma membrane. They used the Langmuir trough to measure the surface area of the lipid molecules composing the cell membrane (

This led them to conclude that the cell membrane was a lipid bilayer, formed by two layers of oil molecules. This was the first proposal of such a structure and somewhat serendipitous considering their experimental approach was far from robust. Changes in the lipid extraction methods and surface pressure dependencies can alter the conclusions of the experiment (
