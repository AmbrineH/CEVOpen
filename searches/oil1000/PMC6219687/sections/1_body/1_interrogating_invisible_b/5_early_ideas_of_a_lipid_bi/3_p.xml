<p class="p">In 1935, James Frederic Danielli and Hugh Davson compiled the many results from Fricke, Gorter, and Grendel and others to develop the paucimolecular model (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Danielli and Davson, 1935</xref>), i.e., a model with the minimum amount of necessary molecular detail. Technically, Fricke’s results allowed for membrane structures from unimolecular to trimolecular thickness, while Gorter and Grendel’s work suggested a bilayer with room for error. In the Danielli and Davson model, they propose a bilayer of ampipathic lipoid molecules filled with a nonpolar lipoid center (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2 B</xref>). On either side of the membrane is a protein layer at least one molecule thick adsorbed onto the lipoid surface because it was believed that proteins could not stably exist inside the membrane. In their model, it was these protein layers that were responsible for selective permeability, and they could form structures spanning the membrane to enable the passage of salts and sugars. This model consolidated many of the physical findings of the cell membrane, but the idea of the membrane structure as a lipid bilayer remained under heavy debate for many decades.
