<p class="p">The lipid bilayer is a completely conserved structure across all of biology. It provides a thermodynamically favorable solution to the physical problem of creating an electrical barrier. It is something that assembles spontaneously, driven by the hydrophobic effect, burying nonpolar acyl chains that are constrained by the polar and charged lipid head groups. The hydrophobic core provides an environment where water is rarely present, creating a low dielectric environment, where partial charges cannot rearrange to counteract the electrostatic field. Thus, the free energy required to transfer a charged particle from a high dielectric medium, like water, to the low dielectric of the membrane is highly unfavorable, making the leakage of ions prohibitive (

Thus, it is a barrier that possesses structural integrity but also the properties of elasticity and pliability that have been described. With the lipid bilayer, a cell builds a self-assembling, self-repairing, practically impermeable barrier for charged particles and ions, enabling the storage of information and potential energy to fuel biologyâ€™s work. It provides a natural and comprehensive solution, basically for free, and lets biology focus on the harder problem of enabling selective permeability.
