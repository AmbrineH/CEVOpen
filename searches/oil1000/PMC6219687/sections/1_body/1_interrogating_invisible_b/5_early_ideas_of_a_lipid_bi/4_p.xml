<p class="p">This changed in 1959, when J. David Robertson was studying the ultrastructure of myelin sheaths at the Nodes of Ranvier by electron microscopy. To improve resolution, he applied potassium permanganate (KMnO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) to stain structures, which highlighted a common trilaminar unit—two dark lines separated by a light center—that was observed at the plasma membrane boundary and encapsulating every organelle (
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robertson, 1959</xref>). He interpreted the dark lines as the adsorbed protein layers and the light center as the lipoid, similar to the model of Danielli and Davson. The observation of the same structure being visible for all cellular compartments led him to propose the unit membrane model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2 C</xref>), where he postulated that all membranes possess the same molecular structure. At that time, he even asserted that all membranes within a cell were in contact with one another, forming one continuous barrier. Although this idea is incorrect, the main point is that the lipid bilayer structure is something that is ubiquitous within biology, and it is capable of combining and fusing under the right conditions. In 1971, several studies measured the structure of membranes by x-ray diffraction (

 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wilkins et al., 1971</xref>), with results consistent with the lipid bilayer backing up Robertson’s imaging studies with high-resolution physical data. Finally, in 1972, Singer and Nicolson published their fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2 D</xref>), which is essentially the model of the membrane that is used today (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singer and Nicolson, 1972</xref>). Although many students are introduced to this concept in a single figure in a biology textbook, it does not do justice to the comprehensive understanding of the membrane structure, membrane proteins, and the thermodynamics of the system as a whole that is presented in their paper.
