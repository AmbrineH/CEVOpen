<p class="p">In the same year, Hugo Fricke measured the electrical capacitance of intact erythrocytes in suspension (

Fricke was cautious not to overinterpret his results, but if we take the 10–20-Å monolayer thickness measured by Rayleigh, Pockels, and Langmuir, the data are in agreement with a lipid bilayer structure.
