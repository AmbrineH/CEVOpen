<p class="p">A key development along the path to identifying integral membrane proteins was the discovery that one could purify fragments of membrane and reconstitute their electrical permeability behavior. In 1962, the first BLM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4 A</xref>) experiments were conducted, in which a membrane was reconstituted outside of any cellular structure while maintaining similar electrical properties to intact cell preparations (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bean et al., 1969</xref>) indicating that whatever was responsible for the permeability, the behavior could be resolved in a quantal manner. Finally, in 1970, the first single-channel recording was measured by adding the antibiotic peptide Gramicidin to a lipid bilayer (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hladky and Haydon, 1970</xref>). Gramicidin showed conductance behavior that was step-like, with constant step magnitudes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4 B</xref>). With this, permeability could be attributed to the peptide itself, and the macroscopic behavior dissected into a sum of individual channel conductances in the membrane. This led to the idea of proteins in the membranes facilitating membrane transport by creating “permanent or transient modifications of the bilayer structure.”
