<p class="p">As was the case with Robertson’s electron microscopy studies, visual evidence is often required to remove remaining doubts. Fortunately, for the study of integral membrane proteins, there was a serendipitous source of highly ordered proteins in membranes that could be reasonably obtained from a type of archaea, 
 <italic class="italic">Halobacterium halobium</italic>. These halobacteria were discovered to contain large, visible patches of purple membranes (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stoeckenius and Rowen, 1967</xref>). Dieter Osterhelt and Walter Stoeckenius developed methods for isolating these membrane fragments that contained nearly pure amounts of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1971</xref>). These preparations resulted in protein that was already in ordered two-dimensional crystals within the membrane, and with this, in 1975, Richard Henderson and Nigel Unwin reported the first structure of an integral membrane protein of bacteriorhodopsin at 7 Å (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Henderson and Unwin, 1975</xref>). It would take a decade before an atomic resolution structure of another membrane protein would be determined, with the delay being attributed to a fundamental biochemical challenge of membrane proteins. Protein crystallography requires the formation of highly ordered three-dimensional crystals from protein in solution. How, then, can membrane proteins be made soluble when they are hydrophobic and prone to aggregation? The solution came via the use of detergents and micelles as membrane mimetics (

 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tanford and Reynolds, 1976</xref>). Detergent has the capability of extracting protein from the membrane, replacing the surrounding lipid, and, in some cases, supporting the membrane protein in a folded and functional state. With this key development, in 1985, Johann Deisenhofer, Harmut Michel, and others reported the first atomic-resolution, 3.0-Å crystal structure of the photosynthetic reaction center of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodopseudomonas viridis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deisenhofer et al., 1985</xref>). With the ability to handle membrane proteins in solution, biochemical optimizations became tractable, and along with that came more structural information. In 1991, the structure of the bacterial outer membrane porin OmpF was solved at a remarkable 1.8-Å resolution (
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weiss et al., 1991</xref>), on par with the resolution being obtained for soluble protein structures. In 1998, Rod MacKinnon and his laboratory determined the first structure of a potassium ion channel, revealing the elegant pore structure conferring selective K

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). Since then, many structures of channels, transporters, pumps, and receptors have been solved, and today, they arrive at a steady pace, especially with recent technological developments in cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hendrickson, 2016</xref>). Although resolution is often lower for membrane proteins compared with soluble proteins, it is not an absolute fact, because many structures of membrane proteins have improved in resolution over time. One remarkable example is the structure of the yeast Aquaporin Aqy1 solved to a sub-angstrom 0.88-Å resolution (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>). Still, it remains true that our knowledge of the structures of membrane proteins, and particularly eukaryotic membrane proteins, falls well behind that of soluble proteins and that this is a consequence of the inherent biochemical challenges associated with expressing and purifying stable membrane proteins.
