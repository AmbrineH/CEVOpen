<p class="p">The earliest ideas of proteins existing inside the cell membrane came from deductions based on physiological observations. In many cell types studied, Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> was observed to be at a higher concentration outside of the cell, while K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> was found to be higher inside. In 1941, R.B. Dean proposed that to maintain these physiological concentrations, there must be a pump responsible for actively moving these ions against their gradients and that it may reside within the cell membrane (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell, 1957</xref>), and introduced models of integral translocases with alternating access transport mechanisms. The discovery of the Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>/K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ATPase by Jens Skou in 1957 (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Skou, 1998</xref>) identified a specific membrane protein responsible for active transport; however, it still remained unclear as to how this protein was associated with the cell membrane. At that time, both the Davsonâ€“Danielli and Robertson membrane models did not account for protein inside the lipoid core as polar and charged protein molecules were expected to destabilize the membrane structure. Further evidence would be required before it would become accepted that proteins could span the hydrophobic membrane.
