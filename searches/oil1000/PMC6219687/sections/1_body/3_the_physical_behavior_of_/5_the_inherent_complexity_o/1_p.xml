<p class="p">In cytosolic and extracellular solutions, there is only one solvent that is relevant to biological reactions: water. Yet, in the membrane, there are infinite possibilities of chemical compositions, and the physical properties of this diverse solvent are not a single set point but a sliding scale. The primary role of the lipid bilayer is to provide sufficient electrical and chemical barriers while maintaining fluidity to allow membrane proteins to function (

 <sub class="sub">12</sub> aliphatic acids before diverging into isoprene ethers in archaea and fatty acid esters in bacteria (

Typically, eukaryotic membranes are comprised of chain lengths from 16 to 18 carbons, consistent with the 3-nm hydrophobic thickness measured by Fricke, although there are some interesting biological examples of shorter membranes such as in organelles like the Golgi apparatus (

There is considerable diversity among lipid head group composition across different organisms, as well as chemistry in the acyl chains, including differing amounts of saturation and branch chain modifications. Eukaryotic membranes can contain high amounts of cholesterol. Furthermore, archaeal membranes are sometimes found to exist not as bilayers but as monolayers of tetraether lipids that resemble two phospholipids covalently connected at their tails (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valentine, 2007</xref>). To top it all off, biological membranes are often asymmetric across the inner and outer leaflets. Yet, despite all of this complexity, it is apparent that membrane proteins from the same family are homologous in structure despite striking differences in the native solvent environments. The long-held interpretation of this was that the lipids act mainly as inert nonspecific solvent molecules. Yet, we know that lipids play an important role in regulating function and protein stability. With this, it appears that many essential properties of membrane proteins are robust and can withstand small changes in lipid composition, but the reactions of these membrane proteins can be finely tuned by changes within the lipid bilayer.
