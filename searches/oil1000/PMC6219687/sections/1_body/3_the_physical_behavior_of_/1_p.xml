<p class="p">As stated by Singer and Nicolson, the membrane is a “two-dimensional liquid-like solution of monomeric or aggregated integral proteins … dissolved in the lipid bilayer” (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singer and Nicolson, 1972</xref>). Yet, the membrane solvent is much more complicated than the other biological solvent that we are used to thinking about, i.e., water. The lipid bilayer has a defined structure and along with it has macroscopic material properties. The chemical composition of membranes is also extremely diverse. In the past this has been interpreted as lipids playing a passive role in membrane protein reactions, merely providing the sea of solvent in which the protein floats about. Following this, many studies of membrane protein biochemistry do not involve lipid bilayers but instead study the protein in detergent micelles, a practical necessity for purification in the aqueous state. This approach is well justified if the protein’s function is maintained in a micellar environment, which can be the case when it is dominated by the intrinsic protein structure. However, it cannot be denied that standard methods of membrane protein purification strip away the natural solvent, placing the protein into an environment that could miss essential chemical or physical properties of the original lipid bilayer. Therefore, the reactions of membrane proteins, whether it is ligand binding, conformational stability, folding, or oligomerization, all depend on the free energy of the system as a whole, and this means in the context of the lipid bilayer.
