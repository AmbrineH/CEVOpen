<p class="p">From a structural perspective, many high-resolution crystal structures of membrane proteins have resolved specific lipids directly associated with the protein. In some of these, the lipids were added during purification, and they became ordered during crystallization. However, in other examples, the lipids appear to have come along for the ride, remaining bound even in the harsh conditions of detergent extraction. One example is the K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channel KcsA, which was observed to bind a single negatively charged lipid per subunit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), and this lipid appears to be necessary for function (
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valiyaveetil et al., 2002</xref>). High-resolution electron crystallography structures of native crystals of Aquaporin-0 (Aqp0) show the proteins are organized in a lattice, stitched together by a layer of lipids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), with a high degree of specificity for certain lipids at different sites (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hite et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, mass spectrometry analysis has provided more quantitative information about lipid binding and has been able to describe the specificity for interactions over other lipids (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the ability for lipids to shift oligomeric distributions in detergent micelles (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). Are these lipids that are found to interact with membrane proteins in structures or mass spectrometry analogous to crystallographic waters found in soluble proteins? Or do they represent something more like ligand binding in the context of the membrane? Electron spin resonance and fluorescence-quenching studies do not support the idea of long-lived lipids binding to membrane proteins in membranes (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee, 2003</xref>). However, it is likely that further research is required with the new structural data in hand to provide context of the reactions in the membrane.
