<p class="p">Although the lipid bilayer structure is generally constrained to the 3-nm hydrophobic core measured by Fricke, it exists across biology with practically infinite chemical compositions that vary molecular head group and acyl chain chemistry. This diversity appears to be a result of an organismâ€™s need to maintain an electrical and physical barrier while preserving membrane fluidity under changing environmental conditions (

Early studies of membrane protein reconstitution found that not all lipid bilayers were equivalent in terms of protein function and stability (

Furthermore, specific lipids were identified as essential for the proper gating activity, most notably the phosphoinositides (PIP
