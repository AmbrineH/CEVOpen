<p class="p">The reason why it took a long time to accept the idea of integral membrane proteins is that it was always a challenge to rationalize how polypeptide chains, which have polar backbones and charged side chains, could possibly be stable inside hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. We now know that this occurs because of the formation of secondary structural elements, α-helices and β-strands, that provide a hydrogen-bonding network that reduces the electrostatic penalty (

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Popot and Engelman, 1990</xref>). In stage 1, the polypeptide chain folds into a stable α-helix in the lipid bilayer, which can occur spontaneously for a small set of hydrophobic peptides (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wimley and White, 2000</xref>). In cells, this occurs during translation where the ribosome is targeted to the translocon channel, which facilitates the formation of α-helical structure and partitioning of nonpolar helices into the membrane (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White and Wimley, 1999</xref>). In stage 2, the helices undergo equilibrium sampling of their different configurations to find the thermodynamically favorable and biologically relevant folded state (

In 1987, Jean-Luc Popot and Donald Engelman showed that proteolytic fragments of bacteriorhodopsin that were reconstituted into separate membranes could reassemble into a folded, retinal-bound structure when the membranes were fused together. This provided strong evidence that the folded state of a membrane protein is a thermodynamically stable state in the membrane (
