<p class="p">Another approach to this problem is to study the reversible binding of protein segments, such as individual α-helices or protein subunits during oligomerization. This strategy simplifies the reaction so that equilibrium studies are tractable, and the reaction reports on the same physical driving forces. The major problem that arises when studying binding of membrane proteins in membranes is the limited protein signal. Because of this, studies are often restricted to high densities where hundreds of copies of protein are present within each liposome, which can saturate the reaction that is being studied. To get around this, strong affinity complexes have been studied at equilibrium with external biasing methods, such as redox driven disulfide exchange (

Alternatively, single-molecule microscopy methods can be used to study high-affinity binding reactions at dilute conditions. Using single-molecule photobleaching analysis, it was possible to measure the equilibrium dimerization reaction of the CLC Cl

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). It should be noted that single-molecule methods are particularly well-suited for studying membrane protein assembly and dynamics. These experiments require minimal amounts of protein, and the studies are conducted away from high-density conditions where membrane proteins can be prone to nonspecific aggregation reactions. Single-molecule force microscopy approaches (atomic force microscopy and optical and magnetic tweezers) offer new ways of studying multihelix assembly of membrane proteins (
