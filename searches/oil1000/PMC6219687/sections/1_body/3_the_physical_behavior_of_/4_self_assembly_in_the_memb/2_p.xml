<p class="p">Beyond this, we have a limited understanding of what drives membrane proteins to assemble inside of the lipid bilayer. We know that membrane proteins are generally nonpolar to exist in the hydrophobic membrane. Yet, during assembly, we do not know why these greasy protein surfaces choose to form stable interactions with other greasy protein surfaces instead of the similarly greasy lipid solvent. To obtain a thermodynamic understanding, equilibrium studies of the second stage of membrane protein folding are required, but there are many technical challenges that arise. For soluble proteins, the study of reversible protein folding was made possible by using denaturants such as chemicals, temperature, or pH. The same approach is problematic for the study of membrane proteins in membranes. For example, a denaturing detergent like SDS would as much dissolve the membrane, thus changing the properties of the solvent environment. However, this is not impossible. Karen Fleming showed that using guanidine hydrochloride as a denaturant enabled the study of reversible folding of the OmpLA β-barrel protein from the aqueous state into POPC lipid bilayers for free energy measurements (
