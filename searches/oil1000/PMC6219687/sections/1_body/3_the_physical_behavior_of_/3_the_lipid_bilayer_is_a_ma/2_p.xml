<p class="p">However, in many cases, it is not just the membrane structure that changes but the protein structure as well. The solution to hydrophobic mismatch comes via coupled structural changes of both the protein and the lipid bilayer, which together find the free energy minimum of the system as a whole. This relationship between membrane deformation and protein conformations has been described in the mattress model by 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mouritsen and Bloom (1984)</xref>. Here, the membrane is modeled as an elastic mattress made of springs, with its own equilibrium free energy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6 A</xref>). A protein reaction, such as a conformational change or oligomerization, will depend on the intrinsic free energy of the protein as well as the external bias offered by the membrane. If a state of the protein sufficiently perturbs the membrane, then this could drive the conformational change or association of proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Gramicidin provides an excellent example of how the membrane couples to the conformational stability of membrane proteins. Through a combination of fluorescence and conductance measurements (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Veatch and Stryer, 1977</xref>) and NMR studies (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Urry et al., 1983</xref>), it was determined that Gramicidin channel activity arises from the dimerization of two pores, one in each leaflet to form a continuous channel across the membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6 A</xref>). However, the structure of the Gramicidin dimer is shorter than the full length of the membrane, and so dimer formation imposes hydrophobic mismatch on the surrounding lipid bilayer. With this, it was discovered that changing the lipid bilayer thickness, by changing acyl chain length, could shift the equilibrium of channel openings and closures (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>). Note that this sensitivity to hydrophobic mismatch is not true of all membrane proteins. In contrast, aggregation of bacteriorhodopsin was found to be generally insensitive to the lipid chain length except at bilayer thickness extremes (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lewis and Engelman, 1983</xref>). In other cases, other properties such as membrane strain may account for long-range conformational organization of membrane proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that ATP synthase dimers organize into rows without direct protein contacts, but because of a minimization of membrane curvature deformations, and this may support the formation of cristae in mitochondria (
