<p class="p">In three dimensions, the lipid bilayer acts as an elastic material, with bulk properties of compressibility, elasticity, curvature, and lateral pressure profiles (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>). These properties are defined by the molecular interactions of the acyl chains and interactions with the head groups. At the same time, cellular membranes contain a high density of membrane proteins, and these act as inclusions or defects, shifting the energetics of the natural lipid bilayer. For instance, a membrane protein may be mainly hydrophobic but introduce a polar surface to the membraneâ€™s nonpolar core. Lipid molecules are flexible and compressible, and so they can rearrange to optimize the solvation structure around any protein embedded within the membrane and minimize the free energy of the system. As a result, membranes change their shape to minimize hydrophobic mismatch around proteins, but this is often associated with an energetic penalty. Hydrophobic matching of the membrane has been observed in molecular dynamics computer simulations, both coarse-grained models that allow for the substantial sampling and some all-atom models (
