<p class="p">In this Milestones article, I review some of the key experiments that led to our current understanding of the cell membrane as a lipid bilayer that solvates proteins that span the membrane. It is a daunting task to go over this enormous body of work, and so this article presents a mere sampling of the research. For those desiring a deeper review of the history, I refer you to several other resources (

Next, I highlight the path to identifying a new class of membrane proteins that reside and function within hydrophobic lipid bilayers. Finally, I discuss current research of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers, highlighting the key challenges and complexities of studying proteins in a solvent environment that is self-assembling and has its own structural properties and increased chemical complexity. The past 100 years take us from a time when we did not know the lipid bilayer and integral membrane proteins existed to the present, where the structure of membrane proteins, even in the context of the cell membrane, is becoming more and more accessible. Throughout this time, the
