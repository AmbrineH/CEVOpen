<p class="p">Organisms live and thrive in a wide range of chemical environments with varying physical conditions. Life has been found at freezing temperatures, thermal vents, extreme acidic and alkaline conditions, and a wide range of salt concentrations. This diversity is possible because the cellular membrane presents a robust barrier to the external world, setting the stage for exquisite control of the cellâ€™s internal solutions. First and foremost, the membrane must be a barrier to salts, protons, and charged molecules to maintain proper biochemistry. In addition, if the membrane is capable of separating charge, like a low dielectric insulator, then it can also store electrical as well as chemical potential energy to fuel future biological work. Finally, the membrane must be capable of changing its shape to accommodate the increasingly complex requirements of biology, and therefore, it must be fluid in nature. It is remarkable that all of the physical properties listed above are satisfied by a two-molecule-thick layer of self-assembled oil and even more amazing how proteins have evolved to function in this dramatically different physical environment. The lipid bilayer provides a robust solution for a physiological barrier, and its simplicity is a foundation for the origins of life and evolutionary diversity (
