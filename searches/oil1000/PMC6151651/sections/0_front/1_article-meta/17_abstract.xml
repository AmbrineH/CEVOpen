 <p class="p">The composition of the essential oil (EO) of 
  <italic class="italic">Thapsia villosa</italic> (Apiaceae), isolated by hydrodistillation from the plant’s aerial parts, was analysed by GC and GC-MS. Antifungal activity of the EO and its main components, limonene (57.5%) and methyleugenol (35.9%), were evaluated against clinically relevant yeasts (
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
  <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Malassezia furfur</italic>) and moulds (
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. and dermatophytes). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured according to the broth macrodilution protocols by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The EO, limonene and methyleugenol displayed low MIC and MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration) values against 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
  <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, dermatophytes, and 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. Regarding 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, an inhibition of yeast–mycelium transition was demonstrated at sub-inhibitory concentrations of the EO (MIC/128; 0.01 μL/mL) and their major compounds in 
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>. Fluconazole does not show this activity, and the combination with low concentrations of EO could associate a supplementary target for the antifungal activity. The association of fluconazole with 
  <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> oil does not show antagonism, but the combination limonene/fluconazole displays synergism. The fungistatic and fungicidal activities revealed by 
  <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> EO and its main compounds, associated with their low haemolytic activity, confirm their potential antimicrobial interest against fungal species often associated with human mycoses.
