<p class="p">If humans struggle to preserve their life fighting infections, microorganisms also need to keep their life by avoiding the effect of antifungal drugs used in the mycoses treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant strains to existing antifungal drugs is inevitable; we will need new antifungal drugs for treatment of infections caused by fungi with intrinsic or developed resistance to current antifungals. In addition to the resistance, other problems arise, such as a restricted number of effective antifungal compounds, and, for most of them, the fungistatic mechanism of action, high toxicity, many drug interactions, and insufficient bioavailability [

Thus, effective treatments and management strategies are essential, the development of new antifungal drugs being a high priority in the healthcare field.
