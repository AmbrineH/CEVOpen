<p class="p">As part of our ongoing studies on the valorization of wild Apiaceae species, the aims of this study were evaluating the phytochemical constituents present in essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> by GC and GC-MS, and determination of the antifungal activity of the essential oil and its main constituents (limonene and methyleugenol). Minimum inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations (MIC and MFC) were evaluated against fungal human pathogenic species (including clinical and ATCC isolates of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptoccocus neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia furfur</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., and several dermatophytes). The in vitro activity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic>, limonene, and methyleugenol, in combination with fluconazole, was also investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the essential oil and its main constituents on the germ tube development in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was also studied. Evaluation of cytotoxic activity was considered using a haemolytic activity assay.
