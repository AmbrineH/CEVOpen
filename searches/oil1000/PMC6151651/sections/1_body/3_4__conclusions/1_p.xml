<p class="p">These results revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">Thapsia villosa</italic> yielded a great amount of oil that is a possible source of bioactive compounds with valuable antifungal activity. The wide-spectrum antifungal activity displayed by the 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> EO, and two of its main components, limonene and methyleugenol, with their associated fungicidal mechanism and low cytotoxic activity, confirms its potential as an antifungal agent against fungal species implicated in human mycoses, particularly candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and dermatophytosis. Their association with commercial antifungal compounds, such as fluconazole used in candidiasis treatment, although not showing a synergistic effect, could bring benefits based on the striking effect on germ tube formation. Further investigation will be necessary for the development of clinically useful therapeutics for clinical use in the treatment of superficial and mucosal mycoses, namely, dermatophytosis and mucocutaneous candidiasis.
