<p class="p">Analytical GC was carried out in a Hewlett-Packard 6890 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a HP GC ChemStation Rev. A.05.04 data handling system, equipped with a single injector and two flame ionization detectors (FID). A graphpak divider was used for simultaneous sampling to two Supelco fused silica capillary columns: SPB-1 (polydimethylsiloxane 30 m × 0.20 mm, film thickness 0.20 μm), and SupelcoWax-10 (SW10) (polyethylene glycol 30 m × 0.20 mm, film thickness 0.20 μm). The oven temperature was programmed at 70–220 °C (3 °C/min), 220 °C (15 min); injector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium, adjusted to a linear velocity of 30 m/s; splitting ratio 1:40; detectors temperature: 250 °C.</p>
