<p class="p">The effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> EO, limonene, and methyleugenol on the yeast–mycelium transition, was evaluated in a suspension of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain ATCC 10231, prepared in NYP medium (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (Sigma-Aldrich; 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mol/L), yeast nitrogen base (Difco-Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France; 3.35 g/L), proline (Fluka-Sigma-Aldrich; 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mol/L), and NaCl (4.5 g/L), at pH 6.7 ± 0.1 [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The cell suspension, prepared from overnight cultures in SDA, was adjusted to a yeast density of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL, and 990 μL volumes were distributed into glass test tubes. Dilutions of the EO, limonene, and methyleugenol, were added into the cell suspension tubes, in 10 μL volumes, to achieve appropriate MIC and sub-inhibitory concentrations. After incubation, without agitation at 37 °C for 3 h, the treated and untreated (positive control) yeast cells were observed under light microscope, and the percentage of germinating cells was determined. The germ tube formation was considered positive when the germinating tube had higher, or the same, blastospore diameter. The results show the average ± standard deviation (SD) of a minimum of three independent experiments.
