<p class="p">Despite its limitations, the checkerboard method remains the most popular approach for evaluating drug interactions between antifungals [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The MICs for different drugs, alone and in combination, were determined using the checkerboard micromethod in a 96 well plate. This assay was performed with 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 90018, by testing the synergism of the combination of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic>, limonene and methyleugenol with the antifungal fluconazole. The plates were incubated at 35 °C and the results of the MIC were read after 24 h. The results were obtained from tests repeated at least 3 times on different days. The substance combinations were analysed by calculating the FICI. It was proposed that a FICI &lt;0.5 should be considered “synergism”, a FICI &gt; 4 should be considered “antagonism” and a FICI between 0.5 and 4 should be considered “without interaction” [
