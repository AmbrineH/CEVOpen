<p class="p">Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the EO and its main components were determined by broth macrodilution methods based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference documents M27-A3, S3 [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], and M38-A2 [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], for yeasts and filamentous fungi, respectively, with some adaptations. Concisely, fungal organism cell suspensions from SDA cultures were prepared in RPMI-1640 medium. Considering 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic>, olive oil was added to the RPMI medium. Two-fold serial dilutions of the EO and its main pure constituents (limonene and methyleugenol), ranging from 0.02 to 20 μL/mL, were prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with a maximum concentration of 1% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Mixed systems were incubated in humid atmosphere, without agitation, at 35 °C for 48 h for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., 72 h for 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic>, and at 25 °C for seven days for dermatophytes. MIC was considered the lowest concentration resulting in 100% growth inhibition. Moreover, fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich; 0.25 to 128 mg/L), for yeasts and dermatophytes, or amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich; 0.016 to 16 mg/L), for 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic>, were used as standard agents. MICs of fluconazole and amphotericin B against 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6258, quality control strain, were also performed and the results were within the CLSI proposed limits. Growth and sterility controls were performed in RPMI 1640 medium with or without 1% DMSO. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined after incubation time (48 h for yeasts and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. and seven days for dermatophytes), by removing 20 μL from all tubes deprived of visible growth to SDA plates and SDA with olive oil for 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic>. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for dermatophytes and at 35 °C for the other fungi. The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration showing a total absence of growth on SDA plates, resulting from the subculture of MIC plates. All the experiments were repeated at least three times, on independent assays. MIC was considered the concentration value that has been repeated at least three times and results ranging from two concentrations were shown as an interval of values.
