<p class="p">On the other hand, dermatological infections have also increased in the last decades, becoming important causes of morbidity. Dermatophytoses remains a problem worldwide in healthy and immunocompromised patients. Considering the increasing impact of these infections, the emerging multidrug resistance and the toxicity of available antifungal drugs, attention has been concentrated on natural products with antifungal properties, motivating the exploration for therapeutic alternatives to conventional antifungals azoles, allylamines, and morpholinic derivatives [

In this study, dermatophytes showed the highest susceptibility, which can be justified by the activity observed for their two major components. Fungicidal activity is a major aspect in fungal infection treatments, once fungistatic activity can turn these infections that are refractory to therapy, resulting in important implications in health care costs, especially in poor developing countries. Also,

 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> species to natural antifungal agents, some studies have shown that some EOs have anti-

 <italic class="italic">Thapsia villosa</italic> showed an anti-
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia</italic> activity with an MIC value of 2.5 μL/mL, higher than for dermatophytes. However, considering the fungicidal activity at the same concentration, as well the known inhibitory effect in the yeast–mycelium transition, and also a mechanism of virulence in the commensal
