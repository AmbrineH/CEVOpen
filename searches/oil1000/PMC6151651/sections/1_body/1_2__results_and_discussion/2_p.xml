<p class="p">High amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (57.4% and 58.6%) and phenylpropanoids (36.3% and 37.0%) characterised both samples. Limonene (56% and 57.5%) and methyleugenol (35% and 35.9%) were the main components identified in the two samples. Oxygen containing monoterpenes only attain 0.6% and sesquiterpenes 0.2% of the oils. Only two sesquiterpene hydrocarbons have been identified as minor components (

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], according to the accumulation of monoterpenes (geranyl acetate and limonene) and/or phenylpropanoids (methyleugenol and elemicin). Our samples are included in the chemotype limonene/methyleugenol. High amounts of phenylpropanoids (eugenol methyl ether) were also identified in the oil of
