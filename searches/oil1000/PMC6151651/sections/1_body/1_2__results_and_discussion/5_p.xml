<p class="p">Furthermore, additionally to the fungistatic or fungicidal activity, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> showed an important inhibitory effect on germ tube development, an essential virulence factor in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The EO produced almost complete inhibition (84.3%) of filamentation in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 at concentrations as low as MIC/128 (0.01 μL/mL), and complete inhibition (100%) at MIC/32 (0.04 μL/mL), in comparison to untreated control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01595-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The influence of the 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> EO on yeast–mycelium transition, at concentrations below the MIC (MIC/128), agreed with previous results for some EOs [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The methyleugenol and limonene were also analysed, and the activity of the EO in germ tube formation is apparently due to the involvement of the main compounds. Fluconazole did not show important inhibitory effect on germ tube formation at four times the MIC (4 μg/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC) (data not shown). The marked difference between MICs and filamentation-inhibiting concentrations is particularly relevant considering that the inhibition of the dimorphic transition in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> has been proposed to be enough to treat candidiasis [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Low concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> can affect this important mechanism of virulence for the most common agent of mucocutaneous infections. Fluconazole does not show this activity, and the combination with low concentrations of EO could associate a supplementary target for the antifungal activity. The inhibition of morphogenesis provides further validation to the potential of the EO for use alone or in combination with an antifungal compound, in therapy of candidiasis by fluconazole resistant or susceptible strains.
