<p class="p">Since EOs are complex natural mixtures of numerous constituents at quite different concentrations, and with possible differences in stereochemical configuration, it is difficult to attribute the antifungal activity to a specific component. Usually, the main compounds are those most responsible for the antifungal activity of the EO. However, some studies show that minor constituents may have an important role in the biological activity of the volatile oil [
