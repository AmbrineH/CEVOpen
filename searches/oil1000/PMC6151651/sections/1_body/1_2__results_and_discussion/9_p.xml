<p class="p">Together, the fungicidal activity displayed by 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> EO, limonene, and methyleugenol, the activity against fluconazole susceptible and resistant strains, the activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., and the strong ability to inhibit the germ tube formation by 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, associated with low cytotoxic activity, confirms its potential as an antifungal agent against varied human mycoses, particularly candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and dermatophytosis. Also, the ability of EO to act on multiple cellular targets can be an advantage to avoid resistance, being active against azole resistant strains.
