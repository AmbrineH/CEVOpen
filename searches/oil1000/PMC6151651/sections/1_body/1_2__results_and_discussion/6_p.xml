<p class="p">In synergistic assays, the EO and its major compounds (limonene and methyleugenol) were tested in combination with the antifungal, fluconazole, to assess whether there was a synergistic effect between these compounds. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values were different according to the combination. For 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa/</italic>fluconazole and methyleugenol/fluconazole, the combination was evaluated as without interaction, showing FICI values of 3 and 0.625, respectively. However, for the combination limonene/fluconazole, the FICI value was 0.375, indicating a situation of synergism. No antagonistic effect was observed in the combination experiments with fluconazole for the tested strain. However, other reports have demonstrated a synergy or indifference between methyleugenol and fluconazole against various clinical isolates of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. So, the association of fluconazole with 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic> does not show antagonism, and at the same time, provides an additional target of action, by inhibition of yeastâ€“mycelium transition. With the association, we can have (i) a fungistatic activity for fluconazole; (ii) a fungicidal activity for the essential oil at MIC concentrations; (iii) at concentrations below the MIC, a striking effect on one of the main mechanisms of pathogenicity for the most common agent of candidiasis,
