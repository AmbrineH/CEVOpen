 <italic class="italic">Thapsia villosa</italic> essential oil (EO) (sample B) exhibited a broad-spectrum of antifungal activity (animal and human pathogenic species, causing superficial or systemic mycosis): 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., and dermatophytes (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01595-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the EO were determined for the different 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species and strains, and the values ranged from 0.64 to 1.25 μL/mL. No differences of behaviour were observed for fluconazole susceptible and resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains. However, 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> showed higher susceptibility to the EO, with a MIC of 0.16 μL/mL. Nevertheless, 
 <italic class="italic">M. furfur</italic> showed the highest MIC value, 2.5 μL/mL. Regarding filamentous fungi, the EO showed a similar activity with a MIC of 0.64 to 1.25 μL/mL for dermatophytes and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> species. In addition, the EO revealed a fungicidal effect against almost all the tested fungi, with MFC values equal to, or just one log2 dilution above, the MICs. The exceptions are 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>, which showed an MFC at least three times above the MIC. Concerning the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">T. villosa</italic>, limonene and methyleugenol displayed fungicidal activity against yeasts and dermatophytes, with the MICs and MFCs ranging from 0.08 to 0.64 μL/mL. As well as for the EO, the MFCs were higher for 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> for methyleugenol. Regarding methyleugenol, our results are in agreement with other previous studies that reported the fungicidal activity of this phenylpropanoid against several fungal species [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The phenylpropanoid compounds, such as eugenol and methyleugenol, are usually highly active against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including fungi. It has been shown that they compromise the structural and functional integrity of cytoplasmic membranes, including sterol biosynthesis [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. On the other hand, limonene shows the highest activity, being fungicidal for all the species tested, including 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. Our fungicidal activity results are in agreement with the results of fungicidal activity obtained by Chee et al. for 
 <italic class="italic">T. rubrum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Also, (+)-limonene showed bactericidal effect against different bacteria [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Limonene belongs to the cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon family, being extensively used in different areas and an excellent solvent of cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The hydrophobicity of limonene seems to facilitate dissolution of the lipids which are accumulated in the microbial plasma membrane, and thus, cause a loss of membrane integrity [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-22-01595" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The microbial cell envelope seems to be an important target for the methyleugenol and (+)-limonene components.
