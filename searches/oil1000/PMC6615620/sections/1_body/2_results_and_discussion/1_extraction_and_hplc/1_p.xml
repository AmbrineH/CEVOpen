 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and the extraction was performed using xylene and methanol as solvents. The xylene extraction was used to get rid of the ballast substances (e. g. chlorophylls) and only methanolic extracts were further analyzed. The High Performance Liquid Chromatography was performed using the gradient elution with the RP-18 chromatographic column and the mobile phase consisting of methanol, water and 0.1% formic acid by 60 minutes. Selected chromatographic system was used to obtain the fingerprint chromatograms of selected lavenders with the best separation of some phenolic compounds (
