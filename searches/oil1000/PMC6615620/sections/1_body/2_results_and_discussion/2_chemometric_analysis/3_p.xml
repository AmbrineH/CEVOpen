<p class="p">The Principal Component Analysis was also performed and the results were presented as PC1 vs. PC2 graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218974.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The vectors with the appropriate number (according to 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) correspond with the studied 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> species. The close location of vectors confirms the similarity between selected samples. It is evident, that the following vectors are close to each other: vectors corresponding to samples 1 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula stoechas</italic>), 2 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula lanata</italic>), 4 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia „Rosea”</italic>), 6 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia „Afropurpurea”</italic>), 7 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>) and 5 (unknown). The vector corresponding to sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula viridis</italic>) is located far away and it confirms its dissimilarity.
