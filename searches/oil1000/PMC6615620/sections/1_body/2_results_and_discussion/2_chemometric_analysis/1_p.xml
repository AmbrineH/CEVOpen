<p class="p">The similarity between studied 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> species was performed using the chemometric methods (Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis). The similarity dendrograms of selected samples are presented in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218974.g003" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218974.g004" class="xref">4</xref>. The dendrogram based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (similarity index) values is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218974.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and six samples (except sample 3) are located close to each other (with r equal about 0.9). The highest values of r were obtained for the following pairs: 4 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia „Rosea”</italic>) and 6 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia „Afropurpurea”</italic>) with r = 0.9417; for 7 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>) and 6 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia „Afropurpurea”</italic>); and for 2 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula lanata</italic>) and 5 (unknown lavender). The sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula viridis</italic>) is most different from the others, the value of r is low (r = 0.2045).
