<p class="p">At the beginning, the solutions of gallic acid with different concentrations (c [mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>] = 2.0; 1.0; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125; 0.01) were prepared. 995 μL of FRAP reagent and 5 μL of the different concentrations of gallic acid were measured using an automatic pipette and located in test-tubes. Next, the samples were placed in dark for 8 minutes. After that, the absorbance was measured at 593 nm (
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Based on the absorbance measure obtained for gallic acid solutions (A [Au] = 2.898 ±0.001; 1.819 ±0.002; 1.207 ±0.010; 0.818 ±0.002; 0.577 ±0.010; 0.45 ±0.035; respectively) the calibration curve was created with the following equation:
