<p class="p">In the same conditions the absorbance values of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> extracts were measured and the results were shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. In the case of sample 3 two-fold dilution was made and the absorbance value presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> is after the dilution. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that the highest value of absorbance (and the highest concentration value– 5.870 mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) is for the sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viridis</italic>) and the lowest concentration value was obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanata</italic> (0.438 mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The concentrations of the other samples are relatively high and their values are between 0.726 and 1.409 mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>.
