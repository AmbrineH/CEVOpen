<p class="p">The absorbance measure was performed with 20 μL of different concentrations (c [mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>] = 2.0; 1.0; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125; 0.01) of gallic acid solutions and 1.5 μL of DPPH solution. The test-tubes were stored in dark place for 30 minutes. The solution of the radical is dark purple. The ability to scavening free radicals increases with the disappearance of this color, At the beginning the absorbance measure was performed for gallic acid and the calibration curve is as follows:
