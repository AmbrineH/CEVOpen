<p class="p">Next, the absorbance measure for the analyzed 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> extracts was performer in the same conditions as gallic acid. The absorbance measure values, the concentration and % inhibition of studied extracts were presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viridis</italic>) was two-fold diluted and the results presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> are after dilution. Based on the results it can be concluded that all samples show the antioxidant activity, the highest inhibition % was obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viridis</italic> (99.47%) and the lowest for 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> (91.51%). The % inhibition of the other samples are between 92.09â€“95.18%.
