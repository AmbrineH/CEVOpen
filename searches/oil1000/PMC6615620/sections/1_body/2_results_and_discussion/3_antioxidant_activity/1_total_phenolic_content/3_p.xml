<p class="p">All analyzed lavender methanolic extracts show the antioxidant activity measured and calculated using the spectrophotometric F-C method. The total phenolic content was within the range from 1.380–3.274 mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The highest value of absorbance measured (the highest of phenolics content) was obtained for sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula viridis</italic>) and the lowest (the lowest of phenolics content) for sample 2 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula lanata</italic>). The absorbance values of the others samples (1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and X) are similar and are between 0.490 and 0.692.
