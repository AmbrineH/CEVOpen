<p class="p">The Total Phenolic Content analysis was performed using the spectrophotometric method with the Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) reagent. Gallic acid was used as standard in concentrations (c [mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>] = 2.0; 1.0; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125; 0.01). 0.01 mL of different concentration of gallic acid solution, 0.99 mL of distilled water and 0.1 mL of F-C reagent were titrated to the tubes and after 5 minutes 1 mL of sodium carbonate (the concentration 75 g∙L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and 0.4 mL of distilled water were added. Next, the tubes were located in the dark place for two hours. After that, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm for all concentrations of gallic acid. Based on the absorbance measure obtained for gallic acid solutions (A [Au] = 0.691 ±0.001; 0.373 ±0.002; 0.205 ±0.001; 0.105 ±0.001; 0.072 ±0.013, 0.016 ±0.001; respectively) the calibration curve was created with the following equation:
