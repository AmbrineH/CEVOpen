The voucher specimen was also from this Botanical Garden. Dried (in the air) plant materials were pulverized in the hand mill. Next, the obtained samples were weighted (about 5 g, according to 
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), located in the paper cases and placed in 250 mL flat bottom flask. Next, the 150 mL of the xylene (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was added and the flasks were located in the ultrasonic bath (Bandelin RK 100 H,Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) under reflux for 4 hours. The obtained xylene extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure using the vacuum evaporator (Heidolph, Schwabach; Laboxact, KNF, Freiburg im Breisgau; Germany). The dried (at room temperature) xylene extracts were dissolved in 25 mL graduated flasks in the xylene. Next, the samples (dried paper cases) were placed in the 250 mL flat bottom flask, and the 250 mL of methanol was added and located in ultrasonic bath under reflux for the 4 hours. The methanolic extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure using the vacuum evaporator. After that, the dried methanolic extracts were dissolved in methanol in 25 mL graduated flasks. Xylene and methanolic extracts were stored in a refrigerator (4°C).
