<p class="p">The HPLC gradient elution analysis was performed on Merck-Hitachi LaChrom Elite System (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with diode array detector L-2455, thermostat L-2300, pump L-2130 and autosampler L-2200 with the Kinetex RP18 (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) chromatographic column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) as stationary phase. The mobile phase was consisted of methanol-water-0.1% formic acid (gradient 5–100% (v/v) of methanol) at 30 °C and the run time was 60 min. The analysis was performed with the detection wavelength 280 nm, the sample injection volume was 10 μL and the flow rate was set to 1.0 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Methanol Chromasolv for HPLC was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and formic acid from Polish Reagents (Polish Reagents, Gliwice, Poland); double-distilled water was used.
