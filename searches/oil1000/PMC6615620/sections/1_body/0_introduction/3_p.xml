<p class="p">The chemical composition of the lavender extracts or essential oils were studied using the HPLC analysis. The phenolic composition of the infusion or decoction of sea lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae algarvense</italic>) was analyzed to confirm the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The impact of different storage conditions on the quality of lavender essential oils was also studied using, among others, this method [

 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> species (among others 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula officinalis</italic>) were constructed using a novel and validated ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method coupled with DAD diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in negative mode of electrospray ionization [
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Phytochemical analysis of hydromethanolic 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> extracts (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">stoechas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dentate</italic>) was performed using Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector- Quadrupole-time-offlight-Mass Spectrometry (RP–HPLC–DAD–QTOF–MS) for the evaluation of their qualitative and quantitative differences [

 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Similarly, some phenolics (phenolic acids) of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill. (LA) extract were analyzed by LC-MS to confirm its biological activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> MILL. was also examined using the HPLC [
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] or HPLC-DAD-MS [
 <xref rid="pone.0218974.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
