<p class="p">The preliminary evaluation of the antioxidant activity of selected 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandulae</italic> species based on the total phenolic content, FRAP and DPPH was performed. In all examined methanolic extracts the presence of phenolics and the ability to scavenging free radicals was observed. The total phenolic content was within the range from 0.10–1.36 mg∙cm
 <sup class="sup">-3</sup> and the highest value of absorbance was obtained for sample 3 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula viridis</italic>) and the lowest for sample 7 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>) and 2 (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula lanata</italic>).
