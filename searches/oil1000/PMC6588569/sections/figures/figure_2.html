 <p> Rheological behavior of thermogelling nanoemulsion-based gel. The canonical system contains 20% isopropyl myristate as the oil phase, 20% surfactant as an emulsifier (a mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 with HLB = 13), 5% PEG 400, 4.7% Pluronic (F127/F68: 6/1 g/g), and 50.3% DI water. All concentrations are in mass percentage. The droplet volume fraction, ϕ, is 0.24, and the hydrodynamic oil droplet diameter is 53 nm. a Evolution of the dynamic moduli in a small amplitude oscillatory shear temperature ramp experiment from 10 °C to 50 °C with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min. The dashed line indicates where G′ and G″ intersect. b Linear viscoelastic spectra at different temperatures. c Optical images of inverted glass vials containing sample below (20 °C) and above (50 °C) the gelation temperature </p>
