 <p> Effect of cosurfactant PEG 400 concentration on rheological properties and gelation temperature T gel. Shear moduli as a function of temperature and frequency at 50 °C. Nanoemulsion droplet size (hydrodynamic diameter of 53 nm) and volume fraction ( ϕ = 0.24) are kept constant for all formulations. The only difference in the chemical composition of the samples is the amount of added cosurfactant (PEG 400). The top panels a– c show the evolution of the dynamic moduli in a small amplitude oscillatory shear temperature ramp experiment and bottom panels d– f show frequency sweep test at 50 °C for the same systems. The pink lines with arrows in a– c mark the intersection of G′ and G and indicate the gel point </p>
