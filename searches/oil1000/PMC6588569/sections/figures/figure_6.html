 <p> Rheological characterization of the thermogelling nanoemulsion below (20 °C) and above (50 °C) the gel point. a Steady shear rheology at 20 °C. b Viscoelastic moduli in a temperature jump from sol state (20 °C) to gel state (50 °C); ( γ 0 = 0.1% and frequency of 20 rad/s). c Optical image of mushroom-shaped gel particles formed by dripping a room temperature thermogelling nanoemulsion (using a 15-gauge needle) into a hot water bath at 50 °C. Large amplitude oscillatory shear experiment (frequency of 20 rad/s) plotted vs. d strain amplitude, and e shear stress. The dashed red line with an arrow in panel e indicates the yield stress. f Change in the moduli indicating breaking and recovery of the structure under applied stresses of 500 Pa and 5 Pa, respectively ( γ 0 = 0.1% and frequency of 20 rad/s). g Cyclic flow sweep experiment from low to high shear rate (up) and from high to low shear rate (down) at 50 °C. Dash lines in a and g are power-law fits to the data </p>
