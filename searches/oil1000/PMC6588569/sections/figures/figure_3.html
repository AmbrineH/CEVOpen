 <p> Micro-DSC signals after baseline subtraction. DSC traces of, a aqueous solutions of F127/F68 (6/1â€‰g/g) at different copolymer concentrations, b of Pluronic solution, the washed nanoemulsion (oil 0.4% wt.), and the subnatant solution (continuous phase) with a similar Pluronic concentration of 1.2%. Nanoemulsion suspensions were centrifuged to filter oil droplets (supernatant) from aqueous phase (subnatant) before adding Pluronic solution. The dashed line in b marks the endothermic peak for the 1.2% Pluronic solution </p>
