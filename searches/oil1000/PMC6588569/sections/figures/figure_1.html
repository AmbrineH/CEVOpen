 <p> Schematic diagram of the nanoemulsion system and hypothesized gelation mechanism. a Formation of the oil-in-water nanoemulsion prepared using a low energy process containing oil, surfactant (Tween 80 and Span 80, HLB = 13) and PEG 400 as a cosurfactant. b Addition of mixed Pluronic solution into the nanoemulsion suspension to impart thermoresponsive behavior. Final concentration of Pluronic is 4.7% wt. c Gel formation at 50 °C through adsorbing midblock of Pluronic onto the droplet interface and mixed micelles formation between Pluronic and excess emulsifiers in the aqueous solution </p>
