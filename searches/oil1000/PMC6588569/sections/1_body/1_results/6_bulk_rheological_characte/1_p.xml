<p id="Par14" class="p">For a thermogelling material to be used as a topical formulation, certain rheological properties are desirable both below and above the gelation temperature. In this section we discuss these rheological properties of our canonical thermogelling nanoemulsion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). At ambient temperature, flow behavior similar to Newtonian fluids was observed at shear rates lower than 1 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; that is, shear stress linearly increases against shear rate and corresponding viscosity is independent of shear rate (a plateau in the viscosity at low shear rates) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). However, at higher shear rates, the material becomes shear-thinning with a power-law dependence on shear rate,

 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = −0.6. The shear-thinning properties at ambient temperature would allow for easy injection of the material. After the material is deposited on a target surface at an elevated temperature, it should undergo a rapid phase transition in order to preserve the structure. To test the material response, we performed qualitative and quantitative temperature-jump experiments. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref> displays shear moduli in a temperature jump test from 20 to 50 °C (flow behavior as a function of temperature is also presented in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). Intriguingly, the thermogelling nanoemulsion responds very quickly to a temperature jump and becomes a gel almost instantaneously. In order to demonstrate qualitatively the gelation rate, the room temperature thermogelling nanoemulsion was dripped through a flat-tip 15-gauge needle into a hot water bath held at 50 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref> and Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). For better observation of the process, the oil phase was also loaded with the Nile red (0.05 mg in 1 mL isopropyl myristate). The drops of the initially liquid-like nanoemulsion suspension become a gel as they enter the hot water and form mushroom-like objects. These immersed gel objects retain their shape and persist for several minutes before eventually dissolving and dispersing into the water. This observed behavior could prove useful when considering these materials for applications involving injected drug delivery depots, 3D printing and topical skin formulations.
