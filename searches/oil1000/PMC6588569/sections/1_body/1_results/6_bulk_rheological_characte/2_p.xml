The storage and loss moduli are independent of strain below a strain amplitude of 2%, indicating a linear viscoelastic regime. At higher applied strain,

 </sup>. The transition from linear to nonlinear viscoelastic regimes can also be monitored in a stress-strain curve. Shear stress linearly increases as a function of strain amplitude up to a stress of 110 Pa, beyond which point stress starts to deviate from linearity. In order to better estimate the yield stress, the critical point above which the structured thermogelling nanoemulsion is disrupted and starts to flow, the shear moduli were plotted as a function of stress (Fig.
