<p id="Par16" class="p">To test recovery of the elasticity after yielding, low to high oscillatory shear stress was repeatedly applied. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6f</xref> displays the moduli as a function of time after two cycles of low (5 Pa for 300 s, below the yield stress) to high (500 Pa for 120 s, above the yield stress) oscillatory stress amplitudes. The application of a shear stress above the material yield stress resulted in moduli indicative of liquid-like behavior (

Full recovery of internal structure in the thermogelling nanoemulsion occurs nearly instantly (in less than 10 seconds). In addition, after two cycles of low to high oscillatory stress, the material returned to its initial value of elastic modulus. In order to further investigate the time-dependent rheological properties of our gel, the thixotropic features (breakdown and buildup of the internal structure) were monitored. An established protocol for characterizing the thixotropic behavior was applied in which the shear viscosity and stress is monitored under steady flow cycle of progressively increasing and decreasing shear rate (Fig.

These results also confirm that the full recovery occurs nearly instantaneously after the material is disrupted (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6f</xref>) to prevent the material from flowing or dripping which is essential in topical formulations.
