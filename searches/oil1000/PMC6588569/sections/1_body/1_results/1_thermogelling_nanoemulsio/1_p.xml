<p id="Par6" class="p">Here we report a thermogelling nanoemulsion platform by the synergistic interplay between low concentrations of amphiphilic triblock copolymers (4.7% wt.) acting as gelling agents and oil nanodroplets. The triblock copolymers used in this work, commercially known as Pluronics or Poloxamer, (F127/F68: 6/1 g/g) are designated as biocompatible compounds by the FDA with a low degree of cytotoxicity

 </sup>. We chose isopropyl myristate (20% wt.) as a canonical oil, as it has been used both in topical formulations and in transdermal drug delivery due to its therapeutic function and its ability to solubilize large amounts of lipophilic drug molecules

 </sup>. To emulsify the disperse oil phase in the aqueous phase, a mixture of food grade nonionic surfactants, polysorbate (Tween 80) and sorbitan oleate (Span 80), was used. The oil-in-water nanoemulsions were produced using the low-energy phase inversion composition method, also known as emulsion phase inversion (Fig.

 </sup>. This process involves the addition of water into a stirred dispersed phase (oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant) at room temperature. The optimal surfactant HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) was considered to minimize the droplet size (Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2a</xref>), which is a signature of metastable suspensions with kinetically stable droplets. In contrast to energy-intensive emulsification processes, such as high pressure homogenization and ultrasonication, the low-energy method employed here only requires simple mixing using a magnetic stirrer. This synthesis method also offers the feasibility of large-scale production of the formulation and batches up to 0.5 kg have been produced. After nanoemulsion preparation (with droplet size of 53 nm, Polydispersity index, PDI, of 0.12), a Pluronic solution was dispersed into the suspension to render it thermally responsive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). A mixture of Pluronic copolymers (F127/F68: 6/1 g/g) with a final concentration of 4.7% wt. was used to tune the gelation temperature. The formed thermogelling nanoemulsion system also offers a long shelf-life and remained stable for a period of at least one year (Supplementary Fig.
