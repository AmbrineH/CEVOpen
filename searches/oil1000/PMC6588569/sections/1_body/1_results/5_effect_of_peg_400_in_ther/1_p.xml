<p id="Par13" class="p">Rheological behavior of our thermogelling nanoemulsion can be modulated by other factors in addition to droplet size. To test the effects of the cosurfactant PEG 400 on thermogelling behavior, we varied the concentration of PEG 400 from 5 to 10% (by mass). In order to compare with our canonical gel, these formulations were prepared in a manner such that the thermogelling nanoemulsion would have a similar oil droplet size (53 nm). The viscoelastic moduli as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. Interestingly, increasing the concentration of PEG 400 lowers the gelation temperature. For example, the gel point reduces 10 °C, when PEG 400 is doubled from 5 to 10%. In addition, both the storage and the loss modulus have higher values in the liquid state with an increase of PEG 400 concentration. However, all three systems have similar shear moduli in the gel state (50 °C). The frequency sweep data captured at the gel state also indicate a similar frequency dependence of shear moduli for these thermogelling nanoemulsions. Having higher values of viscoelastic moduli in the liquid state and lower gelation temperatures with increasing concentration of PEG 400, indicate possible hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups and ether groups among PEG 400 molecules or between PEG 400 and polyethylene groups in the Pluronics. Prior studies showed that the presence of short polyethylene glycol chains lowers the critical micellization temperature of Pluronic aqueous solutions
