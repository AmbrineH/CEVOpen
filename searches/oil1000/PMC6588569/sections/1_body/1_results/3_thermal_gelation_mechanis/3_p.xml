<p id="Par10" class="p">To corroborate our hypothesis regarding the underlying thermogelling mechanism of our system, we performed microcalorimetry measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). To find the critical micellization temperature of the Pluronic solution used here (F127/F68), micro-DSC measurements were conducted on different concentrations of the aqueous Pluronic solutions as references (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The thermograms of Pluronic solutions give rise to an endothermic peak as a result of heating

 </sup>. As temperature increases, PPO segments become dehydrated and less polar which eventually aggregate to form micelles resulting in an endothermic peak in the micro-DSC. The micellization process depends on the concentration and chain length of the copolymers. For example, peak temperature decreases from 29 to 23 °C as the Pluronic concentration increases from 1.2 to 7.8%. To evaluate the adsorption of the midblock (PPO) in the Pluronic onto hydrophobic oil interfaces during ramping temperature experiments, the thermogelling nanoemulsion was diluted to decrease the viscosity of the solution sufficiently to load the samples for micro-DSC measurements and to avoid saturating the maximum detection range of the instrument. Nanoemulsions were centrifuged (using centrifugal filters) to filter the oil droplets from the continuous phase and were separately analyzed in DSC experiments. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> displays DSC traces for the neat Pluronic solution, the subnatant solution (continuous phase), and the washed nanoemulsion (oil) with a similar Pluronic concentration. Interestingly, the endothermic transition peak broadens in the presence of oil droplets and the onset of the peak significantly shifts 13 °C to a lower temperature. As temperature increases in the presence of the oil droplets, hydrophobic segments of Pluronic copolymers (PPO groups) are adsorbed onto the oil droplets and results in an endothermic peak. This implies that Pluronic and nanoemulsion droplets interact strongly with each other. In addition, increased micelle formation occurs in the continuous phase. The endothermic transition peak (red curve in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) was centered at 29 °C, similar to the neat Pluronic solution; however, the onset of the endothermic peak shifted 5 °C to a lower temperature. This early onset is likely due to the mixed micelle formation (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) between Pluronic and free emulsifier molecules (Tween 80 or Span 80) present in the aqueous phase. A similar micro-DSC behavior has been reported for a Pluronic solution in the presence of non-ionic surfactants

 </sup>. Our DSC data suggests that the endothermic adsorption process of Pluronic onto the oil droplet interface is more favourable and dominant as compared with micellization of Pluronic copolymers. Further, unlike the concentrated pure Pluronic solution in which shear moduli sharply increase at the gel point (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3a</xref>), the growth of

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> vs Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3a</xref>). This might be due to the occurrence of multiple temperature-sensitive phenomena, including forming hairy oil droplets and then Pluronic micelles (suggested from broad copolymer adsorption peak in the oil interfaces vs. narrower endothermic peak in pure Pluronic solution).
