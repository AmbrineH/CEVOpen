<p id="Par11" class="p">To understand the origin of the elasticity of our system, we tested the reversibility of the shear moduli in temperature cycle tests (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6a, b, and c</xref>). We noticed that the liquid-like behavior at low temperature is not recoverable through the cooling step (at least during the considered time scale). In fact, the structure remains in the gel state (for a prolong period of time), after being subjected to high temperature. These hysteresis effects are similar to the previously reported data on a concentrated pure Pluronic solution

 </sup>. In pure Pluronics, micelles begin to form as temperature increases until they increase in number to be closely packed. Elasticity in the pure Pluronic system is thought to arise from the overlapping micelle shells formed of PEO chains

 </sup>. In analogy with the pure Pluronic copolymer solution, we speculate that the origin of the elasticity and gel-like response in our thermogelling nanoemulsion is most likely attributed to a sequence of events as temperature is increased: (1) adsorption of the Pluronic to the nanoemulsion, (2) Pluronic micelle formation, and (3) increase in Pluronic micelles until they become close-packed such that there will be overlap of PEO chains amongst the various entities (both micelles and hairy droplets), as depicted in Fig.
