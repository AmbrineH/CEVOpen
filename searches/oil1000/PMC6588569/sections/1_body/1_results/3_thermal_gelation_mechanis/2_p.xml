<p id="Par9" class="p">The above control experiments emphasize that the presence and function of the oil phase is critical in obtaining a thermogelling behavior at these very low Pluronic concentrations. We hypothesize that thermally induced gelling in our system occurs by a synergistic effect between the Pluronic copolymers and nanoemulsion droplets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). There are multiple hydrophobic sites that may affect the self-assembly of Pluronic molecules as temperature rises. These include nanoemulsion oil droplets as well as the hydrophobic core of Tween 80 and Span 80 micelles. As the temperature increases, PPO segments of Pluronic adsorb to the oil interface as they become more hydrophobic. The adsorbed layer of Pluronics onto the oil interface alters the effective volume fraction (

 </sup>. The effective volume fraction of the Pluronic-coated hairy droplets can be estimated using the relationship derived for sterically stabilized dispersions:

 <italic class="italic">δ</italic> is the droplet radius with adsorbed layer of Pluronic, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> is the initial nanoemulsion radius, and 
 <italic class="italic">ϕ</italic> is the true volume fraction. We assume that the oil droplets are mostly coated with F127, as PPO/PEO molar ratio is higher in F127 compared with F68 (PPO/PEO ratios are 0.33 and 0.19 for F127 and F68, respectively) and molar concentration of F127 is as four times as F68. Assuming an adsorbed layer thickness of ≈5.5 nm

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>, the effective volume fraction of the oil phase can be increased from 0.24 to 0.43 upon adsorption of the Pluronic. While this is a significant increase in the effective volume fraction, it is still below the random close-packed limit for monodisperse hard spheres (
 <italic class="italic">ϕ</italic> = 0.64). Excess Pluronic copolymers can also form mixed micelles in the aqueous phase, which increases the micelle concentration in the solution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>)

 </sup>. Akin to the jamming-induced gelation in pure Pluronic systems, we hypothesize that the packing of the mixed-micelles with the hairy nanodroplets leads to the observed thermogelation in our system. The fact that there is no gel transition in the absence of oil droplets suggests that the adsorption of Pluronic copolymers onto the droplet interface is a key step, which gives rise to the thermogelling behavior of our system. Additionally, the confocal images captured above the gelation point support the proposed gelation mechanism where the oil droplets are distributed randomly throughout the microstructure (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Furthermore, the desmeared small angle X-ray scattering spectra of the thermogelling nanoemulsion nearly overlap at liquid and gel states. This confirms that at gel state no clusters form and the oil droplet size remains intact at an elevated temperature. (Supplementary Fig.
