 </sup>. Pluronics are amphiphilic triblock copolymers consisting of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO–PPO–PEO). As temperature increases, midblock segments become more hydrophobic, while PEO segments are hydrated over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature-dependent solubility of PPO in water promotes micelle formation. At high enough concentration, these spherical micelles construct a packed microstructure. It has been postulated that overlap of the PEO chains in adjacent micelle coronas gives rise to gelation

 </sup>. Temperature ramp measurements of the mixed Pluronic solution used in this work indicated that the minimum polymer concentration needed for sol-to-gel transition to occur is 13% (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3a</xref>) and in a 15% Pluronic solution only a weak gel can be obtained. Additionally, dynamic rheological experiments were conducted on our canonical composition without the presence of the oil (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3c–e</xref>) and no gel formation was observed over the temperature range 10–60 °C.
