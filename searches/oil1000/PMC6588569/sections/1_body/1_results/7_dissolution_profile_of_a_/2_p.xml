<p id="Par18" class="p">Overall, our synthesized thermogelling nanoemulsion displays a unique sol-to-gel transition mechanism and offers distinct advantages compared with previously reported thermogelling emulsion-based systems. For example, in our prior work the droplet gelation is thought to occur via droplet bridging induced by a relatively cytotoxic gelator

 </sup>. In contrast, the Pluronic copolymers used here as the thermo-gelator molecule are FDA-approved molecules and have been widely utilized in different biological and pharmaceutical formulations. In addition, the gelation mechanism is different from many other previous reports, in which gelation typically occurs by adding high concentrations of thermogelling polymer (either synthetic or natural) to gel the aqueous phase

 </sup>. In these thermogelling emulsion-based systems, the disperse phase has no role in inducing the gelation and is merely loaded material. In contrast, nanoemulsion droplets in our system play a critical role in the thermoresponsive behavior of the formulation by becoming hairy droplets decorated by the Pluronic copolymers at elevated temperatures. Additionally, the nanoscale droplet size and the presence of the gelator copolymer in the aqueous phase render it a long-term stable formulation (over a period of at least one year), and the feasibility of producing the formulation with a low-energy process in bulk makes it suitable for scaled-up commercial applications. To further test the generality of the thermogelling behavior of our nanoemulsion, the oil fraction and Pluronic concentration in the canonical formulation were varied and their rheological properties were characterized (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>). We found that the thermogelling behavior is robust over a wide range of oil fractions as low as 0.18 (equivalent to 15% wt.) and Pluronic mass fraction as low as 3.9%.
