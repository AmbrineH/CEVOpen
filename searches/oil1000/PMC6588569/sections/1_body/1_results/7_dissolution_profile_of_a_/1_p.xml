<p id="Par17" class="p">One of the potential applications of the formed nanoemulsion is as carrier devices of active compounds for the topical formulations. To demonstrate this application, a model active pharmaceutical ingredient (ibuprofen) was dissolved in the oil phase prior to the nanoemulsion formation and the release profile was studied below and above the gel point of the nanoemulsion. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref> displays the release profiles of the ibuprofen in the dissolution experiments at two different temperature (10 and 37 °C). We noticed that the release profiles are distinctively different at the sol and gel state of the material. At low temperature (where the nanoemulsion has a liquid-like behavior), over 90% of the active material is released within 10 min, whereas at body temperature (where the nanoemulsion forms a gel) it takes about 30 min for the same amount of the ibuprofen to dissolve into the dissolution media.
