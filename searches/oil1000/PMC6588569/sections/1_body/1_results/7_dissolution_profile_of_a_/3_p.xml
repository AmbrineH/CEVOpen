<p id="Par19" class="p">In summary, we synthesized a thermogelling oil-in-water nanoemulsion which contains biocompatible ingredients. Nanoemulsion suspensions are formed through a low-energy method which facilitates large-scale production. A low concentration (4.7% wt.) of Pluronic triblock copolymer was used to gel the nanoemulsion suspension. Micro-DSC data indicate that as temperature increases, nanoemulsion droplets are decorated with Pluronic copolymers such that the midblocks are adsorbed onto the oil-water interfaces while the end blocks remain hydrated in the continuous phase. The decorated nanodroplets and an increased concentration of micelles in the aqueous phase results in a packed gel structure. These nanoemulsion-based gels exhibit unique rheological properties. At ambient temperature, they display shear-thinning behavior, and the solution rapidly gels as temperature is increased. The gel structure is disturbed under applied shear stress above the yielding point and quickly returns to the original state when the applied load is removed. Due to the ease of synthesis, biocompatibility, and the self-healing properties, the introduced thermoresponsive nanoemulsion gel has the potential to serve as an ideal and robust thermogelling vehicle. They warrant further exploration for transdermal and topical formulation application.</p>
