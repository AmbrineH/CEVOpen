<p id="Par12" class="p">Next, we prepared nanoemulsions with varied droplet diameters to examine the effect of droplet size on the thermogelling behavior of our nanoemulsion system. The preparation was performed in such a way that all chemical compositions are identical, except for the oil droplet sizes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> displays the shear moduli as a function of temperature as well as frequency dependency of the moduli at 50 °C for three different droplet sizes (hydrodynamic diameters equal to 53, 72, and 115 nm). All three systems show thermogelling behavior, though with some qualitative changes in rheological behavior and shifts in gelation temperature. For the system with the largest droplet size (115 nm), the

 <sup class="sup">′′</sup> crossover spans from 30 °C to more than 40 °C. At 50 °C, the storage modulus becomes more frequency dependent as droplet size increases. At a fixed dispersed phase volume fraction, increasing the nanoemulsion size from 53 nm to 115 nm reduces the oil surface area by approximately a factor of 2. Additionally, increasing the droplet size (holding the true volume fraction constant) decreases the effective volume fraction for Pluronic-coated droplets from

We postulate that decreasing the effective volume fraction of the oil droplet results in the formation of a gel with a less jammed structure at elevated temperatures and hence a decrease in elasticity. Our hypothesis also was confirmed by using different types of Pluronic copolymers with relatively a similar PEO length, and indeed the results indicated a similar thermogelling behavior of the nanoemulsion (Supplementary Fig.
