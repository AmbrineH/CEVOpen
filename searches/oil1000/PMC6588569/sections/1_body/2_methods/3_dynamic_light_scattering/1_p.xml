<p id="Par23" class="p">A NanoBrook 90plus PALS (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, USA) particle size analyzer was used to measure nanoemulsion droplet sizes and polydispersity index (PDI). Hydrodynamic droplet size was analyzed by dynamic light scattering. Samples were diluted to approximately 0.001 volume fraction. The dilution was performed to eliminate multiple scattering effects arising from components other than the nanodroplets and their inherent effects on the continuous phase viscosity.</p>
