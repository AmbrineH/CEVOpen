<p id="Par26" class="p">Rheological characterizations were conducted using a stress-controlled rheometer, Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, DHR3 (TA Instruments). An aluminium 60 mm 1.004° cone-plate fixture with a solvent trap geometry was utilized. The lower plate was equipped with a Peltier plate to control the temperature. The sol-to-gel transition was monitored in an oscillation temperature ramp, 2 °C/min, (from 10 °C to 50 °C) under strain amplitude of

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 0.1% and

After completion of gelation, all other rheological experiments were conducted. To capture large strain deformation behavior of the thermogelling nanoemulsion at 50 °C, large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) tests were applied (

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 0.1%). To capture flow and thixotropy behavior of the thermogelling nanoemulsion at 50 °C, flow sweep tests were applied from low to high (0.1 1/s–100 1/s) and then high to low shear rate (100 1/s–0.1 1/s). For recovery behavior of thermogelling nanoemulsion at 50 °C, consecutive time sweep experiments were conducted at low (5 Pa for 300 s) and high (500 Pa for 120 s) oscillatory shear stress. In order to capture the speed of gelation from sol state to gel state of our thermogelling nanoemulsion, a temperature jump (20–50 °C) was applied while time sweep experiment (
