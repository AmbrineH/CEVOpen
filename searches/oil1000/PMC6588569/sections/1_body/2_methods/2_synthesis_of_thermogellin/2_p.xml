<p id="Par22" class="p">To prepare thermogelling nanoemulsions with different oil droplet sizes (53, 72, and 115 nm, as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), the cosurfactant (PEG 400, total of 5% wt.) was added during and/or after nanoemulsion preparation as follows. It should be noted that PEG 400 functions as a cosurfactant and reduces the oil droplet diameter only if used during emulsification

 </sup>. For example, a nanoemulsion with oil droplet size of 72 nm was prepared by adding 2.5% wt. PEG 400 during and then 2.5% wt. after nanoemulsion formation. Similarly, adding 5% wt. PEG 400 after nanoemulsion formation resulted in a droplet size of 115 nm. In addition, to obtain nanoemulsion suspensions with different concentrations of PEG 400 while having a similar oil droplet diameter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), 5% cosurfactant was used during nanoemulsion formation and additional amount of cosurfactant was incorporated after forming the nanoemulsion.
