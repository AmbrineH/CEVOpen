<p id="Par21" class="p">The oil-in-water nanoemulsions were first prepared, and then followed by the addition of gelator molecules (See Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Nanoemulsions were prepared by changing the composition in a low-energy methodology at ambient temperature. Deionized (DI) water was added dropwise into a magnetically stirred mixture of oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant. Subsequent to nanoemulsion formation, a Pluronic solution (F127/F68: 6/1 g/g and with polymer concentration of 23.3%, kept at 4 °C), was added. To thoroughly mix the final solution, it was vortexed for additional 5 s and was kept at 4 °C overnight (to remove air bubbles) prior to experimental analysis. Addition of F68 enhances the flow behavior of the thermogelling nanoemulsion at ambient temperature in comparison with using only F127 as the gelator (Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The final composition and concentration in our canonical thermogelling nanoemulsion is as follows: isopropyl myristate as an oil (20% wt., equivalent to the volume fraction of 0.24), mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 (HLB = 13) as surfactant (20% wt.), PEG 400 as cosurfactant (5% wt.), Pluronic, with mass ratio of F127/F68: 6/1, as thermo-gelator molecules (4.7% wt.) and DI water (50.3% wt.). The thermogelling nanoemulsions prepared in this work have a droplet diameter size of 53 ± 2 nm with polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.12, as measured using dynamic light scattering. To monitor the intrinsic stability of the thermogelling nanoemulsion, samples were stored at room temperature and droplet size measurements were monitored for over a period of one year (See Supplementary Fig.
