<p id="Par24" class="p">Micro-differential scanning calorimetry (Micro-DSC) experiments were carried out on a micro-calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., MA, US). The samples were kept at 4 °C for 30 min prior to injecting through an 18-gauge needle into the sample and reference cells. To obtain DI water baselines, an overnight up-and-down temperature scan was performed over a temperature range between 10 and 75 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min (the overall measurement time of the rheology and DSC tests are nearly the same). Subsequent to ensuring bubble free loading in the reference cell and no contamination in the sample cell, samples were loaded in the sample cell at 10 °C. Sample cell was thoroughly cleaned with ethanol and rinsed with DI water in between sample loadings. The collected data were baseline subtracted using the Origin software provided by the manufacturer.</p>
