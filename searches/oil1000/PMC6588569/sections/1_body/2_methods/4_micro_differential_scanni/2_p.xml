<p id="Par25" class="p">The nanoemulsion solution was centrifuged using 4 mL Amicon ultra centrifugal filters with a 100 kDa cutoff. Centrifugation was performed at 4000 rpm for 30 min. To lower the viscosity, nanoemulsions were diluted fivefold prior to centrifugation. Subsequent to centrifugation, the supernatant (primarily composed of the droplet oil phase) was used to make a washed nanoemulsion with a final oil concentration of 0.4% wt. and Pluronic concentration of 1.2% wt. Subnatant solutions (continuous phase) were also collected and then mixed with Pluronic solution, with final concentration of 1.2% wt., and diluting the continuous phase fivefold with respect to our canonical concentration. The hydrodynamic diameter of the oil droplets remain unchanged after the centrifugation process.</p>
