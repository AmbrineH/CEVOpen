<p id="Par5" class="p">Here, we report a unique class of thermogelling organohydrogels which are based on a unique gelation mechanism. The key components in the oil-in-water thermogelling nanoemulsion are chosen among the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s (FDA) approved compounds, which provides a compatible environment for incorporating pharmaceutical agents. In addition, the nanoemulsion suspensions are formed through a low energy process, which facilitates large-scale production

 </sup>. Compared with microemulsions, which are a thermodynamically stable system, nanoemulsions are metastable and considered to be an ideal system in many applications as the droplets remain stable when subject to environmental changes, such as temperature change or dilution

 </sup>. The key concept in the present system is the exploitation of hydrophobic interactions between the amphiphilic triblock copolymers and nanoemulsion droplets which work cooperatively in inducing the gel formation. The gelation is thermally triggered as the copolymer is both adsorbed on the surface of the nanoemulsion oil droplets and forms micelles in solution. Unlike our prior work

 </sup>, here the copolymer gelators contain hydrophobic groups in the central region of the molecules and do not directly bridge the droplets. Support of the proposed gelation mechanism is provided by calorimetry experiments, rheological measurements, confocal microscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering. The resulting organohydrogels exhibit unique rheological properties. Specifically, they display shear-thinning behavior in both liquid and gel states, spontaneously form a gel at elevated temperatures, and rapidly self-recover following the cessation of applied large stress. The biocompatibility of the ingredients used in these organohydrogels and tunable mechanical properties of the obtained gels make them a promising thermogelling system for applications such as transdermal medications or cosmetics.
