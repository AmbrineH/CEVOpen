 </sup>. The encapsulation procedures require only mild dissolution processes, which eliminate any additional chemical modification of bioactive components. The immiscible domains (e.g. oil and water) can be achieved through emulsification methods, which are broadly classified as either high- or low-energy processes

 </sup>. Nanoscale emulsions with sizes on the order of 100 nm (so-called nanoemulsions) provide an efficient and facile approach to encapsulating both polar and non-polar functional biomolecules for co-delivery of dissimilar therapeutics

 </sup>. Multiple strategies have been employed to obtain thermogelling emulsion-based organohydrogels which are mostly based on entrapping the dispersed phase via thermally gelling the continuous phase

 </sup>. Alternatively, we recently developed a method in which the nanoemulsion droplets themselves are physically crosslinked by a thermoresponsive gelator molecule which can bridge nanoemulsion droplets to induce a gel-like material at elevated temperatures

 </sup>. Despite the advances in the synthesis methodologies of thermogelling nanoemulsions, prior approaches are not suitable for practical applications due to the cytotoxicity of the compositions and/or difficulties in scaling-up the process.
