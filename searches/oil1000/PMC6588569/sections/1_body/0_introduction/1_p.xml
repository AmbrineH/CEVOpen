 </sup>. Physically crosslinked hydrogels, which avoid the use of toxic chemical crosslinking reagents, are of the great interest due to inherent reversibility and dynamics of their physical interactions. The dynamic nature of a physically self-assembled gel network can prevent permanent dissociation of the microstructure and promotes self-healing. The self-healing properties of hydrogels have been shown in different physical crosslinking strategies, such as hydrophobic interactions

 </sup>. Among these stimuli-responsive systems, thermal-responsive hydrogels that undergo a sol-to-gel transition at ambient to physiological temperature are highly desirable for biological applications. Most of the thermogelling polymer hydrogels reported in the literature are based on synthetic amphiphilic block copolymers or biopolymers with temperature-sensitive moieties

 </sup>. Ideally, the thermogelling formed hydrogels should possess mechanical properties appropriate to the targeted application. For example, if used as an injectable vehicle or in topical formulations it is desirable to have substantial decreases in viscosity as they flow (shear-thinning), rapidly forming a gel at elevated temperature and fast self-healing properties
