  <title class="title">Background:</title>
  <p class="p">This study investigates the scolicidal effects of 
   <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> essential oil against the protoscoleces of hydatid cysts and its toxicity in the mice model.

  <title class="title">Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analyses were used to identify the constituents of essential oil. Protoscoleces were treated with different concentrations of the essential oil (6.25–100 µL/mL) in each test tube for 5–30 min. The viability of protoscoleces was confirmed using eosin exclusion test (0.1% eosin staining). Forty-eight male NMRI mice were also used to determine the toxicity of 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil (0.5–4 mL/kg).

  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">The main components were found to be cinnamaldehyde (91.8%), ρ metoxicinamate (1.57%), and α pinene (1.25%). Findings indicate that 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil with the concentrations of 100 and 50 µL/mL killed 100% of protoscoleces after 5 min of exposure. Also, the lower concentrations of 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil motivated a late protoscolicidal effect. The LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of intraperitoneal injection of 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil was 2.07 mL/kg body weight after 48 h, and the maximum nonfatal dose was 1.52 mL/kg body weight. The results also showed that there was no significant toxicity following oral administration of 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil for 2 weeks.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">The results exhibited the favorable scolicidal activity of 
   <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic>, which could be applied as a natural scolicidal agent in hydatid cyst surgery.
