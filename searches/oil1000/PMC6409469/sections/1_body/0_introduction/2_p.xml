<p class="p">Precise estimation of DE and metabolizable energy (ME) values are essential for accurate diet formulation and feed cost reduction. However, it consumes large amount of labor, time and money through traditional 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> metabolism experiments to measure the energy contents [
 <xref rid="b11-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Instead, many researchers reported prediction equations to estimate the available energy based on the chemical compositions, for example, in the complete diets [

 <xref rid="b7-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. No such equations have been generated by now on CGM in growing pigs. Therefore, we hypothesized that there are differences in DE and ME values of CGM samples because of their variable chemical composition. The objectives of the present study were to determine the chemical compositions and DE and ME values of CGMs obtained from different plants and to develop prediction equations to estimate the DE and ME values of individual CGM sample.
