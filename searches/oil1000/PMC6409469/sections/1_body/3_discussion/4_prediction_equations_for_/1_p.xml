 <xref rid="b31-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] take advantage of prediction equations to estimate DE and ME values in feed ingredients and diets. Noblet and Perez [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] presented that the DE and ME contents in swine diets could be accurately predicted from chemical components, using 114 diets with more than 40 ingredients. However, those prediction equations obtained may be more suitable for compound diets rather than an individual ingredient [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Because more similarities exist among different samples for a specific ingredient, more suitable prediction equations could be developed. Nevertheless, little research has focused on this work, and no specific prediction equations established solely targeting for the energy contents of CGM in pigs.
