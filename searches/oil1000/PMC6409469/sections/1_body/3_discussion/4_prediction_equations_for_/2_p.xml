<p class="p">It is noteworthy that ADF instead of NDF was a suitable predictor in predicting DE and ME contents of CGM. A simple linear regression analysis of the current data suggests that for every 1% increase in ADF, there is a 3% (0.62 MJ) decrease in DE (Eq. 1,

The fact that IDF was selected into the best-fit prediction equation for DE indicates that the analysis of feedstuffs for TDF and IDF, especially in corn co-products is necessary. Inclusion of a second characteristic (Ca) into the equations improved the accuracy for DE and ME estimation. Generally, energy values are more related to organic compounds such as CP, EE, or starch [

Although the concentration of fiber (e.g., ADF) may be negatively related to energy values, the relationship between energy values and Ca concentration is hardly expected because the concentration of Ca in CGM is considerably lower compared with the other nutrients. Therefore, from the biological perspective, prediction equations with only ADF as the parameter (Eq. 1 and 4, 
 <xref rid="t7-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>) are more acceptable. However, the addition of parameter Ca greatly increased the R

Even though the Ca concentration is low, the coefficients of Ca in the prediction equations are large, which can ensure the logical prediction using Ca from the mathematical point of view. In addition, the processing condition of CGM from different production plants may affect the oil content of CGM, and the steep addition may affect the CP content of CGM, which are 2 important factors that could affect the energy content of CGM. As a result, adding these parameters, e.g. the processing conditions of each plant and the steep addition during the processing, into the equation may greatly improve the prediction efficiency. Nevertheless, this information is unavailable in the current experiment. Further investigation on processing conditions are needed in the future.
