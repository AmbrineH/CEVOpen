<p class="p">In conclusion, the ten CGM samples from different sources used in this experiment showed large variability in chemical characteristics, but no significant differences were observed in the energy contents for most tested samples. To get accurate prediction for the energy contents of the individual CGM sample, it would be conducive to develop prediction equations based on the chemical compositions of the CGM samples. The best-fit prediction equations on mathematical meanings for the DE and ME values (MJ/kg DM) of CGM were: DE = 26.85–0.28 IDF (%)–17.79 Ca (%); ME = 21.05–0.43 ADF (%)–11.40 Ca (%).</p>
