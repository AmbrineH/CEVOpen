<p class="p">The averaged energy contents of the 10 CGM samples (14.42 MJ DE/kg DM and 13.78 MJ ME/kg DM, respectively) were comparable to those published by NRC (13.86 MJ DE/kg DM and 13.13 MJ ME/kg DM) [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The CGM of source 9 had the lowest DE and ME contents, which may be due to its lower GE and EE contents as well as higher ADF and IDF contents compared with other CGM samples. The fiber content of a feed ingredient is negatively correlated with its energy value [
 <xref rid="b26-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Weber et al [
 <xref rid="b6-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] showed that increasing dietary fiber content could decrease the absorption efficiency of dietary lipid and energy. The difference between the minimum and the maximum values of DE and ME contents were 5.61 and 5.49 MJ/kg among the 10 CGM samples on DM basis, respectively, which can result in considerable error when averaged energy values were used in diet formulation. Therefore, dynamic comparisons and prediction equations are necessary to accurately predict the energy contents of different CGM samples.
