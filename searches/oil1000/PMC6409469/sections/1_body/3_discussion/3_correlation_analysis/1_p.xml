<p class="p">Acid detergent fiber, a measurement of the total cellulose and lignin contents, was the most significant factor affecting the variation of the DE and ME contents in the dataset. As expected, there is a positive correlation between GE and AEE in CGM in our experiment because lipids provide more energy than carbohydrates and crude protein [

Moreover, the concentration of fiber components such as ADF and IDF were negatively correlated with DE and ME in the current experiment, which is in agreement with the previous literature reporting negative influences of dietary fiber content on energy values [
