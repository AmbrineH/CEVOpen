<p class="p">To establish the prediction equations for DE and ME values in CGM, 10 CGM samples with different sources were collected in this experiment. There was large variation among the chemical compositions of samples (
 <xref rid="t2-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The chemical compositions were different from those in NRC [
 <xref rid="b14-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and previous literature [
 <xref rid="b7-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The large variation existing in chemical characteristics such as AEE, EE, SDF, ash and Ca can be explained by the differences in original corn and the processing line. Soil, latitude and environmental conditions during corn growing and harvesting can play an important role in the changes of corn chemical components [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], resulting in different nutrient contents in CGM. The varied ash contents among the 10 CGM samples may be due to the corn source and the stone-removing step during the production process [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The varied fiber contents of CGM were related to the supplementation of corn bran to corn germ by the producer during processing [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Cooking temperature, solvent and machines used in the pre-press solvent extraction process would lead to variable fat residue in CGM [
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To meet the customer requirements and to create more profit, some steep liquor was added to CGM, leading to the varied CP content of CGM obtained from different sources [
 <xref rid="b3-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Among the components, the DM and GE values were relative stable.
