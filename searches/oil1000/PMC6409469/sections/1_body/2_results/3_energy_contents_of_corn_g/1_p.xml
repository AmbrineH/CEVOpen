<p class="p">The DE and ME values of the 10 experimental diets are demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Diets supplemented with CGM 9 had the lowest (p&lt;0.01) DE and ME values compared with the other experimental diets. Moreover, diets with CGM 1 added had greater (p&lt;0.01) ME value compared to diets with CGM 4 added. No significant differences were observed for the ME/DE ratio among the 10 experimental diets. The DE and ME values, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE and ME/DE ratios of the 10 CGM samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The DE value and ATTD of GE in CGM 9 was lower (p&lt;0.01) than those in the other CGM samples. The ME value in CGM 4 was higher (p&lt;0.01) than that in CGM 9 but lower (p&lt;0.01) than that in CGM 1. Otherwise, no significant differences were observed among the CGM samples for those parameters. The DE values of the CGM samples tested ranged from 10.22 to 15.83 MJ/kg on DM basis. The ME values of the CGM samples tested ranged from 9.94 to 15.43 MJ/kg on DM basis. There was no significant difference in the ME/DE ratio among different CGM samples.
