<p class="p">Prediction equations were established to estimate the DE and ME values of CGM using regression analysis based on their chemical characteristics (
 <xref rid="t7-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). The ADF was the best predictor for both DE and ME values of the CGM. With the addition of Ca, the R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the prediction equations for the DE and ME values improved from 0.75 to 0.90 and 0.73 to 0.87, respectively. The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the prediction equation for the DE was improved with the IDF instead of ADF. Moreover, DE and ME contents were highly correlated: ME (MJ/kg DM) = 0.40+0.93 DE (MJ/kg DM).
