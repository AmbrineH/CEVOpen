<p class="p">The correlation coefficients (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between chemical compositions and the GE, DE, and ME values of the 10 CGM samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. Digestible energy and ME values were positively correlated with CP and starch (p&lt;0.05), and were negatively correlated with ADF, IDF, and Ca (p&lt;0.05). Gross energy had a negative correlation with ash, Ca and total phosphorus (p&lt;0.05), and a positive correlation with AEE, EE, NDF, and TDF. The TDF was positively correlated with NDF, IDF, and SDF (p&lt;0.05). Insoluble dietary fiber had a positive correlation with NDF and ADF (p&lt;0.05). The highest correlation was found between DE and ME (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.99, p&lt;0.05).
