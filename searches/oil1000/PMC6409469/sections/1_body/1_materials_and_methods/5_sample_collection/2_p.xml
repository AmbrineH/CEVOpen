<p class="p">Urine samples were collected into plastic buckets attached to funnels located under the metabolic crates at the same time as fecal collection according to the methods described by Li et al [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The buckets (5 liters) contained 10 mL of 6 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> HCl for every 1,000 mL of urine to limit microbial growth and reduce the loss of ammonia. The total urine volume excreted from each pig was recorded daily and 10% of the total volume was stored at −20°C. At the end of the collection period, the stored urine samples were pooled for each pig, and a subsample (about 4 to 5 mL) was saved for further analysis. The subsamples were dried at 65°C for 8 h with quantitative filter paper in crucibles for gross energy (GE) determination. Two unaltered sheets of quantitative filter paper from the same box were used to calibrate the energy content of the paper.
