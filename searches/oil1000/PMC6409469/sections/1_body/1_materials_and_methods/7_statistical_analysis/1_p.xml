<p class="p">Data were checked for normality and equal variances using the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS (Version 9.0; SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and no outliers were found. All the data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the general linear model procedure of SAS with individual pig as the experimental unit. The statistical model included the treatment diet as fixed effect. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using Tukeyâ€™s method. The correlation coefficients among the proximate chemical composition and energy values (GE, DE, and ME) of CGM samples were calculated using the CORR procedure of SAS (USA).</p>
