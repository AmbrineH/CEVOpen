<p class="p">Sixty-six healthy crossbred barrows (initial body weight [BW] of 51.3±4.6 kg, Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire) were assigned to 11 treatment diets in a completely randomized design, with 6 replicate pigs per diet. All pigs were placed in individual stainless steel metabolism cages (1.4×0.45×0.6 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) on concrete slatted floors and stayed in temperature-controlled rooms (22.0°C±1.3°C). The cages were equipped with a feeder in front and a dripper on one side, which could limit the feed spillage and keep the feed separate from water. The animal trial lasted for 12 d including 7 d for diet and cage adaptation followed by a 5-d period of total feces and urine collection.
