<p class="p">The ingredients, diets and feces were analyzed for dry matter (DM, method 930.15), crude protein (CP, method 990.03), ash (method 975.03), calcium (Ca, method 985.01), and phosphorus (P, method 985.01) [

 <italic class="italic">N</italic> HCl followed by ether extract (EE) extraction with petroleum ether (method 2003.06) [
 <xref rid="b19-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] using Soxtec 2050 Automated Analyzer (FOSS North America, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were determined using fiber bags and fiber analyzer equipment (Fiber Analyzer, Ankom Technology, Macedon, NY, USA) following an adapted procedure described by van Soest et al [
 <xref rid="b20-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Total dietary fiber (TDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were determined according to the methods described by Prosky et al [
 <xref rid="b21-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and Prosky et al [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], respectively. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) was calculated by subtracting IDF from TDF. Starch content was measured with the Ewers polarimetric method [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-17-0891" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], but it was not measured in feces and the digestibility coefficient of starch was assumed to be 100%. The GE of feed, feces and urine were determined using an automatic isoperibol oxygen bomb calorimeter (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL, USA). Urine samples were analyzed in triplicate for GE value to gain an accurate result, and other samples were analyzed in duplicate.
