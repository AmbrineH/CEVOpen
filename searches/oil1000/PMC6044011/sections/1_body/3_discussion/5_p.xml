<p id="Par27" class="p">Several studies indicated that Gram-positive bacteria are less resistant than negative ones against natural products such as essential oils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. This resistance had been attributed to the additional outer membrane (this is likely the case in our study) and that most resistant bacterium was
