<p id="Par24" class="p">The essential oil in 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> showed the highest antifungal activities by means of lowest MIC and MFC values which might be attributed to 1,8-cineole (19.60%), camphor (17.01%) and Î±-pinene (15.12%) as the major oil constituents as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. It was reported that 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol and other compounds showed strong in-vitro antifungal activities against some plant pathogenic fungi including 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium cerealis, Aspergillus tubingensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. carbonarius</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. In the current study, we report strong antifungal activities of the 1,8-cineole-rich 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> against plant and human pathogenic fungi including 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus, A. ochraceus, A. niger, P. funiculosum, P. ochrochloron</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. The oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> followed 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> in term of level of antifungal activities, and such interesting bioactivities of the essential oil might be attributed to the presence of pulegone (77.45%) and the menthone (4.86%).
