<p id="Par28" class="p">Few species showed promising anticancer activities against the proliferation of cancer cells. The main effect of the essential oils is attributed to main constitutes such as the capillin in 
 <italic class="italic">A. monosperama</italic>, limonene in the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> sp. and pulegone in 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>. In agreement with our results in 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia judaica</italic> oil (mainly composed of thujone), Torres et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>] reported that the thujone enriched fraction has potential anticancer activities. The use of capillin (1–10 uM), isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">A. monosperama</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">inhibited</italic> cell proliferation of HT29, MIA PaCa-2 and HEp-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Several recent studies investigated the anticancer activities of several compounds. Murata et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] found that 1, 8-cineole (the main component of 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon viminals</italic>) suppress the prolifieration of colon cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (see Miller et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>] for in-depth review). On one hand, Shapira et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>] found that Terpinen-4-ol inhibited different cancer cells and Shehab and Abu-Gharbieh, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>] suggested that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria Fruticosa</italic> L. (58.5% pulegone) has antitumor activities against Human Colon Cancer and MCF7 with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> at 10 and 12.7 μg/Ml, respectively. Fayed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>] on the other hand reported that geranium essential oil (29.90% citronellol) had the highest anticancer activity with the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 62.50 μg/ml in NB4 cell line and 86.5 μg/ml in HL-60 cell line whereas Lin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>] reported that α-Phellandrene found in 
 <italic class="italic">Schinus molle</italic> influenced cell cycle and apoptosis in murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells. Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>] found that α-pinene has antitumor activities through inducing cell cycle arrest.
