<p id="Par26" class="p">In the current study, we document the highest antibacterial activity for the 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> essential oil by means of MIC and MBC values compared to other species, potentially because of the high pulegone ratio. Previous investigations reported strong antibacterial activities of essential oils of the pulegone-rich 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha longifolia</italic> L. and pulegone-rich 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> against different bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Pantoea agglumerans</italic> and human pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The high antifungal as well as antibacterial activities of pulegone rich essential oils suggest that this compound might have a wide spectrum of antifungal and antibacterial activities. The oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradise</italic> followed 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> in their level of antibacterial activities, which might be attributed to terpinen-4-ol and sabinene in 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> as well as limonene and linalool in 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradise</italic>. A strong antibacterial activity of five different terpenoids was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] against 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> spp. In addition, it was previously reported that the monoterpene terpinen-4-ol enhanced the antibacterial performance of 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. In the same trend, limonene is the major component of citrus essential oils in most species and was proven to have specific bacterial inactivation mechanism in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>] thus justifying the noticeable antibacterial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic>. However, other species studied here (
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic>) showed slightly lower antibacterial activities which could be partially explained by lower ratios of limonene and synergetic effects with other oil constituents such as the linalool in 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic>. Some essential oils in 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> showed comparable antibacterial and antifungal activities to antibiotics in some cases, which may indicate that these essential oils might be useful sources of natural products for commercial applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries.
