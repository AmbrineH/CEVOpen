The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 1 h. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Hewlett Packard 5890) apparatus detected the the essential oil constitutes after dilution in diethyl ether. Gas chromatography column properties and injection conditions matches those described [
