 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>had the best antioxidant and antibacterial activities with a high and unique pulegone ratio (77.45%). The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> essential oil showed the highest antifungal activities by means of lowest MIC and MFC values which might be attributed to 1,8-cineole, camphor and α-pinene. The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">A. monosperma</italic> showed the highest antiproliferation activities against different cancer cells. Oxygenated monoterpenes (i.e. linalool and pulegone) as well as monoterpene hydrocarbons including pinenes plays a pivotal role in the antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities of the essential oils of different horticultural aromatic plants. Some species showed antioxidant and antimicrobial activities comparable to standard compounds, which may indicate that these crops are valuable resources of natural compounds useful for pharmaceutical and food industries.
