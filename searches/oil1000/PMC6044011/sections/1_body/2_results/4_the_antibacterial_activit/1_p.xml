<p id="Par21" class="p">There were large differences regarding essential oils antibacterial activities by means of MIC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>) and MBC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The oils of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradisi</italic> showed the highest antibacterial activities with MIC values ranged between 0.11–0.76 mg/mL against examined bacteria. 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. paradise</italic> were the three most active essential oils, the MBC was in the range of 0.21 to 1.59. The most resistant bacterium in this case of 
 <italic class="italic">D. solani</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. In general, the highest MIC values were recorded for the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">A. monosperma, C. lemon</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. molle</italic>. Most essential oils showed slightly higher MIC values compared to antibiotics, however, 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> showed comparable values to antibiotics in some cases. The antibacterial activities were higher than antibiotics.
