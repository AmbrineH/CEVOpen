<p id="Par20" class="p">The activities of the essential oils were expressed as MIC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) and MFC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). In general, all examined oils showed antifungal activities against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus, A. ochraceus, A. niger, P. funiculosum, P. ochrochloron</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. The MIC and MFC values varied between 0.16 – 1.31 and 0.33–&gt; 4 mg/mL, respectively. The oils of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis, O. vulgare, C. macrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> showed the lowest MIC values compared to other plants species. The oil of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> showed the highest antifungal activities among studied essential oils by means of lowest values of MIC and MFC against the six fungi. The most resistant fungi were 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans, P. funiculosum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> showing the highest MIC and MFC values. The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinallis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> revealed comparable activities to commercial reagents.
