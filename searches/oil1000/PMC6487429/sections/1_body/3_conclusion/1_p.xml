<p class="p">The results obtained from this study indicate that CGPO and DEET were successfully encapsulated using the interfacial precipitation chemistry technique. The particle sizes of the microencapsulated CGPO and DEET were 2.7 and 6.5 Âµm, respectively. Zeta potential analysis indicated the stability of microencapsulated CGPO and DEET in the emulsion system. The FTIR spectra indicated the presence of interaction between the CMC and BKC in microcapsule; thus suggesting the successful encapsulation of active ingredients into the wall materials. The thermal analysis suggested that the core materials were properly encapsulated within the wall materials providing good thermal stability for the core materials. The formulation of microencapsulated CGPO in the lotion form demonstrated a remarkable potency as repellent against mosquito bites by providing outstanding repellency effect compared to pure compounds besides showing comparable effects compared with the gold standard for repellent, DEET. In conclusion, by employing the microencapsulation technique in the plant-based repellent product development particularly the volatile essential oil helps to improve their stability as well as their effectiveness as mosquito repellent. </p>
