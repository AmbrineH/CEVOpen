<p class="p">Twenty mg samples were dispersed in 50 mL deionised water and sonicated at 25 °C for 15 minutes. The solutions were then transferred into a folded capillary cell (polycarbonate with gold plated electrodes) to test for particle size and zeta potential using Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instrument Ltd. United Kingdom) at 25 °C. The mean particle diameter was calculated using the differential size distribution processor (SDP) intensity analysis program. The size distribution of the microcapsules was characterized statistically by polydispersity index (PDI). The lower the index value the narrower the size distribution of the microcapsules. The expected polydispersity is between 0 and 1. Values close to 0 indicate a monodispersed while values close to 1 indicate polydispersed of the particles size distribution. The measurements were done in triplicate and the average results for the measurement were recorded. </p>
