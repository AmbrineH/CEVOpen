<p class="p">CGPO and DEET were encapsulated based on the work of Kasting

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). Briefly, microcapsule walls were formed in two steps by reacting the amphiphilic macromolecule carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with a complementary reactant benzalkonium chloride (BKC). The first step is the formation of emulsions containing droplets of the core material (CGPO or DEET) in the first wall-forming reactant solution (CMC) that preferentially accumulated at the droplet surface by polar solvent forces. The second step added the second wall-forming reactant (BKC) to the system and spontaneously precipitating the CMC to form a membrane-like wall surrounding each droplet.
