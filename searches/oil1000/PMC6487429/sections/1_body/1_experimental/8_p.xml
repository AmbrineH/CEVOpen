 <underline class="underline">Phase C is the aqueous solution of the first wall-forming reactant (CMC) combined with distilled water to make a 1% solution and mixed using a 40 mm diameter four-bladed propeller at 600 rpm and 45 Â°C. The core emulsion mixture was then dispersed into the Phase C solution at the same rotation speed and temperature. Stirring was maintained for one hour in order to produce a uniform oil-in-water dispersion (Phase E). Phase D is a mixture of the second wall-forming reactant (BKC) and distilled water. This solution was gradually added to the Phase E emulsion while slowly increasing the stirrer speed to 800 rpm in order to achieve the formation of a microcapsule wall. This mixture was then removed from heating after 120 sec and allowed to cool to ambient temperature by stirring to complete the reaction resulting in a semisolid microcapsule within the aqueous solution. </underline>
