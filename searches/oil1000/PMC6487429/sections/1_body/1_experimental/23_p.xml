<p class="p">To test for any inherent repellency characteristics of the blank formulation (formulation without active ingredient), a comparison of mean landing rates per minutes of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti </italic>was conducted. Five volunteers were applied with 0.4 g of blank formulation to treatment area, leaving their second area as an untreated control. Prior to treatment, both hands were covered with rubber gloves with a 25 cm
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>opening corresponding to the marked area to confine mosquito bites to only the exposed areas. Both hands were exposed simultaneously in a cage for one minute and the number of mosquito lands and/or bites was recorded. The procedure was repeated 5 times with 5-min interval between each exposure.
