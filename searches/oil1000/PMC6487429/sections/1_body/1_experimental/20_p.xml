<p class="p">Thermal degradation of the microcapsule was carried out using themogravity analysis (TGA) model 4000 (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) to determine the decomposition temperature. About 30 mg of samples were heated from 25 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>under nitrogen flow. The thermal profiles were recorded in the form of graphs and the TGA curves were derived.
