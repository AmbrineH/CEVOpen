<p class="p">For our study, the microencapsulation of GGPO and DEET involved several phases as follows: Phase A is the mixture of the active ingredient (20% CGPO or 20% DEET) with an adjuvant to form a core phase consisting 60% active ingredient and 40% adjuvant. The Dow Corning 200 (silicon oil) and vanillin were mixed and blended in a 200 mL beaker using a magnetic stirrer bar set to rotate at a minimal speed of 200 rpm at 60 °C. The solution was allowed to cool down to 45 °C before the active ingredient was subsequently added to the mixture. Stirring was continued to complete the process. In another beaker, all ingredients in phase B (cetyl alcohol, PEG 3350, SPAN 80, and TWEEN 60) were heated to melt (60 °C) and stirred to mix completely. Phase A was then slowly added in the phase B mixture and the stirring continued to form an emulsion referred to as a core emulsion mixture. </p>
