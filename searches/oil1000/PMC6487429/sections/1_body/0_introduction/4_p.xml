<p class="p">There were few characteristics of the essential oil, which limit their effectiveness as mosquito repellents such as poor physiochemical stability, high volatility, and high thermal decomposition (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). However, these characteristics may possibly be minimized by using a controlled release technique in the formulation. Microencapsulation is one of the current techniques in the controlled release formulation which has been extensively studied all over the world (14). This technique will provide the outer coating (wall) that surrounds the particle of essential oil (core) by using natural or synthetic polymer. Subsequently, it will protect the unstable core material from the environment and be able to control the volatility and extend the release rate of the essential oil (
