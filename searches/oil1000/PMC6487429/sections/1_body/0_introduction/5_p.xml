<p class="p">This study aims to apply the microencapsulation technique in the attempt to produce microencapsulated CGPO via interfacial precipitation chemistry. The characteristics of the microcapsules were determined by measuring their size distribution, zeta potential, Fourier Transmission Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) spectra, and Thermogravity analysis (TGA) curve. After the formulation into lotion form, the effectiveness of microencapsulated CGPO was evaluated against mosquito bites compared with the pure CGPO and synthetic repellent, DEET. </p>
