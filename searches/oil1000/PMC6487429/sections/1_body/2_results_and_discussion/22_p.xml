<p class="p">Statistical analysis revealed that the microencapsulated CGPO-based lotion formulation showed no significant difference compared with the microencapsulated DEET-based lotion formulation at 4 h of exposure (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Although the microencapsulated CGPO-based formulation possessed similar efficacy as the microencapsulated DEET up to 4 h post application, it was unable to sustain the high protection as long as microencapsulated DEET-based lotion formulation (8 h). As discussed earlier, the microcapsule diameter size plays an important role in the microcapsule release rate. Microcapsule with smaller size tends to have high release rate due to the large surface area and microcapsule with the high release rate providing the short duration of protection. This could be the possible explanation to why the microencapsulated CGPO-based lotion formulation only possessed &gt; 75% protection after 8 h post application. The attempt to perform a similar test on 20% concentration of pure CGPO and pure DEET found the absence of complete protection for CGPO and only 2 h of protection for DEET. This finding suggested that the encapsulation of CGPO or DEET has helped these compounds to improve the repellency duration against mosquito bites.
