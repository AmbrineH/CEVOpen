<p class="p">As seen in the CGPO curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>), a dramatic weight loss was observed starting from 120 °C and the weight loss rate began to decrease when the temperature reached 150 °C. While for DEET (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4D</xref>), the weight loss started from 140 °C and completed at 180 °C. In the case of CGPO microcapsule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4E</xref>), there was less than 2% weight loss observed up to 150 °C that may be due to the evaporation of water remaining entrapped in the capsules after the encapsulation process (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). The three stages of weight loss were observed as the temperature was increased about 150 °C. After 150 °C until 230 °C, the essential oil reached the boiling point and the microcapsule wall broke. Part of the core material was released from the microcapsule resulted in a 58% weight loss. Compared with essential oil, the microcapsule had slower weight loss rate under temperature range (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). The second weight loss stage (20%) ranging from 230 °C and 350 °C was due to the degradation of microcapsule wall and the temperature range was consistent with that of the third weight loss stage and complete degradation for the CMC and BKC, respectively (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). The third stage of weight loss observed above 350 °C was due to the residual degradation of the microcapsule wall (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). These respective weight losses were also observed in the case of DEET microcapsule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4F</xref>) with minimal difference in the temperature and weight loss.
