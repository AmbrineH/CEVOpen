<p class="p">FTIR analyses were employed to determine the interaction between the wall material (BKC and CMC) and the successful entrapment of the EOs in the microcapsules. The FTIR spectra of BKC, CMC, pure CGPO, microencapsulated CGPO, pure DEET, and microencapsulated DEET are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The absorption peaks of BKC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>) show the characteristic peaks at 3395 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> because of N-H stretching (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>), while the peaks at 2922 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 2853 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>and 1456 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were due to the –CH stretching vibration of the surfactant tail and –CH bonding in the methyl and methylene groups, respectively (
