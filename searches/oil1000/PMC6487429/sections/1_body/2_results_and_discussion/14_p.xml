<p class="p">The FTIR analysis of DEET (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref>) showed multiple absorptions peaks at 2972 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 2875 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> characterized by the aliphatic C-H stretching vibration. The absorption peak at 1628 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was associated with the –C = C stretching of the aromatic group. Several peaks between 1500 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 1000 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>were assigned to the vibration of the C-C and C-H group. The vibration peaks from 945 to 456 were associated with the ‘oop’ = C-H stretch bending.
