 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the optical micrograph of microcapsule CGPO and DEET. 2 (A) and 2(B) showed a single microcapsule of CGPO and DEET respectively that consisted of thick wall surrounding the core. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> also shows several microcapsules of CGPO (C) and DEET (D) that demonstrated spherical and oval shape with the surfaces of the capsules bearing rough or sponge-like structure. The microcapsules were shown distributed individually without excessive agglomeration. The diameter measurement of microcapsules in the optical micrographs indicated that diameters of the microcapsule vary in the range of 2 to 8 Âµm. These results were strongly supported by results of the microcapsules size distribution as described later.
