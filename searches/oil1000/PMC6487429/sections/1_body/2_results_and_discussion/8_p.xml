<p class="p">The size distribution of the microcapsules was characterized by the polydispersity index (PDI). The lower the index value the narrower the size distribution of the microcapsules. The polydispersity of the microcapsules examined was found between 0 and 1. Values close to 0 indicate a monodisperse while values close to 1 indicate polydisperse in particle size distribution (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Results obtained showed that the PDI values for both CGPO and DEET microcapsules were 0.6 and 0.4, respectively (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Thus, this indicates that DEET microcapsules were more monodisperse and had narrow size distribution compared to CGPO microcapsules. These results were confirmed by the percentage of intensity distribution histograms shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. CGPO microcapsule had a wider distribution (more polydisperse) ranging from 0.4 µm to 8.3 µm with PDI value closer to 1.0 (
