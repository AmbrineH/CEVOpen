<p class="p">Statistically, no significant difference was detected between the mean landing rate per minute of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> on the blank formulation area and untreated area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). This indicated that the blank lotion did not possess inherent repellent properties and therefore did not affect the repellency response of the CGPO and DEET. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the percentage reduction of repellent efficacy for the microencapsulated CGPO-based lotion formulation and microencapsulated DEET- based lotion formulation against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti </italic>for six hours of exposure. The results obtained indicated that the microencapsulated CGPO-based lotion formulation provides complete protection (100%) for 2 h and then followed by high protection (98.82%) for the next 4 h of exposure. After 8 h of exposure, the protection was eventually reduced to 75.86% against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. As for the microencapsulated DEET-based lotion formulation, results showed that complete protection (100%) was maintained for 4 h after that &gt; 80% of protection was sustained up to 8 h post application.
