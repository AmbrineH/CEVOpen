<p class="p">From these results, it can be concluded that the encapsulation significantly improved the thermal stability of active ingredients (CGPO and DEET), suggesting that the wall materials (CMC and BKC) encapsulated these compounds appropriately (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). In addition, due to the compact encapsulation of the DEET and CGPO, the thermal stability curve of the microcapsule looked more complicated than their pure compounds thus suggesting that the DEET and CGPO were most likely being successfully encapsulated (
