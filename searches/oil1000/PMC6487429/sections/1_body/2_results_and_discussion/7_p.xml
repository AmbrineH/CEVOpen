<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-average particle diameters of CGPO and DEET microcapsules indicated the size of 2.7 µm and 6.5 µm respectively, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Microencapsulation is shown to produce significantly smaller particle size of CGPO compared to DEET (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and later found to have an effect towards the particle release rate. Surface area is one of the factors known affecting the particle release rate. According to Sinko (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>), the surface area increases with the decrease of particle size therefore, the release rate acts correspondingly with the surface area. Particles with smaller size (larger surface area) tend to be released faster than those having larger size. This finding corresponds with the result obtained from the repellent efficacy study as discussed later.
