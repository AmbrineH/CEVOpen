<p class="p">The zeta potential is a measure of the charge on a particle surface and has been known as the indicator for the emulsion system stability. High absolute values, whether negative or positive lead to repulsive forces between particles which improve the repellency between particles, thus inhibiting aggregations (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) demonstrated strong negative charged -47.9 mV and -43.0 mV for CGPO and DEET microcapsules, respectively. These values indicate that the particles in the suspension are stable having less tendency to build up flocculation. The negative charges of microcapsules are due to the carboxylate ion (-COO
 <sup class="sup">-</sup>) and chloride ion (CI
 <sup class="sup">-</sup>) in the emulsion system. The reaction between CMC (1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> wall reactant) and BKC (2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> wall reactant) produces two pairs of oppositely charged ions which are benzalkonium methylcellulose carboxylate and sodium chloride. Benzalkonium methylcellulose carboxylate is poorly soluble at the phase interface and precipitates to form the wall of the microcapsule while sodium chloride is typically fairly water soluble and readily dissolves in the aqueous medium (
