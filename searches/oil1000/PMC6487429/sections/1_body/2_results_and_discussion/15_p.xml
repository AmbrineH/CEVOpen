<p class="p">The absorption peaks at 3327 for CGPO microcapsule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3E</xref>) and 3321 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for DEET microcapsule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3F</xref>) indicated the presence of –OH group and N-H group from CMC and BKC, respectively (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). As seen, the stretching frequency of –OH (3280 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) in CMC and N-H group (3395 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) in BKC shifted to 3327 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for CGPO microcapsule and 3321 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>for the DEET microcapsule. Such shifting confirmed that there is a H bonding type interaction between CMC and BKC (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). The presence of new peaks at 1633 (CGPO microcapsule) and 1642 (DEET microcapsule) associated with the formation of –CONH- group which confirmed the formation of membrane around the microcapsule due to the electrostatic interaction between –COOH group of CMC and –NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> group of BKC (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Most of the characteristic peaks of CGPO and DEET could be observed in the spectrum of microcapsule with minor differences in frequencies indicating the successful incorporation of essential oil or DEET into the microcapsule and chemical stability of essential oil after encapsulation.
