<p class="p">TGA curve is used to access the thermal stability and study the weight changes of samples along with temperature. The thermal analysis of BKC, CMC, pure CGPO, microencapsulated CGPO, pure DEET, and microencapsulated DEET is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The TGA curve of BKC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>) presented one step of weight loss, began at 180 °C and completed at 300 °C. While the CMC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>) presented the multiple weight loss steps, the first weight loss (10%) due to evaporation of water began from 50 to 200 °C, the second weight loss (50%) around 200 – 220 °C attributed to the decarboxylation process, and the third weight loss (40%) observed in the range of 220 – 430 °C was related to the main chain decomposition of the cellulose and above 430 °C the CMC started to decompose (
