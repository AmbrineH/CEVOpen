<p class="p">The FTIR spectrum of CGPO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref>) showed typical bands related to the functional groups of the plant extracts (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). The absorption peaks at 3381 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were due the asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations in = CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The characteristic peaks present at 2923 and 2854 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were relative to the vibrations of aliphatic C-H stretching vibration in –CH
 <sub class="sub">3 </sub>and CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, respectively (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). The absorption peak at 1734 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was assigned to the C = O of saturated aliphatic ester (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>) and the scissor C-H bending vibration in = CH
 <sub class="sub">2 </sub>appeared at 1467 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> peak (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). While the symmetric C-H bending vibration in –CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was observed at 1374 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> peak. The absorption peaks at 962 and 586 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in CGPO represented the C-H bending of the alkene or the aromatic groups (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>).
