<p class="p">The strong and wide absorption peaks of CMC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>) at 3280 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>were attributed to the stretching frequency of the O-H group (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Two typical peaks for CMC were observed at 1590 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 1413 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> due to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration of the carboxyl (-COO
 <sup class="sup">-</sup>) group (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). The peaks at 2883 and 1323 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>were associated with the asymmetric –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and –OH stretching vibration, respectively. While the vibration located at 1028 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1 </sup>was attributed to C-O stretching vibration of the cellulose backbone of the CMC (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>).
