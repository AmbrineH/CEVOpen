<p class="p">γ-Oryzanol was first isolated in 1954 by Kaneko and Tsuchiya from the unsaponifiable fraction of rice bran as a crystalline substance; it is mainly composed of esters of trans-ferulic acid with phytosterols [

 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Among these, cycloartenol, β-sitosterol, 24-methylenecycloartenol, and campesterol predominate. Since then, γ-oryzanol has allowed for the identification of more than 20 ferulic acid esters of triterpene alcohols and sterols. For industrial procedures, soapstock is the richest source of γ-oryzanol, with the refining process used to prepare soapstock involving a deacidification treatment of rice bran oil [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. γ-Oryzanol has received considerable attention due to its numerous positive qualities, including the fact that it is anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective [

DHA was a popular nutritional with the consumer market in view of the clear evidence of the health benefits, including development of the eyes and brain, antihyperlipidemic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and antiarrhythmic effects [
 <xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The rate of DHA biosynthesis is low and insufficient to meet the physiological demands of humans, of which dietary intake is the primary source. Algae oil is a commercially successful alternative via microalgae fermentation, which has high amounts of DHA, shortens growth, and has good sensory and safety profiles [
