<p class="p">Ferulate, one of the functional groups in γ-oryzanol, provide antioxidative capacity, and enhance the stabilization of algae oil. Simultaneously, γ-oryzanol and algae oil lead synergistic effects on cardiovascular disease. The application of γ-oryzanol in medical and functional food systems may be limited by its low water solubility, poor bioavailability, and rapid metabolism. In this study, we designed a SEDDS for γ-oryzanol/algae oil, with alginate beads used as carriers. We then evaluated the release characteristics in the gastrointestinal tract of the γ-oryzanol/algae oil contained in the self-emulsified alginate beads (SEABs). More specifically, we measured its particle size, turbidity, γ-oryzanol amount, and antioxidant capacity.</p>
