<p class="p">The experimental results indicated that the γ-oryzanol/algae oil SEABs were prepared successfully through emulsification combined with gelation, which improved solubility for γ-oryzanol/algae oil and the liquid transformed into a solid. The pH responsivity of alginate prevented the release of γ-oryzanol/algae oil in the upper gastrointestinal tract, while subsequently allowing the emulsion formulation and release of γ-oryzanol upon the arrival of the beads in the intestinal fluid. The controlled release of SEABs was influenced by cross-linking them with alginate and emulsification treatment. Therefore, it can be suggested that SEABs constitute an effective delivery system for the oral administration of γ-oryzanol/algae oil. In the future, the SEAB production process and formulation parameters can be easily and successfully applied to various biologicals with a wide range of medical and pharmaceutical applications.</p>
