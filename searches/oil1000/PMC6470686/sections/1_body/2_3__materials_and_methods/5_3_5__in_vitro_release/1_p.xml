<p class="p">The SEABs were evaluated for in vitro drug release in simulated gastrointestinal fluids in accordance with previous research [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Simulated gastric fluid was prepared by adding 2 g NaCl and 6 mL 12 N HCl to 500 mL of distilled water, adjusting the pH to 1.2 by adding 0.01 M HCl, and then adding distilled water up to 1 L. The simulated intestinal fluid consisted of 0.2 M, pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The various forms of SEABs (0.2 g) were suspended in 100 mL of simulated gastric fluid for 2 h, and then transferred to 100 mL of simulated intestinal fluid for 4 h. The various forms of SEABs were placed in simulated gastric fluid (or simulated intestinal fluid) at a temperature of 37 °C and stirred with a paddle at under 50 rpm. In the simulated gastric fluid phase, we analyzed the γ-oryzanol content, DPPH scavenging, and turbidity at regular time intervals. In the simulated intestinal fluid phase, we analyzed the turbidity and droplet size.
