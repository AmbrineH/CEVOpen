<p class="p">Dynamic light scattering was used to determine the droplet sizes of the emulsions (Zetasizer Nano-ZS, Malvern, UK). The samples were diluted to a droplet concentration of approximately 1/10, with an appropriate buffer to prevent multiple scattering effects. The foundation of this technique is based on the scattering of light by moving particles due to Brownian motion in a liquid. The movement of the particles was then related to the size of the particles. Each recorded measurement was an average of eight runs. All the samples were measured at least in duplicate at 25 Â°C. The instrument reports the mean particle diameter (z-average), PDI range, and size distribution.</p>
