<p class="p">The DPPH radical-scavenging activity was detected using the same methods as in previous research [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The various forms of SEABs were extracted with isopropanol dissolved in an ethanol solution (0.2 mM) containing DPPH radicals. After shaking and incubation for 30 min, the sample was measured for UV absorbance at 517 nm. The absorbance of a sample (As), a control (where the sample was replaced with distilled water, Ac), and a blank (Ab) were measured by a spectrophotometer at 517 nm. The DPPH-scavenging activity was calculated with the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula"> DPPH − scavenging activity (%) = 1 − (As − Ab)/Ac × 100 </disp-formula>
