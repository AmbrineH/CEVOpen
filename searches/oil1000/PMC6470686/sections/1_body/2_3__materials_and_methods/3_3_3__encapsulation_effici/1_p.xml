<p class="p">In the next step, 200 mg of SEABs were ground in a mortar and dispersed with isopropanol (10 mL) in a volumetric flask, and then stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h. The solution was then filtered through a 0.45-mm filter. The γ-oryzanol content was determined using UV-visible spectrophotometry at 327 nm [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The drug-entrapment efficiency was determined using the following formula: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula"> Encapsulation efficiency (%) = γ-oryzanol in low-gelation alginate/γ-oryzanol in SEAB × 100 </disp-formula>
