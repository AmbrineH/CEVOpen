<p class="p">To prepare the γ-oryzanol/algae oil self-emulsion, γ-oryzanol (2.4 g) was first added to algal oil (60 mL), and the mixture was then stirred (400 rpm) until clear. Next, Tween 80 (24 g) and Span 80 (16 g) were added to the mixture. The γ-oryzanol SEABs were entrapped in calcium alginate (Ca–alginate) beads through ionotropic gelation in various compositions, as shown in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00156-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Specifically, 50 mL of alginate and γ-oryzanol self-emulsion were extruded through a coaxial bead generator (Unit-Varj1, Nisco Engineering AG, Switzerland) and then dripped into a calcium chloride gelling solution to form the γ-oryzanol self-emulsion, Ca–alginate beads. The tip of a needle was fixed at 10 cm above the surface of the gelling bath. The gelling solution was gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer (100 rpm) to prevent the beads from sticking together. After 30 min of bead formation in the gelling bath, the beads were collected by filtration and rinsed sequentially with distilled water and 95% ethanol.
