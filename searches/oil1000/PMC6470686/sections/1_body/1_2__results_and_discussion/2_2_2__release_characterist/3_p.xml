<p class="p">When placed in simulated intestinal fluid, each form of the SEAB exhibited signs of swelling and erosion. Meanwhile, the aqueous environment produced a reconstituted emulsion of the γ-oryzanol/algae oil self-emulsion. The γ-oryzanol was solubilized in the oily core and on the interface of the emulsion structures [

 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The turbidity of the intestinal fluid corresponded with the emulsion formed from the SEAB. At 50 min after being placed in the simulated intestinal fluid, the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% SEABs caused turbidity levels of 14.8%, 14.3%, 22.5%, 40.3%, and 62.0%, respectively. At 100 min, those levels were 33.2%, 37.1%, 51.2%, 71.7%, and 90.15%, respectively. At 125 min, they were 50.1%, 61.9%, 71.2%, 90.4%, and 98.1%, respectively. We found that the release of 5% and 10% SEABs at 100 min was lower than 50% because of the strong network leading to strong gelation (

These particles exhibited a bimodal distribution, with a population of small droplets of approximately 129~215 nm in size and a population of large droplets of approximately 750~1916 nm in size (

At sufficiently low hydrogel concentrations, agglutination between oppositely charged biopolymers and emulsion droplets occurred, leading to the formation of large aggregates. When fluid secretion and peristalsis occurred, the large droplets in the simulated intestinal fluid were transformed into small droplets, the γ-oryzanol had to be hydrolyzed enzymatically from the large droplets, and its emulsification enhanced its enzyme affinity [
