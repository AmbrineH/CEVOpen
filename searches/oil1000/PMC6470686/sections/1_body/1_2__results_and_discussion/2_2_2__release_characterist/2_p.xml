Due to the presence of the phenolic acids in its composition, its anti-ulcer and anti-inflammatory intestinal effects are a matter of great interest. In this study, we analyzed the γ-oryzanol release and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging of the SEAB when it was placed in simulated stomach fluid and found that the various forms of SEABs provide similar levels of protection to γ-oryzanol, given that the differences in γ-oryzanol release are not significant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00156-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Initially, the DPPH scavenging levels of the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% SEABs were 9.7%, 15.1%, 26.0%, 20.7%, and 35.81%, respectively. When placed in the simulated stomach fluid, the DPPH scavenging levels increased, reaching their highest levels at 80 min, with those levels being 33.0%, 35.9%, 40.1%, 41.9%, and 47.7%, respectively, and then decreasing thereafter (

 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. We found that the SEAB, the protection of the γ-oryzanol amount, was not consistent with DPPH scavenging. We expect that this is a reversible change of γ-oryzanol, attributable to the constitution of simulated stomach fluid. Simultaneously, we observed that in the simulated gastric fluid, γ-oryzanol was not detected and the emulsion was formed (data not shown).
