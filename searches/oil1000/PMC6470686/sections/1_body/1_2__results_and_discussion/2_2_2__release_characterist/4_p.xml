<p class="p">The pH responsivity of alginates is high because alginates are molecular polymers that undergo volume or phase transition when the pH value of the external environment changes. As the test results of the SEABs indicated (

In the second phase, meanwhile, we observed a burst-like release pattern, because Tween is a non-ionic substance that has a relatively weak interaction with anionic biopolymer molecules [
