<p class="p">The encapsulation, expressed as the percentage of encapsulated γ-oryzanol/algae oil relative to the self-emulsion used, decreased as alginate concentration increased. We found that γ-oryzanol/algae oil encapsulation levels of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% SEABs were 98.93%, 73.04%, 68.73%, 66.73%, and 60.20%, respectively (

This may be attributable to an increase in the viscosity of the continuous phase surrounding the oil droplets, thus restricting their movement, or the adsorption/precipitation of the gum in the oil–water interphase causing a reduction in interfacial tension [
