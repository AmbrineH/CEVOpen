<p class="p">Some studies have indicated that alginate-based beads are characterized by a porous and collapsed structure, and a clear ridge structure indicates strong gelation [

The use of calcium chloride with alginate leads to the cross-linking and aggregation of alginate, where the exchange of divalent ions of calcium during the reticulation process is responsible for the creation of a strong network, leading to a very strong matrix [

When hydrogel encapsulates a hydrophobic substance, tiny grains can be found on the surface of the resulting particles. However, if a surfactant is also used, the grains have a smoother surface. These characteristics are caused by the sublimation of water crystals from the freeze-dried alginate matrix, resulting in void spaces and minor structural shrinkage. The difference in the treatment of surfactant shown in
