<p class="p">Oil was one of the essential excipients in the SEDDS formulation, not only because it can solubilize marked amounts of γ-oryzanol and facilitate self-emulsification, but also, and primarily, because it can increase the fraction of γ-oryzanol transported via the intestinal lymphatic system, thereby increasing its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In this study, the γ-oryzanol containing SEABs comprised 60% algal oil (which contained 40 mg of γ-oryzanol per mL), 24% Tween 80, and 16% Span 80. We used algal oil because it provides the most “natural and functional” basis for excipients. In our previous studies, the n-3 PUFA of algal oil was 30.3 g/100 g, and they have excellent oxidative stability (Ea: 96.8 kj/mol) [

In addition, they are more compatible with biological systems and less affected by pH and ionic strength. γ-Oryzanol/algae oil self-emulsion was assessed using the self-emulsification test, the results of which indicated that the spontaneity, homogeneity, and dispersibility of the self-emulsion were good. The appearance of the emulsion formulation was milky, while the z-average and polydispersity index (PDI) of the droplets were 149 nm and 0.246 (data not shown).
