<p class="p">Alginates are naturally occurring substances that can be considered a form of block polymer, which mainly consist of mannuronic acid, guluronic acid, and mannuronic–guluronic blocks. The dropwise addition of aqueous alginate solution to an aqueous solution containing calcium ions and/or other di- and polyvalent cations causes the formation of gel in a spherical shape, termed “an alginate bead,” and such beads have been widely used as drug carriers for oral administration [

The alginate bead formation of 5~10% SEABs with varying ratios of γ-oryzanol self-emulsion resulted in spherical shapes with a narrow size distribution. When a higher load of γ-oryzanol/algae oil self-emulsion (&gt;15%) was used, the tail became more distinct because of extrusion dripping (

The results resembled those reported by other studies, where varying ratios of hydrogel to oil resulted in spherical, pear-shaped beads by reductions of interfacial tension, whereas tear-shaped beads, as well as spherical beads, formed with the lowest surface/volume ratio that were beneficial to the diffused compounds [
