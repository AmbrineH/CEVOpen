<p class="p">The identification of the essential oil constituents was based on the comparison of their Kovats retention indices (RIs), determined relative to the tR values of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>–C
 <sub class="sub">35</sub>) with either those of the literature [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and mass spectra on both columns with those of authentic compounds available in our laboratories by means NIST 02 and Wiley 275 mass spectral libraries [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The components’ relative concentrations were obtained by peak area normalization. No response factors were calculated.
