<p class="p">The possible antifungal activity of the essential oil and 1,8-cineole was tested against four fungal tester strains of agro-food interest, Aspergillus versicolor DSM 1943, Penicillium expansum DSM 1994, Penicillium citrinum DSMZ 1179, and Aspergillus niger DSM 1957 following the method of Marrufo and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The strains were purchased from DSMZ. They were grown in potato dextrose broth (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) at 28 °C. A cell suspension of fungi was prepared in sterile distilled water, adjusted to contain approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL, and plated onto potato dextrose agar. After 30 min under sterile conditions, the inoculated plates were spotted with different amount of the samples, previously diluted 1:10 (

When the mycelium of fungi reached the edges of the control plate (negative control without the samples added), the diameter of the clear zone shown on plates (inhibition halo zone) was accurately measured (“Extra steel Caliper mod 0289”, mm/inch reading scale, precision 0.05 mm, Mario De Maio, Milano, Italy); DMSO was used as negative control (10 μL/paper disc). The antifungal activity was expressed in mm. Samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
