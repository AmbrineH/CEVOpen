<p class="p">The inhibition halo test was performed in order to evaluate the potential antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> essential oil and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> DMS 8579 and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 50071, and the Gram positive 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> DSM 4313, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> 4384 and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> DSM 25693 were the bacterial strains tested in this study. Bacteria were purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ). Nutrient broth (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) was used as medium of bacterial growth at 37 °C for 18 h. The optical densities of all cultures were adjusted to match a 0.5 McFarland standard of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and spread onto Nutrient agar plates. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> as well as the pure component 1,8-cineole were re-suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and then diluted to be subjected to biological analyses. Sterile filter paper discs (5 mm) were impregnated with volumes corresponding to 0.4, 1 and 2 µL of the essential oil and placed on the plates. These last were left for 30 min at room temperature under sterile conditions before their incubation at 37 °C for 24 h; the diameter of the clear zone shown on plates (inhibition halo zone) was accurately measured (“Extra steel Caliper mod 0289”, mm/inch reading scale, precision 0.05 mm, Mario De Maio, Milan, Italy). A disc treated with DMSO alone served as the negative control. Tetracycline (7 µg/disc; Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) was used as reference drugs. The experiments were performed in triplicate and averaged.
