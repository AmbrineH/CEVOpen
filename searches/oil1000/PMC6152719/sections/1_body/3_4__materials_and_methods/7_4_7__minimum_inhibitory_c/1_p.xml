<p class="p">A modified version of the resazurin microtitre-plate assay [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentration of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> essential oil and 1,8-cineole. Briefly, different volumes of the test material—prepared as described above—were pipetted in a multi-well with different volumes of Muller-Hinton broth (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy). Two fold serial dilutions were performed such that each well had 50 μL of the test material in serially descending concentrations. 30 μL of 3.3 × strength isosensitised broth (Sigma Aldrich) and 5 μL of resazurin indicator solution (previously prepared by dissolving 270 mg tablet purchased from Sigma Aldrich, in 40 mL of sterile distilled water) were added in each well, to reach a final volume/well of 240 µL. Finally, 10 μL of bacterial suspension was added to each well to achieve a concentration of approx. 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL. Ciprofloxacin (3 µM in DMSO, Sigma Aldrich) and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Plates were prepared in triplicate, wrapped with cling film to avoid the bacterial dehydration, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration at which a colour change (visually assessed from blu/dark purple to pink, or colorless) occurred indicated the MIC value.
