<p class="p">The essential oil showed significant antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms as early as the lesser amount used in the test (0.4 µL), giving inhibition zones between 6.33 and 8.66 mm. Such results were particularly appealing, as far as we are concerned, considering the zone of inhibition produced by tetracycline. In fact, the diameters of inhibition produced by 0.4 µL of the essential oil resulted in two cases almost equal (versus 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>) or even superior (versus 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>) to that produced by tetracycline. It should be also emphasized that 1 and 2 µL of essential oil resulted in a sensitivity by all the tester strains superior to that given by their contact with tetracycline, giving zones of inhibition between 13.33 and 18 mm. 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> 4313 turned out the most sensitive organism among those tested, and it was also more sensitive if compared the other strain of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> used in the assay.
