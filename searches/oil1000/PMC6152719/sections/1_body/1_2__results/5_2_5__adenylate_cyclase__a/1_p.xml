<p class="p">We investigated the effects of 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> essential oil in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Representative Western blots and quantitative densitometry for adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) protein expression in SH-SY5Y following exposure to different concentrations of 1,8-cineole and the essential oil are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-00930-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Treatments of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with 1,8-cineole had no influence on ADCY1 expression (Panel A), whereas a treatment with 200 and 100 Âµg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> essential oil for 24 h significantly reduced ADCY1 expression (Panel B).
