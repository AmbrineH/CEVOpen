<p class="p">The cytotoxic activity of the 1,8-cineole and the essential oil were evaluated in human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were &gt; 400 µg/mL, indicating that the substances were not cytotoxic, as judged by the criterion set by the National Cancer Institute, that stated that only natural substances with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &lt; 20 µg/mL were considered to be cytotoxic against the treated cells [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, comparing the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, our findings indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> EO is more cytotoxic than 1,8-cineole. This cytotoxicity can be probably attributed to a synergistic activity of this and other components.
