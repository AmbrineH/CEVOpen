<p class="p">The comparison with most recent literature concerning the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> from other Mediterranean areas, showed substantial differences: 1,8-cineole percentage found (31.9%) is lower than the values recorded in other studies: Turkey 44.97% [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], Tunisia 56.0% [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], Cyprus 58.59% [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], Morocco 52.43% [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], but similar to Algerian essential oil (34.62%) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In our sample, the amount of sabinene was 12.2%, higher than in the essential oils analyzed by Derwich and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], Snuossi and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], and Yalcin [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] who found percentages of sabinene of 6.13, 3.5, and 6.13%, respectively. Linalool was found in concentrations comparable to previous studies [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] but in essential oil analyzed by Derwick and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] linalool was not found.
