<p class="p">Essential oils have been used for centuries as a traditional medicine, and currently used worldwide in the management of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders but there is very little verified science behind their use [

 <xref rid="B1-molecules-22-00930" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], we investigated the possible influence of the essential oil and its major components on ADCY1 expression. Our results showed that the treatment with 200 and 100 Âµg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">L. nobilis</italic> essential oil reduced ADCY1 expression in SH-SY5Y cell and, consequently, the intracellular production of cAMP. 1,8-Cineole had no effect on ADCY1 expression but we hypothesized that the essential oil effect is due to the presence of linalool (10.2%). Elisabetsky and coworkers showed that linalool possesses dose-dependent sedative effects in the Central Nervous System [
