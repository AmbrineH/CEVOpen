 <p> Cell viability calculated as percentage after MTT assay. Cells were treated with different concentrations (1600–50 µg/mL) of 1,8-cineole ( A) and L. nobilis essential oil ( B), for 24 h and solvent (DMSO, 0.1%) alone. Data are the mean ± SD of three experiments ** p &lt; 0.01, **** p &lt; 0.0001 vs. DMSO. </p>
