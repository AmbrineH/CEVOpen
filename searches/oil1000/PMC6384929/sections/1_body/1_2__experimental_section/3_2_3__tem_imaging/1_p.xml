<p class="p">The morphology of the prepared vesicles was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, which were obtained on a JEOL-2100 UHR electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. In details, lipid vesicles at a concentration of 6 mg/mL were dropped on a 300-mesh copper grid. After incubation for 5 min, the excess solution was removed with filter pater. Then the grids were negatively stained with uranyl acetate (2%, w/v) aqueous solution for about 5 min. Freeze-fraction TEM was employed to analyze the morphology of lipid vesicles. A small amount of the vesicle solution was placed on a specimen holder, being frozen by quickly plunging the specimen holder into liquid ethane cooled using liquid nitrogen. Fracturing and replication were carried out on a freeze-fracture apparatus (EM BAF 060, Leica, Germany) at −140 °C. Pt/C was deposited at an angle of 45°. The replicas were transferred onto copper grid and then examined using a JEOL JEM-1400 TEM (JEOL, MA, USA) at 120 kV. More details of the method of vesicle characterization were described in our previous work [
