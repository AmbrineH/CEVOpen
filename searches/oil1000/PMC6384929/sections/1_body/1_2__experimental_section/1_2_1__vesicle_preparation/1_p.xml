<p class="p">Three types of lipids, including POPC, POPG and DOPC, were purchased from Avanti Phospholipid (Avanti, AL, USA). Shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00349-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> is the molecular structure of each lipid type. Compared with POPC and POPG molecules, each of which contains one unsaturated tail bond, the DOPC molecule has two unsaturated bonds. Compared with POPC and DOPC molecules, both of which have no electric charge, the POPG molecule has a negative charge. We can observe the orientation of bR in mimic membranes in term of comparing their similarities and differences. The detailed process of vesicle preparation is given elsewhere and briefly described as follows [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. First, lipids dissolved in chloroform were evaporated in vacuum for 20 min and dried overnight. Phosphate buffer was then added to obtain the multilayer lipid aggregates. Subsequently, the lipid solution was extruded 30 times through a membrane with a specified diameter to obtain lipid vesicles with a defined concentration of 6 mg/mL in phosphate buffer.
