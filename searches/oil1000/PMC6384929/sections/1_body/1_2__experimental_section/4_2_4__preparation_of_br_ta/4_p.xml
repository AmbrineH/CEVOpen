<p class="p">In the reconstitution of unfolded bR with vesicles, bR was first unfolded with 0.3% SDS. The unfolded bR was then mixed with vesicle solution with volume ratio of 1:10, corresponding to a final SDS concentration of 0.03%, where bR can refold. According to our experiments, at this SDS concentration, the vesicles are stable (
