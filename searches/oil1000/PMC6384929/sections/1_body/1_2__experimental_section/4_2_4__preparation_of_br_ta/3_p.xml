<p class="p">We note that earlier experiments reported that detergents were applied in the reconstitution of TMPs with lipid vesicles. However, our present experiments suggest that detergents are not required for reconstitution of bR with vesicles. Instead, bR purified from 
 <italic class="italic">halobacterium</italic> could be reconstituted into different lipid bilayers through a very simple and efficient way. We used the sucrose density gradient centrifugation to determine the efficiency of membrane protein reconstitution (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-00349" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>). It was found that all the bR proteins were successfully reconstituted into vesicles by direct mixing. Here, the direct reconstitution without detergent may be due to the existence of residual amount of lipids from purple membrane, where bR was purified from.
