<p class="p">The bR labeled with TAMRA was then added into the vesicle solution to get recombination with membranes. To acquire the proportion of labeled bR being inserted into mimic membranes, we detected the fluorescence anisotropy value on a FluoroMax-4 fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Kyoto, Japan). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 540 nm and 576 nm, the slits of which were 4 nm and 3 nm, respectively. In fluorescence anisotropy experiments, the vertically and horizontally polarized emission intensities were background-corrected with a blank containing the lipid vesicle suspension as a reference.</p>
