<p class="p">bR was first purified from 
 <italic class="italic">Halobacterium salinarum</italic> using the method developed by Oesterhelt et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] The purified bR with a concentration of 1 mg/mL was then labeled with TAMRA on its N-terminus. We note that a number of lysines exist in the protein sequence, which provides amino groups for TAMRA labeling. However, it has been known that different types of amines can be selectively labeled by controlling the reaction conditions. For example, by decreasing the pH value to 6.4, the succinimidyl ester group could react preferentially with the N-terminal amines rather than the primary amines [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In detail, the buffer was exchanged into the 100 mM phosphate buffer with a pH value of 6.4 and a salt (NaCl) concentration of 100 mM. Then TAMRA dissolved in buffer was added into the protein solution, which was incubated for 1h with stirring and covered with aluminum foil. TAMRA was removed by size exclusion chromatography immediately after being quenched with 1 M Tris buffer (Tris-HCl and Tris base). After that, the TAMRA labeled bR was further characterized using uv-vis and fluorescence spectrophotometry and the labeling sites of bR were identified using tryptic-digested mass spectrum analysis [
