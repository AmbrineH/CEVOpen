<p class="p">The size distribution of the prepared lipid vesicles was measured by means of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Systems, Southborough, MA, USA). The DLS measures Brownian motion and relates it to the size of the lipid vesicles. The instrument uses a 633 nm wavelength laser beam and detects the light signal at an angle of 173Â°.</p>
