It is composed of seven Î± helices and displays purple color in solution due to the presence of retinal that binds through a Schiff base to lysine-216 locating at the last helix. It has 248 amino acid residues with N- and C-termini pointing to opposite sides of the membrane. Previous studies have successfully captured the intermediate state in both folding and unfolding processes of bR, facilitating our understanding on membrane protein folding [

 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In the presence of translocon in vivo, natural bR correctly inserts into membranes, leaving the N-terminus pointing to the cell exterior. However, the question of whether bR is inserted into the membrane in folded or unfolded state still remains unclear, even controversial [
