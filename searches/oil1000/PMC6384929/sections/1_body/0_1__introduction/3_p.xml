<p class="p">During in vitro experiments, construction of applicable mimic membranes is requisite for exploring folding, inserting and orientating of TMPs in the membrane [

With phospholipid as the major component, they can spontaneously assemble into different morphologies, like micelles, bilayers, vesicles and tubes. Specifically, lipid vesicle is an ideal model membrane platform for exploring insertion, especially the orientation of TMPs in the membrane, because the interior of vesicles can be easily distinguished from the exterior to identify the orientation of TMPs. This property can be well utilized by the experimental method of fluorescence quenching titration (FQT) [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The FQT method is based on the use of TAMRA, a fluorescent molecule with high extinction coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], acting as a fluorescent probe and a free soluble tryptophan zwitterion as a quencher. Note that the free soluble tryptophan zwitterion cannot penetrate through the membrane, thus only quenching fluorescence of TAMRA exposed outside the vesicle. By premixing SDS to denature bR before membrane insertion, the membrane orientations of bR in folded and unfolded states can be compared, thus helping answer whether and how the folding state of bR affects its orientation in mimic membranes and implying whether bR could be inserted into membranes in folded or unfolded state.
