<p class="p">The folding mechanism of water-soluble proteins has been investigated for decades and relatively well understood [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], whereas folding of membrane proteins still remains ambiguous [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], not only because of the lower protein concentration in membranes restraining protein extraction and purification but also due to the difficulty of reconstituting purified proteins with membranes [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Besides folding, inserting proteins into plasma membranes is an equally fundamental biophysical process [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. During in vitro experiments, acquiring stable membrane-protein structures with defined orientation of proteins in membranes is of essential importance ensuring biological activities of the product. This is trivial in vivo because both folding and inserting of proteins are intelligently and efficiently assisted by a number of cofactors, such as translocon and molecular chaperone [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In the absence of cofactors, such as during in vitro recombination experiments, both insertion and orientation of proteins are expected to be mainly determined by their interactions with the membrane. However, the knowledge on how TMPs orientate in mimic membranes is still lacking.
