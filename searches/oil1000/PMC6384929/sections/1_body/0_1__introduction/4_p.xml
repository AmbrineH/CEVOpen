<p class="p">Briefly, our experimental results demonstrate that bR can be readily inserted into mimic membranes in preferred orientations and the orientation can be modulated by varying environmental conditions. Among all considered factors, changing the lipid composition is the most capable of regulating the orientation of bR in mimic membranes. Other factors, including pH value, ionic strength and membrane curvature, were found to play secondary or minor roles in orientating bR in membranes. Experiments with denatured bR demonstrate that TMPs could be inserted into membranes in the unfolded state and complete folding inside the membrane without the assistance of cofactors in vitro.</p>
