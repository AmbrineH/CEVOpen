<p class="p">However, above analysis does not interpret why more N termini of bR were inserted into the POPC vesicles, since there are nearly no electrostatic interactions between each terminus of bR and the POPC membrane. We assumed that increasing contact of C termini with the neutrally charged POPC membrane could induce strong electrostatic repulsion between C termini of adjacent bR proteins, thus hindering their contact and insertion into the membrane. By contrast, the N terminus of bR has nearly no net charge (
