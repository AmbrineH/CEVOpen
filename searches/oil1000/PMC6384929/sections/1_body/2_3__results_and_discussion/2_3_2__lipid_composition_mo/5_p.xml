<p class="p">There are some properties of the composition of lipid, such as the charge of the lipid, the length of hydrophobic alkyl chain and unsaturation which decide the assembly potential, thickness and curvature of mimic membranes. Whatâ€™s more, these properties of lipid have an impact on orientation, folding, structure and function of membrane proteins in the mimic membrane. Compared with POPC and POPG molecules (16:0, 18:1), the length of two hydrophobic alkyl chain of the DOPC molecule are 18. Membrane protein will insert into membrane bilayers at high inclination angles with the decrease in thickness of membrane, to make up the insufficient of thickness of hydrophobic environment. Besides, compared with POPC and POPG molecules, each of which contains one unsaturated tail bond, the DOPC molecule has two unsaturated bonds, thus making it more flexible and the membrane more fluidic and permeable than the other two types of lipid vesicles. It has been convincingly proved by experiments that higher fluidity and permeability could more easily generate lipid defects on membranes [

Our experimental data support this analysis that no apparent selectivity of orientation of bR in DOPC vesicles was observed. Besides, the inherent structural asymmetry between two termini of bR should have minor effect on its orientation in the membrane.
