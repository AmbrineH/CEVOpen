<p class="p">According to Equation (2) (see the Experimental section), calculating the orientation distribution of bR requires the value of 
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">q</sub>
 </italic>. We thus first performed FQT experiments in the absence of lipid vesicles. The linear ratio between 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> and [
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>] is given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-00349" class="xref">Figure S4</xref>. By fitting the quenching data, the quenching constant (
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">q</sub>
 </italic>) was determined to be 1.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> M
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. After that, we reconstituted TAMRA-bR into POPC, POPG and DOPC vesicles. The detected values of 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> as a function of [
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>] are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00349-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. By fitting the quenching data using Equation (2), we obtained the value of 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> to be 0.64, 0.41 and 0.52 respectively. Note that single experiment cannot rigorously suggest the preferential orientation of bR in lipid vesicles. We thus repeated multiple titration experiments to determine the average value of 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>. Importantly, similar results were obtained by repeating multiple experiments, with the error being ignored to suggest that bR preferentially inserts its N terminus into the POPC membrane (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.63 ± 0.02), whereas more C termini were inserted into membranes composed of POPG molecules (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.40 ± 0.01). The value of 0.53 ± 0.01 indicates that bR has no preferential orientation in DOPC membranes.
