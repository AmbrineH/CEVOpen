<p class="p">Essentially, why simply changing the lipid component could generate such distinct orientation of bR in the membrane? In the absence of translocon, both insertion and orientation of bR should be solely determined by their interactions with the membrane. Our previous molecular dynamics simulations on insertion of transmembrane peptides into membranes suggested that the first stage of membrane attachment is driven by the electrostatic interactions, whereas the subsequent insertion is synergistically or competitively affected by both the electrostatic interaction and the hydrophobic interaction [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00349-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), the membrane surface charge apparently plays a dominant role in regulating the insertion and orientation of bR in the membrane. Specifically, each POPG molecule has one negative charge, while POPC is electroneutral. Shown in

 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. It appears that the region near the C terminus of bR has many positive charges, whereas the side of N terminus is nearly electroneutral. It is thus expected that the positively charged C termini of bR should be preferentially attracted toward the POPG membrane, accordingly having a higher probability to be inserted into the membrane driven by hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues of bR and lipid tails. Such explanation is consistent with our previous simulations and fits our experimental finding that more C termini of bR point inside the POPG vesicles (
