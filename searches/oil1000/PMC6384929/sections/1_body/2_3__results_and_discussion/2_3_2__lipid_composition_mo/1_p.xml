<p class="p">Before conducting the FQT experiments, three possible orientations of bR in mimic membranes were presumed to exist. As described above, our FQT experiments were based on the fact that the fluorescence of TAMRA can be efficiently quenched by free soluble tryptophan zwitterion, which could not penetrate through the membrane to quench fluorescence of the TAMRA being inserted into vesicles. Since only the N-terminus of bR was labeled with TAMRA, theoretically, the final orientation of bR being inserted into mimic membranes can be identified by the fluorescence intensity after adding the quencher. If all C termini are inserted into the vesicle, leaving N termini exposed outside the vesicle, the fluorescence intensity should be effectively reduced upon increasing the free tryptophan concentration. Conversely, the fluorescence intensity will be nearly unchanged if all N termini are inserted into the vesicle. More generally, the fluorescence intensity could be partially reduced by the quencher, suggesting that a proportion of N termini are inserted into vesicles.</p>
