<p class="p">To date, an important question of whether TMPs insert themselves into the membrane in folded or unfolded state is still not well understood. In one pathway, the nascent peptide chains first fold being assisted by the molecular chaperone [

Discriminating these two mechanisms requires systematic investigations on interactions between membranes and proteins in different folding states. Here, our established method determining orientation of bR in mimic membranes may provide a clue to help answer this question by comparing orientations of bR proteins in folded and unfolded states. Before recombination with the POPC vesicles, 0.3% of SDS was added to denature bR. The denatured bR was then mixed with POPC vesicles and the SDS was diluted down to 0.03%, where bR can refold. In our previous work, it was shown that the folding of bR took 2 h, while this work shows that the insertion of bR into the vesicles need only 9 min. This demonstrate that unfolded bR can insert into the vesicles and refold wherein (

Note that there exists evidence suggesting that the SDS-denatured bR probably still contains four transmembrane helices and the covalent bond between retinal and lysine cannot be effectively broken by SDS [

 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Therefore, SDS could only partially induce the conformational change of bR, which may refold under diluted concentration of SDS. Nevertheless, our results point to an important indication that bR proteins could be inserted into membranes in the fully or partially unfolded state and complete folding inside the membrane.
