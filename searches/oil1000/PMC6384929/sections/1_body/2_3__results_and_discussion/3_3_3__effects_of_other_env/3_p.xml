<p class="p">Similar results were observed for the effect of the pH value, being another environmental factor that potentially influences interactions between bR and lipid membranes. We have shown that, under pH value of about 7.0, POPC vesicles preferentially permit bR to insert its N terminus into the vesicles (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.63 ± 0.02), while the POPG membrane attracts positively charged C terminus of bR to be inserted into the vesicles (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.40 ± 0.01). Similar with the effect of the ionic strength, the electrostatic interactions between bR and the membrane can be shielded under both acidic and alkaline conditions. As expected, we observed that the preference of orientation of bR in membranes for both lipid types became less obvious (
