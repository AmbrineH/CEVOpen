<p class="p">Having analyzed that the final orientation of bR in membranes is determined by the electrostatic interactions, not only between the positively charged C terminus of bR and negatively charged lipid headgroups but also between C termini of different bRs, it can be expected that the ionic strength could modulate the orientation by influencing the electrostatic interactions. Here, for both POPC and POPG membranes, three ionic strengths (10 mM, 50 mM and 250 mM) were used to compare the orientation of bR in membranes. Since POPC molecule has no net charge on its headgroup, increasing ionic strength from 10 mM to 50 mM and 250 mM was found to have insignificant effect on the orientation, considering the measuring error (

For POPG vesicles, it was found that increasing the ionic strength could decrease the preference of C terminus of bR being inserted into vesicles. This was expected because the preference of C terminus pointing inside the POPG vesicle is ascribed to the coulomb attraction between the positively charged C terminus and the negatively charged POPG headgroup (
