<p class="p">During in vitro experiments of membrane-protein interactions, membrane curvature is expected to be an important factor influencing the interactions by changing the bending stress or surface tension of membranes. Theoretically, smaller vesicles having larger curvatures are under larger bending stress that facilitates insertion of membrane proteins. Our experiments also demonstrated that under the same concentration of lipid vesicles, more bR proteins were found to be inserted into vesicles with smaller size. However, by using vesicles of two diameters (50 nm and 100 nm), no obvious change of orientation of bR in membranes was observed (

Nevertheless, elucidating effect of the membrane curvature on orientation of TMPs requires more experimental data using vesicles with wider size distribution and other types of TMPs and this will be pursued in our future work.
