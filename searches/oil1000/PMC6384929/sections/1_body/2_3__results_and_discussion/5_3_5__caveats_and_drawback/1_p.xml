<p class="p">It should be noted that although our FQT experiments provide insight into determining orientation of TMPs in mimic membranes, it is worth putting a caveat on these results. First, the optimal concentrations of bR and mimic membranes were determined ensuring saturate incorporation of bR into lipid vesicles (

However, we cannot strictly exclude the possibility that more or less bR molecules are not incorporated into or dissociated from the membrane, due to thermal fluctuations, thus being exposed outside the vesicle to be easily quenched by tryptophan. This effect should be insignificant because incorporation of TMPs into membranes is always driven by favorable interactions. Second, our analysis of the FQT data is based on the hypothesis that TMPs including bR incorporated into lipid vesicles adopt two possible orientations inside the membrane, that is, either C or N terminus of bR is inserted into vesicles, leaving the other terminus exposed outside the vesicle. However, there may exist another case that bR locates in parallel with the membrane plane to expose both termini outside the vesicle. This case is rare because the transmembrane state of bR is much more energetically favorable than other orientations. Third, even if only the C terminus of bR is inserted into membranes, the N-terminal TAMRA might be occasionally immersed into head-groups of lipids to avoid quenching by tryptophan. Our joint experimental and simulation study revealed that both termini of TMPs inserted into membranes are frequently exposed to get contact with molecules outside the membrane [

Also since SDS is a detergent, in this study SDS was used as defolding agent, which would be expected to influence the lipid properties. According to our previous study, there is not observable change in the size of lipid vesicles in the presence of SDS up to 0.3% (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-00349" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>), which suggests that the lipid vesicles are stable with the addition of SDS. Under the working conditions in this work, the concentration of SDS is 0.03%, which is not expected to destroy the vesicles. All these cases, despite rare or having minor effects, should be considered comprehensively with caution before determining orientation of any TMP in mimic membranes.
