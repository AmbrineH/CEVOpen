<p class="p">For determining the orientation of bR in mimic membranes using the FQT method, the purified bR was labeled with TAMRA only on its N-terminus. We note that a number of lysines exist in the protein sequence, which provides primary amino groups for TAMRA labeling. To probe whether bR has been successfully labeled with TAMRA, we detected the fluorescence spectra and UV-Vis absorption spectra of the product. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00349-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the fluorescence emission peak at 576 nm and the characteristic absorption peak at 560 nm both prove that bR has been successfully labeled with TAMRA. To exclude the unexpected fluorescence labeling on lysines, the pH value of reaction buffer was strictly set as 6.4 [
