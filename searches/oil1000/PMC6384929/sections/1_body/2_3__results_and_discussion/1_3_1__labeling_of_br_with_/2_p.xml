<p class="p">After that, we measured the fluorescence anisotropy of the TAMRA-bR incorporated with lipid vesicles of increasing concentration to obtain the molar ratio of complete reconstitution. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00349-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the value of fluorescence anisotropy was below 0.2 without lipid vesicles, considering the influence of existing surfactants. As we gradually increased the concentration of lipid vesicles, more TAMRA-bRs were incorporated into the vesicles, thus increasing the value of anisotropy, until all TARMA-bRs were incorporated into the vesicles when the ratio between proteins and lipids was larger than 4:3. We thus obtained the optimal concentration of bR to be 4 Î¼M and that of mimic membranes to be 3 mg/mL.
