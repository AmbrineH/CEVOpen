<p class="p">In summary, we have used fluorescence quenching titration experiment to determine the orientation of a model transmembrane protein (TMP), namely bR, in mimic membranes. By using different lipid components, our results suggest that electrostatic interactions between charged residues of TMPs and lipid headgroups critically determine which terminus is first captured by the membrane, thereby having a higher probability to be inserted into the membrane, though further insertion could be influenced by other factors, such as hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues and lipid tails [

It is found that such critical electrostatic interactions can be somewhat shielded by increasing the ionic strength or changing the pH value of solvent. By changing the vesicle size as a modulator of membrane curvature, no obvious change of orientation was observed. Finally, we compared orientations of bR in mimic membranes with and without SDS, finding that bR can be inserted into membranes in both folded and unfolded states. This observation concurs with other findings to support the idea that similar TMPs could be inserted into membranes in the unfolded state and subsequently fold into the native state inside the membrane. Our results in line with previous research that natural bR correctly inserts its C-terminus into membranes, leaving the N-terminus pointing to the cell exterior in vivo. Inspired by this research, future research on modulating orientations of other TMPs in membranes is required to further understand what internal and external factors cooperatively or competitively impact orientation of TMPs in membranes. These results would promote wide in vitro applications of TMPs in different areas of science and technology, such as biosensor and drug delivery.
