(A) bR from Halobacterium salinarium; (B) The constitution method by mixing bR with POPC vesicles, Figure S2: Size distribution of POPC vesicles (100 nm) at different SDS concentration, Figure S3: Enzyme-digested mass spectrometry analysis of bR after TAMRA labeling. The experiments were performed as described in the supplementary methods at the National Facility for Protein Science of Shanghai. The protein was digested with Trypsin (R/K cleavage specificity) and Chymotrypsin, respectively. The latter is a serine endoproteinase that specifically cleaves peptide bonds at the C-termini of Tyr, Phe, Trp and Leu. Met, Ala, Asp and Glu may be cleaved at a much lower rate. All the digested peptides were then analyzed with Mass spectrum. The identified amino acids are highlighted in grey and the identified peptides are listed as the blue lines underneath. The experiments were carried out for three times and the results show that more than 98% of the intramolecular lysines were covered and recognized and no intramolecular lysine labeling was detected.
