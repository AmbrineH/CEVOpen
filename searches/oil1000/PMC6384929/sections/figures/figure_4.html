 <p> The fluorescence anisotropy of TAMRA-bR incorporated in an increasing concentration of lipid vesicles. Three types of lipids were used, including POPC ( a); POPG ( b) and DOPC ( c), the 50 nm and 100 nm indicate the size of mimic membrane. We have conducted a systematic study of the concentration of phospholipids impact on the scattered light of mimic membranes in our early studies and obtained the optimal concentration of bR to be 4 ÂµM and the mimic membranes to be 3 mg/mL. </p>
