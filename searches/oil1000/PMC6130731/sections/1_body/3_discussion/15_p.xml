<p class="p">In their research, Singh et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) observed that α-pinene increased the conductivity levels in the membrane, indicating that it caused stress which resulted in the rupture of the membrane integrity. Harrewijn et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) have suggested that membrane rupture is one of the mechanisms responsible for the antifungal and antibacterial activity of monoterpenoids.
