<p class="p">Phytochemicals are small, organic biomolecules, which are generally hydrophobic and designated as naturally occurring antibiotics. Cytoplasm membrane coagulation, proton pump and electron flux damage, and active transport imbalances are some of the mechanisms of actions responsible for providing the antimicrobial property of phytochemicals (Sikkema et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). It is believed that these biological events do not occur separately, as some are activated as a consequence of others (Sikkema et al.
