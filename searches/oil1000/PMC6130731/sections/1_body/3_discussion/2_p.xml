<p class="p">The only result indicating a clinically relevant antibacterial concentration was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, with a MIC of 512 μg/mL. According to Houghton et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), any natural product with a biological effect demonstrated with a concentration higher than 1 mg/mL cannot be considered clinically relevant due to the impossibility to be dispersed in the plasma volume. A similar result was found by Azevedo (
