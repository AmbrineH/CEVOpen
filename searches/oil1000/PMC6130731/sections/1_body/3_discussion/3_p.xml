<p class="p">According to Oliveira et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), the interference that the essential oil can cause with the action of the antibiotics generally varies in accordance with the type of antibiotic, the type of associated essential oil tested and the type of bacterial strain. In testing the modulatory activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. blanchetianus</italic>, Angélico (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) observed that there was a potentiation of the action of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, kanamycin, amikacin and gentamicin, in the interaction with the 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> strain. Nonetheless, he did not observe any interference with the activity of the antibiotics in contact with the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strain, thus differing from the results found in this study for the same bacterial strain. Canton and Onofre (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) observed in their experiments that the extracts and essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis dracunculifolia</italic> DC (Asteraceae) against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> β-lactamase negative and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> can interfere synergistically or antagonistically with the action of antibiotics when associated with them.
