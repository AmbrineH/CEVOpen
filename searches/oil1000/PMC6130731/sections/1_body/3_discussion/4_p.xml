 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), while analyzing the antimicrobial potential of vegetable extracts from a Cerrado area against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains, also noted antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Croton</italic> species against this strain; the chloroform and hexane extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Croton antisyphiliticus</italic> Mart. showed bactericidal activity and significant antimicrobial activity, affecting five out of the seven strains tested, with the MIC varying between 0.12 and 0.50 mg/mL. In a further test, the chloroform extract of 
 <italic class="italic">C. antisyphiliticus</italic> considerably affected all 20 tested strains; for 17 of them, the MIC was 1.03 mg/mL and for the remaining ones, it was 4.15 mg/mL.
