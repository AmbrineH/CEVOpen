<p class="p">The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. limae</italic> fresh leaves was extracted using the hydrodistillation technique. Triturated fresh leaves (480.52 g) were immersed in a flask containing a quantity of distilled water sufficient to entirely cover them and then coupled to a hydrodistillation unit. Two hours after the start of boiling, the essential oil was separated by adding sodium sulfate for the complete removal of water. Next, the mixture was kept refrigerated for 24 h and taken out of the flask with the aid of a glass pipette with cotton wool on the end (to avoid taking out the sodium sulfate), then stored in a labeled flask in the refrigerator at 8–12 °C until used.
