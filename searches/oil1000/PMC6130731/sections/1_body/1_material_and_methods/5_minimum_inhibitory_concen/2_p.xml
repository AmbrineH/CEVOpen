<p class="p">The material was incubated in a microbiological incubator at a constant temperature of 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h (Javadpour et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>). After incubation, 20 μL of Resazurin sodium red dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well in the antibacterial tests, letting it rest for 1 h at room temperature. Regarding the interpretation of the results, the wells which stayed blue were considered a positive result and those which went red were considered negative (Salvat et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). The interpretation of the antifungal activity was carried out through observation of turbidity. All assays were performed at least 3 times and the most common result was used.
