<p class="p">The broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC of the essential oil in 96-well microdilution plates. 1:1 serial dilutions were carried out with the plates in the numerical position (horizontal), adding 100 μL of the culture medium with the strains (inoculum and BHI 10%) and 100 μL of the essential oil in each well. Only the inoculum was placed in the final well, as this acted as the control. The concentrations varied from 512 to 8 μg/mL for each microorganism tested.</p>
