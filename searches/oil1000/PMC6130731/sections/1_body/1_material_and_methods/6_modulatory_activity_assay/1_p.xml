<p class="p">For the evaluation of the essential oil as a modulator of antibiotic and antifungal activity, the MIC of the standard antibiotics and fungicides was determined in the presence and absence of the oil using the microdilution method at subinhibitory concentrations (MIC 1/8). The antibiotics, amikacin, gentamicin and neomycin, and the antifungals, amphotericin B, benzoylmetronidazole and nystatin, were used. Benzoylmetronidazole was used as a fungicide in this study due to recent findings of its activity against
