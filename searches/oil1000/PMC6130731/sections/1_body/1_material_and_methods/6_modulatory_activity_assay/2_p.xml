<p class="p">The antibiotic and fungicides solutions were prepared with distilled water at a concentration of 5000 μg/mL. A volume of 100 μL of each solution was serially diluted (1:1) in the wells containing the BHI broth at 10% and the suspension of the microorganism (1:10) in microdilution plates in the alphabetical position (vertical). The concentrations of the drugs in the culture medium varied from 2500 to 2.5 μg/mL. The incubation of the assays and the interpretation of results are the same as for those previously referred to for the MIC. The control consisted of a serial dilution of the antibiotic in the culture medium made up of 1350 μg of BHI and 150 μL of inoculum. All assays were performed at least 3 times and the most common result was used.</p>
