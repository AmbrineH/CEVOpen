<p class="p">The microorganisms used in these assays were obtained from the National Institute of Health Quality Control (INCQS) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. Four standard strains (a Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and three Gram-negative ones: 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 10536, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442 and 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 4362) were used. Two other multidrug resistant strains (MDR), 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> EC 27 and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> SA 358, obtained from the Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB), Brazil, were also used. Three fungal strains from the 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> genus were assayed: 
 <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic> ATCC 40042, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krusei</italic> ATCC 2538 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 40006. All the strains were inoculated into brain–heart infusion (BHI) culture medium at 3.8% and incubated for 24 h at 35 °C with forced air circulation in order to be reactivated. In the preparation of the inoculum, 100 μL of the strain was added in 1 mL of 10% BHI and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
