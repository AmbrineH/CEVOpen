  <bold class="bold">Context:</bold>
  <italic class="italic">Croton</italic> sp. are plants with a well-reported antimicrobial activity
  <italic class="italic">. Croton limae</italic> A.P. Gomes, M.F. Sales P.E. Berry (Euphorbiaceae), known as ‘marmeleiro-prateado’, is commonly used to manage abdominal pain in Brazil.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Objective:</bold> This work evaluates the phytochemical composition, antimicrobial and modulatory activities of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">C. limae</italic> leaves (EOCL).
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Materials and methods:</bold> The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the modulation of the antibiotic activity were determined using a microdilution method. The concentration of EOCL ranged between 512 and 8
  <bold class="bold">
   <sc class="sc"> </sc>
  </bold>μg/mL. 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains were used in the MIC and modulation assays. The antibiotics, amikacin, gentamicin and neomycin, and the antifungals, amphotericin B, benzoylmetronidazole and nystatin, were used in concentrations ranging between 2500 and 2.5

  </bold>μg/mL. The phytochemical analysis of the EOCL was performed through gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS).
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Results:</bold> Only 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was inhibited by a clinically relevant concentration of EOCL (MIC 512 μg/mL). Synergism between the EOCL and amikacin against 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (9.76 μg/mL) and 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (39.062 μg/mL); neomycin against 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (2.44 μg/mL); and benzoylmetronidazole against 
  <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> (256 μg/mL) were observed. The GC/MS analysis identified cedrol, eucalyptol and α-pinene as the main compounds of EOCL.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Conclusion:</bold> EOCL inhibited the growth of 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and potentiated the antibiotic and antifungal effects of drugs against all bacterial and 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains, respectively.
