<p class="p">As a result of the performed studies, stable oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions were obtained, which were compatible with the six selected fragrance compositions, and they did not contain ethanol or any other solvent. These systems can be successfully applied as modern carriers of selected fragrance compositions, both with a low-energy method (PIC), at a laboratory scale, and with a high-energy method (US), at a production scale. The optimized nano-perfume recipes that were obtained with different methods, yielded the same physicochemical properties (stability, medium droplet size of the inner phase, polydispersity, viscosity, surface tension, pH, and density). The simple composition of the formulation is worth noting. The use of a nonionic surfactant that was gentle to the skin as an emulsifier, i.e., castor oil (Etocas 35) ethoxylated with 35 moles of ethylene oxide, allowed to obtain stable systems, without the need to use additional solubilizers, such as polyol, e.g. glycerin, an oil phase component, or an oil with low polarity (e.g., isohexadecane). Stable, transparent nano-perfumes were obtained with a fragrance composition concentration within 6â€“15% range [

 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. These formulations have low viscosity and pH suitable for the skin. Moreover, the obtained results confirmed the protective role of nanoemulsions. The peroxide number measurement (POV) showed that the tested fragrance compositions had a high chemical stability. The results of the microbiological tests confirmed that the obtained products were free of microbiological contamination and were appropriately preserved. The dermatological test results confirmed the safety of the developed preparations.
