 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] obtained nanoemulsions also stabilized with Cremophor EL (PEG-35 castor oil), on the basis of caprylic and capric triglycerides (Miglyol 812), with a low-energy method. For a water/Cremophor EL/Miglyol 812 system, the nanoemulsion was obtained with an oil:surfactant ratio of 10:90 to 40:60. They had a droplet size between 14 and 39 nm and maintained kinetic stability for 7 months.
