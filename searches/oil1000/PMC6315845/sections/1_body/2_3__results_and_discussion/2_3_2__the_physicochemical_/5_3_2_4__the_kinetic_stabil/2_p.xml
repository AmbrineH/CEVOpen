 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00981-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, it can be clearly seen that the nanoemulsions on the basis of the fragrance Composition A, in which the surfactant:oil ratio (S:O) was 0.625:0375 and 0.5:0.5, maintained kinetic stability for 12 months. However, in the case of preparations with higher content of oil phase, the droplet size increased significantly, most likely due to coalescence and Ostwald ripening.
