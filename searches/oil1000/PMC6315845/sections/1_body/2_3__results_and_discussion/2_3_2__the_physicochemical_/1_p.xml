<p class="p">So far, a few methods of obtaining nanoemulsions with a low-energy method have been proposed, including spontaneous emulsification, phase inversion method, and solvent evaporation method, which perform well in the laboratory but not on an industrial scale [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Among the different literature reports, ultrasound homogenization is one of the most attractive methods for direct production of nanoemulsions on a larger scale [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, comparative studies between scalable and non-scalable methods have not been documented enough. Even if numerous studies report the properties of nanoemulsions obtained with different methods [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], still there is no substantial knowledge about the possibility of producing a preparation optimized with a laboratory method, on a small scale, by applying a large-scale production method. This paper presents the comparison of the physicochemical properties of the optimized nanoemulsions as the media of the selected fragrance compositions obtained with a non-scalable PIC method, with systems obtained with a scalable US method.
