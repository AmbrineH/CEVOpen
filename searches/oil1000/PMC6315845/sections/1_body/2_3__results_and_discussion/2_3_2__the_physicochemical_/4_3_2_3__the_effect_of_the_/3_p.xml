<p class="p">The effect of the oil phase on the nanoemulsion droplet size obtained with a low-energy method (EPI), was studied by Ostertag et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The systems were stabilized with emulsifiers from oxyethylated esters of sorbitan and fatty acids (Tween 20, Tween 80, Tween 85). On the basis of the conducted experiments, the researchers found out that the smallest nanoemulsion droplet sizes were obtained with medium-chain triglycerides, then with essential oils (orange and limonene), and the largest droplets when the oil phase consisted of natural oils with long-chain triglycerides (olive, grape, sesame, peanut, and canola oils). Out of the natural oils, the nanoemulsions with the smallest droplet size of the inner phase were obtained with olive, and the largest ones with canola oil.
