<p class="p">According to the literature, there is no clear relationship between the size of the nanoemulsion droplets and physicochemical properties of the oil phase (refractive index, density, interfacial tension, and viscosity). Instead, the phase behavior of the surfactant-oil-water system is likely to be more important [
