 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] obtained nanoemulsions with the CPI (Catastrophic Phase Inversion) method, on the basis of olive oil as a carrier of D-limonene, stabilized with Tween 80. The nanoemulsions were obtained with a maximum 15% concentration of olive oil. Similar results were achieved when corn oil, sunflower oil, and soybean oil were used instead of olive oil. However, the obtained systems differed in droplet sizes (the smallest in the case of olive oil with 15% concentration of oil phase). Moreover, the nanoemulsions containing only olive oil had larger sizes than those which also had D-limonene in the oil phase. The authors explained this phenomenon with the differences in the viscosity of the oil phase. D-limonene was characterized by a much lower viscosity (approx. 2 mPa·s) than the vegetable oils (above 30 mPa·s). The viscosity of the oil phase could affect the rate of mass transport of surfactant molecules through the oil and into the aqueous phase or droplet disruption, within a flow field [
