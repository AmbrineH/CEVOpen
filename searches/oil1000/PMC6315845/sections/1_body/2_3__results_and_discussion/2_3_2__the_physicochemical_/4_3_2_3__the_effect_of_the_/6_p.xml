<p class="p">The nanoemulsion in which the oil phase was formed only with D-limonene was obtained by Li and Chiang [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], with the US method. The system was stabilized with a surfactant mixture—sorbitane trioleate and polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether. The ultrasound power was 18 W, sonification time 100–140 s. Nanoemulsions had a droplet size under 100 nm and maintained kinetic stability for eight weeks.
