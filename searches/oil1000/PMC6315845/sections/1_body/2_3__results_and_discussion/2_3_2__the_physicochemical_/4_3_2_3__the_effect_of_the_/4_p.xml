The difference lay in that in order to receive the nanoemulsion, a different low-energy method—spontaneous emulsification (SE)—was used. Additionally, in this case, the droplet size followed the order—medium chain triglycerides &lt; flavor oils &lt; long-chain triglycerides. However, in contrast to the observations made by Ostertaga et al. [
