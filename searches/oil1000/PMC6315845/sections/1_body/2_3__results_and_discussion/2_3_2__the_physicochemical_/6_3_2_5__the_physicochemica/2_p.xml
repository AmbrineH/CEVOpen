The method used to obtain the composition with the above-mentioned content, did not have any effect on the properties of the preparations. Nanoemulsion obtained by US method had properties similar to those of formulations obtained with a low-energy method. Z-Ave diameter, PDI, viscosity, surface tension, pH, and density values did not show any significant differences (
