<p class="p">According to the literature, the physicochemical properties of the nonionic emulsifiers, used for obtaining nanoemulsions, play a crucial role during emulsification. The most popular group of nonionic emulsifiers used for obtaining nanoemulsions are Tweens (ethoxylated esters of sorbitan and fatty acids) and Cremophors (ethoxylated derivatives of castor oil) [
