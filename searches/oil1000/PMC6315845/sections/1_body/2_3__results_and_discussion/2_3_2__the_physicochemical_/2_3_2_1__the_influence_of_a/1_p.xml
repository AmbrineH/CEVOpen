<p class="p">In the course of the study, four hydrophilic emulsifiers were selected with an HLB (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) of 10.3–14.0, due to their very good dermatological and application properties. In order to select an optimal emulsifier, two tests were carried out—for a 6% fragrance composition concentration (corresponding to concentrations of eau de toilette, i.e., 5–15%), and for an emulsifier concentration up to 10% (not more than the traditional emulsifier systems that are safe for the skin).
