The oil phase was formed by propylene glycol monolaurate. Nanoformulations were characterized with kinetic stability and droplet size under 200 nm. It was observed that the optimal surfactant concentration for the greatest dispersion rate of the systems was in the range of 5â€“6%. The authors of the research supposed that a significant decrease in the droplet size could be attributed to the presence of the polar covalent parts in the Cremophor EL chemical structure (polyethylene glycols and ethoxylated glycerol). These two components have good properties to solubilize various essential oils and hydrophobic drugs. Due to these two highly hydrophilic groups in the aqueous phase, the viscosity difference between the two immiscible phases is reduced, leading to a decrease in the critical Weber number, followed by an increased droplet break-up efficiency. The good stability of nanoemulsion droplets can be attributed to the steric stabilizing effect of nonionic emulsifier (Cremophore EL), in which it prevents flocculation and coalescence, by forming a thick steric barrier against droplet merging.
