On the basis of their studies, they concluded that Cremophors had better emulsification properties than Tweens. Out of the tested emulsifiers (Cremophor RH 40, Cremophor EL, Tween 20, Tween 80), nanoemulsions with the smallest droplet size and lowest PDI were obtained by stabilizing systems with Cremophor RH 40 (INCI: PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil) and Cremophor EL (INCI: PEG-35 castor oil). The authors of the study found no correlation between the droplet size of the nanoemulsion and the HLB of the applied emulsifier. Tween 20 and Tween 80 have a similar HLB and the nanoemulsions stabilized with them had different particle sizesâ€”179 and 122 nm, respectively. They explained the results with the impact of the molecular structure of the surfactant and, therefore, the packing parameter on emulsification. The differences between packing parameters of a surfactant affect the curvature of its monolayer on the inter-phase surface [

The changes of this curvature, during nanoemulsion emulsification, are crucial parameters in the process of obtaining nanoemulsions with low-energy methods (Phase Inversion Temperature (PIT); Phase Inversion Composition (PIC); Self-Emulsification (SE); Catastrophic Phase Inversion (CPI); Emulsion Phase Inversion (EPI)).
