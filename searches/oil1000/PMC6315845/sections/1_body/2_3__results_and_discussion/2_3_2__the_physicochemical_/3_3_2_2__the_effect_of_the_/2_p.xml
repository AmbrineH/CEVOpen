 <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00981-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, all fragrances (Aâ€“F) achieved satisfactory values with reduced emulsifier concentration (S:O = 0.5:0.5) and with increased fragrance composition concentration (S:O = 0.4:0.6) The droplet size did not exceed 150 nm and the PDI was not greater than 0.5, in most cases. However, increasing the fragrance composition concentration (S:O = 0.4:0.6) resulted in increasing the average droplet size of the nanoemulsion and PDI, which is consistent with the literature data, according to which the droplet size increases with the concentration of the inner phase [

On the other hand, the systems in which the surfactant concentration was the highest (S:O = 0.625:0.375), showed significantly larger dispersion rate. As reported in the literature, high surfactant concentration can cause complete dissolution of the oil phase in water, at the emulsion inversion point, but low surfactant concentration resulted in the formation of larger droplets. When surfactant:oil ratio (S:O) was high enough, the surfactant formed the layer structure at phase inversion point, and then the minimal interfacial tension was formed and promoted the formation of small droplets [
