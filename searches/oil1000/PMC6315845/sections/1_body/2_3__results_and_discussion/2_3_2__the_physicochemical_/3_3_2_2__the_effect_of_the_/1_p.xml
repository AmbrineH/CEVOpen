<p class="p">In the next stage of the study, the emulsifier concentration was reduced to 6%, while maintaining the same fragrance composition concentration (6%) (S:O ratio = 0.5:0.5). Attempts were also made to increase the fragrance composition concentration to 15% (corresponding to the composition concentrations in eau de parfum), while maintaining the surfactant concentration at 10% (S:O ratio = 0.4:0.6).
