<p class="p">In order to confirm the effect of the nanoemulsions on the chemical stability of fragrance compositions, an oxidative stress test was carried out. The peroxide number measurement (POV) helped to determine the chemical stability of the applied fragrances. The same amount of the oils (fragrance compositions) was used in all of the formulations. The calculated values of the peroxide number (POV) indicated the level of the oil oxidation process. The lower were the peroxide number differences between the fresh fragrances and those protected by nanoemulsions during storage, the higher was the protective ability of the nanoemulsion and chemical stability of the oils. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00981-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows the protection effect of nanoemulsion against oxidation of the oils. The obtained formulations showed a high protection against the oxidation of fragrance compositions, compared to the reference samples of pure oils. This protective ability is connected with the nanoemulsion structure, which hinders the oxygen from reaching the oils, and oxidizing them.
