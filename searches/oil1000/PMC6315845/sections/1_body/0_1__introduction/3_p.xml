<p class="p">An interesting solution for the water-based perfumes without alcohol, seem to be nanoemulsions—liquid colloidal systems characterized by a high degree of dispersion (20–500 nm), consisting of aqueous and oil phases and a surfactant, sometimes with the addition of a cosurfactant. Similar to microemulsions, nanoemulsions increase the expiry date of many products, due to their resistance to sedimentation and creaming. An additional advantage over microemulsions is that they have a much lower amount of a surfactant (approx. 5–10%), which allows maintaining adequate stability of the system and it makes them safe for human body [

The examples of nanoemulsion cosmetics found on the market are anti-UV hair spray by Korres, Nanocream by Sinerga, Nanogel by Kemira, Vital Nanoemulsion A-VC serum by Marie Louise, Bepanthol Ultra face cream by Bayer, or face cleanser NanoVital by Vitacos Cosmetics [
