<p class="p">As an alternative to alcohol compositions, there are perfumes in a solid state (solid emulsions, gels, and pomades) and perfumed oils. However, their main disadvantage is that they leave greasy and slippery spots on the perfumed surfaces. Some examples of perfumed products are presented in the literature and they are based on a safe solvent like water, the so-called “alcohol-free perfumes” (emulsions, microemulsions, liposomes, and micelles) [

Yet from a technological perspective, the introduction of lipophilic systems to water without a cosurfactant (ethanol, among others) is very difficult, with respect to thermodynamic stability. It requires the use of solubilizers of essential oils which can be polyols (glycols and glycerin) or surfactants.
