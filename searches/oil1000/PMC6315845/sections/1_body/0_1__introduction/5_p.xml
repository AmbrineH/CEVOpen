<p class="p">Nanoemulsions turned out to be a great solution for solving problems related to the oxidation and low-bioavailability of fragrances and they could be applied as nano-encapsulated fragrance systems, in the perfume industry. Therefore, the most important aspect for further research would be to make the preparation of fragrance nanoemulsions practicable, at a pilot scale, so as to make them possible to be adopted in the industrial full-scale production.</p>
