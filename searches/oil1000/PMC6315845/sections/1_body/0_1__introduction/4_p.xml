Nanoemulsions that serve as a matrix for fragrance substances used in cosmetics are also described in the literature [

On the other hand, the fragrance compositions contain up to twenty compounds with various chemical structures (alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, esters, saturated, unsaturated, cyclic, and branched hydrocarbons), and as a result they are a difficult base for obtaining stable nanoemulsion systems.
