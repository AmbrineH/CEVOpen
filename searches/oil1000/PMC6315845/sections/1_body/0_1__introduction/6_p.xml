<p class="p">The aim of the research was to develop stable oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions that are compatible with selected fragrance compositions, without ethanol, polyols, and ionic surfactants, and to study the physicochemical, microbiological, and dermatological properties, as well as permanence of the fragrance of the obtained nano-perfumes. The nano-perfume systems were obtained with a low-energy method (Phase Inversion Composition; PIC), as well as with an ultrasound (US) high-energy method, taking into account the possibility of moving from the laboratory scale to an industrial scale.</p>
