<p class="p">The nano-perfumes in the nanoemulsion form were obtained with a high-energy method that requires ultrasonic homogenization with initial pre-emulsification. A specified amount of the oil phase (fragrance composition), surfactant, and demineralized water was dispersed at room temperature (25 °C), with a mechanical stirrer (IKA° RW 20 digital), 500 rpm, for 10 min. The obtained pre-emulsion underwent ultrasonic homogenization (probe-type sonicator UP200Ht, Hielscher Company, Teltow, Germany) with 15 W for at least 60 s.</p>
