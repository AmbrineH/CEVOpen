<p class="p">In order to establish the properties of the fragrance compositions used in the research, their surface tension was measured with a tensiometer STA-1 by Sinterface (Berlin, Germany) with a du Noüy ring. Viscosity was determined with an R/S (Cone/Plate) rotational rheometer with cone/plate measuring elements (by Brookfield). Moreover, the value of logP was calculated (i.e., lipophilicity of the composition) on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative constituents of the used fragrance compositions provided in material data sheets. This was determined by calculating the lipophilicity (logP, P—Partition coefficient) of individual relevant constituents and the percentage composition of the fragrance [
