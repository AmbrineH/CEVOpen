<p class="p">The oxidative stress test was carried out to demonstrate the chemical stability of the fragrances and protecting effect of nanoemulsions against peroxidation of the fragrance composition. The oxidation process induced by the oxygen from air and by UV, was determined by measuring the peroxide value of the fragrances, according to Wheeler DGF standard method C-VI 6a [
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-08-00981" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The value was measured as the amount of iodine which was formed by the reaction of peroxides (formed in oil) with iodide ion. The sample was added to a mixture of glacial acetic acid and isooctane (60/40
