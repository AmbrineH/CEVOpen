<p class="p">In order to obtain dispersive systems with the droplet size of 20–500 nm of the inner phase, the research concerned the influence of the type and concentration of the oil phase (of a given fragrance composition) and of the type and concentration of the surfactant on the stability of nanoemulsion systems. The emulsifiers used in the study were supplied by the Croda company (Krakow, Poland) (

All tested fragrances are of GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe) status, allergen free. Milli-Q® filtered water (Merck, Warsaw, Poland) was used as the aqueous phase of the nanoemulsions. The preservative used was Dermosoft 1388 (up to 1%), kindly supplied by Evonik Dr. Straetmans GmbH (Germany).
