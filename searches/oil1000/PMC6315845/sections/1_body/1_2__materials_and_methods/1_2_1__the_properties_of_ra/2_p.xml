<p class="p">Nonionic surface active agents were used in the research. Those surfactants belong to the group of polyoxyethylated esters of glycerin and fatty acids, polyoxyethylated castor oil, polyglycerol and fatty acids esters, and alkyl polyglucosides. Surfactants of this type are known for their very good performance and dermatological properties. They show biocompatibility with the skin and they are used in cosmetics, such as solubilizers, humectants, dispersing agents, and emulsifiers, for the stabilization of O/W emulsions. In comparison to the ionic surfactants, both cationic and anionic, they are not susceptible to pH change and the addition of electrolytes. They can be used with other emulsifiers to increase the system stability [
