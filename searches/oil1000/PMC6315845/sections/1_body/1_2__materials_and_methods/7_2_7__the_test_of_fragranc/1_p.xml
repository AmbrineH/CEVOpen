<p class="p">The test of fragrance permanence was carried out in accordance with the standard BN-84/6148-02. Two strips of filter paper, 150 mm long and 15–20 mm broad, were dipped 20 mm in the samples; the first one was dipped in a tested sample, and the second one in a reference sample, and left at the temperature of 25 °C. The intensity of the fragrance was assessed organoleptically after 1, 24, and 48 h after dipping. The samples were assessed by comparing the intensity of the fragrance of the tested sample and the reference sample. </p>
