<p class="p">In order to determine the physicochemical properties of the obtained systems, the following analytical methods and techniques were used. The size of the droplets of the inner phase was analyzed with a Zetasizer Nano ZS droplet analyzer (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The kinetic stability of the emulsion systems was monitored with the analysis of the droplet size of the inner phase of the nanoemulsion and the polydispersity index (PDI) over time. To determine the rheological properties of the obtained formulations, just like in the case of pure compositions, an R/S rotational rheometer was used with cone/plate measuring elements (cone C25-1), at room temperature (25 °C). Viscosity tests were conducted with a variable cutting rate, within the range of 1–500 rps. The surface tension of the emulsion was also measured with a tensiometer and a du Noüy ring, in the same way as in the case of the fragrance compositions. The pH value of the emulsion system was determined with a multi-functional measuring tool (Seven Multi by Mettler Toledo, Warsaw, Poland) which was equipped with an electrode for measuring pH. Density was established with a hydrostatic method, using an analytical balance (AS310X0, Radwag, Krakow, Poland), with a density measuring device.</p>
