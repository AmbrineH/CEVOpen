<p class="p">The essential oil was obtained from fresh leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger extractor. The fresh leaves were triturated with ultra-pure water in a blender and transferred to the distillation flask (2â€‰L). After extraction, the essential oil was transferred to a glass vial, and purification was performed by freezing the remaining water. The essential oil, which was kept in liquid state, was drained to another flask and then stored under refrigeration until analysis.
