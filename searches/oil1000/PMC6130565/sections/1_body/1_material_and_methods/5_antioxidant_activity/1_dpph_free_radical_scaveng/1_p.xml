<p class="p">Antioxidant activity of the samples was determined by the DPPH method, according to Scherer and Godoy (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Antioxidant activity of the essential oil and β-caryophyllene was compared with the synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT, and the phenolic compound quercetin. The antioxidant capacity was expressed as antioxidant activity index (AAI), which classifies antioxidants as weak when AAI &lt;0.5, moderate when 0.5 &lt; AAI &lt;1.0, strong when 1.0 &lt; AAI &lt;2.0 and very strong when AAI &gt;2.0.
