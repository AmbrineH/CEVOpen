<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was determined according to Re et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) with modifications. ABTS radical cation (ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup>) was formed by reaction of 7.0 mM ABTS (50% ethanol) with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate (in distilled water). This reagent was stored under refrigeration for at least 24 h. Before use, the reagent was diluted with 50% ethanol until absorbance of 1.0 (± 0.02) at 734 nm. In 96-well microplates 250 uL ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+ </sup>and 20 μL of each concentration of the compounds were added. The blank was 20 μL of ethanol. After 10 min of reaction in the dark, the reading was performed at 734 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190 Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows: I (%) = [(Abs
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>−Abs
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/Abs
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>] × 100, where Abs
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the blank and Abs
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance in the presence of the test compound at different concentrations. The results were expressed as IR50 (concentration capable of reducing 50% of free radicals), and calculated using a calibration curve in the linear range by plotting the final concentration of the extract versus the corresponding scavenging effect. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil and β-caryophyllene was compared to quercetin, BHA and BHT.
