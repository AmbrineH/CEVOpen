<p class="p">The studies were performed according to M38-A method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). The final cell concentration was adjusted to the McFarland scale, and thereafter adjusted with Mueller Hinton broth so that each tube had 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> UFC/mL. Assays were performed in 2 mL tubes by adding 500 μL of inoculum in growth medium (Mueller Hinton broth) together with 500 μL of the essential oil or β-caryophyllene to the final concentration of MIC and 2 × MIC or 500 μL of medium for blank, and incubated at 37 °C. For the experiments, a 10 μL aliquot was added in 990 μL of saline 0.85%, and then 100 μL of diluted was spread in a plate with Sabouraud Agar, and incubated for 25 °C up to positive growth in the control group, when all plates were counted. The tests were performed for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h. The experiment was carried out twice. The reduction of ≥3 log10 CFU compared with the control was defined as fungicidal effect. The experiment was carried out twice.
