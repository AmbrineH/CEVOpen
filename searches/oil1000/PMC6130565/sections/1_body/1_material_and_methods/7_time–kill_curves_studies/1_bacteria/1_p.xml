Assays were performed in 2 mL tubes by adding 500 μL of inoculum in growth medium (Mueller Hinton broth) together with 500 μL of the essential oil or β-caryophyllene to the final concentration of MIC and 2 × MIC or 500 μL of medium for blank, and incubated at 37 °C. For the experiments, a 10 μL aliquot was added in 990 μL of saline 0.85%, and then 100 μL of the diluted solution was spread on a plate with Muller Hinton Agar, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The tests were performed for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h. The reduction of ≥3 log10 CFU compared with the control was defined as bactericidal effect (CLSI
