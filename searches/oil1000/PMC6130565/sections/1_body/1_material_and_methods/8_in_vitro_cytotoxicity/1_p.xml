<p class="p">The cytotoxic activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> and β-caryophyllene was evaluated by the colorimetric MTT assay proposed by Mosmann (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>). Briefly, 3T3 fibroblasts or HEPA h1c1c7 cells were added in 96-well microplate at a final concentration of 7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL. After overnight incubation, cells were exposure to increasing concentrations of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> or β-caryophyllene (7.8–500 μg/mL), and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, 100 μL of MTT (1 mg/mL) were added to each well and incubated for additional 2 h. Then, 100 μL of DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Camptothecin (100 μM) was used as a positive control. The absorbance of purple formazan, proportional to the number of viable cells, was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Spectra Max 190, Sunnyvale, CA). The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
