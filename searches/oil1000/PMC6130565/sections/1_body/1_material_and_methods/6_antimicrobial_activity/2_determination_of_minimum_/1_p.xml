<p class="p">To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the bacteria, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> and β-caryophyllene were prepared at a concentration of 4.0 mg/mL in 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and immediately diluted with saline solution (0.85%). The final cell concentration was adjusted to there McFarland scale, and thereafter adjusted with Mueller Hinton broth so that each well of the microplate had 5 × 10

All microplates included a positive control, a negative control and the antibiotic ampicilin. The essential oil and β-caryophyllene were evaluated at final concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 0.015 mg/mL. The microplates were incubated at 36 °C for 24 h, and then 50 μL CTT (solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium 0.5% in deionized water) were added. After 6 h of incubation, MIC was determined as the lowest concentration that inhibited visible growth of bacteria since dead cells are not stained by CTT (CLSI
