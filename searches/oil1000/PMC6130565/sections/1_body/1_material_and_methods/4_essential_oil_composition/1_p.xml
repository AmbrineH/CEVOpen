<p class="p">The identification of the essential oil’s components was carried out by GC-MS analysis. Identification of the chemical constituents was done in a gas chromatograph (TraceUltra, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled with mass spectrometer (DSQII, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and in a gas chromatograph coupled with FID detector for quantification (Focus, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The compounds were separated in a DB-5 fused silica capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm ×0.25 μm film thickness (J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA). Helium was the carrier gas used, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analyses were performed using splitless injection at 220 °C. The oven temperature program used was 60–240 °C at 3 °C/min, and the final temperature was held for 7 min. The GC–MS interface and FID detector were maintained at 240 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The oil was dissolved in hexane (2 mg/mL) for the analyses. The MS data were obtained in the scan mode (35–400
