<p class="p">On one hand, the results of present study found poor antioxidant activity. On the other hand, Rodriguez et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) reported strong antioxidant activity by the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic>, in which β-caryophyllene was reported as the main constituent. The criteria used by Rodriguez et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) to classify the power of action of the essential oil as strong were not the same as those used in this work, which may have caused the discrepancy between the results. β-Caryophyllene showed weak antioxidant activity; thus, it is possible that the good antioxidant action found by Rodriguez et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) is due to the other constituents of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> cultivated in Cuba. There is a consensus in the literature that essential oils rich in monoterpenes with aromatic rings attached to hydroxyl groups (phenolics) have good antioxidant activity, while oils rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons have weak action. The main constituents of the essential oil obtained in our study are sesquiterpenes (99%), which is consistent with what is reported in the literature (Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Antioxidant activity is directly related to the compound's ability to scavenge free radicals, so compounds with little or no chemical grouping with this ability (e.g. hydroxyl groups) will not be able to perform this function. The most abundant compounds in the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> obtained in this experiment do not have hydroxyl groups, which can be the cause of weak antioxidant potential.
