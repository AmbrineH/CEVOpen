<p class="p">Previous studies indicate that Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to the action of essential oils due to the greater complexity of the dual cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria in contrast to the simple structure of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (Rios &amp; Recio

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>); however, the results of the present study indicate that the difference of the cell wall of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was not a major factor in determining the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of

However, the characterization of an antimicrobial’s pharmacodynamics for dose optimization can be done using time–kill curve experiments, which provide much more information than a MIC value. While the MIC is a static, one-point in time measurement with a 2-fold variability, time–kill curves provide a profile of antimicrobial activity over time, offer information on the extent of kill and may even be used to detect the presence of resistant subpopulations. The graphs of death kinetics of bacteria have shown that Gram-positive bacteria count was reduced more quickly (4 h for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 12 h for 
 <italic class="italic">E. feacallis</italic>) than Gram-negative bacteria (24 h for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>) in MIC concentrations of essential oil and β-caryophyllene. This result shows a possible relationship between the difference of the cell wall and the mechanism of action of the essential oil and β-caryophyllene; however, this relationship was not observed in the results of the MIC and MBC. As cited before, time–kill curve experiments provide much more information than a MIC value.
