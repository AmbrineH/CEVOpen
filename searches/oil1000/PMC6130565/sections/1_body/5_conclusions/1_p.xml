<p class="p">Experimental data indicate β-caryophyllene and α-zingiberene as main compounds in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> essential oil from Brazil and suggested that this plant can be used as a source for isolation of these two substances. The essential oil showed only weak free radical scavenging capacity; however, it exhibited the potential bactericidal and fungicidal activity for the microorganisms tested. In addition, the essential oil showed good selective cytotoxic activity against the hepatoma cells (Hepa 1c1c7). β-Caryophyllene, the major compound, showed significantly lower results than the essential oil in all analyses, indicating that the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> biological activities of the essential oil may be due to the synergistic effect of the components of the oil.
