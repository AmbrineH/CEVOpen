 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the results of the cytotoxic activity of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> and β-caryophyllene in tumourous cells of hepatocytes and in normal fibroblast cells. On one hand, the essential oil was more cytotoxic on tumour cells than on normal cells, displaying an activity similar to that of camptothecin. On the other hand, β-caryophyllene showed lower activity in both investigated cell lines.
