<p class="p">The results of time–kill curves for bacteria and fungi investigated are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figures 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" class="xref">3</xref>, respectively. Both essential oil and β-caryophyllene induced rapid bacterial killing with concentrations equal to or above the MIC for all bacteria, except for β-caryophyllene against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. The time–kill curve study showed that essential oil and β-caryophyllene exhibited a good and rapid fungicidal effect within 2–4 h for 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> and 4–8 h for 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The results showed a dose-dependent effect for all fungi, whereas the concentration of 2 × MIC led to a more rapid reduction in counts compared with the MIC concentration. This relationship was also observed in previous studies of filamentous fungi (Sumathy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
