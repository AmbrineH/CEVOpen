<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations of the essential oil are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. According to the classification by Holetz et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), MIC values lower than 0.1 mg/mL represent strong antimicrobial action; values between 0.1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL indicate moderate antimicrobial activity, values between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL indicate weak action, and values above 1.0 mg/mL inaction. Considering this classification, the essential oil showed weak antibacterial activity for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and moderate action for all other bacteria strains. The action of β-caryophyllene was similar for Gram-positive- and Gram-negative-tested bacteria and showed only weak activity in all bacterial strains investigated, suggesting that the moderate action found for the essential oil occurs by a synergistic effect among its compounds and not by action of its major compound.
