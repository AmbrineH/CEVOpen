<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of the essential oil on the fungi are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The MIC values of the essential oil demonstrate that it shows moderate to strong antifungal activity (MIC between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL), mainly on the fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. The mechanism of action of essential oils seems to involve the fungal membrane structures changing the micellar growth, but not affecting the germination of the spores (Abad et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Similar to the antibacterial test, the MIC and MFC values for β-caryophyllene were higher than those found for the essential oil, indicating that the synergistic effect between the oil’s components is essential for the antifungal action. The ratio of the lethal concentration to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MBC/MIC or MFC/MIC) indicates that the compound exhibits bactericidal or bacteriostatic action, where values greater than 4.0 indicate bacteriostatic action, while values less than 4.0 indicate bactericidal action (Nkanwen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The values were all less than or equal to 4, indicating that the essential oil and β-caryophyllene showed bactericidal and fungicidal action (
