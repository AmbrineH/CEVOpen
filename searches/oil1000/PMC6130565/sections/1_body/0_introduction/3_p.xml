<p class="p">The diversity of the properties attributed to 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> is mainly due to the variety chemical compounds in this plant. Detailed studies of the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic> describe the presence of flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and coumarins (Gautam et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012a</xref>; Shah et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Teshima et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Few studies have been conducted with the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. paniculata</italic>, and the majority of them have evaluated only the chemical composition, describing the presence of sesquiterpenes, such as β-caryophyllene, limonene, spathulenol and elemene (γ and δ), as major compounds (Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Rodriguez et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The only two studies in the literature describing the biological activity of the essential oil revealed antioxidant and antibacterial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Rodriguez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and repellency against 
 <italic class="italic">Diaphorina citri</italic> Kuwayama (Andrade et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, no data were found for the main isolated compounds as well. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of β-caryophyllene and Orange Jessamine essential oil in the murine hepatoma cells (Hepa 1c1c7) and in the bacteria and fungi 24-h time–kill curve studies, as well as to evaluate the composition of the essential oil and its antioxidant activity.
