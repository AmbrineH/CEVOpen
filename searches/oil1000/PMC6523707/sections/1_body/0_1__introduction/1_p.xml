<p class="p">One of the main products of the oil industry is production water, i.e., water that is produced along with the oil, and water that is injected during recovery processes. Production water is usually contaminated with hydrocarbons, which must be removed before either reinjection or disposal [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For each barrel of oil, approximately five barrels of water are produced, and, in mature fields, this ratio could reach 1:15 [
 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This situation has required the development of technologies to ensure control of the production water in accordance with industry standards for its disposal or reinjection (National Association of Corrosion Engineers NACE). Currently, there are different mechanisms for the removal of oil from the production water including adsorption [
 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], filtration [
 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], reverse osmosis [
 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], flotation [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and coagulation [
 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Adsorption is the most commonly employed technique in the tertiary stage of oil removal (“dissolved” oil) due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Typical adsorbents used in the treatment of produced water are activated carbon, organoclay, copolymers, aerogels, zeolites, resins and, lately, nanomaterials.
