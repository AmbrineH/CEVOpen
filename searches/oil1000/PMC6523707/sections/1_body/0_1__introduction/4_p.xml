<p class="p">The reason is that there are stress factors, high temperatures, water activity, pH, dissolved oxygen content, nutritional limitations, and toxicity of contaminants, which limit cell viability. Consequently, the development of efficient biological technologies for the removal of hydrocarbons is of great ecological and economic value. Strategies such as the immobilization of microbial cells in materials are being used [
