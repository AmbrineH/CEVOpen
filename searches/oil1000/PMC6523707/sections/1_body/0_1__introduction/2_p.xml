 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Regardless of the positive results, the adsorptive approaches have limitations for the desorption and final elimination of the contaminant. Biological processes are an emerging technology capable of solving these issues due to the capacity of specific microorganisms to catalyze “miscible” hydrocarbons in water [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. While the physical treatments and many of the chemicals are based on transferring the contamination between gaseous, liquid and solid media, in the biological processes the contaminating compound is transformed into another more oxidized and less toxic state.
