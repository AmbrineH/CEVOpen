<p class="p">However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has yet been conducted on the immobilization of microorganisms on activated carbon for the removal of hydrocarbons in O/W emulsified systems. Activated carbons are structured materials with high porosity and large surface chemistry, controllably obtained from the pyrolysis of organic matter, which can be used as important adsorbent materials of bacteria and hydrocarbons [
