<p class="p">This study investigated the capacity of biofilm activated carbon 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> to catalyze hydrocarbons and crude oil from oil-in-saltwater emulsions. The results showed that the macroporosity of the materials was essential to bacterial immobilization, the microporosity for the hosting of the hydrocarbons, and high pH
 <sub class="sub">PZC</sub> for the electrostatic stabilization of these adsorbates. The removal of aromatic hydrocarbons was slightly more efficient using materials (adsorption: 60%–93%) and biomaterials (catalysis: 16%–84%) as opposed to free 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> (bioremediation: 1–47%). Total crude oil removal from OBE systems using 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic>, CK, CKN, CK and CKN biomaterials was 21.9%, 75.1%, 62.3%, 48.5% and 37.4% after 24 h. The lower removal percentages, compared with purely adsorptive methods, are compensated for with the catalytic route for the oil elimination. This is evidenced by the presence of minor hydrocarbons only in the presence of free or immobilized
