<p class="p">A biochemical character that the authors have systematically examined is the mechanism of hydrocarbon catalysis by the 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> genus. Biocatalysis was described as a process that culminates in the cleavage of the aromatic rings and the final formation of fatty acids and/or acetyl CoA for the development of pathways to obtain gas and water. During the first stages of catalysis, the addition of oxygenated groups, specifically hydroxyls (Monooxygenases), and the subsequent oxidation of these groups to aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids (Dehydrogenases) was reported [

 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In the present study this phenomenon was evidenced by the presence of homologous metabolites of benzene, which were modified by the addition of functional groups of oxygen, hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, and ether.
