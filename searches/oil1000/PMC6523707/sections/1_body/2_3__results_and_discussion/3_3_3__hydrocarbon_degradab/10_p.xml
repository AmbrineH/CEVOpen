<p class="p">Consequently, the bioremediation capacity is related to the strain’s ability to access the adsorbed hydrocarbon. It is therefore believed that degrading hydrocarbon strains produce surfactants for this purpose. During xenobiotic bioremediation modulated by fine porous materials, some types of adsorption phenomena may take place: the contaminant’s adsorption on the material, the cell’s adsorption on the material and the contaminant’s adsorption on the microbial cells. These adsorption phases lead to the formation of a microenvironment or biofilm for pollutant degradation [
