<p class="p">The use of CK and CKN biomaterials for benzene and toluene elimination caused a less than 15% reduction in the removal efficiency of CK and CKN materials. These results suggest that the loss of active sites by bacterial immobilization was compensated for with 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeriâ€™s</italic> ability to consume benzene and toluene individually. Finally, there are no significant differences between CK and CKN, or CK and CKN biomaterials in terms of aromatic hydrocarbon removal.
