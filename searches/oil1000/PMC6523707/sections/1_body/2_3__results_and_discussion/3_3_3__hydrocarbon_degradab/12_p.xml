 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00500-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows the rhamnolipid production by 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> on CKN (the best biomaterial) during the aromatic hydrocarbon and crude oil removal; the results confirmed the biosurfactant generation for bioremediation action. Rhamnolipid production in the presence of phenol is remarkable; the results could be related to the difficulty for 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> to metabolize this hydrocarbon exclusively. This condition can force the production of surfactants by the microbial cell. Many authors have reported the rhamnolipid production by strains of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomona</italic> for the effective removal of hydrocarbons (10–20 g/L) similar to those found in this study (9 g/L–16 g/L) [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. On the other hand, the production of rhamnolipids when 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> was immobilized on CKN (CKN Biomaterial) was less efficient compared to the other tests, which could be due to the partial adsorption of the biosurfactant in the porous material.
