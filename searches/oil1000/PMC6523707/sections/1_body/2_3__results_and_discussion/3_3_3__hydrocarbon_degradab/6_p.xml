<p class="p">The total crude oil removed from the oil-brine emulsions (O/W) was, after 24 h, 21.9%, 75.1%, 62.3%, 48.5% and 37.4% using, respectively, 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic>, CK, CKN, CK and CKN biomaterials. In general, CK and CKN materials removed a higher amount of crude oil than the biomaterials. This could be due to the high physicochemical affinity of the adsorptive couple that could be ruled by the Van der Waals interactions. The high porosity of the carbons benefits the physisorption of the crude oil components. The difference between the removal of the base materials and the biomaterials lies in the different amounts of available active sites, which are less in the biomaterials since the microorganisms are deposited in the pores. CKN showed the best result (48.5% of crude oil removed from 8000 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in OBE after 24 h); these findings are explained by considering that the CK material immobilized 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> in greater proportion and presented better porous properties.
