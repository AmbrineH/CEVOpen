<p class="p">The use of CK and CKN biomaterials for phenol removal produced a drop in the removal efficiency, originally greater than 50%, of CK and CKN materials. These results could be attributed to the loss of porosity when 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> was immobilized, as well as the absence of any 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> affinity for phenol. The experiments in the presence of phenol were useful to interpret the ways in which the cells altered the porosity of CK and CKN. The comparison between the phenol removal efficiencies using materials and biomaterials shows the way the pore space was modified by bacterial immobilization. Due to the low ability of 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> to consume phenol, the removal was strictly limited to the adsorptive process.
