<p class="p">Finally, existing reports suggest that the degradation efficiency is largely determined by the degree of retention of contaminants (which is governed by the process of adsorption, desorption, and diffusion between the porous materials). In other words, the contaminantâ€™s availability is a critical factor of hydrocarbon biocatalysis [
