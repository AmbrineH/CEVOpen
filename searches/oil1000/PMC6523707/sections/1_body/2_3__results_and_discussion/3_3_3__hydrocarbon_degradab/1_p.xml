 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic>, CK and CKN materials were used as the controls. In particular, the adsorption efficiencies of benzene and toluene, using CK and CKN materials, were greater than 90%, while their capacity to adsorb phenol was less than 70%. These results can be explained by considering the difference in polarity between the adsorbates. The capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons can be understood as follows: benzene &gt; toluene &gt; phenol. 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri’s</italic> ability to consume phenol from a simulated medium was almost nonexistent.
