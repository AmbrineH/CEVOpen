<p class="p">However, contaminants can be blocked within the micro/mesopores of the materials. Due to the size factor, a bacterium cannot enter these spaces, causing the hydrocarbons to be blocked to microbial action. It is hypothesized that degrading hydrocarbon strains produce biosurfactants that decrease the surface tension that occurs in all phases [
