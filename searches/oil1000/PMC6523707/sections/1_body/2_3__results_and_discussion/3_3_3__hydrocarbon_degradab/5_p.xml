<p class="p">Briefly, the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons was more efficient using materials (60%–93%) and biomaterials (16%–84%) than free 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> (1%–47%). The adsorption was favored by the material’s porosity and adsorptive couple polarity. CK and CKN displayed a high degree of microporosity, in which benzene, toluene, and phenol, with molecular volumes around 100 Ǻ, could be accommodated. The non-polar character of CK and CKN guaranteed the hydrophobic attraction of the hydrocarbons, also apolar. The CKN cationic surface favored aromatic hydrocarbon retention since the π electrons in the aromatic ring were electrostatically linked with the surface cations. Other authors have reported the high affinity of this adsorptive couple [
