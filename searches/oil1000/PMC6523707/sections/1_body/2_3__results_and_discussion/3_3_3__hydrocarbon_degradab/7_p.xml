<p class="p">Although there is evidence of oil removal efficiencies higher than those reached in the present study (â‰¥90% removal in less than 24 h), these results were obtained with adsorbent and non-catalytic materials so the advantages are partial. They do not solve the problems of desorption, such as in the present work in which biomaterials are used. In this study, the catalytic action of the biomaterials was confirmed as the presence of minor hydrocarbons, such as quinolinamine, benzo[h]quinoline, cyclohexasiloxane, pentadiene, and cyclopentane, which were observed only in the presence of free or immobilized
