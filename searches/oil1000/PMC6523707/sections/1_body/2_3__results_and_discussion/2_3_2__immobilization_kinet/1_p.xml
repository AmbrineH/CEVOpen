<p class="p">The immobilization kinetics of 
 <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> on CK and CP materials are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00500-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The results indicate that for all CK materials the immobilization process advanced linearly with the interaction time until the third hour and equilibrium was reached after. The linear zone was attributed to the migration of the cells from the bulk cell suspension to the particle surfaces, while the plateau region corresponded to the diffusion of
