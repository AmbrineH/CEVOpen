<p class="p">In CP materials, after 6 h of contact, no bacterial cells remained attached to the materials. The results can be explained by considering that the CP materials exhibited low pH
 <sub class="sub">PZC</sub> and were very negative in neutral media, presenting strong repulsions with the bacterial exocellular membrane that is also negatively charged under the same conditions. In addition to the low adsorption of microorganisms, the absence of a bacterial count in the final suspension established the antimicrobial effect of CP materials. When acid materials were exposed to a pH of 7 they were negatively charged due to the hydrogen release that came from the dissociation of the surface chemical groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl [
