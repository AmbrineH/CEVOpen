<p class="p">The ability to immobilize cells is given in the following order: CK &gt; CKN &gt; CKP. The results were based in the bacterialâ€“material interaction. The cationic and neutral surface of CKN and CK under experimental pH attracted the negative charge of the cell wall. Both Gram-negative and positive bacteria possessed a relatively negative charge on their surface due to the presence of active proton functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and phosphoryl deprotonated to pH = 7.0 [
