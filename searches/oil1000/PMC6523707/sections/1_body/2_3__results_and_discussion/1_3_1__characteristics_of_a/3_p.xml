 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00500-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The results show that the CK isotherm was type I, while the other materials exhibited type II isotherms. The CK isotherm was concave in terms of the relative pressure axis (P/P
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>), increased rapidly at low pressures (P/P
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) and later reached horizontal saturation. This class of isotherm is characteristic of highly microporous materials. The high adsorption energy of the micropores allows the gas to adsorb at low pressures. Once the entire volume of the micropores has been completed, the curve remains almost constant over a wide range of pressures, producing the so-called plateau.
