<p class="p">The surface area (S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub>) for CK and CP decreased with the surface modifications, which was to be expected considering that the heteroatoms block the pore by deposition in the microporous space. However, the modification with phosphoric acid (P) of CP had a double activating effect, increasing V
