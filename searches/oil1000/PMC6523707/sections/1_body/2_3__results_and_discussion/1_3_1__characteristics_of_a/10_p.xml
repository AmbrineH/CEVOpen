All CP materials were strong acids due to the use of acid activation that promoted cleavage reactions and the formation of crosslinks with the phosphorous atom (Lewis acids), as verified by XPS. CK and CKP materials were slightly acidic or almost neutral, while CKN was a basic material for the presence of amino groups on the surface (Lewis basis); similar data were obtained by Moreno [
