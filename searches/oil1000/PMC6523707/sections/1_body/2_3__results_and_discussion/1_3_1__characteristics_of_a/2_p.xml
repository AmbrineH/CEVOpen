<p class="p">The specific chemical bonds in the surfaces of CK and CP were assessed by deconvolution of XPS signals, as shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00500-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The carbon spectra showed six peaks for CK and CP related to carbon atoms bonded to carbon and oxygen. The C=C bound the most frequently (≥70% of carbon bonds) for both samples were C=C, C–O, C=O, O=C–OR,

 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Regarding the P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>p region of the CP sample, three different peaks were found: reduced phosphorus (C–P; 40% phosphorous bonds), Pyrophosphate (C–PO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>; 40% phosphorous bonds), and polyphosphates and/or phosphates (C–O–PO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>; 20% phosphorous bonds). Hasegawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] observed that P atoms are introduced into carbon principally in reduced states and these unstable groups are gradually oxidized by oxygen, leading to oxidized P-containing functional groups. In the CP sample, the 60% phosphorus group was oxidized.
