<p class="p">The materialâ€™s textural properties are summarized in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00500-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. CK materials were exclusively microporous, their micropore volume (V
 <sub class="sub">micro</sub>) represented approximately 80% of V
 <sub class="sub">0.95</sub>, while CP materials were micro and mesoporous; V
 <sub class="sub">micro</sub> and V
 <sub class="sub">meso</sub> each represented 50% of V
 <sub class="sub">0.95</sub>. The CP samples exhibited a significantly higher V
 <sub class="sub">0.95</sub> than the CK samples. The difference between mesoporous volume by BHJ method (V
 <sub class="sub">meso</sub>) and mesoporous volume by porosimetry method (V
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) indicated that, for all materials, the mesopores were between 2 and 6.5 nm.
