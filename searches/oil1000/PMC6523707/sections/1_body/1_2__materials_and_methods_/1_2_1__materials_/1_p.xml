<p class="p">Olive stones were harvested in Granada, Spain, and were used as the raw material for the activated carbon preparation. The olive stones were dried at 80 °C until constant weight and sieved to 1.6–2.4 mm size. Potassium hydroxide (reagent grade ≥90%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and phosphoric acid (mass fraction of 85% in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used for the chemical activation of the olive stones before carbonization, while melamine (99%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and phosphoric acid (mass fraction ≥85% in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used for the modification of surface chemistry. Chlorihydric acid was used for the washing protocol (mass fraction of 37% in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetonitrile (mass fraction of 99.8% in water, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was employed for rhamnolipid quantification. Tryptone glucose extract agar (TGEA) and bushnell haas broth (BH, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used for the bacterial culture. A Colombian light crude oil (33° API), deionized water and NaCl (99%, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, DE, Germany) were used for preparing oil in brine emulsions. Benzene, toluene, and phenol (≥98%, CARLO ERBA Reactive-SDS, Barcelona, ES, Spain) were used for the assays of the removal of aromatics hydrocarbons.
