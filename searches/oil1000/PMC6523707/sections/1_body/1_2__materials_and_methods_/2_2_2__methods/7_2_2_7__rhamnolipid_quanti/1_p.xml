<p class="p">For the rhamnolipid quantification, standard solutions were prepared (CAS Standard: 0869062420 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the calibration curve was elaborated using HPLC (Prominence, Shimadzu, Kioto, Japan). A LiChrospher
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 100 RP-18 column (5 µm; 250 × 4 mm) was used as the stationary phase and water/acetonitrile 1:1 as the mobile phase. The experimental conditions were an absorption wavelength of 254 nm, an injection volume of 70 µL, 27 °C of temperature, a flow rate of 0.8 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and a retention time of 2.5 min.
