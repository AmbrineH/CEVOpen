<p class="p">An incipient impregnation method was used for surface modifications [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The CK and CP materials were dried at 110 °C for 24 h. An appropriate amount of modifying agents, phosphoric acid and melamine were prepared with a minimum amount of water or ethanol, according to their solubility for including heteroatoms of P or N, respectively. The solutions were then slowly dripped on each material. Impregnated materials were dried under IR lamp for 24 h and were later heated at 700 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen flow of 300 cm
