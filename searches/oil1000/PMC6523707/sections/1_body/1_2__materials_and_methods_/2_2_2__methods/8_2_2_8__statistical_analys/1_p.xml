<p class="p">Immobilization kinetics and bio-removal experiments were made in triplicate. The reported data correspond to the arithmetic mean ± standard deviation. In all cases, deviations (±SD) were lower than 10% of the mean (coefficient of variation). To determine statistical differences between measurements, a unidirectional analysis of variance was performed in the 95% confidence interval using Statgraphics Centurion V (Statgraphics, Seattle, WA, USA). Comparisons of the means were made with a Duncan’s multiple range test (
