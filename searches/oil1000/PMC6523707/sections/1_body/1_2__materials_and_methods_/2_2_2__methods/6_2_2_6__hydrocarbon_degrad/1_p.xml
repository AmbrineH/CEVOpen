<p class="p">Crude oil and aromatic hydrocarbon degradability tests were performed following the protocol proposed by Juang and Tsai [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], with some modifications. The biomaterials were inoculated into 15 mL of W/O emulsions. After, the flasks were cultured at 150 rpm and 35 °C for 24 h. Free cells (10
