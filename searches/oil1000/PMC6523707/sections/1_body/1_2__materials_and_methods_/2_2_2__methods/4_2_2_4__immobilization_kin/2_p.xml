<p class="p">Carbon sterilization was carried out following the method described by Sekaran et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. For this, approximately 1 g of carbon was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask of 200 mL, slightly closed, and autoclaved (WestLab, Surrey, UK) at 121 Â°C and 15 psi for 15 min. The manipulation of the materials was always carried out in a laminar flow chamber (DSS, New Delhi) to guarantee asepsis. Sterilization was based on the denaturation of the proteins of the microorganisms due to the moist heat supplied by the autoclave.
