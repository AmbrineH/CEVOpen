<p class="p">Activated carbons were prepared by chemical activation of olive stones with phosphoric acid (CP) and potassium hydroxide (CK) following the procedure previously published by Bautista et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-09-00500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. A portion of olive stones was combined separately with potassium hydroxide and phosphoric acid in a mass ratio of 1:2. The blend was macerated and dried under IR lamps. It was then carbonized by heating at 10 °C·min
