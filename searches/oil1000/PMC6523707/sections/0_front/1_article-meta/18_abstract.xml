 <p class="p">Production water is the largest byproduct of the oil industry and must be treated before disposal, either by reinjection or shedding processes, with the purpose of eliminating emulsified crude oil and avoiding the operational and toxic problems associated with it. The objective of this work was to immobilize a hydrocarbon-degrading strain on activated carbons, to evaluate the biocomplex’s capacity for catalyzing hydrocarbons from Oil in Brine emulsions (O/W) simulating produced waters. Activated carbons were prepared and their chemical and porous properties were estimated by XPS, pH
  <sub class="sub">PZC</sub> and SEM, N
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> adsorption, and mercury porosimetry. Biomaterials were synthesized and hydrocarbon removal tests were performed. The basic and neutral carbons immobilized 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> by physisorption in the macroporous space and electrostatic interactions (10
  <sup class="sup">8</sup>–10
  <sup class="sup">9</sup> UFC∙g
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), while acid materials inhibited bacterial growth. Removal of aromatic hydrocarbons was more efficient using materials (60%–93%) and biomaterials (16%–84%) than using free 
  <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> (1%–47%), and the removal efficiencies of crude oil were 22%, 48% and 37% for 
  <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> and two biomaterials, respectively. The presence of minor hydrocarbons only when 
  <italic class="italic">P. stutzeri</italic> was present confirmed the biotransformation process.
