 <p> Schematic model of dietâ€“host interactions in the intestine. The interaction between dietary elements and the intestinal mucosa is highly complex and, in normal conditions, results in a tolerogenic response. However, in genetically predisposed individuals, the interplay of specific dietary constituents with the resident microbiota and other environmental factors induces epigenetic modifications that affect the immune response, further compromising the epithelial barrier and defense mechanisms, leading to chronic inflammation, as observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). </p>
