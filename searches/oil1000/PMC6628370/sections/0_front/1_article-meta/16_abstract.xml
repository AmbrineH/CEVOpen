 <p class="p">Dramatic changes in the environment and human lifestyle have been associated with the rise of various chronic complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A dysbiotic gut microbiota has been proposed as a crucial pathogenic element, contributing to immune imbalances and fostering a proinflammatory milieu, which may be associated with disease relapses or even the initiation of IBD. In addition to representing important regulators of the mucosal immunity and the composition of the gut microbiota, food components have been shown to be potential environmental triggers of epigenetic modifications. In the context of chronic intestinal inflammation, dietary habits and specific food components have been implicated as important modulators of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, which may predispose a person to the increased risk of the initiation and evolution of IBD. This review provides novel insights about how dietary factors may interact with the intestinal mucosa and modulate immune homeostasis by shaping the intestinal ecosystem, as well as the potential influence of diet in the etiopathogenesis and management of IBD.</p>
