<p class="p">Clinical experience shows that patients usually associate their symptoms or disease relapses with the ingestion of certain foods and, as a result, they often change their diet empirically, with variable and, at most, temporary effects. In practice, decisions on dietary modifications usually do not follow professional nutritional advice and may have detrimental consequences [

In a prospective study investigating the dietary influence in the course of UC, researchers observed that a large ingestion of meat, more so of red and processed meat, in addition to ethanol, protein, sulfur, and sulfate, enhanced the chances of triggering a flare [

Although many physicians have concerns regarding the management of iron deficiency in IBD, current data suggest that oral iron therapy should be preferred in mild cases or during clinical remission, unless patients are intolerant or have an inadequate response [
