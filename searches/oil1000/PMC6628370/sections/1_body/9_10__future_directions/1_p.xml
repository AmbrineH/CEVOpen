<p class="p">Among the environmental changes associated with the progressive and global expansion of IBD, diet has emerged as an essential regulatory element of the gut microbiome, which in turn has been strongly associated with the pathogenesis of several complex chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In addition to the involvement in dysbiosis, dietary components have been shown to interfere in intestinal homeostasis, modulating the barrier function and innate immunity mechanisms. Therefore, the accumulated scientific evidence appears to position diet as a central element both in disease pathogenesis as a critical risk factor and also as a potential opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Currently, several clinical trials are being conducted in different institutions and, hopefully, novel approaches to dietary therapy will be available in the near future. </p>
