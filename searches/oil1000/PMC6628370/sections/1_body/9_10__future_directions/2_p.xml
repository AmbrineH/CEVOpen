<p class="p">Considering the progressive burden due to IBD anticipated in the next decades, dietary interventions appear particularly interesting, presumably due to the expected irrelevant side effects, lower costs, and potential application in the prevention of disease initiation or relapses. For the moment, however, the simplest approach includes the avoidance of foods that patients self-identify as worsening their symptoms, in addition to high-fat, high-carbohydrate meals and processed foods. Notably, dietary measures should be considered within the wider context of the patientâ€™s routine, not only in terms of food quality, but also changes in lifestyle, including dietary habits. For this purpose, while the results of large prospective controlled studies are awaited to provide more specific dietary guidance to patients, it is important to reinforce the role of multidisciplinary teams, including nutritionists, for offering better attention to and individualized support for patients with IBD.</p>
