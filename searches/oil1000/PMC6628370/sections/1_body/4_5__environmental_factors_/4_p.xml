<p class="p">Smoking is a well-established modifying factor in IBD, with opposing effects in CD and UC [
 <xref rid="B97-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>], but the mechanism by which it regulates intestinal inflammation is still unclear. The composition of cigarettes is heterogeneous and complex with several chemical elements that may affect different targets in the intestinal cells and modulate the microbiota [
