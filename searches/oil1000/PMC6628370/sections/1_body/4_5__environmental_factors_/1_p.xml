 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The observation of the coincident increase in immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases in the more developed and industrialized nations has long been associated with the hygiene hypothesis [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. This hypothesis appears to be relatively reductionist, as it does not explain the dynamics of IBD evolution in long-modernized Asian countries, for example. Whereas improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices are usually related to the urban compared to the rural environment, several other concomitant factors affecting the rise of immune-mediated disorders need to be pondered. For example, areas with a higher prevalence of IBD also have fewer infections and are characterized by the widespread use of vaccines and antibiotics, in addition to the availability of clean food and water [
