<p class="p">Investigations based on experimental models have provided results regarding the effects of specific diets on the immune response. For instance, a high-fat (HF) and high-sugar diet generated a proinflammatory intestinal environment, associated with an overgrowth of Proteobacteria, reduction in butyrate production, and expression of the butyrate GPR43 receptor, also underexpressed in CD patients [

A high intake of fat has been shown to have several effects on the mucosal immune system, revealing the complex interaction between the lamina propria immune cells and the intestinal microbiota. For example, the ingestion of high-fat meals increases the expression of interlukein-1β (IL-1β), TNF-α, IL-6, and necrosis factor-κB (NF-κB) in the colon [

Likewise, mice fed with cholesterol-enriched meals displayed acute inflammasome-dependent intestinal inflammation, increasing the production of IL-1β, and driving the accumulation of CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells in the lamina propria [
