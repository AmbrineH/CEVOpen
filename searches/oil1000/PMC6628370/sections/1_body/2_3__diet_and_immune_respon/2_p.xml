<p class="p">Dietary fiber has been shown to interfere in host immunity via multiple pathways. Fibers and starches present in fruits and vegetables represent a substrate for the production of butyrate and other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by intestinal microbiota. Butyrate, for example, is well-recognized as a critical element in epithelial homeostasis, but also plays an important role in downregulating the immune response by inhibiting the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and promoting the differentiation of lamina propria Tregs [
