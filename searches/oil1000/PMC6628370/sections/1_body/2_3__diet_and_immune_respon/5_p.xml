<p class="p">Dietary habits can affect human health either directly or via changes in the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is a highly complex and dynamic system that can be shaped by environmental factors, including the diet [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Regarding the dietary factors directly or indirectly associated with the immune response and intestinal homeostasis, diets with high concentrations of fat and sugar have been associated with intestinal colonization with potential IBD-related pathobionts. For instance, adherent invasive 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (AIEC) strains, induced by high-fat high-sugar diets, may become pathogenic when the ligand CEACAM 6 is presented by the intestinal epithelium. Under such circumstances, AIEC may form biofilms, adhere to, and translocate via M cells and the associated epithelium [

These findings reinforce the idea that changes in the local environment exert a selective pressure on several species, which in turn shape the microbiota according to the most adaptable microorganisms to the intestinal milieu [
