<p class="p">The increasing knowledge about the influence of the gut microbiome on the mucosal and systemic immune response has contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of IBD and other chronic inflammatory conditions. Dysbiosis has been confirmed in samples from patients with CD, displaying an increase in Enterobacteriales such as 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, and a decrease in Clostridiales such as 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In a study involving UC, the results supported a role for reduced microbial diversity, although not as prominent as the dysbiosis seen in CD [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. A large cohort study analyzing fecal samples from four different European countries revealed that CD and UC are distinct in terms of the microbiome [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Notably, some specific intestinal microbes can shape the immune response. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium difficile</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii</italic> have been shown to elicit innate lymphoid cells-1 (ILC1) and Th1 cells, which orchestrate the secretion of cytokines, such as interferon-gamma and TNF-Î±, critically important in the immunity against those intestinal pathogens [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Clostridia strains have been shown to promote the accumulation of Foxp3 Treg cells in the gut [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], which in turn down-regulate inflammatory responses, including those in experimental colitis [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Some microorganisms induce the activation of subsets of immune cells responsible for promoting intestinal inflammation, such as Th17 cells [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. For instance, segmented filamentous bacteria can activate Th17 cells, whereas a decrease in Th17 cell-inducing bacteria can attenuate the severity of colitis in mice [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In previous studies, adherent invasive 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (AIEC) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacteria adolescentis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], in addition to 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli O157</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Citrobacter rodentium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], have been shown to induce populations of Th17 cells.
