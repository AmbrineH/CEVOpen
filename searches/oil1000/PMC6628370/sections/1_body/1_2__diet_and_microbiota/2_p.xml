<p class="p">The results of studies analyzing the microbial communities of the gut obtained from mammalian species have endorsed the assumption that diet can influence microbial diversity. Such diversity has been shown to increase from carnivores to omnivores and then to herbivores [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Regarding humans, the intestinal microbiota reflects predominant omnivorous habits, but substantial inconsistencies have been reported. For example, opposing patterns of the intestinal microbiota composition were reported when comparing samples from African children living in rural communities with children from a European urban center, a phenomenon that has been attributed to dietary differences [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In this case, in terms of health issues, individuals from the European urban center are expected to be at increased risk for the development of several immune-mediated disorders. Such diseases, likely including IBD, are probably associated with the microbiome structure, often resulting from dietary incompatibilities between the current environments and those in which humans evolved.
