<p class="p">Previous studies have analyzed the gut microbiota of infants and children within one population, but few have attempted to compare the microbial composition considering distinct socio-economic, geographic, and cultural aspects [

To analyze the potential effect of environmental factors on defining how and from where a gut microbiota may be acquired, investigators characterized bacterial species and gene contents of fecal samples from a cohort of healthy Amerindians from Venezuela, rural Malawian communities, and metropolitan USA inhabitants. The investigators found that bacterial diversity increases with age, and the degree of similarity among members of a family is consistent in all three populations. The fecal microbiota of USA adults was the least diverse compared to the others [

Therefore, it appears that differences in social structures and cultural traditions known to impact food and many other environmental factors may also condition the magnitude of the circulation of microbes among members of a family or community.
