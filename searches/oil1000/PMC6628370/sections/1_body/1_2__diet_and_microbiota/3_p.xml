<p class="p">The Western style of diet, defined by high caloric content due to large amounts of fat and carbohydrates, has been associated with a markedly reduced microbiome diversity [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In addition to the plethora of fat, Western diets usually have high concentrations of dietary omega-6 fatty acids, from vegetable oils, resulting in a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. Whereas omega-3 fatty acids, such as a-linolenic acid from vegetables and eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid from fish, have anti-inflammatory properties, omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, are considered pro-inflammatory. This may explain why the Western diet has been regarded as a key factor for producing intestinal inflammation [
