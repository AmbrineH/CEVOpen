<p class="p">Given practical concerns and clinical limitations, other research groups have employed a different strategy based on the combination of partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with a specific exclusion diet granting access to whole foods. The diet was evaluated in a retrospective cohort of children and young adults with mild-to-moderate CD, and remission was achieved in 70% of patients. Clinical improvement was followed by the reduction in ESR and CRP and was associated with mucosal healing [

Afterward, this diet—low in animal fat, rich in complex carbohydrates, and with a moderate exposure to soluble fiber—was evaluated for the induction of remission in children and adults failing biologics. More than 60% of the patients achieved clinical remission, with a marked decrease in inflammatory markers [
