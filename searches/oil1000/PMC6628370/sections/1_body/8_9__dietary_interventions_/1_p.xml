<p class="p">Simple dietary interventions usually improve gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBD, including a reduction in the ingestion of dairy products and also fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPS) [
 <xref rid="B161-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. More recent data have demonstrated the possible roles of specific dietary therapy in IBD. For example, dietary therapies, such as exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), have been successfully used to induce remission in early or new-onset CD [
 <xref rid="B162-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. Theoretically, EEN involves the isolated use of medical formulas in a liquid form without exposure to other foods, usually for six to eight weeks [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This strategy is apparently more feasible in the pediatric population, in contrast to adults. Investigations have demonstrated that EEN may induce remission in more than 60% of children with CD followed by a significant reduction in inflammatory markers, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin [

Grover et al. conducted a prospective open label study to assess mucosal healing before and after eight weeks of EEN, and concluded that the therapy is effective for inducing early clinical, biochemical, mucosal, and transmural remission, and was associated with improved outcomes at one year [
