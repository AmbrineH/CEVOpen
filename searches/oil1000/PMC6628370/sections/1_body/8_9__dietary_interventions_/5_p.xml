<p class="p">The nutritional theories of IBD pathogenesis involving carbohydrates, for example, have been based on the increasing evidence of the beneficial effects of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in the treatment of both CD and UC, resulting in improvement in clinical parameters and inflammatory biomarkers [

The hypothesis that carbohydrate variation increases the predisposition to IBD has been supported by the evidence of resultant immune dysfunction, mucosal barrier defects, and dysbiosis, which are represented by the Westernized dietary features [

 <xref rid="B187-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>]. Paleo is also an exclusion diet, supposedly representing habits of the Paleolithic era, consisting of a non-cereal, plant-based diet, including non-domesticated meats, and a low intake of carbohydrates, which are taken from a monotonous source. The rational for the use of carbohydrate monotony derives from the usually lower prevalence of IBD in rural or less developed communities consuming locally-produced seasonal products [
