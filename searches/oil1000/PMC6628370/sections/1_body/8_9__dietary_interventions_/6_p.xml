<p class="p">In terms of dietary supplements, vitamin D appears to have a role in IBD. Vitamin D3 (animal sources and skin exposure to ultraviolet light) and vitamin D2 (plant sources) are first hydroxylated in the liver, and then in the kidney and extrarenal tissues, including intestinal macrophages, into the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The active vitamin D binds to its specific receptor in different tissues, including immune cells, modulating gene expression. Vitamin D deficiency has been frequently seen in patients with IBD; therefore, it has been regarded as a protective factor against disease development [

In another clinical investigation, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, dietary supplementation with 1200 IU vitamin D3 daily for 12 months significantly increased the vitamin D levels, but only modestly reduced the risk of disease relapse [
