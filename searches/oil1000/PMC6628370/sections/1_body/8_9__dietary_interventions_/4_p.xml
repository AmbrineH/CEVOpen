<p class="p">Although the most consistent studies regarding dietary interventions in IBD usually refer to CD, previous systematic evaluations performed by independent groups have supported the potential beneficial effects of diet in both CD and UC according to patientsâ€™ perceptions [

In an observational prospective cohort study, patients with UC in clinical remission were followed for one year to investigate the effect of diet on disease relapse. The investigators identified an increased risk of UC relapses associated with the consumption of meat (particularly red and processed meat), eggs, and alcoholic beverages, which have been attributed to the high dietary content of sulfur [
