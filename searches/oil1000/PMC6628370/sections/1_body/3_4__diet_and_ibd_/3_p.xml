A reduced production of SCFAs, which are promoted by the presence of dietary fiber, has been shown in UC and CD. Particularly in patients with UC, a deficient production of SCFAs has been shown, and could not be corrected by increasing the intake of wheat bran-associated fiber and high amylose-associated-resistant starch [
