<p class="p">Data have confirmed that food plays a crucial role in the gut microenvironment, and modifications of dietary habits may have an important impact on the microbial composition and function, but also on the gut barrier and immunity [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that modifications in a single food group might produce various outcomes. For instance, changing the dietary composition from a predominant plant- to animal-based diet results in a change in the intestinal microbial environment and functionality, determining alterations in bile acids and sulfide metabolism, which have been implicated in IBD pathogenesis [

In an experimental study, investigators demonstrated that a low-fiber diet induces the expansion and activity of colonic mucous-degrading microorganisms, potentially favoring the development of severe colitis by enteric pathogens [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In another experimental study, mice fed a Western-style diet (rich in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates, but depleted in dietary fiber), developed an alteration in the colonic microbiota, resulting in increased permeability and a reduced inner mucus layer. Both defects could be prevented by transplanting microbiota from chow-fed mice, whereas the administration of

 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. These findings suggest that specific bacteria are crucial for normal mucus and barrier function and, in humans, this information could help us to understand important mechanisms underlying IBD pathogenesis.
