<p class="p">To investigate the mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet, an intervention with two different diets, one rich in nuts and the other one in extra-virgin olive oil, was conducted. The evaluation of the methylation status of peripheral white blood cells genes showed that both diets influenced methylation, characteristically of genes such as 
 <italic class="italic">CPT1B</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GNAS</italic> involved in intermediate metabolism, inflammation, and the signal transduction process. Therefore, the investigators concluded that the expected beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet, supplemented with nuts or extra-virgin olive oil, could be mediated, at least in part, through epigenetic modifications [
