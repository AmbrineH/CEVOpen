<p class="p">Currently, among the environmental factors, dietary factors were found to be powerful stimuli, being associated with peculiar patterns of gene expression and epigenetic signatures [
 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. For instance, the diet supplies substrates for DNA methylation and can regulate the enzymatic activity required in the one-carbon cycle. Consequently, elements such as folate, choline, and water-soluble B vitamins have been implicated in methylation patterns [
 <xref rid="B123-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>,
 <xref rid="B127-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>], which are essential elements for the synthesis and repair of DNA that modulate gene expression [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Experimental evidence obtained also supports the idea that dietary nutraceuticals possess potential as epigenetic modulators. For example, data from studies involving DNA methylation and chromatin repair indicate that polyphenols can regulate gene expression [
 <xref rid="B129-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Polyphenols are secondary plant metabolites, common components of vegetables, fruits, green tea, and red wine, and have been recognized for their antioxidant properties. In addition, studies have shown beneficial effects of polyphenols through the modulation of NF-ÎºB expression, and chromatin remodeling via the modulation of histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferase activities, reversing altered gene expression [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-11-01398" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. In experimental IBD, resveratrol, a natural phenolic compound, was shown to decrease inflammatory cytokines and profibrotic factors, supporting a potential therapeutic benefit [
