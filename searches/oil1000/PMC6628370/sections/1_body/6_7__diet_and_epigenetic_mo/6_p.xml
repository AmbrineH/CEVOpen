<p class="p">In addition to the direct effects of dietary constituents on epigenetic modifications in human intestinal tissues, the resident microbiota has been shown to alter host histone acetylation and methylation. In this regard, particularly short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, mostly produced by the microbial fermentation of fiber, appear to play a critical role in the epigenetic control of the inflammatory response. In a diet poor in fiber, the inhibition of SCFA production was correlated with disturbed chromatin effects, which were restored following supplementation with SCFA [
