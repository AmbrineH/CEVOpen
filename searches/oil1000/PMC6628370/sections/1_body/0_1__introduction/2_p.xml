<p class="p">Information derived from epidemiological studies has revealed consistent associations between the increase in the occurrence in IBD and other autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, and the decline in infectious diseases, accompanied by the use of antibiotics, immunizations, and overall improvements in sanitary conditions and the quality of water [

Among all the environmental changes usually associated with IBD, dietary habits are one element, both from the patientsâ€™ perspective, including personal observations and common practical concerns, and due to scientific evidence implicating diet as a triggering factor in disease relapses [
