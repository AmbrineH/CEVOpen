<p class="p">Epidemiological studies investigating the South Asian population indicate that the incidence and prevalence of adult IBD are significantly lower than in North America or the U.K. [

In another similar study analyzing a migrant group to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of IBD, Middle Eastern migrants to Australia had a significantly higher risk compared with the Caucasian population. The results, including the analysis of additional exposures such as smoking, antibiotic usage, and hygiene markers, suggested that migrants might be more sensitive to environmental challenges influencing the gut microbiome [

This thought is further supported by the results of a population-based study in the Asia-Pacific area in which the investigators suggested that early childhood factors and markers of altered intestinal microbiota may modulate the risk of IBD later in life [
