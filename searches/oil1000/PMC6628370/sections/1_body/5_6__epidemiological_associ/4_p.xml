<p class="p">Another study analyzing an Asian population combined a series of Chinese patients with IBD with the sequences from RISK and PRISM cohorts of IBD patients from the United States for a meta-analysis comparing gut microbiome profiles across ethnic groups. The investigators found that the gut dysbiosis observed in IBD is similar among Chinese and Western populations [

This may lead to the question of whether the gut microbiota provides universal biomarkers in IBD regardless of ethnicity. Results from another study suggest the existence of diverse gut microbial taxa with differential patterns of abundance common to various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), including IBD [

These findings appear to corroborate the possible use of microbial taxa patterns as biomarkers for the detection and diagnosis of IBD, but also support the idea that the gut microbiota may constitute a common component of the etiology of IMIDs.
