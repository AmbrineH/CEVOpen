<p class="p">The observation that the risk of developing IBD increases when people move from a low-risk to high-risk area appears to further support the role of environmental factors in the detriment of genetic predisposition, and reinforces the utility of studies examining immigration. For example, distinct investigations showed that immigrants to Israel had a higher prevalence of IBD than populations born in Israel [

Another population-based study demonstrated that in Sweden, a high incidence region, second-generation but not first-generation immigrants developed IBD at rates comparable to the native Swedish population. These results appear to underscore the importance of early-life exposures in determining disease initiation [
