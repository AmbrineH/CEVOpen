<p class="p">Gentamicin and ampicillin were chosen as antibacterial agents, while amphotericin B was chosen as antifungal. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic largely used for the treatment and prevention of severe Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, its severe side effects (oto- and nephrotoxicity) limit its use. In addition, psychiatric symptoms related to gentamicin (confusion, anorexia, depression, disorientation and visual hallucinations) may occur.</p>
