<p class="p">Plant essential oils (EOs) have been examined in detail for their pharmacological properties and may constitute a promising source for new natural drugs [

 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Currently, approximately 3000 EOs are known of which 300 are commercially available in the agronomic, alimentary, sanitary and pharmaceutical fields [

 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Plant-derived EOs are natural mixtures of a certain complexity. At times, they may contain more than 100 components at quite different concentrations. These components encompass two groups of distinct biosynthetic origin: the main group includes terpenes and terpenoids, while the other one includes aromatic and aliphatic constituents with low molecular weight [
 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Plausibly, the presence of all these compounds in the EOs explains the absence of microbial resistance or adaptation to their pharmacological properties. Thus, EOs constitute an effective alternative or complementary therapy to synthetic compounds, without manifesting the same side effects [
