<p class="p">FICI values for the association with gentamicin and ampicillin were, respectively, in the range of 0.07–0.46 and 0.13–0.65 against all tested bacterial strains. It is also interesting to underline that the MIC value for gentamicin is markedly reduced when combined with 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO, as the MIC value for this particular association was found to be more than 30-fold lower against six out of the ten bacteria strains considered. The most interesting result was obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633 for which the MIC value of gentamicin was found to have decreased from 0.5 to 0.01 μg/mL (FICI = 0.07). Moreover, a promising result was obtained also against 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> ATCC 19606, a Gram-negative bacillus resistant to treatment with gentamicin alone. In this case, a 16-fold reduction of gentamicin MIC (FICI = 0.46) was observed when used with 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO. The strong synergy observed between gentamicin and the EO against the Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 and 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC</italic> 19833 is worthy of note. In particular, the MICc value for gentamicin is much lower than that normally required to achieve the direct inhibition of bacterial growth (MICc: 0.06 μg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic> MICo: 2 μg/mL, MICc: 1 μg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic> MICo: 32 μg/mL). Associations of ampicillin with 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO showed a marked synergistic effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli ATCC</italic> 25922 (FICI = 0.08) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtili</italic>s ATCC 6633 (FICI = 0.13). Results for the associations with antifungals are reported in
