 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. An isobole is an “iso-effect” curve, in which a combination of constituents is represented on a graph, whose axises represent the inhibitory doses of the individual agents. If the agents do not interact, the isobole (the line joining the points representing the combination to the points on the dose axises representing the individual doses with the same effect as the combination) will be a straight line. If the effect is additive, the curve of the isobole will be a “concave” line, thus indicating that the agents in the mixture are synergic. When the opposite occurs, a “convex” line will result, showing antagonism. In other words, the same biological effects of the isolated agents are obtained at lower (or higher) doses than those observed for the mixture. Our graphs indicate, indeed, a high synergism against all the bacteria and yeast strains examined. The synergistic or antagonistic relationship between antimicrobials may result from competition for a possible primary target [
 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Conversely, a synergistic multi-target effect may occur, involving enzymes, substrates, metabolites and proteins, receptors, ion channels, transport proteins, ribosomes, DNA/RNA and physicochemical mechanisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. An alternative explanation may be that the interaction between different compounds may lead to changes in the structural conformation, and it may result in the reduction of the inhibitory activity. However, it is difficult to elucidate the exact mechanism of the synergistic effect without further investigation. In order to assess the impact of

 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. 27 components have been identified in the pure EO, 20 of which corresponded to 97.64% of the mixture. Menthol was found to be the major component, amounting to 68% of the mixture. The composition of the EO has been summarized in
