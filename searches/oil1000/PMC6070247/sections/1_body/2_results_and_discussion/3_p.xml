<p class="p">A synergistic antifungal action was observed when 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO was combined with fluconazole, amphotericin B or miconazole against yeast strains under study. FICI values close to 0.4 were found for amphotericin B and fluconazole, whereas they ranged between 0.23 and 0.46 for miconazole. It is interesting to note that this association had a strong synergistic effect against the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guilliermondii</italic> spp.. On the whole, the synergistic antimicrobial action demonstrated by combining 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO with antifungals was less pronounced against yeast strains than that of antibacterial agents combined with the same EO against bacteria strains. The synergistic interaction between

 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> EO and the most promising antimicrobials, gentamicin and miconazole, is shown in
