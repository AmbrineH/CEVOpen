 <xref rid="pone.0200902.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] demonstrated that monoterpenes contained in the EOs interact with model membranes and that their antimicrobial effect may be attributed to a damage sustained by the microbial lipid membrane fraction. The Gram-negative outer membrane has a strong negative charge conferred to it by the lipopolysaccharide, which is connected to lipid composition and to the net surface charge of the microbial membrane. The lower synergistic effect observed on yeasts may be attributed to a negative interaction with the antifungal drugs.
