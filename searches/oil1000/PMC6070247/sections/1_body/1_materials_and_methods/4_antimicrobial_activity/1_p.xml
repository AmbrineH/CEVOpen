<p class="p">For antibacterial tests, a stock solution (EO/Ethanol 1:2.5, 40% v/v with Tween 80, 0.1%) was diluted 1:20 in MHB to obtain a 2% (v/v) final solution. Doubling dilutions of the EO from 2% to 0.015% for EO were prepared directly in 96 well microtiter trays in MHB. After the addition of 0.02 mL of the inoculum, the microtiter trays were incubated at 36Â°C for 24 h. The final concentration of ethanol was 1.5% (v/v). The MHB medium 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 and ethanol 1.5%, (without EO) was used as a positive growth control.</p>
