<p class="p">Preparation of the EO for the antifungal tests followed the same procedure as the one for the antibacterial tests. A small quantity of inoculum was dissolved in RPMI 2% glucose and then spectrophotometrically adjusted to 0.5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> to 2.5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/mL (McFarland, turbidity standard). The initial inocula were confirmed by plating serial dilutions and determining the colony counts. A total of 0.1 mL of each yeast suspension was dispensed into serially diluted wells containing the drugs or the EO, achieving final drug concentration. After the addition of 0.1 mL of inoculum, the plates were incubated at 36°C for 48 h. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the mixtures at which no visible growth of the fungal strains could be detected compared to their growth in the negative control well. MIC values are given in mg/mL and μg/mL for
