<p class="p">For chemical characterization, a standard solution of 100 μL of the pure EO in 1 mL of ethyl acetate was prepared. The solution was filtered and 1 μL was analyzed by GC/MS. The sample was analyzed in triplicate. Qualitative analysis was executed comparing the calculated Linear Retention Indices (LRI) and Similarity Index Mass Spectra (SI/MS) for the obtained peaks with the analogous data from NIST2011 and Adams 4th ed. (2007) databases. LRI of each compound was obtained by temperature programming analysis and was determined in relation to an homologous series of
