<p class="p">The gas chromatographic analyses have been performed on HP GC/MS 6890N-5973N MSD HP ChemStation equipped with autosampler and HP-5MS column (crosslinked 5% PH ME siloxane) 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm Film Thickness. The following temperature program was applied: 40°C (4 min), 4°C per minute heating up to 280°C (30 min). The mass spectrometer was operated in EI mode at 70 eV; the ion source temperature was 220°C. The mass spectra were measured in the range of 35–360 amu.</p>
