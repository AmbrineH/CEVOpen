<p class="p">This method was used to mix each antimicrobial compounds dilution with the appropriate concentrations of EO in order to obtain a series of concentration combinations of the EO with each particular drug. In our experimental protocol, the substance combinations were analysed by calculating the FIC index (FICI) as follows: FIC of the EO plus FIC of the drug. Generally, the FICI value was interpreted as: i) a synergistic effect when ≤ 0.5; ii) an additive or indifferent effect when &gt; 0.5 and &lt;1; iii) an antagonistic effect when &gt; 1 [

The concentrations prepared accounted for 40%, 20%, 10%, and 5% of the MIC value for the EO, and 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.12% of the MIC value for the antibiotic. Also, the combination of two components is shown graphically in a Cartesian diagram by applying the isobole method. The non-interaction of the two components results in a straight line, whereas the occurrence of an interaction is shown by a concave isobole [
