 <p class="p">The interaction 
  <italic class="italic">Spodoptera exigua</italic> Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) × its natural enemies 
  <italic class="italic">Cotesia flavipes</italic> Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and 
  <italic class="italic">Podisus maculiventris</italic> Say (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) × botanical compounds with and without synergist is unknown; therefore, it was studied under controlled conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct mortality of 
  <italic class="italic">P. maculiventris</italic> nymphs and adults and indirect by this predator feeding on 
  <italic class="italic">S. exigua</italic> larvae treated after being exposed to parasitism by 
  <italic class="italic">C. flavipes</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">Brassica nigra</italic> L. (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) and 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> L. (Zingiberales: Zingiberaceae) compounds, with and without lead (II) oxide (PbO), were tested as insecticides. The mortality of first and second instars 
  <italic class="italic">P. maculiventris</italic> was high with turmeric essential oil by topical application. The PbO increased the predator mortality in combination with turmeric powder, crude essential oil, and 
  <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone. This last derivative caused also the highest mortality of 
  <italic class="italic">P. maculiventris</italic> nymphs when ingested through treated 
  <italic class="italic">S. exigua</italic> larvae that were previously subjected to parasitism. Turmeric powder and its derivatives, with and without PbO, should not be used in areas with 
  <italic class="italic">P. maculiventris</italic> due to the high mortality caused to this predator.
