<p class="p">The mortality of predatory spined soldier bug nymphs and adults treated with turmeric powder, its derivatives (
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, essential oil, and curcuminoid pigments), and black mustard seed essential oil solutions with or without PbO as a synergist was assessed. The mortality of nymphs and adults of this predator fed on treated beet armyworm larvae after being exposed to parasitism by 
 <italic class="italic">C. flavipes</italic> was also evaluated. There is little information about the mortality caused by turmeric powder, its derivatives, and black mustard seed essential oil to nontarget organisms such as generalist predators including the predatory spined soldier bug. There is almost no information on the mortality of the predatory spined soldier bug fed on beet armyworm larvae subjected to parasitism by 
 <italic class="italic">C. flavipes</italic> and postly treated with solutions of these botanicals.
