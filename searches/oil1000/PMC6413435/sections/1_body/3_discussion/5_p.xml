<p class="p">The consumption of treated larvae, subjected to parasitism by 
 <italic class="italic">C. flavipes</italic>, by the predatory spined soldier bug suggests mortality of the parasitoid by the insecticides, because heteropteran predators avoid preying on parasitized larvae.

 </sup> The faster dying of the predatory spined soldier bug with the positive control, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, and black mustard seed essential oil in the current study shows knockdown effect of these products to the predator. However, this mortality could be reduced because host larvae parasitized by 
 <italic class="italic">Cotesia</italic> species increase the CYP activity.

 </sup> The higher mortality of the confused flour beetle
