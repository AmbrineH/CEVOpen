<p class="p">The high synergism of PbO in turmeric powder, crude essential oil, and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone solutions through topical application on predatory spined soldier bug nymphs and adults suggests blockade of the metabolic system of detoxifying enzymes of this insect.

 </sup> The PbO increased the toxicity of turmeric powder and its derivatives (90-97% mortality) in most binary combinations (5 μg of turmeric powder or its derivatives + 5 μg PbO). The 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone compound alone or in combination with PbO reduced the weight of cabbage looper larvae on treated 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica oleracea</italic> L. (Brassicaceae) plants under laboratory and greenhouse conditions compared to the negative control (pure acetone).

 </sup> The combination of permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide) and PbO inhibited CYP activity by 81% and reduced the longevity period of the itch mite
