 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H, 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements were carried out on a Bruker Avance III 500 instrument (Bruker Corporation, Germany) (operating at 500.13 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H) equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance broadband inverse probe head with Z-gradient. Deuterated chloroform was used as solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph (GC-17A Shimadzu, GC-MS/QP5,000 Shimadzu, DB-5 column; 30 × 0.32 mm), with ionization by electronic impact, under the following conditions: 60°C for three min; 5 to 240°C for eight min, with an injector of 180°C, a detector of 260°C, and an injection of 1 L. Mass spectra were compared with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Database 62.
