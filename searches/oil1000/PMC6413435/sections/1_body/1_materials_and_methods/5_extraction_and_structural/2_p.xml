<p class="p">An aliquot of the turmeric powder was reserved for bioassays and part of the remainder extracted by steeping in hexane freshly distilled at 25 ± 3°C with occasional stirring for a 6-hour period. Five hundred grams of rhizome powder were extracted with 1-L hexane. The solution obtained was filtered and the solvent removed in a rotary evaporator under low pressure, yielding a light yellow oil (= crude essential oil). Some volatile compounds in the turmeric crude essential oil include atlantone, turmerone, and zingiberene.</p>
