<p class="p">Turmeric rhizomes were obtained from a commercial crop grown on the Macaúba Farm in Catalão, Goiás State, Brazil (18º08´ S, 47º57´ W, 515 m above sea level). Five large plants, lacking diseases and pests, were aleatorely selected within the crop. The soil was dug with a hoe until rhizomes became visible. Entire plants were harvested and the rhizomes cut from the plants with a scalpel. The rhizomes were placed in a polystyrene box lined with ice cubes and brought to a laboratory, where they were washed in running water, dried, and stored at 2°C. This farm uses no synthetic pesticides for their produce.</p>
