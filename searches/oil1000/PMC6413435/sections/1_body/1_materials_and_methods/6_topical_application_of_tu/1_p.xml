<p class="p">Ten nymphs each of first, second, third, fourth, or fifth instar, or 10 1-day-old predatory spined soldier bug adults were placed per Petri dish (90 × 15 mm). The insect dorsum was treated each with 2 µL ethanolic solutions of turmeric powder, its derivatives (crude essential oil, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, or curcuminoid pigments), or black mustard seed essential oil at 1, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125% (m/m; 1:1 ratio) plus or minus PbO using a microsyringe equipped with a dispenser (Trajan Scientific and Medical, Austin, Texas, USA).
