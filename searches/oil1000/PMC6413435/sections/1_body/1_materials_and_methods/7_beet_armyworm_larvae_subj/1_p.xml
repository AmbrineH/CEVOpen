 </sup> The larvae (five days old) that were subjected to parasitism were then dipped for one second into each ethanolic solution of turmeric powder, its derivatives (crude essential oil, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, or curcuminoid pigments), or black mustard seed essential oil at 1% (m/m) using a forcep. The 1-second period was used because it was sufficient to wet uniformly without causing mortality of larvae according to a preliminary test. The preliminary test evaluated the wet uniformity and mortality of three day old beet armyworm larvae after being dipped into pure ethanol for one, two, and three seconds. Treated larvae were introduced in Petri dishes each with 10 second, third, fourth, or fifth instar, or 10 1-day-old predatory spined soldier bug adults. A 5 g cube 
 <italic class="italic">S. exigua</italic> artificial diet was placed per Petri dish and replaced after dried being or consumed. Cannibalism and natural dead or consumed larvae were replaced by fresh ones for feeding from the same treatment. Absolute ethanol and Schultz Insecticide, Houseplant &amp; Indoor Garden Insect Spray were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The predatory spined soldier bug mortality was assessed per Petri dish every 24 h for five consecutive days.
