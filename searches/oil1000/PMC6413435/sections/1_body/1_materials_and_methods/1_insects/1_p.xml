<p class="p">Predatory spined soldier bug was obtained from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology (CMAVE), in Tallahassee, FL. This predator was reared in metal cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm) and fed yellow mealworm larvae

 </sup> All insects were reared under controlled environmental conditions at 25 ± 2°C, 70 ± 5% RH, and a 12:12-h (light:dark) photoperiod. Predatory spined soldier bug first, second, third, fourth, and fifth instars, and 1-day-old adults, three days old beet armyworm larvae, and parasitoid adults were obtained after daily observations on the colonies of these insects.
