 </sup> Consequently, the impact of turmeric powder, its derivatives, and black mustard seed essential oil solutions in this interaction is also unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mortality caused by turmeric powder, its derivatives (
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, essential oil, and curcuminoid pigments), and black mustard seed essential oil solutions with or without PbO as a synergist to the predatory spined soldier bug nymphs and adults. The mortality of nymphs and adults of this predator fed on treated beet armyworm larvae after being exposed to parasitism by 
 <italic class="italic">C. flavipes</italic>, was also evaluated.
