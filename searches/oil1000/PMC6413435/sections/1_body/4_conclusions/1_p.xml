<p class="p">The mortality of the second and third instar predatory spined soldier bug by topical application of turmeric essential oil without synergist was high. It suggests that this compound should not be used in integrated pest management programs with these instars. However, the fourth and fifth instars and adults of this predator survived after being treated through topical application of turmeric powder and its derivatives without synergist regardless of the concentration. The fourth and fifth instars and adults of this predator should be selected for releasing activities in areas treated with turmeric-based insecticides. As expected, the synergist PbO enhanced the toxic effect (eg, mortality) of turmeric powder, crude essential oil, and

 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-Turmerone showed knockdown effect to the predator by its ingestion through treated beet armyworm larvae that were previously exposed to parasitism.
