<p class="p">The ferric reducing capacity of EOs was determined by using the potassium ferricyanide-ferric chloride method [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The sample concentration providing 0.5 of absorbance (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated by plotting absorbance at 700â€‰nm against the corresponding sample concentration.
