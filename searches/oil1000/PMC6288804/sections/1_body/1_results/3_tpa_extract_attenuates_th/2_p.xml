<p class="p">Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to test the spatial learning and memory ability of mice. As shown in

 </xref>A, during the five training days, the escape latency of all the groups declined progressively. This suggests that with continuous learning, the learning ability of each group increased. However, compared with the other groups, the LPS model mice spent a longer period finding the platform. Especially, on the third to fifth days, the escape latency of the model mice was significantly longer than that of the control mice (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively). These results show that the LPS-treated mice had significant cognitive impairment. Moreover, piracetam (0.4 g/kg)-treated and TPA (1 and 2 g/kg)-treated mice showed a significant shortened escape latency compared with the model mice on the fifth day (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively). In the probe trial, the platform was removed. As shown in

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared with the control group. Compared with the model group, piracetam-treated and TPA (1 and 2 g/kg)-treated mice showed significant increase in both the time spent in the quadrant of the platform and the number of crossing counts (both
