<p class="p">To obtain the TPA extract of hempseed, the dried hempseed was defatted with petroleum ether and extracted with 70% EtOH. The crude extract was subjected to an D101 macroporous adsorption resin column using H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 75%, and 95% EtOH successively as eluents. Finally, the 75% EtOH fraction was collected and concentrated. HPLC technology was used to study the chemical composition of the TPA extract.
