 </xref>, most compounds in the hempseed extract were identified. Therefore, the content of TPA in the extract was quantified by summing up the contents of the identified 14 compounds. Because the UV spectra of compounds 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> were similar to that of cannabisin A (CA) and those of the others were similar to that of

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caffeoyltyramine (NC), we quantified the two kinds of compounds using CA and NC as reference compounds, respectively. The standard curves of CA and NC are given in

The content of the 14 compounds was calculated based on their measured peak area. As shown in
