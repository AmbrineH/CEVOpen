Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis indicated that exposure to LPS significantly increased the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the brain compared with the control group (all

The results show that a low dose of TPA (1 g/kg) and piracetam inhibited the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines in the brain in an LPS-induced neuroinflammation model, but a high dose of TPA may induce toxicity and counteract its role in inhibiting inflammatory cytokines production.
