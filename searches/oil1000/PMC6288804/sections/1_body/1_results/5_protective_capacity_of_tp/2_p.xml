 </xref>, hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining indicated that the intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 μg/kg/day) for 7 days caused neuronal damage. In the LPS model group, this was observed as dark-stained and deformed neurons, clearly identified in the hippocampal CA3 region. However, there were no evident neuronal morphological alterations in the TPA groups and the piracetam group, indicating that TPA and piracetam can alleviate LPS-induced neuronal damage.
