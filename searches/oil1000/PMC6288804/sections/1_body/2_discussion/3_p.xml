<p class="p">The results showed that TPA treatment significantly improved the learning and memory of LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice, and significantly improved their cognitive function. Low-dose TPA significantly reduced the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the brains of LPS-induced mice. From the observation of the morphology of hippocampal neurons in mice, it was found that TPA prevented damage to nerve cells in the hippocampal CA3 region induced by LPS, indicating that TPA has neuroprotective effects. However, as we can see in the experiment, the dose-dependent relation of TPA regarding the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the brains of LPS-induced mice was not as expected, suggesting that the safe and effective dose for TPA is less than 2 g/kg; this should be researched in more detail. According to the reports in literature,

 </sup> most studies use Swiss or ICR mice for modeling. Here, we have demonstrated that Kunming mice are also applicable to the LPS model. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory function of hempseed, including the use different mouse models and measuring more biomarkers.
