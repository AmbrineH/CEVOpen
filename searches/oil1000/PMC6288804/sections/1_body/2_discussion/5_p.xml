<p class="p">Overall, our previous study found that the phenylpropanamide compounds in hempseed have significant anti-neuroinflammatory activities at the cellular level. In this study, we established a mouse model of neuroinflammation induced by LPS and found that hempseed extract rich in phenylpropionamides possesses effective anti-neuroinflammatory activity. This neuroprotective function of hempseed makes it worth noting as a functional food.</p>
