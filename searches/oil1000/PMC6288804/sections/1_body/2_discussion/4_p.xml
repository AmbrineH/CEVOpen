<p class="p">Presently, fourteen phenylpropionamides have been identified from the extract, including caffeoyloctopamine, caffeoyltyramine, coumaroyltyramine, feryroyltyramine, cannabisins (A–F, M, N), grossamide, and demethyl-grossamide. In our previous cell-level screening test, most of them showed anti-neuroinflammatory activity in LPS-induced BV2 microglia cell, especially caffeoyltyramine, cannabisin F, G, M, and grossamide.

 </sup> Actually, some other phenylpropionamides of low content also showed good anti-neuroinflammatory activity,

 </sup> but they could not be identified and measured online from the extract because of their low content and lack of standard substances. We selected grossamide as a representative compound to study its anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism and found it able to significantly inhibit the LPS-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduce the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB subunit p65 in a concentration-dependent manner, and suppress the translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus, suggesting that grossamide could intervene the NF-κB signaling pathway.

 </sup> Further study still need to be done to elucidate the anti-neuroinflammatory contribution of hempseed constituents.
