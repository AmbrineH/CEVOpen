 </sup> investigated the effect of hempseed extracts prepared by different solvents (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol and aqueous) on mice with experimental Alzheimer’s disease and found that hempseed extracts conspicuously alleviated learning and memory ability, as well as improved brain tissue pathological changes in experimental dementia mice, whereas the ethyl acetate extract demonstrates a more prominent improvement than other extracts. According to our experience,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup> the ethyl acetate extract contains mainly ligananamide and other phenylpropionamides. This study obtained a hempseed extract containing mainly phenylpropionamides and described its chemical profile based on our phytochemical study on hempseed.
