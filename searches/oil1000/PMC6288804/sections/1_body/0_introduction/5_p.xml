<p class="p">The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of hempseed extract containing mainly phenylpropionamides. The phenylpropionamide fraction was enriched from hempseed and the chemical profile of the extract was obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technology based on our previous phytochemical study of hempseed. The total phenylpropanamides (TPA) content and representative constituents were measured. The anti-neuroinflammatory effects of the TPA extract were evaluated using an LPS-induced mouse model. This study demonstrates the nutraceutical potential of hempseed from a new perspective.</p>
