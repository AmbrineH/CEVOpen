<p class="p">Sixty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into five groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12/group), including control (1–3 weeks, 0.9% saline, 10 mL/kg/day), model (third week, 0.9% saline, 10 mL/kg/day), TPA (1–3 week, 1, 2 g/kg/day), and piracetam (2–3 week, 0.4 g/kg/day) treatment groups. Piracetam was used as a positive control due to its therapeutic effect on cognition in aging and dementia, as well as its ability to improve mitochondrial function to ameliorate the detrimental effects of Aβ on brain function.
