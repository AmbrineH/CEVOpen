<p class="p">After the MWM test, the animals (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6/group) were decapitated and the brain was rapidly moved on ice. Thereafter, each mouse brain was weighed, homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (with 1:100 PMSF, a protease inhibitor) to a concentration of 100 mg/mL, and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C for ELISA.
