<p class="p">To observe the histological changes in the hippocampus in the LPS-induced mice, the brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4 °C for 24 h. The brain specimens were paraffin-embedded and coronal sections were cut (4 μm thick) before mounting on silane-coated slides. The coronal sections were processed for HE staining according to a previously described method.
