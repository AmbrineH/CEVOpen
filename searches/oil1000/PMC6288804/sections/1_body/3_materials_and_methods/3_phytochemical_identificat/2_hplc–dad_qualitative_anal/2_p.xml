<p class="p">The 75% EtOH fraction was dissolved in methanol as the sample solution and analyzed by HPLC with a diode array detector (DAD) detector. Identification of the sample solution was performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a G-1315D DAD detector. The samples were separated through an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 5 μm; Agilent) using water (A)–acetonitrile (B) as the mobile phase, and detected under 280 nm at 25 °C. The gradient elution for the mobile phase was set as follows: 10% B at the beginning, 20% at 5 min, 30% at 25 min, 45% at 45 min, and 75% at 55 min. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 μL.
