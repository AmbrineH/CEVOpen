<p class="p">In the hidden-platform training session, the mice were allowed four daily trials in the presence of the platform for five subsequent days. In this session, the mice were placed in the pool facing the wall in one of the four quadrants. When the mouse located the platform, the time required to find the hidden escape platform (escape latency) was recorded and the mouse was allowed to stay on the platform for 15 s. If the mouse did not locate the platform within 90 s, it was placed on the platform for 15 s to familiarize it and the escape latency was considered to be 90 s. On day 6, the probe trial was performed. In this session, the platform was removed. The time spent in the target quadrant and the number of times that the mouse crossed the removed platform was recorded and analyzed during 90 s.</p>
