 </sup> The equipment consists of a black circular pool (120 cm in diameter, 50 cm in height), platform, and recording system. The pool was divided into four quadrants, and an invisible transparent platform (9 cm in diameter) was placed at the center of the second quadrant and submerged 1 cm below the water surface. A black edible pigment was added to the water, so the water was opaque. The water temperature was maintained at 22–24 °C. This behavioral task included hidden-platform training (spatial learning) and probe trial (spatial memory) sessions.
