<p class="p">The dried and crushed hempseed (3 kg) was first defatted with petroleum ether (25 L) under ultrasound for 1 h three times and then extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol (EtOH) under reflux (three times, 25 L Ã— 2 h). The ethanol solution was subsequently concentrated to 500 mL by evaporating in a vacuum. This solution was suspended in distilled water and subjected to a D101 macroporous adsorption resin column using H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 75%, and 95% EtOH successively to obtain the 75% EtOH fraction (41.2 g, 1.37%, extract of hempseed).
