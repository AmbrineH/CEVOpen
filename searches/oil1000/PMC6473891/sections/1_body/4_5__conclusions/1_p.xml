<p class="p">Food packaging is very important to protect foods from bacterial infection. Therefore, we should develop cheaper, safer food packaging to meet the fast-growing demand of the food industry. According to its inherent characteristics, polymer food packaging can be divided into two types: biodegradable and non-biodegradable. Although non-degradable food packaging is still the most commonly used material, their use is being reduced as a result of their environmental pollution. Therefore, in the long run, biodegradable food packaging is more promising because it is green, renewable, and environmentally friendly. </p>
