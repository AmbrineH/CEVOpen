<p class="p">First of all, new, safe, and highly effective antibacterial agents, such as synthetic antibacterial peptides, should be developed to obtain broad-spectrum activity of packaging materials with high antibacterial activity. Synthetic antimicrobial peptides not only have a good antibacterial activity against various bacteria, but also have the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and biodegradability [
