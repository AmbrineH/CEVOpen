<p class="p">As for antibacterial agents, they can also be divided into natural and synthetic materials. Although the toxicity of natural antibacterial agent is low, the production cost is high, which hinders their wide applications. Compared with natural antibacterial agents, Synthetic antibacterial packaging can inhibit the growth of bacteria more effectively. However, the toxicity of synthetic agents should not be ignored. Reducing the toxicity of synthetic material is also an important subject in need of further research. </p>
