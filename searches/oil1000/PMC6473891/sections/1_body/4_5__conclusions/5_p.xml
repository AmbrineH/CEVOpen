<p class="p">Second, the controlled release of antibacterial agents has become an important research direction, enabling the possibility of producing packaging materials with durable antibacterial properties. Introducing micro-nano structures, such as microcapsules and nanofibers, to packing materials helps achieve gradual release and simultaneously maintains the mechanical properties of materials. </p>
