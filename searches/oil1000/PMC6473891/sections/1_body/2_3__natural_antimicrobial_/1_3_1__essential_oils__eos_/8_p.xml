Utilizing the advantages of electrospinning, they encapsulated tea tree oil (TTO) and beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) into poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) by electrospinning. After administering plasma treatment, they further determined the TTO antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> O157:H7 on beef at different temperatures for 7 days. They found that the antibacterial properties greatly increased after the plasma treatment, and an inhibition efficiency of 99.99% was obtained at 4 or 12 °C, suggesting that TTO can prolong the shelf life on beef. By incorporating cinnamon essential oil/β-cyclodextrin (CEO/β-CD) proteoliposomes into PEO nanofibers by electrospinning technique, the controlled release of CEO from proteoliposomes was achieved via proteolysis of protein in proteoliposomes (
