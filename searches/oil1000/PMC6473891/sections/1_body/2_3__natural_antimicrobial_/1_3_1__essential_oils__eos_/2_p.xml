<p class="p">EOs have been used in food packaging to extend shelf life. Three methods are employed to utilize EOs as antimicrobial agents: mixing EOs into basic materials, coating EOs onto food packages and loading EOs into an antibacterial pouch. Among these methods, mixing EOs with other polymers is commonly used because it is convenient and easily applied to mass production. Nowadays, environmental friendliness is the common trend of scientific research. Under this circumstance, EOs incorporated with biodegradable polymers, such as PLA, skate skin gelatin, and chitosan, are popular throughout the world.</p>
