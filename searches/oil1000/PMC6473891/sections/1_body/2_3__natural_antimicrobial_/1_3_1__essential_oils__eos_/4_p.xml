This new active packaging shows antimicrobial properties against yeasts and molds, and 5% and 10% of OEO are the most effective. The resulting film as an active food packaging exhibits suitable mechanical and physical properties with slight changes. Jouki et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] investigated the physical, thermal, barrier, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of Quince seed mucilage (QSM) films after OEO is incorporated. The film with 1% OEO has no effect on Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but strongly inhibits the growth of
