<p class="p">EOs also combine with nonbiodegradable polymers for easy production and processing. However, traditional processing methods have many limitations, resulting in the development of many new processing methods. Electrospinning is one of the most popular methods to prepare nanofibers. With an external electric field, polymer solutions or melting polymers can form nanofibers with diameters in the sub-micron range. This method has several advantages, such as high surface area and highly porous structure.</p>
