The incorporation of GFSE to biodegradable poly-ε-caprolactone increases the crystallinity of poly-ε-caprolactone and alginic acid [

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) without affecting film transparency. Increasing GFSE induces the tensile strength of chitosan-based composite films and improves the elongation at break of the films. Preliminary antifungal activity evaluation has demonstrated that chitosan-based composite films can retard fungal growth. They incorporated GFSE into a polyethylene film via co-extrusion or solution-coating process and tested the antimicrobial property of this film by applying it to ground beef at 3 °C. The composite film shows an enhanced antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms, including
