<p class="p">The antimicrobial mechanism of chitosan has been proposed to be mainly divided into three types. (I) Electrostatic attractions exist between positively charged chitosan chains and negatively charged bacterial cell walls, causing the absorption of chitosan onto the target bacteria. Thus, intracellular components tend to break down, leading to cell death. (II) The accumulation of chitosan can envelop the target bacteria, isolating the bacteria from the environment and inhibiting nutrient intake and exchange. (III) Chitosan has a chelating effect on metals and oligoelements, which are involved in antibacterial activity. Metals and oligoelements are essential for bacterial growth, and their absence results in bacterial death. The drawback of chitosan is its poor processing property, leading difficulty for chitosan to be processed into food packaging.</p>
