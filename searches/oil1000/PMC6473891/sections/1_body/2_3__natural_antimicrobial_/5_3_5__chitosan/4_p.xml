<p class="p">However, chitosan films have several disadvantages, including rapid dissolution in acidic solutions and poor mechanical properties as food packaging, especially in a wet environment. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] fabricated a biodegradable composite film containing silica, PVA and chitosan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00560-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The film is biodegradable, low cost, and high performing and can be used in food packaging. With 0.6 wt % SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the tensile strength of the PVA/ chitosan films is as high as 44.12 MPa and improved by 45% through hydrogen bonds between silica and PVA or chitosan. SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> also reduces the moisture and oxygen permeability of the food packaging films to retain freshness. The weight of PVA/chitosan decreases to 60% after 30 days in soil, suggesting its degradability compared with other nondegradable plastic food packages. The composite film is useful and had a promising for the future green, high-performance and environmentally friendly food packaging.
