<p class="p">As a biopolymer, chitosan has a good film forming ability and is easily used with other bioactive agents, giving chitosan good comprehensive properties. Rezaei et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] mixed two antimicrobial agents based on chitosan and cinnamon EO to fabricate a high-performance biodegradable film. The film not only shows increased antimicrobial activity, but also exhibits low affinity to water. These phenomena are the result of the combined effect between cinnamon EO components and the chitosan matrix. Chawla et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] prepared composite films from chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol containing mint extract/pomegranate peel extract. The addition of extracts improves the tensile strength of the films by up to 41.07 ± 0.88 MPa without affecting their puncture strength. The films also have good antioxidant properties provided by the extracts and antibacterial activity against

 <xref rid="B86-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] incorporated green tea extract into a chitosan film to develop active packaging for pork sausages. The film successfully inhibits the microbial growth at 4 °C, showing enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and providing food protection. Chitosan films with 0, 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 20%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> propolis extract have also been developed. Polyphenols are the main molecule in the propolis extract. The mechanical property and antioxidant activity of the film are greatly enhanced. They proposed that some interactions occur between chitosan and propolis extract, thereby increasing the antimicrobial properties of the films.
