<p class="p">The electrospinning of chitosan in the form of nanofibers is another promising process that has been widely explored. Ajji et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] fabricated chitosan-based nanofibers via electrospinning to prevent the spoilage of meat and the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. aureus and L. innocua.</italic> They demonstrated that antimicrobial property of chitosan-based fibers is based on the protonation of amino groups, and this observation is consistent with mechanism (I) of chitosan. They also found the following susceptibility order: 
 <italic class="italic">E.coli &gt; L.innocua &gt; S. aureus &gt; S. Tyohimurium</italic>, which was a guide for meat quality preservation.
