 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. MIC is the minimum concentration of drug that can inhibit the growth of certain microorganism, which is used for the quantitative determination of antibacterial activity in vitro. In terms of film forming ability, antibacterial ability, and biodegradability, chitosan is a good candidate for antibacterial packaging.
