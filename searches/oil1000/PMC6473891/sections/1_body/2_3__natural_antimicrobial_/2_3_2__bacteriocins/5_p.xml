<p class="p">In addition to the antimicrobial property of nisin, its release rates are essential for food preservation. Imran et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] studied the release rates of nisin from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), chitosan, sodium caseinate, and PLA films at the temperature of 4 and 40 Â°C in a water-ethanol solution. They found that HPMC has the largest nisin diffusion coefficient, whereas chitosan has the smallest diffusion coefficient. Temperature was proportional to the release rate.
