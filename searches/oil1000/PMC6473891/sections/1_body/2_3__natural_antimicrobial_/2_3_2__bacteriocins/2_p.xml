<p class="p">Nisin, an antibacterial peptide produced by a lactic acid bacterium and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactococcus lactics</italic>, is the most widely used bacteriocin in active food packaging. Nisin is used in more than 48 countries and approved by the USFDA. Nisin can inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of Gram-positive microorganisms, such as

 <xref rid="B53-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Nisin has both positive charges and hydrophobic groups. The positive charge causes electrostatic interaction between peptide and bacteriaâ€™s negatively charged cell membranes, allowing the antimicrobial peptide to attach to the bacterial cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B54-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Given that the bacterial cell membrane is also hydrophobic, the hydrophobic amino acid of antibacterial peptide can insert into bacterial cell, thereby changing the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane. Cellular substances, such as DNA, leak out of cells, causing bacterial death. Nisin can be easily combined with polymers to exhibit antimicrobial properties by coating on the polymer films or mixing with polymers and then producing films as food packages. Numerous studies have reported the effectiveness of insin-containing active packaging in preventing the growth of different food-borne bacteria.
