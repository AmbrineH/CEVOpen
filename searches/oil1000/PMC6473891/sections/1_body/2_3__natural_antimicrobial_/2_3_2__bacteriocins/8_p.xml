<p class="p">Pediocin is another commonly used bacteriocin, which is mainly derived from 
 <italic class="italic">pediococcus acidilactici</italic>. It is an unmodified small-molecule protein with good thermal stability, stable physicochemical properties, and broad antimicrobial spectrum, pediocin has a wide range of adaptability to temperature and pH. It can be degraded in the human body because of the nature of polypeptide, and can effectively inhibit various foodborne pathogenic bacteria. Thus, pediocin can be developed as a new generation of natural food preservatives [
