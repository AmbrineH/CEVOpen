<p class="p">Nisin can inhibit the growth of microbes and keep food fresh even at room temperature. For example, nisin has antimicrobial properties on the seasoned beef, which is a popular food in Korea [
 <xref rid="B57-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Seasoned beef is packaged and kept in storage for 60 days at low temperature (4 °C) and room temperature (25 °C). As a result, seasoned beef with nisin favors the slight increase in the growth of mesophilic microorganisms, whereas seasoned beef without nisin has a remarkable increase in the growth of these microorganisms. That means nisin has excellent antimicrobial properties, even at a room temperature. Nisin improves the mechanical properties of food packages, thereby contributing to the preservation of seasoned beef. Packages containing nisin slightly change in cutting force during storage at 25 °C, whereas packages without nisin show a remarkable decrease. Therefore, nisin is a promising antimicrobial agent widely used in food package.
