 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> displays a decrease in growth after 14 days of storage, indicating that the antimicrobial properties of food packaging are enhanced. They demonstrated that nisin can be added to cellulose films to fabricate a green and high-performance film. Bras et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] developed green and convenient cellulose fiber-based nisin used for antimicrobial food packaging. They studied the two different methods that can introduce nisin to food packages: mixing nisin with basic food packages and grafting nisin to basic food packages. Nisin-grafted carboxylated cellulose nanofibers show antimicrobial properties against various Gram-positive bacteria. Nisin mixing with cellulose nanofibers can kill
