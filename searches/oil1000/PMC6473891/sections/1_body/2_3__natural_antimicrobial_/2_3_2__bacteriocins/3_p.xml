 <xref rid="B55-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] evaluated the antibacterial activities of nisin, EDTA and lysozyme incorporated in a starch film-based food packaging film. They confirmed the effectiveness of the combined effect of antibacterial agents through antibacterial experiments, supporting the hypothesis that nisin and EDTA have a partial synergistic effect on antibacterial activities. Moradi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] fabricated a composite film containing chitosan, cellulose, and nisin and used it as an antimicrobial package of ultra-filtered (UF) cheese. The pure chitosan-cellulose film does not exhibit antimicrobial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, whereas a film incorporated with nisin shows a significant increase in the inhibitory effects on the 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, further demonstrating the antimicrobial properties of nisin. UF white cheese stored at 4 Â°C for 14 days packaged with a composite nisin film does not significantly change upon exposure to
