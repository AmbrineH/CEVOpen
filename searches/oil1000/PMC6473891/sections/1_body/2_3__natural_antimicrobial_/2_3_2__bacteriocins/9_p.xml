 <xref rid="B65-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] developed a cellulose matrix film with a high antimicrobial efficiency based on pediocin, which can inhibit the growth of the pathogenic bacteria. They stored ham slices for up to 15 days and found that films with 25% and 50% pediocin have a similar performance in terms of antimicrobial properties, that is, the films cause a 0.5 log cycle reduction after the ham slices are stored for 12 days. They also fabricated nanocomposite films containing pediocin and ZnO nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties against

 <xref rid="B66-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The addition of pediocin results in increased values of elongation at break. The presence of pediocin in nanocomposite films produces slightly yellowish films, which are balanced by ZnO nanoparticles incorporation, resulting in a whitish coloration.
