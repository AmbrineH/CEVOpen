<p class="p">As a volatile antimicrobial agent, AIT is expected to be gradually released into the atmosphere from packaging materials, thereby inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms on food surfaces. For this purpose, LDPE capsules containing AIT beads have been developed [
 <xref rid="B98-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. The effects of film thickness and temperature on release rate of AIT have been studied. As LDPE thickness decreases and temperature increases, the release of AIT increases obviously. The antibacterial test shows that the film inhibits the growth of

 <italic class="italic">E. coli O157:H7</italic> is 5.6 log CFU/leaf decreases by 1.6–2.6 log CFU/leaf at 4 °C within 5 days.
