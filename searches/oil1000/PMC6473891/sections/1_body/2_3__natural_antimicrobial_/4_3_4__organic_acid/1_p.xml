<p class="p">Organic acids, such as propionic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, sorbic acid, and tartaric acid, are commonly used as traditional food additives. Sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate have a GRAS status [
 <xref rid="B76-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], and they can inhibit the growth of bacterial and fungal cells [
 <xref rid="B70-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Sodium citrate inhibits the growth and reproduction of Listeria, bladder, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 [
 <xref rid="B77-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Sorbic acid and potassium sorbate show activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria and molds [
 <xref rid="B76-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. At pH from 6.0–6.5, the preservative effect of sorbic acid is 5–10 times more resistant than that of benzoate [
 <xref rid="B78-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Nano-scale benzoic acid and sorbic acid have better antibacterial properties than their non-nano-scale equivalent [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. As such, a small amount of nano-sized antimicrobial agents used in antimicrobial packaging can obtain acceptable antibacterial effects.
