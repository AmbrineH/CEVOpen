<p class="p">Numerous examples show that bacterial growth can be inhibited by organic acid-based food packaging and extend the shelf life of foods. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] developed antimicrobial EVOH films with sorbic acid-chitosan microcapsules (S-MPs) and applied them to fish fillets. In antimicrobial tests, the film inhibits the growth of

 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and prolongs the shelf life of fish fillets. In comparison with the addition of antibacterial agents directly to film, the incorporation of antibacterial agents by using the chitosan microcapsule can reduce the release rate of sorbic acid in films. Microcapsules incorporated with antibacterial and antioxidant active agents may offer a broad application prospect as food packaging materials.
