<p class="p">With the use of these organic acids and organic acidic salts in food packaging to extend shelf life, the antibacterial mechanism of organic acids has been studied. Organic acids have two forms: dissociated and undissociated. In a solution, the amount of organic acids undergoing dissociation and undissociation is in a dynamic equilibrium state. The unionized form of organic acids can cross the cell membrane and penetrate cells, and dissociate in cells to produce protons because of the high pH in cells. Bacterial cells consume energy to transport protons out of their cell membranes to keep the pH inside them at around 7. The transport of these protons exhausts all their energy in bacterial cells [
