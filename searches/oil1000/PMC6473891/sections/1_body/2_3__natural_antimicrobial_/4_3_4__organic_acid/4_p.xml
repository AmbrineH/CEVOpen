<p class="p">Starch-based films are a common and economical antimicrobial packaging materials. Lopez et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] incorporated potassium sorbate into different formulations of starch films at different pH levels. They found that starch type and pH change do not affect the kinetic release. The film can inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus and Salmonella</italic> spp. Applying this film to frozen cheese can extend its shelf life by 21%. Salleh and Muhamad [
 <xref rid="B82-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] fabricated antimicrobial packaging based on wheat starch containing lauric acid and chitosan, which act as the antimicrobial agents. They tested 
 <italic class="italic">B. substilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> to confirm the antimicrobial property of the multicomponent film and showed that the film more effectively inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">B. substilis</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in solid media or liquid culture, indicating that the multicomponent film used for food packaging has a better effect on 
 <italic class="italic">B. substilis</italic>. Therefore, it can be used to protect fresh food from bacterial attack.
