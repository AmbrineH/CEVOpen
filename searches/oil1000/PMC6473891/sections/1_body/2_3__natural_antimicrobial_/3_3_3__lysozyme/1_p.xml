<p class="p">Lysozyme, an important class of enzyme, is a hydrophilic monopeptide chain [
 <xref rid="B68-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. It can inhibit bacterial infections, especially those caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial activity of lysozyme is due to its ability to hydrolyze the beta-1â€“4 glycosidic bonds between
