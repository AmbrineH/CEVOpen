<p class="p">Numerous studies have been performed to develop food packaging materials based on antimicrobial enzymes immobilization by physical blending or chemical bonding. For example, an antimicrobial active packaging based on lysozyme is prepared via the solâ€“gel route by using PET as a matrix to develop packaging films with controlled release properties [
 <xref rid="B71-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The film shows an antimicrobial activity against
