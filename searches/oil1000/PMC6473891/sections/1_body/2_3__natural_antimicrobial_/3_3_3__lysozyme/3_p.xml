The activation of partially purified lysozyme in zein films has the advantage of obtaining an antimicrobial effect in zein films with low initial lysozyme activities. However, the low solubility of partially purified lysozyme causes the formation of protein aggregates in zein films. This can be improved by the addition of edible ingredients with an emulsifying activity. Altinkaya et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] attempted to modify the release rate of lysozyme in cellulose acetate films by changing the structure of films from highly asymmetric and porous to compact. The structure of the film surface influences the lysozyme release rate because the main release mechanism is the diffusion of lysozyme through films. This phenomenon is significantly influenced by the morphological characteristics of the films. This work shows that asymmetric porous films containing antimicrobial agents can be used as novel internal food packaging materials with controlled release properties. However, further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of these films on selected food systems.
