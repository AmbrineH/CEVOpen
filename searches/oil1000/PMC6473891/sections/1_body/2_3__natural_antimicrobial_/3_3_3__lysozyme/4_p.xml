 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> are close to those of the free enzyme. The log reduction values of EVOH 29−lysozyme, EVOH 44−lysozyme, and free lysozyme are 1.08, 0.95, and 1.34, respectively. Del Nobile et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] incorporated different concentrations of lysozyme into a plasma-treated PE film through chemical immobilization. Plasma treatment process involves the physical or chemical modification of a surface layer of the PE film, thereby contributing to the later immobilization of lysozyme on the surface. They found that plasma-treated films containing lysozyme have an antimicrobial performance against
