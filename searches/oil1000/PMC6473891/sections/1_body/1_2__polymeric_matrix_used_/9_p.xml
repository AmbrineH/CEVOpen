<p class="p">Although food packages composed of nondegradable plastics remain the most commonly used materials, their use is decreasing because they cause environmental pollution. In contrast, biodegradable food packaging is more promising in the long run because it is green, reproducible, and environmentally friendly. In countries where landfill is the main method of waste management, the use of biodegradable materials is the most promising with the development of biodegradable polymer antimicrobial packaging, such as polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose, starch, and chitosan.</p>
