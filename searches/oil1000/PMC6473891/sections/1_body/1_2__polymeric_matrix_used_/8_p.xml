 <bold class="bold">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)</bold> films are common, useful packaging materials for potentially replacing PVC. They have the advantages of a relatively good mechanical strength, toughness, and a high crystalline melting temperature (270 Â°C). They are mainly used as bottles and food packages due to their safety and easy processing. The demand for PET with various shapes and without residual acetaldehyde is increasing [
