<p class="p">Nonbiodegradable polymer used in the antimicrobial food packaging mainly include poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) (EVA), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and so on. Plastics are commonly used as food packaging, and their use is continuously increasing because of the inherent plastic film properties, such as ease of processing, transparency and flexibility. </p>
