 <bold class="bold">High density polyethylene (HDPE)</bold> is a linear polymer of ethylene with only a small branching. HDPE is stiffer but less transparent than LDPE. HDPE films have a good gas and water vapor barrier, but are highly permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide. As food packaging, HDPE films are durable and can preserve food for a long time.
