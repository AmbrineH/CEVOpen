 <bold class="bold">Polylactic acid (PLA)</bold> is considered as one of the most promising and environmentally-friendly polymers because of its excellent physical and chemical properties, including renewability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. PLA derived from corn is biodegradable, which makes it unique in food applications. PLA has generally considered as safe (GRAS) status, as given by the USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration). However, one of the major disadvantages of PLA in food packaging is its high permeability to gas and vapor, limiting its use for short-life packaged food [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Given that PLA is nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, biocompatible, hydrophilicity, water soluble and chemically stable, it is usually mixed with different polymers.
