<p class="p">Polymeric food packaging films are some of the most commonly used films because they are easy to produce and have excellent performance [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Polymeric food packaging can protect food from microbial attack and has properties such as flexibility, strength, stiffness and a barrier to oxygen and moisture. This review introduces polymeric film-based antibacterial packaging and focuses on natural antimicrobial packaging and synthetic organic antimicrobial packaging, according to the source of antimicrobial agents. 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00560-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows some examples of incorporation of antimicrobial agent into polymeric matrix and their applications in food packaging. Other studies on the microbiological and physical properties of antibacterial packaging materials are discussed according to the types of antimicrobial agents in the following text.
