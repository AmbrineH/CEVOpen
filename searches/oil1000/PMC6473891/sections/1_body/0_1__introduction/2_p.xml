<p class="p">The antimicrobial abilities of food packaging depend on antimicrobial agents, which can be classified as natural antibacterial agents and synthetic antibacterial agents based on their sources. Antimicrobial agents have been developed from natural sources because natural antimicrobial agents are relatively safe and are easy to obtain [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Natural antimicrobial agents are extracted from materials in nature and require sophisticated extraction procedures. The amount of natural antimicrobial agents depends on the kinds of original animals or plants, which may be rare or precious. However, with increasing food production and demand for packaging, natural antimicrobial materials tend to be insufficient. Thus, organic or inorganic synthetic antimicrobial agents have been developed. The main antibacterial components in food packaging are synthetic organic materials, which mainly contain ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), fungicides, parabens and other chemicals.
