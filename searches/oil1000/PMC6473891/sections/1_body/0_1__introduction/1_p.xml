<p class="p">Food decays when it is exposed to an open environment, such as during postprocessing, distribution, and storage. In daily life, food spoilage and deterioration are mainly caused by foodborne pathogens and other microorganisms, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, which mainly grow on food surfaces; there are also some microorganisms growing in the volume of polymers throughout the pores and gels. [

 <xref rid="B2-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Traditional food preservation methods include freezing, refrigeration, fermentation, drying, the use of additives (e.g., organic acids and salts), and thermal processing [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. A relatively new concept called “active packaging” or “intelligent packaging” has been introduced [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] to provide interaction between food and packaging materials and to maintain a microenvironment. Active packaging extends the shelf life of food products [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Active packaging can provide several functions, such as scavenging of oxygen, moisture or ethylene; emission of ethanol and flavors; and antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Some of the most promising active packaging materials are antimicrobial films, which can be prepared by incorporating synthetic or natural antimicrobial agents into films or directly coating them on food [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, antimicrobial coatings have several disadvantages. First, antimicrobial agents sprayed or dripped on the food cannot have an effective activity because of the rapid diffusion of antimicrobial agents and the reactions of these agents with the food [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Second, the addition of these agents negatively affects the taste of food. Antimicrobial agents carried by polymers interact with the surface to prevent foodborne microbial growth and control the diffusion rate of antimicrobial agents, thereby ensuring the continuous and adequate presence of antimicrobials on food surface [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Antimicrobial food packaging has a slight negative influence on food, and provide excellent antimicrobial properties that can preserve food for a long time [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, antimicrobial agents are often incorporated into films to develop antimicrobial food packaging.
