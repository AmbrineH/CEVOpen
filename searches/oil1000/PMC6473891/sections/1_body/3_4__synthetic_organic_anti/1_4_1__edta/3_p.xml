 <xref rid="B103-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] studied the antimicrobial effect of nisin and lysozyme combined with EDTA on spoilage microorganisms in chilled buffalo meat. The best effect is achieved by combining 0.5% lysozyme and 2% EDTA, which can inhibit the growth of all investigated bacteria, including
