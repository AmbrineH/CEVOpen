<p class="p">The synergism of EDTA with other antimicrobial agents has been widely studied. EDTA can enhance the antimicrobial activity of weak acids against Gram-negative bacteria [

 <xref rid="B99-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] demonstrated that EDTA can help enhance the antibacterial effect of nisin and extend the shelf life of food. The combined effect of EDTA with an oregano EO on modified atmosphere-packaged chicken liver meat has also been investigated [
