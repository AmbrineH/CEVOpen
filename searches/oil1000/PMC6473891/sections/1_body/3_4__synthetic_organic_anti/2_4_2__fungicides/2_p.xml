 <xref rid="B104-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] investigated the general mechanism by which an antimycotic-incorporated LDPE film can inhibit surface mold growth in packaged foods. The LDPE film containing concentration of 2000 mg/kg imazalil can delay the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. toxicarius</italic> on potato dextrose agar, whereas the LDPE film containing 1000 mg/kg imazalil markedly delays the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp. and mold on cheddar cheese. Thus, the incorporation of an antimycotic agent, such as imazalil, into food contact packaging films can inhibit surface mold growth.
