<p class="p">Propyl paraben is a colorless and odorless substance with a GRAS status [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Propyl paraben can inhibit the growth of molds and yeasts. At pH 4â€“8, it has a strong antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B108-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. The antibacterial action mechanism of propyl paraben may be related to its effect on cytoplasmic membrane. Yam et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] studied the antimicrobial activity of propyl paraben against 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by the slow release from a styrene-acrylate copolymer coating. For comparison, they also studied the inhibitory effect through the direct addition of propyl paraben. 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> inhibition is slow but is sustained under slow release with the direct addition, an adequate incubation period is required to inhibit the bacteria.
