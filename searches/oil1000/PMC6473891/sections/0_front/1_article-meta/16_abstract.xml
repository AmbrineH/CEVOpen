 <p class="p">Food corruption and spoilage caused by food-borne pathogens and microorganisms is a serious problem. As a result, the demand for antibacterial drugs in food packaging is growing. In this review, biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials for food packaging are discussed based on their properties. Most importantly, antibacterial agents are essential to inhibit the growth of bacteria in food. To keep food fresh and prolong the shelf life, different kinds of antibacterial agents were used. The composition and application of natural antibacterial agents and synthetic antibacterial agents are discussed. Compared with natural antibacterial agents, synthetic antibacterial agents have the advantages of low cost and high activity, but their toxicity is usually higher than that of natural antibacterial agents. Finally, future development of antimicrobial food packaging is proposed. It is an urgent problem for researchers to design and synthesize antibacterial drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity.</p>
