<p class="p">In conclusion, our results indicated that fat supplementation during gestation had no significant effect on the performance of sows and their offspring, but it improved colostrum composition and plasma concentration of prolactin at farrowing, associated with altered intestinal morphology and innate immunity in newborn offspring. The results provide some evidence that fat supplementation may improve the lactating capability in sows and enhance the immune function of newborn piglets.</p>
