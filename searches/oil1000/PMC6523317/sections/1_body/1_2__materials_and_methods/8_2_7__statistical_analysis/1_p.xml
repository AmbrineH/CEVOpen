<p class="p">The individual sow and piglet were used as the experimental unit for all response variables in the model, which included diet (CON or HF) as the main effect. Data were analyzed by an independent-samples 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test using SPSS 21.0 (IBM SPSS Company, Chicago, IL, USA). Piglet performance during the first day after birth was analyzed for all the piglets nursed during that day. Litter size after cross-fostering was used as a covariate for piglet and litter performance from days 1 to 20 of lactation. The sow was used as the experimental unit for the analysis of data of reproductive performance, plasma parameters, colostrum and milk composition, whereas the piglet was used as the experimental unit for the analysis of data involving piglet performance, gut morphology, relative organ weights, and gene expression in the ileum. All values were expressed as means with their standard errors (SEM). Differences were considered as significant when 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, whereas 0.05 &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.10 was considered a tendency.
