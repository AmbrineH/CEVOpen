<p class="p">By referring to our previous study [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the intestinal tissues preserved in the 4% paraformaldehyde solution were embedded in paraffin. Each tissue sample was used to prepare five slides and each slide had three sections (5 Âµm thick), which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for intestinal morphology measurement by 20 intact well-oriented crypt-villus units in each section (Optimus software version 6.5, Media Cybergenetics, North Reading, MA, USA).
