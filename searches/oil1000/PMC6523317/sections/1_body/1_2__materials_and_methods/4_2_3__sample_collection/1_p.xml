<p class="p">Blood samples were sampled by ear venipuncture from a random subset of sows (n = 8) at day 90 of gestation and farrowing. The same subset of sows was bled at each time period. Approximately 5 mL of blood per sow was collected into heparinized tubes and centrifuged at 3000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> at 4 °C for 15 min; plasma was separated and immediately stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Immediately after parturition, colostrum samples (10 mL) were collected after the sow was injected with 1 mg of oxytocin (Hangzhou Animal Medicine Factory, Hangzhou, China) in the ear vein. Likewise, milk samples on days 10 and 20 of lactation were collected. Colostrum and milk samples were immediately frozen at −20 °C until analysis.
