<p class="p">After farrowing, eight piglets (one male piglet from each group of eight litters) whose BW was closest to the average BW of their litter was selected and anesthetized with an intravenous injection of Zoletil 50 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg BW before jugular exsanguination as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. After the abdomen was exposed, the heart, spleen, pancreas, kidney and liver were quickly removed and weighed. The weight of small intestine was measured after the removal of luminal contents. Relative small intestine, heart, spleen, pancreas, kidney and liver weights were expressed as the ratio to body weight (g/kg). The jejunal, ileal and colonic samples (approximately 2 cm in length) were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for histological measurement. Another portion of the ileum (approximately 2 cm in length) was snap-frozen and then stored at −80 °C until analysis.
