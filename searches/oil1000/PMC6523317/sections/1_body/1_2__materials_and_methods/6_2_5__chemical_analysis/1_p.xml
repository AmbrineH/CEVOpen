<p class="p">The milk composition was analyzed using an automatic milk analyzer (Milk-Y Way-CP2, Beijing, China). The plasma metabolites from sows (glucose, triacylglycerol, urea) were determined using specific assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma concentrations of progesterone, prolactin and leptin in sows were determined using commercial ELISA kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. There was less than 5% variation of intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients for each assay.</p>
