<p class="p">Fetuses receive nutrients from mothers via the placenta, while postnatal pups must take up nutrients from food via the small intestine; therefore, small intestinal development during gestation period plays an important role [

It is well known that fat supplementation during gestation and lactation affects the fatty acid composition of milk and the tissues of piglets. Boudry et al. (2009) observed a modified fatty acid composition and structure of the ileum of piglets when supplementing 3.0% linseed oil to the sow diet during gestation and lactation [

Relative to piglets born of sows fed the CON diet, in the present study, piglets born of sows fed the HF diet had greater jejunal villous height and deeper crypt depth in the jejunum and colon. Supportively, our studies in sows have showed that maternal soybean oil intake improves not only intestinal morphology, but also enzyme activity and growth factors [

 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Therefore, it may be concluded that fat supplementation during gestation may improve the intestinal development of offspring.
