<p class="p">Results from the present study showed that fat supplementation during gestation did not markedly affect reproductive performance. This result is in agreement with a previous study [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] which showed that the isoenergetic replacement of starch with palm oil during gestation had no significant effect on litter performance. The similar results had been also observed in our recent study [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that sows fed supplemental fat at more than 5% improved the litter growth performance [

 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and only a few studies have shown a significantly positive effect on breast-feeding performance by the addition of less than 5% fat [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, the backfat thickness and metabolic characteristics such as triacylglycerol, urea and glucose were not markedly altered by fat supplementation, which may be ascribed to the dietary isoenergetic intake. However, sows fed the HF diet in gestation had greater sow backfat gain during days 1 to 90 of gestation compared with sows fed the CON diet, which may be due to the higher relative fat deposition efficiency of soybean oil than that of cereal grains. Furthermore, prolactin is one of the main hormones involved in the initiation and maintenance of milk production in mammals [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We observed that sows fed the HF diet had greater plasma prolactin concentration than sows fed the CON diet at farrowing, suggesting that dietary fat supplementation during gestation had a beneficial effect on the lactating capability of sows, as indicated by the increased milk yield in sows fed the fat-supplemented diet [
