<p class="p">It is widely accepted that fetal nutritional demands are greatly increased during late gestation and lactation, and maternal reserves change to a catabolic condition during this period, particularly when dietary energy supply is insufficient to meet requirements [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Dietary fats are used in late gestation and/or lactation diets as sources of energy and essential fatty acids to improve milk yield or fat content [

 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], prevent excessive body reserve mobilization [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and improve offspring survival rate [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, some researchers reported no significant litter performance and milk production improvement when supplementing dietary fat in late gestation sow diets [

 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], which had been ascribed to the variations in the fat source and quantity, as well as the length of time fat was supplied in the diet [

 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In addition, maternal fat supplementation has been shown to induce metabolic disease in offspring, such as insulin resistance, liver dysfunction and high blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Our recent study showed that fat supplementation during gestation could modulate fetal gene expressions and related signal transduction on intestinal immunity and metabolism [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. For these studies, however, the biological responses may not only relate to fatty acid supply, but also the greater energy intake when fat supplementation was at higher levels. To our knowledge, the data are limited when it comes to indicating whether dietary isoenergetic intake, but using fat as an energy source during the whole gestation, affects sow performance and their milk composition, as well as intestinal development in offspring.
