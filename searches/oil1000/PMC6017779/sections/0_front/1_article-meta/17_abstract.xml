 <p class="p">To develop natural product resources to control cigarette beetles (
  <italic class="italic">Lasioderma serricorne</italic>), the essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">Artemisia lavandulaefolia</italic> (Compositae) was investigated. Oil was extracted by hydrodistillation of the above-ground portion of 
  <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Extracted essential oil and three compounds isolated from the oil were then evaluated in laboratory assays to determine the fumigant, contact, and repellent efficacy against the stored-products’ pest, 
  <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic>. The bioactive constituents from the oil extracts were identified as chamazulene (40.4%), 1,8-cineole (16.0%), and β-caryophyllene (11.5%). In the insecticidal activity assay, the adults of 
  <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> were susceptible to fumigant action of the essential oil and 1,8-cineole, with LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 31.81 and 5.18 mg/L air. The essential oil, 1,8-cineole, chamazulene, and β-caryophyllene exhibited contact toxicity with LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 13.51, 15.58, 15.18 and 35.52 μg/adult, respectively. During the repellency test, the essential oil and chamazulene had repellency approximating the positive control. The results indicated that chamazulene was abundant in 
  <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> essential oil and was toxic to cigarette beetles.
