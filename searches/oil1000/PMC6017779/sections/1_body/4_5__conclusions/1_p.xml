<p class="p">In this paper, we reported three isolated compounds from the essential oil of the above-ground portion of 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> and their activities against cigarette beetles for the first time. Our work finds chamazulene was abundant in 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> essential oil and exhibited contact and repellent effects. As valuable resources, 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> and chamazulene deserves further development.
