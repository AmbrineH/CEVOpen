<p class="p">The essential oil (10 mL) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (50 × 500 mm) by eluting with petroleum ether first, then with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate, and last with ethyl acetate. Fractions (200 mL) were collected, and fractions’ profiles were combined to yield 38 fractions on the basis of Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) analysis. Three fractions (3–8, 10–15, 20–26) were further purified until the pure compounds for determining structure as chamazulene (2.42 g), 1,8-cineole (0.95 g), and β-caryophyllene (0.63 g) were obtained. The isolated compounds were elucidated based on NMR.
