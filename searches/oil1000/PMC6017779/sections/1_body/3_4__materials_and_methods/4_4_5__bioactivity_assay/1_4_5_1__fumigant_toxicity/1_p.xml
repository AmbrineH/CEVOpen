<p class="p">The fumigant activity assay references the testing method of Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The essential oil and chamazulene were tested in this work. The data of other compounds were not. They were obtained from other papers by our research group. A Whatman filter paper (diameter 2.0 cm) was put inside of the screw cap of a glass vial (diameter 2.5 cm, height 5.5 cm, volume 25 mL). Each paper was impregnated with a 10 Î¼L dilution (serial diluted to five concentrations by 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane). Then the cap was placed tightly on the glass vial (contained 10 insects). 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-Hexane was used as a control. Five replicates were carried out for all treatments and controls. The insects were considered dead if their appendages did not move when probed with a camel brush after 24 h. The LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were calculated using Probit analysis [
