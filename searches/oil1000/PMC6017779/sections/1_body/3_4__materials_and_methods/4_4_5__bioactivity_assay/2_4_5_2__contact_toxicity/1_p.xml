<p class="p">The contact toxicity was also measured as topical application method proposed by Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Serial dilutions of the essential oil and chamazulene (five concentrations) were prepared in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. Dilutions (aliquots of 0.5 Î¼L) were applied topically to the dorsal thorax of the insects. Five replicates were carried out for all treatments and controls (using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane). Fifty adults in replicates with ten insects per replication were treated for the control and for each concentration of the samples. Mortality was recorded after 24 h and the LD
