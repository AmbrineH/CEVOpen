<p class="p">The area preference method were using to test the repellent activity [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Five solutions (78.63, 15.83, 3.15, 0.63, and 0.13 nL/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were prepared by diluting the essential oil and the six comstituents with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. Each solution was applied to half a filter-paper disc as uniformly as possible with a micropipette. Petri dishes (9 cm in diameter) were used to confine cigarette beetles during the experiment. Filter paper (9 cm in diameter) was cut in half. The other half (control) was treated with 500 μL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. Both the two halves were then air-dried to evaporate the solvent completely. The tested and control halves were attached with solid glue to carefully remake a full disk . Twenty adult beetles of mixed sex were released separately at the center of each filter paper disc. The dishes were then covered and transferred to an incubator at room temperature. Ten replications were used for each concentration. After twenty insects were released on the center of each filter paper disk, the dishes were then covered and transferred to the incubator. The experiment was repeated three times. Observations on the number of insects present on both the treated (Nt) and untreated (Nc) halves were recorded after 2 and 4 h. The percent repellency (PR) was then calculated using the formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">PR (%) = [(Nc − Nt)/(Nc + Nt)] × 100</disp-formula>
