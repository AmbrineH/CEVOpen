<p class="p">The oil was hydrodistilled for 6 h using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus and then stored in an airtight container in a refrigerator at 4 °C. Analysis of the essential oil by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) was conducted on a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ instrument (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The carrier gas was helium and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The essential oils were diluted to 1% with n-hexane and 1 µL was injected into the gas chromatograph. Spectra were scanned from 50 to 550
