<p class="p">As early as 2010, Dr. Yuan had already analyzed the bioactivity, mechanism, and security of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> systematically, and demonstrated the prospects of this plantâ€™s resource development [

 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> adults. Further studies will continue to explore more chemical constituents in this plant.
