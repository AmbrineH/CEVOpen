<p class="p">Three compounds we isolated in this work are common components in essential oils. In our previous research, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Dendranthema indicum</italic> were extracted, and then the same three isolated compounds (1,8-cineole, chamazulene, and β-caryophyllene) were also isolated [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this essential oil, monoterpenoids accounting for over 20%, and the proportion of the other three listed monocyclic ones (4-terpineol, α-terpineol, and γ-terpinene) were nearly 7%.
