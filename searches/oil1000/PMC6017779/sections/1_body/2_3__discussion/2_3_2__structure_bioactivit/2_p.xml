<p class="p">By comparing the structures with their bio-effects, the structure-bioactivity relationships were apparent. The four monoterpenoids shared the same basic parent structure (monoterpenoid skeleton) but with different substitution patterns. As for the fumigant activity, the molecules with oxygen bridges between the ring and the substituent group (1,8-cineole) had less fumigant toxicity than the one branched chain oxygenous groups (α-terpineol), but more effective than the compounds that had oxygenous groups linked to the saturated carbon ring directly (4-terpineol). However, for 1,8-cineole, the compounds with oxygen bridges had the weakest contact toxicity than the other monoterpenoids. 4-Terpineol had oxygenous groups linked to the saturated carbon ring directly, which possessed the highest contact toxity. For the repellent activities against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> adults, the monoterpenoid without the substitutional group (γ-terpinene) had the relatively weakest effects. Overall, the activities of the monoterpenoids might depend on the number and position of the oxygenous groups. This result may have implications for the chemical structural modification of leading compounds.
