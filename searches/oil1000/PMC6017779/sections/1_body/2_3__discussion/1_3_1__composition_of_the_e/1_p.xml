<p class="p">The chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> in the present study was different from previous reports. For example, β-caryophyllene (15.5%), β-thujone (13.6%), 1,8-cineole (13.1%), and β-farnesene (12.3%) were the main volatile components of this plant from Beijing, China [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Extracted by the same method, 1,8-cineole (10.7%), α-terpineol (5.3%), 4-carene (4.0%), 4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-3-one (3.6%), caryophyllene oxide (2.6%), and β-caryophyllene (2.2%) were the dominant compounds in the sample from Changchun, China [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, the major compounds in the samples collected in Mt. Unnamsan in Korea were β-caryophyllene (16.1%), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-chrysanthenol (7.0%), 1,8-cineole (5.6%), borneol (5.3%), and β-farnesene (5.1%) [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. It can be deduced from these results that 1,8-cineole and β-caryophyllene were common constituents in 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, chamazulene had not been previously identified as a main component in this plant, which perhaps suggested a new chamazulene chemotype, but more evidence is needed to confirm this idea. In addition, we have not identified 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-chrysanthenol in the samples collected in China [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Some literature analyses showed that 
 <italic class="italic">A. absinthium</italic> harvested from June to November contained varying amounts of cis-chrysanthenol, which might suggest that the geographical environment and harvest time are the important factors in this plant [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-00343" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>].
