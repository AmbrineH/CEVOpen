 <italic class="italic">Artemisia lavandulaefolia</italic> DC is a perennial herbaceous plant. Reviewing the literature, the essential oil from the fresh above-ground portion of 
 <italic class="italic">A. lavandulaefolia</italic> has been reported to show insecticidal activity against some pests [
