<p class="p">Although 1,8-cineole showed considerably less fumigant toxicity (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 5.18 mg/L air) than the positive control (phosphine, LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 9.23 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> mg/L air), it showed considerable fumigant toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> adults. The three monoterpenoids all had stronger fumigant activity than the essential oil, particularly α-terpineol had the lowest LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value against the pest. The four monoterpenoids (4-terpineol, α-terpineol, γ-terpinene and 1,8-cineole) were more effective than the two sesquiterpenoids (chamazulene and β-caryophyllene).
