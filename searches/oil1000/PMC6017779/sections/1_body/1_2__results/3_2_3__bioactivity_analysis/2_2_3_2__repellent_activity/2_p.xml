<p class="p">As for the four monoterpenoids, the three oxygenated ones (4-terpineol, α-terpineol, and 1,8-cineole) showed the same or better efficiency than γ-terpinene. α-Terpineol possessed a better effect than both 4-terpineol and 1,8-cineole at the doses of 78.63, 15.83, 3.15, and 0.63 nL/cm

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), 1,8-cineole showed much stronger repellency (76%) than the positive control, DEET (
