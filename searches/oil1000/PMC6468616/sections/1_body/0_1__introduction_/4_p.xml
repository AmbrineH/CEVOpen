<p class="p">A substance possessing anti-inflammatory properties, associated with antioxidant and antifungal activities, as in the case of several essential oils, is considered to be promising in the investigation of novel therapeutic agents. During infection with dermatophytes, an immune response is induced by keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This inflammatory process is fundamental to the defense of the host; however, exacerbated responses can result in tissue damage and even increase susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In addition to this, the production of reactive species by the defense system can worsen the disease and trigger chronic inflammatory diseases, therefore indicating the importance of the combined antioxidant action of the substance [
