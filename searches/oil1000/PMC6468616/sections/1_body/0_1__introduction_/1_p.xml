<p class="p">Essential oils are an important group of secondary plant metabolites used in large scale in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries owing to their correlated biological effects [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Due to their repellent or attractive properties, these metabolites have been implicated in several ecological and biological functions, and different chemical profiles have been observed throughout plant development in response to biotic or abiotic environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The chemical composition of medicinal and aromatic plants and their biological effects are known to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Such variations can be correlated with the plant collection site and the developmental phase [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and the agronomic and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], in addition to the method of extraction [
