<p class="p">The antichemotactic activity observed for the oil extracted from the sample of the productive rest phase can be related to the presence of (

 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The fact that α-pinene acts through an anti-inflammatory mechanism that is different from the one investigated in this study may explain the lower inhibitory effect of the oil obtained from the sample of the blooming phase compared with that of other oils.
