<p class="p">The ability of essential oils to inhibit leukocyte migration was assessed by the Boyden method. All the oil samples, at the tested concentrations, exerted a statistically significant reduction in leukocyte migration compared with the negative control (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00112-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, with the inhibition ranging from 34.6% to 100% for the samples, whereas indomethacin showed an inhibition of only 33% and 58.5%, respectively, at the concentrations of 0.5 and 5 μg/mL. Significant differences were observed among oils at the same concentration. At 5 μg/mL, the oils corresponding to the end of the productive rest, productive rest, pre-blooming, and fruiting phases exhibited a significantly higher antichemotactic effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that of the oil obtained from the sample of the blooming phase, with the inhibition ranging from 77.5% to 100%. These results indicated that the presence of monoterpenes has a direct effect on the activity, because the effect increased with a decrease in the monoterpenic fraction. The oil obtained from the sample of the productive rest phase demonstrated 100% inhibition of leukocyte migration, with the monoterpenic fraction comprising only 5% of the total oil content, in addition to the predominance of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction (73.9%). On the other hand, the oil corresponding to the blooming phase exhibited a lower antichemotactic effect and a higher percentage of monoterpenes, including limonene and α- and β-pinenes as the primary compounds.
