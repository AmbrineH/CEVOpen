<p class="p">In addition to being more abundant in the bloodstream among the leukocytes, neutrophils are characterized as the first defense cells recruited to the site of the injury from chemoattractant factors released by microorganisms or necrotic cells [

In this manner, the antichemotactic effect observed in this study indicates that the essential oils act in the acute phase of the inflammatory process. In addition to this, activation of the immune system, triggering an inflammatory process, is an important step in the defense of the host against microbial infections. However, in a contradictory manner, exacerbated inflammatory responses can cause tissue damage and even increase susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens [

 <italic class="italic">N. megapotamica</italic> samples, especially those obtained during the pre-blooming, blooming, and fruiting phases, indicates that they can act both in the healing process of one fungal infection and in relieving symptoms. During an infection, this set of biological properties contributes significantly to the rapid reduction of symptoms, the promotion of cures, and the prevention of chronicity [
