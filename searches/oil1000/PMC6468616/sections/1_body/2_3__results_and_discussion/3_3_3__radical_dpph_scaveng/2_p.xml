<p class="p">Limonene was identified as one of the major compounds in the oil obtained from the sample of the pre-blooming phase, which demonstrated a stronger free-radical-scavenging activity. The presence of this compound in significant amounts may have contributed to its action [

 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] demonstrated that limonene was more active than α-pinene, although they found a moderate antioxidant effect for both compounds. The compounds α-pinene and β-pinene tested alone in the DPPH assay showed no free-radical-scavenging ability [

 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], indicating that the antioxidant effect observed in this study for the oils obtained from the samples of the productive rest and blooming phases can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between different compounds present in the oil. In general, for the essential oils, the stabilization of the radical DPPH effect is attributed to the presence of phenols, alcohols, and other oxygenated compounds due to their high hydrogen donation capacity [
