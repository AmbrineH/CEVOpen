<p class="p">In general, the antifungal activity of the essential oils is attributed to the content of oxygen-containing compounds such as oxygenated sequiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. This hypothesis was corroborated by the reduced MIC values (125 μg/mL) observed for the oil obtained from the sample of the fruiting phase containing spathulenol (9.1%) among the major compounds. However, Dhouioui et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] reported that different samples of oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Aristolochia longa</italic> L. ssp. Paucinervis, containing smaller fractions of oxygenated compounds, were more effective against the tested microorganisms, in the same manner in which α-pinene and limonene exhibited higher antifungal activity than 
 <italic class="italic">Wedelia prostate</italic> total oil, with MICs ranging from 62.5 to 125 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. These findings may validate the improvement in activity of the oil from obtained samples of the blooming and pre-blooming phases against those of the productive rest phase, since the former contained α- and β-pinenes and limonene as the major compounds.
