<p class="p">The oils obtained from samples collected during the pre-blooming, blooming, and fruiting phases exhibited the antifungal effect for a greater number of microorganisms, with MICs ranging from 125 to 500 μg/mL. The oil from the sample of the pre-blooming phase, which contained limonene among the major compounds, showed growth inhibition of 60% of the tested strains, with MICs ranging from 250 to 500 μg/mL. A similar result was observed for the oil extracted from the sample of the fruiting phase, which inhibited 53.3% growth of the strains and exhibited an MIC of 125 μg/mL. In addition to limonene, the oil obtained from the sample of this phase contained higher amounts of spathulenol, an oxygenated sesquiterpene. The lower content of limonene and the higher contents of α- and β-pinenes in the oil extracted from the sample collected during the blooming phase correlated with a reduced antifungal effect, showing growth inhibition of only 33.3% of the strains. The presence of a higher amount of limonene in the oil obtained from the sample of the pre-blooming phase indicated a direct correlation of this compound to the inhibition of the growth of dermatophytes, considering that the oil obtained from the sample collected at the end of the productive rest phase contained only 13.8% of monoterpenic compounds and inhibited the growth of only one isolate. The lack of antifungal effect was also observed for the oil obtained from the sample collected during the productive rest phase, which contained β-pinene and limonene as the minority compounds.</p>
