<p class="p">Regarding the antifungal activity, the essential oils were evaluated at concentrations of 1.95–500 μg/mL against strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Microsporum</italic> genera. MIC values in the range of 125–500 μg/mL were observed for oils obtained from samples collected during the pre-blooming, blooming, and fruiting phases (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00112-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Only one isolate of 
 <italic class="italic">T. rubrum</italic> was sensitive to the oil obtained samples of the end productive rest phase at the concentration of 500 μg/mL. The oils obtained from samples of the productive rest and the end of the productive rest phases exhibited MIC values &gt;500 μg/mL for all the tested strains, except for TRU48 that showed an MIC of 500 μg/mL.
