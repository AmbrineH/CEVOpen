<p class="p">To investigate possible correlations among the compounds and the collection phase due to the similarity of the chemical profile, the chemical data of the essential oils obtained from leaves collected during different stages of plant development were evaluated by PCA. The graph produced by the PCA, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00112-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, indicated different chemical profiles among the oils influenced by minor compounds. The biplot graph shows the first two components (PC1 and PC2), which together account for 62.63% of the variance. This graph distinguished two groups of plant developmental phases characterized by PC1, which corresponds to 32.45% of the total variance. This group corresponds to the oils obtained from samples of the fruiting and the end of the productive rest phases. The second group observed for the remaining PCA chart shows negative scores on the PC1 scale and corresponds to the oils obtained from samples collected in the productive rest, pre-blooming, and blooming phases.
