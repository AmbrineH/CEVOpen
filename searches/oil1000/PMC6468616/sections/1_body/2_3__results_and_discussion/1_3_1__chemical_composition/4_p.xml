<p class="p">Regarding the hydrocarbon sesquiterpene fraction, bicyclogermacrene and germacrene D were predominant in the oils obtained from samples of all collections, with varying amounts in each (22.0–36.7% and 10.9–19.2%, respectively). In addition, β-caryophyllene (3.9–6.4%), δ-cadinene (3.9–6.8%), α-copaene (2.8–4.5%), and α-humulene (2.7–3.9%) were the major compounds with smaller variations among the oil samples. Among oxygenated sesquiterpenes, spathulenol was the major compound present in the oil obtained from all collections (1.9–3.3%) and also in the sample of the fruiting phase with a relative abundance of 9.1%. This may be related to the fact that the oil obtained from this sample showed the lowest quantity of germacrene D (10.9%) and also a reduced quantity of bicyclogermacrene (22.8%) compared with oils extracted from the other collections. Compounds of phenylpropanoid class (elemicin and (

 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], the collection period is one of the most important factors affecting the nature and quantity of the constituents, which are variable during the year. In addition, the developmental phase of the plant can have a considerable effect on the relative proportions of the components.
