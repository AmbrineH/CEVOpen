<p class="p">Samples of 
 <italic class="italic">N. megapotamica</italic> collected at different developmental stages were investigated in relation to yield and chemical composition of the essential oil. Data relative to climate during the collection period as well as the yield of oil are described in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00112-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The yield of the essential oil obtained from fresh leaves collected from the same individual during different periods ranged from 0.3 to 0.5%. The highest yield of oil was observed in samples collected during the austral summer (0.5%), corresponding to the productive rest phase of the plant and characterized by high temperatures and a total precipitation of 150–200 mm. The opposite result was observed for the oil obtained from samples collected in the pre-blooming stage, which presented a lower yield of 0.3%. During this period, there were lower maximum and minimum temperatures, in addition to a higher volume of total precipitation (250–300 mm). In terms of the compounds, the samples corresponding to this period (pre-blooming and blooming) exhibited higher levels of monoterpenes, with limonene being the predominant compound among the collection with a greater volume of precipitation. The differences in the yield and chemical composition of essential oils can be related to the effects of climatic and geographic factors such as temperature, ultraviolet radiation, atmospheric pollution, altitude, and water and nutrient availability, as well as the developmental stage of the plant and genetic factors [
