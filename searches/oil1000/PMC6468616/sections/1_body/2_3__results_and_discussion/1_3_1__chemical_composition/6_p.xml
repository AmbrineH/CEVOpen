<p class="p">Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between globulol (29), aromadendrene (14), sabinene (3), and α-copaene (8) compounds and oils obtained from the sample collected at the end of the productive rest phase, while β-elemene (11), β-cubebene (10), humulene epoxide II (31), spathulenol (27), and elemicin (37) correlated with the oil sample of the fruiting phase. In the productive rest phase, this correlation was observed primarily with cadina-1,4-diene (24), bicyclogermacrene (19), τ-cadinol (35), and 1-epi-cubenol (32). Finally, the oil extracted from the sample collected during the blooming phase correlated with camphene (2), isospathulenol (33), cubenol (36), and β-bourbonene (9) compounds.</p>
