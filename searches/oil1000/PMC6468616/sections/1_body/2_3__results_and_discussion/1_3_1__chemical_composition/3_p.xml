<p class="p">The major differences were observed in the monoterpenic fraction. The quantity of this fraction increased gradually from the oils obtained from the samples of the productive rest phase to those of the blooming phase (5.1% to 37.1%, respectively), with a slight reduction in the oils obtained during the fruiting phase (20.7%). This variation was predominantly related to the quantities of α- and β-pinenes and limonene identified in the different samples. The oil extracted from the sample collected during the productive rest phase was characterized by the absence of α-pinene, the presence of β-pinene only as a minority compound (0.2%), and limonene (4.6%) as the more abundant compound in the monoterpenic fraction. In the oil corresponding to the sample collected at the end of this phase, the major compounds were α- and β-pinenes (4.3% and 6.6%, respectively), whereas there was a reduction in the abundance of limonene (2.7%). The oil obtained from the sample collected during the pre-blooming phase exhibited a predominance of limonene (14.1%), followed by β-pinene (4.1%) and α-pinene (2.7%). The opposite result was observed in the oil sample collected during the blooming phase, in which both pinenes were predominant (14.8% and 15.5%, respectively, for α- and β-pinene) and limonene constituted only 5.3%. Similar to the oils obtained from leaves collected during the productive rest and pre-blooming phases, the oil sample of the fruiting phase showed a reduced quantity of pinenes (5.0% and 6.4%, respectively) but a slight predominance of limonene (8.6%).</p>
