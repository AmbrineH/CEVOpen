<p class="p">Chemical analysis of the essential oils revealed considerable quantitative variations among the collections. A total of 38 compounds were identified by GC–MS, representing 97.0–99.2% of the total composition of the oils (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00112-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons fraction was predominant in the oils obtained from all samples (55.3–79.4%), followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (5.1–37.1%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (5.3–15.2 %). Bicyclogermacrene (22.0–36.7%) and germacrene D (10.9–19.2%) were identified as the major compounds in all the oil samples. A relatively higher abundance of bicyclogermacrene was detected in the oil corresponding to samples of the productive rest (32.1% and 36.7%) and pre-blooming (33.4%) stages. Similar variations were observed for germacrene D, with values of 18.7%, 19.2%, and 16.8%, respectively, for the oils obtained from the above-mentioned phases.
