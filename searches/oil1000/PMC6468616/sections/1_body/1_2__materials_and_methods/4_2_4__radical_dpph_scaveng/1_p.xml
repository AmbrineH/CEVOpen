<p class="p">The sequestering capacity of free radicals by the oils was determined by reaction with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) at concentrations of 25–250 μg/mL. The samples at their respective concentrations were added to 0.004% DPPH methanolic solution and the absorbance was read in a spectrophotometer (517 nm) within 30 min of reaction. Rutin was used as positive control, and all experiments were performed in triplicate. The percentage of activity was determined by the formula %AA = (A
