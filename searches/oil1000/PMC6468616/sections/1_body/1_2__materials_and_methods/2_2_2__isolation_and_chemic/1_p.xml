<p class="p">The essential oils were obtained from fresh leaves by hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Approximately 100 g of immediately collected leaves were used for the distillation process. The yield was determined as weight/volume (

A capillary column of fused silica Durabond-DB5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used to separate the constituents. The temperature of the injector and the detector was set at 220 °C and 250 °C, respectively, and the column temperature was programmed at 60–300 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min using helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The compounds were identified based on the comparison of retention indices calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes and their mass spectra with authentic samples and with data extracted from the literature [

Relative amounts of the components were calculated based on GC peak areas.
