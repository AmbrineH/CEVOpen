<p class="p">The antifungal activity of essential oils was determined against the following strains deposited in the Applied Mycology Laboratory of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul: 
 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton rubrum</italic> (TRU43, TRU51, TRU50, and TRU48), 
 <italic class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</italic> (TME16, TME40, TME32, and TME46), 
 <italic class="italic">Microsporum canis</italic> (MCA29, MCA01, MCA33, and MCA40), and 
 <italic class="italic">M. gypseum</italic> (MGY50, MGY42, MGY58, and MGY42). To obtain viable cells for use in the assay, the filamentous fungi were incubated on potato dextrose agar at 32 °C for 5 days. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method according to M38-A2 protocol standardized by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The experiments were conducted using RPMI-MOPS culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-glutamine, without sodium bicarbonate-buffered, at pH 7.0 with 0.165 mol/L MOPS), and the oil samples were tested at a concentration range of 1.95–500 μg/mL, where 100 μL aliquots were inoculated in a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance in which the tested microorganism did not show visible growth. The microplates were incubated at 32 °C for 72 h. The experiments were performed in triplicate using terbinafine as a positive control.
