<p class="p">The antichemotactic activity was evaluated according to the modified Boyden chamber method described by Suyenaga et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. A total of seven animals were used for this test. For obtaining rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 20 mL of sterile 1% glycogen (
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>) was injected into the peritoneum of one Wistar rat that was killed 4 h later for leukocyte collection. Before the assay, the leukocytes were treated with essential oils and positive control solubilized in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS pH 7.4) at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 μg/mL for 30 min at 37 °C. A solution of neutrophils without the addition of the antichemotactic agent was used as a negative control. Plasma obtained from the blood of six rats was incubated with 65 µg/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>) at 37 °C for 30 min and then diluted in Hank’s buffer to obtain a 20% solution (
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>). The treated leukocytes were added to the upper wells of the chamber, separated by a nitrocellulose filter (8.0 μm) from the chemotactic factor (LPS) present in the lower compartment. The migration of leukocytes was determined by the distance, measured in micrometers, between the filter upper plane and the lower plane containing two cells in 10 microscopic fields. Indomethacin was used as a positive control. The animal protocol was approved by and performed following guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UFRGS [CEUA/CAr no. 25955/2014].
