<p class="p">This study reports differences in yield and chemical composition of essential oils obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">N. megapotamica</italic> collected during the productive rest, end of the productive rest, pre-blooming, blooming, and fruiting phases. Although the major compounds identified in the oils were common across the samples, they exhibited important quantitative differences. Such chemical variations, primarily in the content of monoterpenes, limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene, resulted in important differences in the antichemotactic, antifungal, and DPPH radical-scavenging activities. This variability indicates the importance of qualitative and quantitative chemical characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">N. megapotamica</italic> oil in relation to seasonal variations, as well as its influence on biological effects. Studies investigating the variations in the chemical composition of essential oils may offer a strategy to produce a compound or a group of compounds of interest to industries with a specific pharmacological focus.
