 <p> Cell growth and lipid accumulation of D15D overexpressing strains. Recombinant Mc-D15D and control strain Mc-1552 cultures were grown in 1.5 L modified K&amp;R medium and ( a) glucose concentration, ( b) ammonium concentration, ( c) cell dry weight (CDW), and ( d) lipid content were measured. Samples from the fermenter were taken at the indicated times. The values were mean of three biological replicates. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. </p>
