Pentadecanoic acid (15:0) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the freeze-dried cells as an internal standard and n-hexane were used to extract the fatty acid methyl esters, which were analyzed by GCFID equipped with a 30 m × 0.32 mm DB-Waxetr column with 0.25 μm film thickness. The program was as follows: 120 °C for 3 min, ramp to 200 °C at 5 °C per min, ramp to 220 °C at 4 °C per min, hold 2 min.
