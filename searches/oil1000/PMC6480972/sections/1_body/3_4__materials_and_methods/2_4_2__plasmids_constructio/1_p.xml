<p class="p">D15D-overexpressing plasmid for pleu-MU402 was constructed by using the expression vector pMAT1552, which contains the 
 <italic class="italic">pyrG</italic> gene of 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> to encode orotidine 5â€²-phosphate decarboxylase to produce uridine as a selectable marker. It is surrounded up-stream and down-stream by 1 kb of 
 <italic class="italic">carB-carRP</italic> sequences to allow its chromosomal integration by homologous recombination. PCR amplification was carried out to isolate the 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene from the genome of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alpina</italic> ATCC 32222 using the primers D15D-F/R (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01683" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). The 30 bp homologous sequences of both sides of 
 <italic class="italic">XhoI</italic> restriction site in pMAT1552 were also included in these primers. After digestion with 
 <italic class="italic">XhoI</italic> restriction endonuclease, the PCR fragment was ligated to generate plasmid pMAT1552-D15D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>) for mutant pleu-MU402. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> Top 10 competent cells for its propagation. The extracted plasmids from these bacteria were checked by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing was carried out to confirm the gene sequence.
