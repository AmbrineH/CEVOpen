<p class="p">Real-time quantitative PCR were carried out to analyze the mRNA level of 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> in the recombinant strains at 3, 24, 48 and 72 h of growth in two liter fermenter with K &amp; R medium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The mRNA expression level of Mc-D15D was considered as 1 at 3 h and by comparing with this value, the expression level increased in that strain by 5.10, 3.50 and 2.55 fold at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. Although it increased quickly from 3 to 24 h, there was a decreasing trend with the incubation time after 24 h. The fact that D15D mRNA was maintained at elevated levels throughout the culture time confirmed that it was overexpressed in the recombinant strains.
