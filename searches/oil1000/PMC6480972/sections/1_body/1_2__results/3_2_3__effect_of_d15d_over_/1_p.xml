<p class="p">The effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> over-expression in growth and lipid accumulation was analyzed in the strain Mc-D15D, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The concentrations of ammonium and glucose in the culture medium are also highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Adequate concentrations of glucose remained during the entire bioprocess (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a), however at approximately 24 h the ammonium was used up by Mc-D15D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b). After 12 h of cultivation, cell dry weight (CDW) increased rapidly but slowed down after nitrogen depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c). The fungus started to accumulate lipids immediately after nitrogen exhaustion from the culture medium. The total fatty acids (TFAs) content increased rapidly from 24 h, reaching its peak at 60 h and then slowed gradually. The maximum content of TFAs was found to be 15.53% in Mc-D15D (
