<p class="p">PCR analysis was used to confirm the integration of the target gene in the genome of overexpressing transformants. A primer pair 1552-F/R (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01683" class="xref">Table S1</xref>) was used to amplify the target gene and the 557 bp sequences of the plasmid pMAT1552. As expected, bands of 1796 bp of PCR products were seen on gels for transformants with the target gene but only 557 bp fragment was observed for Mc-1552 control strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, PCR amplification results confirmed the integration of the target gene in the genome of recombinant fungi.
