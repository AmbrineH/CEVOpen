<p class="p">According to the genomic data of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alpina</italic>, this study found only one gene encoding for D15D (Genebank accession number KF433065), which is 1212 bp long. For overexpression of the target gene, the coding region of 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> was cloned into the 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> expression vector pMAT1552, which contained the strong 
 <italic class="italic">zrt1</italic> promoter and flanking sequence of 
 <italic class="italic">carRP</italic> locus to allow integration of the whole over-expressing construction by homologous recombination [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Integration in 
 <italic class="italic">carRP</italic> locus produced white colonies, which were easily distinguishable from yellow transformants that did not integrate the 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene. The target gene-overexpressing plasmids, pMAT1552-D15D, and the empty plasmids pMAT1552 were transformed into the uridine auxotrophic strain, pleu-MU402, and selection of the colonies was performed as reported by Rodríguez-Frómeta [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Three overexpressing and one control transformants named as Mc-D15D, Mc-D15D-1, Mc-D15D-2 and Mc-1552, respectively, were selected. Additional screening was carried out (data not shown) and only one strain (Mc-D15D) that produced a maximum amount of lipid and SDA was selected for further experiments.
