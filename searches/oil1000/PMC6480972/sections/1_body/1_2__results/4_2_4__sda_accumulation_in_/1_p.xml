 <xref rid="ijms-20-01683-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In the transformants, SDA production started at 24 h, and at 48 h its content reached its peak (5.09%). From 36 to 72 h the SDA content remained elevated over 4%. In these recombinant fungi the other fatty acid contents were almost similar as found in the control strains.
