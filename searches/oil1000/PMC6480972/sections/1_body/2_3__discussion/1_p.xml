<p class="p">The accumulation of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (VLCPUFA) in recombinant microorganisms is a process which can further improve the accumulation of desired products [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The oleaginous fungus, 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>, is an attractive oleaginous fungus for researchers because of its ability to produce oil that is rich in gamma linolenic acid. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">M. alpina</italic> produces both ARA and EPA and possess both ω-6 and ω-3 biosynthetic pathways for the production of fatty acids. However, in all other features, both fungi share similar characteristics and phenotype (filamentous) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Delta-15 desaturase (ω-3 desaturase) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. alpina</italic> ATCC 32221, is reported to convert GLA to SDA and LA to ALA. ALA is converted to SDA by delta-6 desaturase, which is already present in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore, SDA can be produced using both pathways that were constructed in this fungus by overexpressing 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01683-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Besides the production of SDA, a significant amount of ALA was also produced in this process. The RT-qPCR results revealed that D15D mRNA remained elevated during the entire culture time of Mc-D15D and fatty acid analysis revealed the presence of SDA. These results confirmed that 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> was overexpressed in the recombinant strains.
