<p class="p">Previous research has confirmed that during the last 50 years the decreased consumption of ω-3 fatty acids is thought to be responsible for the increased occurrence of some diseases, such as hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis, CHD, metabolic syndrome X, cancer, etc. The precursor of the prostaglandins of series 3 and the leukotrienes of series 5 are also produced from EPA [

 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> in this study can produce almost 5% SDA without any supplement and according to our knowledge, this is the first study describing the overexpression of 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> to construct SDA producing cell factory. However, more research is required to use this fungus for the industrial production of SDA.
