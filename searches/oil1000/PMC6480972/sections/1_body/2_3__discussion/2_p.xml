<p class="p">Deficiency of nitrogen (N) is a general approach to start the storage of lipid in most oleaginous microorganisms. Investigation of lipid accumulation is frequently carried out by comparing the N rich phase to the N deficiency phase in the whole culture time, and the quantity of lipid enhances under N depletion [
