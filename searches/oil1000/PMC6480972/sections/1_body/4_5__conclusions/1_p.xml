<p class="p">This study constructed a SDA-producing 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> CBS 277.49 by 
 <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene overexpression. According to our knowledge, this is the first study about the construction of a SDA-producing strain by gene cloning and recombination in 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor</italic>. This work establishes a new scope for further research for improved production of SDA in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>, specifically in its high lipid-producing strain, WJ11.
