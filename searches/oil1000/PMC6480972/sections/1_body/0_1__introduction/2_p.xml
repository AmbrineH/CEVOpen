<p class="p">Stearidonic acid (SDA; 18:4, n-3) is produced from gamma linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3, n-6) and ALA (18:3, n-3) catalyzed by the enzymes delta 15-desaturase and delta 6-desaturase, respectively (

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. SDA can be elongated to a longer chain omega-3 PUFA with related biological properties, such as EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, conversion of SDA from ALA is very inefficient in humans because delta 6-desaturase is rate-limiting, therefore it is difficult to change tissue levels of EPA (20:5, n-3) by the consumption of ALA. Consequently, the oral administration of SDA has been suggested as an alternative approach of increasing the amount of EPA in body tissues [

 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Again, in comparison to EPA and DHA, SDA is less unsaturated, more stable, less prone to oxidation, and therefore more amenable to a wide variety of food and beverage applications [
