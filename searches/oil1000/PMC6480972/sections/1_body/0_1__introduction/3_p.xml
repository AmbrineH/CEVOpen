<p class="p">SDA occurs naturally in seafood, fish and a few species of seaweed as a minor n-3 PUFA [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Among the plant sources, oils derived from blackcurrant seed and members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Boraginaceae</italic> family contain SDA [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. By weight, Echium oil is comparatively a better plant source of SDA and contains both ω-3 PUFA and ω-6 PUFA [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, due to safety concerns, limited shelf-life, palatability issues and the risk of over-fishing, fish and fish oil are difficult to use as commercial source of (ω-3) LCPUFA [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Plant sources also need to be improved for large scale production due to their low yield. Therefore, there is a requirement to identify alternative sources of SDA that can be used commercially [
