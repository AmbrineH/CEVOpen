<p class="p">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have significant functions in maintaining human health [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. They are very important nutritionally because mammals, including humans, can synthesize saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) but cannot produce linoleic acid (LA; 18:2, n-6) and α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3, n-3) that are known as de novo omega-6 or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), respectively. Hence, these fatty acids are called essential fatty acids (EFAs) and must be obtained from external sources [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. LA and ALA are metabolized to arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5, n-3), respectively, in a series of reactions catalyzed by the same sets of enzymes [

However, the metabolism of EFAs can be altered in several diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, cancer, etc. Therefore, the physiological role of EFAs and their products is very important as they are involved in various biological reactions [
