<p class="p">Fungi, microalgae and bacteria that can accumulate lipids up to 20% of their dry cell weight are known as oleaginous microorganisms. 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor circinelloides</italic> has been extensively investigated for GLA production since the 1980s [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It has been considered as an important classical organism for microbial lipid analysis because of its ability to produce oil that is rich in GLA as well as the availability of genome data and genetic tools [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In previous studies this fungus was used for improved GLA production [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], increased lipid accumulation [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], 13C-metabolic flux analysis of lipid accumulation [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], investigation of the effects of 20 standard amino acids on growth, GLA and total fatty acids production [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the role of pentose phosphate pathway in lipid accumulation [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], etc. 
 <italic class="italic">Mortierella alpina,</italic> another filamentous fungus, can accumulate lipids up to 50% of its dry weight [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and mostly composed of triacylglycerol with a high amount of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4, n-6) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], however at a low temperature it can also produce EPA [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-20-01683" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In this experiment, the 
 <italic class="italic">delta-15 desaturase (D15D)</italic> gene from 
 <italic class="italic">M. alpina</italic> was cloned and recombined in 
 <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> to make a SDA-producing cell factory.
