 <p class="p">Stearidonic acid (SDA; 18:4, n-3) is the delta 15-desaturase product of gamma linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3, n-6) and delta 6-desaturase product of alpha linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3, n-3). Construction of engineered oleaginous microbes have been attracting significant interest in producing SDA because of its nutritional value and pharmaceutical applications. 
  <italic class="italic">Mucor circinelloides</italic> is a GLA producing filamentous fungus, which can be a useful tool to produce SDA. This study has, therefore, overexpressed the 
  <italic class="italic">delta-15 desaturase</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">D15D</italic>) gene from 
  <italic class="italic">Mortierella alpina</italic> in this fungus to construct a SDA-producing cell factory. To produce SDA in 
  <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>, the homologous overexpression of 
  <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene was analyzed. When the gene was overexpressed in 
  <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic> CBS 277.49, up to 5.0% SDA was accumulated in this strain. According to current knowledge, this is the first study describing the construction of a SDA-producing cell factory by overexpression of 
  <italic class="italic">D15D</italic> gene in oleaginous fungus 
  <italic class="italic">M. circinelloides</italic>. A new scope for further research has been established by this work to improve SDA production in this fungus, specifically in its high lipid-producing strain, WJ11.
