 <p> Wine polyphenol extract is able to prevent aberrant crypt foci formation in various animal models (mice, rats), which is the first step of colorectal carcinogenesis, and can block the different steps leading to adenocarcinoma development. The effects involved different molecular mechanisms such as an arrest of the cell cycle in the S phase, an induction of apoptosis through caspase activation, and an inhibition of angiogenesis and tumoral invasion through a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activities. </p>
