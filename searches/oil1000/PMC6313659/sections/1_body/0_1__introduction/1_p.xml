<p class="p">Wine has been produced since the beginnings of civilization, presumably starting in the Near East; traces are found in the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the code of the Babylonian king Hammurabi, and in Assyrian bas-reliefs. The influence of wine on the development of most Eurasian societies is considerable and it is the only food for which such a sacred and symbolic character has been attributed. Since antiquity, wine has been an important part of the diet of most countries around the Mediterranean. It is consumed in several forms, and it is also a prime commercial activity. Today, wine consumption, even though it has been decreasing over the past several decades, remains important in the countries of the Mediterranean basin, and wine continues to appear on our tables by remaining a central element of our diet and culture. It should be noted that consumption is increasing in emerging countries (China, Brazil, Argentina) and in other industrialized countries (USA, Japan).</p>
