<p class="p">These polyphenol extracts could both serve as sources of new bioactive compounds and also reduce the deleterious effects of certain chemotherapies. A study on various cancers has shown that a red wine extract lowered the side-effect toxicity of cisplatin treatment [

 <xref rid="B81-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. These females were gavaged with 1 mL of polyphenol extract (400 mg/kg) daily (day three to 11), and received 5-FU (150 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection on day nine to induce mucositis. Compared with 5-FU controls, polyphenol extract significantly reduced myeloperoxidase activity in the proximal jejunum and distal ileum, decreased qualitative histological scores of damage in the proximal jejunum, increased villus height in the proximal jejunum and distal ileum, and attenuated the 5-FU-induced reduction of mucosal thickness by 16% in the jejunum and 45% in the ileum [
