<p class="p">Cancer is one of the major causes of death in the world and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. The most common cancers equally affect the lung and breast, with 2.09 million cases, colon (1.80 million cases), prostate (1.28 million cases), skin (non-melanoma) (1.04 million cases), and stomach (1.03 million cases). Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are described as major cancer risk factors worldwide and modifying or avoiding these key risk factors can significantly reduce (30%–50%) the burden of cancer [

 <xref rid="B29-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore, the strong interrelationship between nutrition and diet and the occurrence of tumors is abundantly described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B30-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and it is observed that a plant-rich diet may prevent 30%–40% of all cancer types [

 <xref rid="B34-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Such benefits have been partly attributed to the presence of significant amounts of phenolic antioxidants in fruits and vegetables and are believed to contribute to their chemopreventive effects, notably in the colon [

 <xref rid="B37-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Therefore, several studies (in vitro and/or in vivo) have demonstrated the anticancer potential of wine phenols (i.e., resveratrol, quercetin, (+)-catechin). In this way, various case–control studies have shown that a moderate red wine consumption exerts a protective effect on colorectal cancer in both men and women [

 <xref rid="B20-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Moreover, other case–control studies have examined the association between wine and the Mediterranean diet, showing a lower risk of colon cancer and certain other cancers, such as urinary tract tumors, compared to other diets [

 <xref rid="B40-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, one study did not find an inverse association between moderate red wine intake and the risk of colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="B41-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] or breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B42-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This controversy may result from the amount and quality of polyphenols present in red wine. Indeed, red wine contains a range of biologically active polyphenols, including phenolic acids, trihydroxystilbenes, and flavonoids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diseases-06-00106-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In previous studies, we have shown both that a mixture of polyphenol extract from vine shoots demonstrates more antiproliferative activity on colon cancer cells than resveratrol alone, due to a synergism between polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B43-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], and that the quantity and quality of the polyphenols present in wine also played an important role.
