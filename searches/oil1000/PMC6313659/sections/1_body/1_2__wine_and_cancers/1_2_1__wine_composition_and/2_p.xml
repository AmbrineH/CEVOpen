<p class="p">Wine composition is a complex and unique combination dependent on various factors such as the vine, the climate, the country, and the year. Thus, the amount of polyphenols in wine, although varying greatly, is estimated to be around 190–290 mg/L in white wines and 900–2500 mg/L in red wines [

 <xref rid="B45-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This variability of the polyphenol composition seems very important in determining its effects. We demonstrated in a previous study that the lengthening of the maceration time modified and enriched the polyphenol composition of red wine [
 <xref rid="B26-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In comparison with red wine extracts, whose maceration time was less and therefore whose polyphenol composition was lower, the extract resulting from a longer maceration in red wine showed a more pronounced antiproliferative effect, with respect to the colonic cancer lines tested [
 <xref rid="B26-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The quantitative aspect is not the only important parameter; the qualitative composition of the wines is also a crucial factor in the observation of the beneficial effects or their absence. Very interestingly, some polyphenols do not act in a synergistic manner but rather in an additive manner and in some cases have an opposite effect [
 <xref rid="B26-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These data raise the crucial role of the polyphenol composition of wine where an imbalance between polyphenolic species may increase or conversely reduce their beneficial effects. The presence of (+)-catechin reduces the synergism effect between resveratrol and quercetin, which could explain the differences studies have shown in colon cancer risk reduction with moderate red wine consumption in humans [

 <xref rid="B20-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], or in animal models [
 <xref rid="B27-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], while others showed no effect [

 <xref rid="B47-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. It therefore seems essential to study the effects of a wine in relation to its phenolic composition. Some of these polyphenols present in large quantities have a strong activity when they are studied separately. This is particularly the case for the most well-known resveratrol [

 <xref rid="B49-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], quercetin [
 <xref rid="B50-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], (+)-catechin [
 <xref rid="B51-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], and gallic acid [
 <xref rid="B52-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], which present a variety of chemopreventive properties.
