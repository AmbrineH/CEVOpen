<p class="p">In a similar manner to the different compounds that compose it, the wine extracts can modulate the activation of the kinase cascades induced by many activators. Resveratrol, a major phenolic component, can inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, which is mediated by various promoters [

 <xref rid="B77-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. For example, in vitro, resveratrol inhibits phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [
 <xref rid="B78-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. In vivo, pretreatment of the dorsal skin of female mice with resveratrol decreases the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), as well as the catalytic activity of ERK and p38 MAPK, which are stimulated by various stimuli [

 <xref rid="B80-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Lee et al. reported that red wine extract inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced transformation of JB6 promotion-sensitive mouse skin epidermal cells. The activation of activator protein-1 (AP1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NFÎºB), induced by TPA, was dose-dependently inhibited by RWE treatment [
