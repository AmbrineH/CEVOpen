<p class="p">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of cancer occurring worldwide. A total of 1.8 million cases each year are recorded [
 <xref rid="B28-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that the risk factors of developing colon cancer can be attributed mostly to multifactorial environmental factors. Therefore, the majority (95%) of CRC diagnoses begin as noncancerous polyps of the intestinal epithelium on the inner lining of the colon or rectum that have accumulated oncogenic mutations over time. Noncancerous polyps may become malignant and transform into adenomatous polyps if left undetected. Progression through the various stages of the adenoma–carcinoma process is significantly influenced by environmental factors inherent in the western lifestyle, such as the diet, the sedentary lifestyle, as well as smoking and the consumption of alcohol. Indeed, the consumption of high levels of red meat and fat together with low levels of fruits and vegetables has been suggested to increase the risk of CRC [
 <xref rid="B56-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Several studies indicate that the establishment of nutritional prevention could significantly reduce the occurrence of colon cancer. As documented in the literature, the benefits of the Mediterranean diet include protection against cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and various cancers, and now is a recommended diet, among others, in strategies for cancer prevention. However, the mechanisms involved in the protection against CRC by patients following the Mediterranean diet are not completely identified and understood. For more insight on the Mediterranean diet, Donovan et al. have reviewed preclinical and clinical studies conducted over the last 10 years on the impact of a Mediterranean diet-eating pattern [

 <xref rid="B58-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific natural products or synthetic chemical agents to delay, prevent, or reverse lesions before the development of invasive cancer [
 <xref rid="B59-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Otherwise, previous research has demonstrated that polyphenol-rich extracts from wines and grapes have the ability to modulate mutagenesis and prevent tumor initiation and promotion [
 <xref rid="B46-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Gronbaek et al. demonstrated that regular and moderate consumption of red wine is associated with a 22% decreased risk of cancer [
 <xref rid="B60-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Various reports have demonstrated the anticancer action of red wine polyphenols in animal models. For example, tumoral C26 growth was significantly reduced with red wine polyphenols in BALB/c mice [
 <xref rid="B27-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In this study, red wine extract (RWE) decreased tumor vascularization and the expression of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diseases-06-00106-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The inhibition of cell proliferation with the expression of p21, an inhibitor of the cell cycle, and the expression of tumor suppressor genes, including p16INK4A, p53, and p73, was observed. RWE is able to act on the development of colorectal cancer through the prevention of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diseases-06-00106-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In a preclinical study on male CF-1 mice developing intestine polyp preneoplasia with azoxymethane (AOM) injection [
 <xref rid="B61-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], we showed that mice receiving red wine extract in the diet, at a concentration of 500 mg/kg for 6 weeks, reduced the total number of AFCs per centimeter of colon as compared to the control group [
 <xref rid="B26-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This result is interesting because the lower part of the colon is often associated with rectal cancer. Very recently, this study was reinforced by a report showing that dried red wine, pomegranate extract, and α-tocopherol added at one dose to cured meat, and the withdrawal of sodium erythorbate, significantly decreased the number of precancerous lesions (mucin-depleted foci, MDF) per colon in rats [
 <xref rid="B62-diseases-06-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. However, white grape and rosemary extracts, which do not have the same polyphenol composition, did not. The molecular mechanism involved seems to be the suppression of fecal excretion of nitrosyl iron [
