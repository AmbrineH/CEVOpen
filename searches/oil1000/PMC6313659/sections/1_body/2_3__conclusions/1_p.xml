<p class="p">Moderate wine consumption, part of the Mediterranean diet, has been associated with potential protective effects, not only on cardiovascular pathologies but also on several cancer types. These protective effects have been attributed to wine microconstituents, such as polyphenols, among which resveratrol has been the most widely studied so far. However, much effort has been extended to characterize and understand the complex composition of wines, in particular red wine, whose polyphenol content is highly dependent on winemaking processes, the type of vine, climate, country, and the age of the wine. We have notably provided evidence that the efficacy of red wine extracts in inhibiting colon cancer cell line proliferation depended on their polyphenolic content and composition. Indeed, taken individually, red wine polyphenols have been shown to limit several stages of tumorigenesis, supporting their chemopreventive properties; however, some polyphenols may have antagonist activities, thus limiting their beneficial effects. These aspects are of importance as not all preclinical trials in humans have shown a positive effect of wine extract consumption on the occurrence of cancers, which could be partly explained by the dose used and the composition of the extracts. Nonetheless, a great deal of evidence supports the bioactivity of red wine extracts in various cancer type models, both in vitro and in vivo, in animals. Compared to individual red wine chemical constituents, RWE has been able to target the most commonly deregulated signaling pathways in cancer and prevent some of the side effects of conventional chemotherapies. Hence, diet supplementation with RWE, which does not seem to present any toxicity, at least in animal models, would be valuable in chemoprevention strategies; however, much work remains to be done to discover how best to use it (e.g., identification of the most efficient combination of microcomponents for synergistic effects), which may benefit from taking into account individual genetic variability and metabolism.</p>
