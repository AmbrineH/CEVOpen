<p class="p">Considering that most isolated constituents share a monoaminergic and/or pro-inflammatory mechanism of antidepressant action, it could be suggested that these compounds may present some chemical similarities, thus supporting an interaction with the same molecular site of action. However, the diversity of chemical structures of these compounds makes it difficult to establish a chemical template determining the antidepressant activity. This fact can be explained due to possible distinct molecular sites of action, or formation of psychoactive metabolite products.</p>
