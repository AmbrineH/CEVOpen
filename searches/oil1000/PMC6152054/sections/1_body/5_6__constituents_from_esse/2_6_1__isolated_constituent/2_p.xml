<p class="p">Other isolated constituents from essential oils that induce antidepressant-like actions possibly mediated by monoamines are 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-menthone [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], perillaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], thymol [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] and thymoquinone [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. These compounds increase monoamines in the brain, a mechanism of action similar to classical antidepressants. Studies showed that carvacrol and β-pinene induce antidepressant-like actions in behavioral despair assays, e.g., FST and TST [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The acute treatment with these isolated constituents decrease the immobility time, an effect reversed by the pretreatment with SCH23390, a dopamine D
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> antagonist [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The antidepressant effects of β-pinene were also blocked by 5-HT
 <sub class="sub">1A</sub> antagonist, β-antagonist and DSP-4, a noradrenergic neurotoxin [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. By contrast, the pretreatment with prazosin, a α
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>-receptor antagonist, yohimbine, a α
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-receptor antagonist, and PCPA, a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the antidepressant effects of carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. These experimental data suggest that β-pinene seems to evoke antidepressant actions dependent on dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems, while carvacrol displays antidepressant activity mainly mediated by dopaminergic system.
