<p class="p">Cinnamic aldehyde reversed the loss of sucrose preference in CUMS rats and also reversed the increased COX-2 hippocampal expression and enzyme activity. However, no behavioral effects have been observed when mice injected with cinnamic aldehyde were subjected in the FST [

Taken together, it is still unknown if a putative central nervous system anti-inflammatory effect is required for the antidepressant action of conventional drugs. However, further studies aimed to identify the molecular site of action of these compounds are mandatory.
