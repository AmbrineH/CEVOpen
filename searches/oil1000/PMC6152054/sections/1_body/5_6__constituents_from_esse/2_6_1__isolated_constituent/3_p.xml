 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] induce antidepressant-like effects in rodents and the mechanisms of these actions were partially described. For these compounds, potential anti-inflammatory effects may be involved and/or mediating the antidepressant actions. A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an association between concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines—mainly interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α and depressive symptoms. In addition, mounting evidence has shown a concomitant reduction in both depressive symptoms and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations following treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs [

 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-menthone, thymol and geraniol inhibited IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα cytokines and other pro-inflammatory intracellular signaling, such as NF-κB, NLRP3 and caspase 1, usually increased by stress. Interestingly, the antidepressant fluoxetine could restore CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by significantly decreasing the level of NLRP3 and caspase 1 [
