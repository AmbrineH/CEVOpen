<p class="p">Two distinct research groups from China have described the antidepressant effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Perilla frutescens</italic> L. Britton essential oil in mice. Using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), a well validated animal model of depression, these studies showed the effects of the essential oil in reversing behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological alterations induced by stress [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The essential oil restored sucrose-preference in stressed mice, a behavior intrinsically related to anedonia, a core symptom of depression. In addition, the treatment with this oil also restored the increased immobility time in the FST and TST in CUMS mice, thus supporting a robust antidepressant-like action [
