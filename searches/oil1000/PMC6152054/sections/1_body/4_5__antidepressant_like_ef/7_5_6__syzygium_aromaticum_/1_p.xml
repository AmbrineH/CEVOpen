<p class="p">Recently, a well-designed study showed the antidepressant effects of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil in rodents. After acute administration, this essential oil reduced immobility time in mice in the FST and TST. Using the CUMS, chronic administration of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry oil restored sucrose preference and reversed the increased latency to feed in an unfamiliar environment in CUMS rats [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The antidepressant doses (50–200 mg/kg) were, at least, 22-fold higher than the lethal dose 53 (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 4.5 g/kg). The chronic administration of this essential oil restored hippocampal BDNF, p-ERK and p-CREB protein expression in CUMS rats [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The major compounds identified in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry essential oil were eugenol (71%), β-caryophyllene (10%), eugenyl acetate (16%) [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Literature findings support antidepressant-like actions for eugenol and β-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], which could be synergically mediating the antidepressant effects of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry oil. Repeated administration of eugenol reduced immobility in the TST and FST [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The antidepressant effects of eugenol were attributed to the inhibition of human MAO
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], and the increase in hippocampal BDNF [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. These findings suggest that eugenol, but also β-caryophyllene could be mediating the antidepressant-like actions of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry essential oil by the increase in monoamine neurotransmission and neuroplastic actions.
