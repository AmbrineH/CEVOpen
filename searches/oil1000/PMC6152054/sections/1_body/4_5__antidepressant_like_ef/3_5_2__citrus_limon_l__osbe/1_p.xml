 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, in the same studies, inhalation of this oil reduced locomotion and exploration in the open field, which would be suggestive of a sedative effect [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Later, Lopes et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] evaluated prolonged oral effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic> L. Osbeck oil (from the leaves) in mice in the FST. Antidepressant, anxiolytic and hypolocomotor effects in animal were reported in a dose-dependent manner. A mixture of monoterpenes was detected in the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic> L. Osbeck essential oil, among which limonene (53%), geranyl acetate (10%) and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-limonene-oxide (7%) were the main compounds [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Contrasting findings are available in literature regarding the effects of limonene on mood states in rodents. After acute administration, the monoterpene was inactive in the mouse FST [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. However, under prolonged treatment (15 days), limonene reversed increased immobility time in the FST induced by neuropathic pain in rats [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The putative mechanism by which lemon oil produces antidepressant-like effects seems to be mediated by 5-HT and dopamine neurotransmission. The pretreatment with buspirone (5-HT
 <sub class="sub">1A</sub> partial agonist), DOI (5-HT
 <sub class="sub">2A</sub> receptor agonist), miaserin (5-HT
 <sub class="sub">2A/C</sub> receptor agonist), apomorphin (nonselective dopamine receptor agonist) and haloperidol (nonselective dopamine receptor antagonist), blocked the antidepressant effects of lemon oil [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Moreover, the acute inhalation of this oil significantly increased dopamine contents in the hippocampus and 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. As commented before, dopamine and 5-HT are intrinsically involved in the modulation of mood states, and hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the main stages of this action [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Thus, the antidepressant-like effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic> L. Osbeck oil might be mediated by limonene. Indeed, modulation of 5-HT and dopamine neurotransmission in brain areas highly involved with mood states could be on the basis of the antidepressant effects of lemon oil.
