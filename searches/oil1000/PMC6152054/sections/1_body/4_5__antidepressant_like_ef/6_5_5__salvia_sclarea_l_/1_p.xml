<p class="p">The antidepressant effects of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia sclarea</italic> L. were assessed in the FST in rats. The acute exposition to this oil, via intraperitoneal and inhalation, reduced immobility time similar to conventional antidepressant drugs [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The antidepressant effects of this essential oil seem to be mainly mediated by the activation of dopamine and 5-HT neurotransmission [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In fact, the pretreatment with haloperidol (Dopamine receptor antagonist), SCH-23390 (D
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> receptor antagonist), but also buspirone (5-HT
 <sub class="sub">1A</sub> partial agonist) blocked the antidepressant effect of this essential oil [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The principal constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia sclarea</italic> L. oil include linalyl acetate (64%), linalool (21%), and geraniol (2.6%) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Linalool and geraniol have showed consistent antidepressant actions in rodents after acute administrations [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. This effect of linalool in rodents were prevented with WAY100,635 (5-HT
 <sub class="sub">1A</sub> receptor antagonist) and yohimbine (Î±
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-receptor antagonist), thus reinforcing the role mediated by monoaminergic neurotransmission in the antidepressant effects of linalool [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Ultimately, the antidepressant of the 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia sclarea</italic> L. essential oil seems to be due to the synergic effects of bioactive isolated compounds.
