<p class="p">The plant species presented here were selected based on the effects shown by their essential oils in specific animal models used for evaluation of antidepressant activity and/or by complementary studies, aimed at elucidating the mechanism(s) of action of the oils or individual components. To select the essential oil constituents, terms related to the theme, such as “essential oils”, “monoterpenes” and “phenylpropanoids”, were used, as well as names of representative compounds of these chemical groups refining with “antidepressant” or “depression”. A search was performed in the scientific literature database PubMed from 1995 to December 2015. The essential oils or the main constituents were deemed to display antidepressant activity when they had shown effects in one or more different depressant model. The scientific publications were selected from studies published in English language.</p>
