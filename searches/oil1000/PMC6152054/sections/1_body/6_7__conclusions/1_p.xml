<p class="p">The antidepressant effects of essential oils and their constituents are very promising but they are still at the preliminary stages. Few clinical trials have been performed until now, and most of them are aimed for testing the effects of lavender oil. Importantly, the preclinical effects of lavender oil on rodents were superficially studied, and there is no suggestion of mechanism of action for this antidepressant effect. By contrast, some essential oil constituents display promising antidepressant effects by involving monoamine neurotransmission. With respect to the attribution of the antidepressant effect of a whole essential oil to one single constituent, the overall conclusion remains that the diversity of chemically active constituents of essential oils can be an advantage in the treatment of depression, since more than one compound with positive effects on depression can evoke synergic actions. Finally, the importance of these preclinical observations for the clinical overall picture of depression still needs to be addressed through further research. Future clinical trials will give scientific support for the employment of essential oils with potential antidepressant actions as real options for the treatment of depressive states.</p>
