<p class="p">Conventional antidepressant drugs ultimately act by increasing monoamine levels at the synaptic cleft by either: (i) blocking presynaptic monoamine transporter proteins, which remove released transmitters from the extracellular space; (ii) inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which degrades monoamine neurotransmitters; or (iii) interacting with pre- or postsynaptic receptors that regulate monoamine transmitter release and/or neuronal firing rate [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. It has been proposed that as antidepressant drugs increase extracellular monoamine concentrations, depression might be produced by deficiencies in noradrenaline, 5-HT and dopamine at their receptor sites in the brain. This proposal is known as the monoamine depression hypothesis [

Although the effects of antidepressants on monoamines can be seen soon after administration, it generally takes a few weeks of continued treatment for therapeutic responses to appear. Due to the therapeutic delay of antidepressants, problems involving the neural networkâ€™s processing of information, rather than chemical disequilibrium, might well underlie depression [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In fact, conventional antidepressants mediate their effects by increasing Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in the forebrain regions, particularly in the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy. BDNF acts in the brain inducing neuroplasticity, which results in depressive symptom improvements [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-01290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and it has already been shown that hippocampal neurogenesis is a requirement for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants [
