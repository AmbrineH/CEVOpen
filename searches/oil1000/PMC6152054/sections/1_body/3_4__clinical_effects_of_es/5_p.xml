<p class="p">In a controlled, and randomized clinical pilot trial, the effect of continuous inhalation, in adult men with depression and under conventional pharmacological treatment, of citrus fragrance, (whose main component was lemon oil), was compared with that of no fragrance (n = 12 and 8, respectively) [
