<p class="p">In the world of cardiology research, remarkably wide recognition in this matter has been obtained as a result of the trials carried out by GISSI (Gruppo Italiano per la Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto miocardico)—an Italian group studying survival of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The GISSI designed and carried out a series of large-scale clinical trials that involved more than 60,000 patients over the last 20 years. One of the research studies—the GISSI Preventzioni trial evaluated the effectiveness of a therapy with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin E, and a statin in patients with a previous AMI and demonstrated 20% mortality reduction in patients treated with omega-3 PUFAs. Another study demonstrated that omega-3 ethyl esters have clinically proven benefits in improving post-myocardial infarction (MI) outcomes, such as significant 15% risk reduction for all-cause mortality together with 20% risk reduction for CVDs [

According to the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, treatment with omega-3 PUFAs may be considered a new option to add to the shortlist of evidence-based life-prolonging therapies for heart failure [
