<p class="p">Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown in epidemiological and clinical trials to reduce the incidence of CVD. The daily intake of fish or plant origin oil rich in omega-3 fatty acid corresponding to recommended dosage may prove to be difficult, albeit valuable. Thus, an alternative method of supplementation may be oral omega n3-PUFA therapy, which represents a potentially huge factor of interest and motivation for the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical and biomedical companies are increasingly interested in the subject of omega-3 fatty acids and their metabolites, and subsequently there has been a substantial amount of research on supplements of omega-3s, particularly those found in seafood and fish oil, and heart disease. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements usually do not have negative side effects. When side effects do occur, they typically consist of minor gastrointestinal symptoms, such as belching, indigestion, or diarrhea. Although the biggest group of omega-3 supplements is based on marine or fish oils, vegetable oils have become increasingly popular and approachable in this matter, not only for vegans and vegetarians but also for people concerned about having a healthy balanced diet. Commonly used alternative dietary supplements based on Î±-linolenic acid include flaxseed oil and algae oils as a source of DHA. Plant oils (source of ALA) serving as an omega-3 supplements are as potent and effective as fish based oils (containing mainly EPA and DHA fatty acids). However, ALA with only three double bonds is not as susceptible to oxidation as EPA (five bonds) and DHA (six bonds). A substantial part of fish oils is oxidized during the production process, which significantly reduces the pharmacological activity and may confer toxic properties.</p>
