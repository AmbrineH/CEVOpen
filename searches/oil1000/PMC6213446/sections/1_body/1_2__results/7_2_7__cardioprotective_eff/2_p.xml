<p class="p">Both anticoagulant and antiplatelet functions of omega-3 PUFAs were explored in the past with inconsistent findings, therefore complementary studies were required [

The results obtained may be of significant clinical importance, as they indicated the ability to improve platelet response to clopidogrel by omega-3 PUFA co-administration in coronary artery disease patients treated with angioplasty (percutaneous coronary intervention) who are carriers of the loss-of-function CYP2C19 genetic variant. These findings are also supported by the results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 study subanalysis [
