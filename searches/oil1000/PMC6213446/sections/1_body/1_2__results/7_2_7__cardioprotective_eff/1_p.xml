<p class="p">Solid experimental evidence of different effects of omega-3 fatty acids on individual components of cardiovascular risk has been described. Multiple research studies revealed that omega-3 long-chain fatty acids may prevent myocardial infarction and arrhythmia, decrease systolic, and diastolic blood pressure and improve vascular function. This effect can be explained by very rapid omega-3 fatty acids incorporation into cell membranes, thus affecting the function of cells and tissues with subsequent impacts on the production of various vasoactive eicosanoids and other mediators [

Although the exact mechanisms of the beneficial effect of omega-3s on cardiovascular diseases are multifactorial and remain unclear, a series of omega-3 PUFAs action has been proven and described as mechanisms with major importance for cardiology.
