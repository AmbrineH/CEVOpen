<p class="p">An epidemiologic approach has been applied in order to evaluate the relationship between plasma ALA levels, dietary ALA consumption, and AF risk. Fretts et al.’s research group investigated subjects who were 65 years or older at study entry and detected no relationship between plasma ALA and AF incident after correcting for age, sex, and a variety of clinical and demographic factors [

It should be mentioned that a similar epidemiologic study has recently reported a beneficial effect of dietary ALA with respect to heart failure risk. Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are frequently comorbid conditions. It seems probable that diets that substantially increase ALA consumption with concurrent decrease in omega-6 PUFAs intake would beneficially affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [

Calo et al., conducted an open-label, prospective, randomized study in order to assess the efficacy of preoperative and postoperative treatment with omega-3 PUFAs in preventing the occurrence of AF, which is the most coincident complication associated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery [

The daily doses of omega-3 PUFAs consisted of two gelatin capsules containing 850 to 882 mg EPA and DHA as ethyl esters with an average ratio of 1:2 EPA/DHA. As a result, postoperative AF was noted in 15.2% (12 of 79) of the patients in the PUFA group compared to 33.3% (27 of 81) of those in the control group. Additionally, the PUFA patients were hospitalized after surgery for significantly fewer days than the controls. This was the first study to demonstrate that individuals supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs presented a decreased risk ratio in cardiac events, like the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation [

ALA’s role either in isoproterenol-treated isolated rat cardiomyocytes or in in vivo rat hearts was studied, and it was demonstrated that an ALA-enriched diet protects the heart against induced fibrosis and hypertrophy [
