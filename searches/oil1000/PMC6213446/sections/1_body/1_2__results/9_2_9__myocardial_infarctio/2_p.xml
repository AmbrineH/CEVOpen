<p class="p">The Lyon Diet Heart Study found plasma ALA to be associated with an improved prognosis for recurrent myocardial infarction, but it did not find a similar association with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. A meta-analysis of five prospective studies on ALA suggested that high ALA intake was associated with reduced risk of fatal heart disease (relative risk 0.79, 0.60–1.04) [

Omega-3 fatty acids may provide rapid protective effects in patients with AMI, according to the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled long-term trial. The effects of treatment with fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.08 g/day) and mustard oil (α-linolenic acid, 2.9 g/day) were compared for 1 year in the management of patients divided into a fish oil group, a mustard oil group, and placebo patients with suspected AMI. The fish oil and mustard oil groups showed a significant reduction in total cardiac arrhythmias, left ventricular enlargement, and angina pectoris compared to the placebo group [

According to the authors, plasma ALA may be slightly associated with reduced AMI risk, even in individuals with high concentrations of long-chain omega-3s, and this may be partially mediated by lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol level [

Contrary to the pointed importance of the aforementioned finding, the results of the study by Derbali et al., proved that flaxseed oil has a significant effect in heart protection against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Linum oil pre-co-treatment was reported as an agent preventing almost all induced MI parameters through the beneficial effect of the important ALA fraction [
