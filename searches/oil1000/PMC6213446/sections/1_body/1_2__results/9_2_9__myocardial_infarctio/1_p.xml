<p class="p">Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs due to damage to the heart muscle caused by stopped blood flow, which prevents blood from reaching the heart—this refers to STEMI (ST-elevated myocardial infarction) or injured heart muscle caused by major obstruction in blood flow through coronary arteries (NSTEMI—non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction). The MI mechanism often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) can contain 70% total plasma cholesterol and—as mentioned previously—is considered the foremost malefactor triggering inflammatory processes and early plaque formation, which later might lead to MI and stroke. It was identified by Assmann and Gotto that reduction in the LDL levels could lower the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), including MI, by up to one-third. HDL (the good lipoprotein, which carries only 20% total plasma cholesterol) has also been linked to the rates of coronary events in epidemiological and clinical studies [

Although LDL is the lipoprotein most commonly associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk, other lipoproteins, such as VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), might also act as atherogenic factors. On the other hand, HDL appears to play a protective role, and high levels of HDL particles are associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease. The cardioprotective effects of HDL have been attributed to its role in reverse cholesterol transport [

The results of a clinical study on non-insulin-dependent diabetic individuals consuming a diversified ratio of dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid (P/S) indicated that fish oil significantly reduced plasma triacylglycerol levels (

Demonty et al., concluded that a modest intake of omega-3 fatty acids, such as could be obtained due to regular fish consumption, would reduce plasma triglyceride levels without affecting LDL or HDL cholesterol levels [

It is worth mentioning that an increasing amount of data indicate that to initiate atherosclerosis, LDL has to undergo chemical modification, such as oxidation or glycation, since these particles are more liable to retention within the vessel wall intima [

Modified or damaged LDLs or their particular types (e.g., VLDL) have become a subject of interest in regard to their role in CVDs. Thus, when it comes to cholesterol particles, a high LDL level by itself cannot be considered to be the decisive factor responsible for cardiovascular dysfunctions. Current evidence suggests that cardiovascular risk depends on the “quality” rather than only the “quantity” of LDL [
