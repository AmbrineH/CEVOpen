<p class="p">Many studies on stroke models have shown that omega-3 fatty acids are able to protect against ischemic brain injury [

It was suggested that this inability to explain the underlying mechanisms behind the protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids could be due to the multiple effects of these acids, i.e., anti-inflammatory activity [
