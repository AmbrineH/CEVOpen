Thus, an important issue in stroke-related research is the search for some alternative therapies that would be safe in the case of long-term prophylactic administration. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that the brain of an adult is able to try to repair itself in reaction to ischemic insults, no safe, efficient therapies that would enhance repair mechanisms and thus prevent neurological deficits induced by stroke have been recognized. Therefore, attention has been paid to neurorestorative therapies that are able to boost cerebral brain repair and concurrently enhance post-ischemia neurological recovery [
