<p class="p">The study conducted by Mozaffarian et al. [
 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>] revealed that total omega-3 level in plasma was inversely correlated with ischemic stroke risk; however, the authors did not demonstrate any significant effect in the case of hemorrhagic stroke [
 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. A meta-analysis of fish consumption relation to stroke conducted by Larsson and Orsini [
 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>] demonstrated that increased fish consumption (three servings per week) was associated with a 6% lower stroke incidence [
 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. Also, a meta-analysis of cohort studies performed by He et al. [
 <xref rid="B133-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>] showed an inverse relationship between stroke (especially ischemic one) and fish consumption. However, in another study [
 <xref rid="B134-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>], fish oil supplementation was not related to a decreased stroke incidence. Also, a meta-analysis conducted by Siscovick et al. [
 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>] provided only minor evidence of stroke incidence decrease in patients supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs. Similar conclusions were reported by other meta-analyses [
 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>,
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>].
