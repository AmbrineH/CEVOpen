<p class="p">A study conducted by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] demonstrated that an endogenous post-stroke angiogenesis was induced by omega-3 supplementation, and this measure may be considered to be a potential angiogenic factor enhancing endogenous tissue repair and improving long-term functional recovery after stroke. In turn, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>] demonstrated in their study that prolonged administration of fish oil caused an increase in cerebral omega-3 level and provided long-term histological and neurological protection against ischemic brain damage. This study also demonstrated that omega-3 PUFAs derived from dietary supplementation can actively promote brain repair due to the possibility of post-stroke brain revascularization as well as enhanced neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, not only alleviate ischemic brain injury.
