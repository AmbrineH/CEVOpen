<p class="p">Results of various research studies have shown that the suppression of atherosclerosis is associated with reduced levels of serum lipids and antioxidant activity. A recent study hat was designed to evaluate the effects of flaxseed oil containing α-linolenic acid ester of plant sterols (ALA-PS) demonstrated that ALA-PS flaxseed oil synergistically interacted in atherosclerosis ameliorating as well as in optimizing overall lipid levels, contracting inflammation, and lowering oxidative stress [

Another animal study suggested that ingestion of oxidized flaxseed oil increases hepatic plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and is potentially pro-atherogenic. Mice from the control group received fresh flaxseed oil, while the experimental population received the same diet with heated flaxseed oil. The results obtained demonstrated that aortic wall thickness increased and lumen and diameter parameters changed only in the experimental group [

The same study also demonstrated that flaxseed can suppress hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis in a rabbit model.
