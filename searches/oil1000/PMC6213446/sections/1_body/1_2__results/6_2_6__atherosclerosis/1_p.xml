<p class="p">Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic, but over time, the arteries’ walls can harden and the lumen of blood vessels can become narrower. The direct cause of atherosclerosis is plaque accumulating and building up inside the arteries. Plaque is a miscellany of cholesterol, cells, and debris that creates a bump on the artery wall. It all begins with damage to the endothelium—a thin layer of cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels—that can be caused by risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, or high cholesterol, that afterwards leads to plaque formation.</p>
