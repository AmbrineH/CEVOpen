<p class="p">Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are classified as either monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), because they have only one double bond (e.g., omega-7 and -9 fats), or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), since they have more than one double bond in their backbone (e.g., omega-3 and -6 acids) [

The most important role and significant functions are attributed to PUFAs, which possess a unique subgroup referred to essential fatty acids (EFAs), cannot be synthesized de novo and like vitamins, and need to be delivered with food. They can be further classified in various groups due to their chemical structure. Omega fatty acids are classified according to the location of the first double bondâ€”the difference between them is expressed by the number of omega [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Two main compound groups can be distinguished among PUFAs: omega-3 and omega-6 families. The first double bond in the omega-3 family occurs at the third carbon from the methyl end of the chain (hence the name omega-3), and in the case of the omega-6 family, the first double bond occurs at the sixth carbon from the methyl end of the chain (
