<p class="p">It has been established that PUFAs are required for the normal development and functioning of the brain and heart, and also for the equilibrium of all tissues and organs. Studies concerning the nutritional deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids as well as the particular roles of omega-6 and omega-3 have become the focus of numerous research groups around the world [

Deficit of omega-6 linoleic acid leads to poor growth, fatty liver, skin lesions, and reproductive failure, while the symptoms of omega-3 fatty acids deficiency include reduced vision or abnormal electroretinogram results. Studies in rodents have revealed significant effects of n-3 PUFAs deficiency on learning, memory, cognition, and behavior [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The literature reports highlight how the increment of the omega-6/omega-3 ratio corresponds to an increase in the occurrence of pro-inflammatory conditions. It is crucial to maintain a proper balance of omega-3 in our bodies, since an excess of omega-6 leads to low grade chronic systemic inflammationâ€”recognized as the leading cause of the so-called civilizational diseases [
