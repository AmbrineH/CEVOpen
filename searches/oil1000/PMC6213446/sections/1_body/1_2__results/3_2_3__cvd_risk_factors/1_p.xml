<p class="p">In its Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organization (WHO) divided cardiovascular risk factors into modifiable and non-modifiable ones [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It reported that most cardiovascular diseases are triggered by risk factors that can be controlled, treated, or modified, such as high blood pressure, lipid disorders, overweight/obesity, tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and diabetes. The WHO together with World Health Federation (WHF) have been raising concerns that in 2008, 9.8% of men and 13.8% of women were obese (with a body mass index (BMI) higher than or equal to 30 kg/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), compared to 4.8% for men and 7.9% for women in 1980. In regard to tobacco users, the WHO estimates that there are currently about 1 billion smokers in the world today. A higher risk of CVDs development was associated with heavy smokers, female smokers and young male smokers [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. It was emphasized in the report that cardiovascular risk increases with elevated blood glucose values and therefore CVDs account for about 60% of all mortality in people with diabetes.
