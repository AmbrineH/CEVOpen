<p class="p">However, in addition to the variable risk factors, there are also some major CVD factors that cannot be controlled, which include age, gender, and genetic predisposition based on family history. It is well-known that CVDs become increasingly common with age. As a person gets older, the heart undergoes subtle physiologic changes, even in the absence of disease. As the heart muscle undergoes ageing it is often unable to relax completely between beats, and as a result, the pumping chambers become stiffer and may work less efficiently. With respect to the age factor, some studies suggest that men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women. Once past menopause, a womanâ€™s risk is comparable to that of a man. However, the answer for whether premenopausal women are protected from atherosclerotic disease by virtue of their hormonal status still remains inconclusive. The same risk factors for cardiovascular diseases appear to act in women as in men, although the general insufficiency of women presented in a large number of studies means that far less information about the importance of these risk factors is available to us. In light of these data, the risk of stroke is similar for men and women [
