<p class="p">Regarding the suggestion that the cardioprotective effect of fish intake is mainly due to the antiarrhythmic properties of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which modulate ion currents, omega-3 PUFAs of vegetable origin were also examined. Epidemiological studies and dietary trials in humans suggest that Î±-linolenic acid is a major cardioprotective nutrient [

The results of the studies conducted by Dhein et al. or Guizy et al. indicated that ALA directly blocks atria-specific Kv1.5 channels without modifying their expression or the bilayer order. Together with the indicated influence of EPA and DHA, these effects suggest that the antiarrhythmic potential of diets enriched with plant-derived n-3 PUFAs may partially result from direct effects on cardiac ion channels [
