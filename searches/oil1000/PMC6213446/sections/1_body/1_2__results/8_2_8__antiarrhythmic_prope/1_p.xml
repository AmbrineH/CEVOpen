<p class="p">Antiarrhythmic properties are of particular interest to researchers. The antiarrhythmic effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been widely described and explained by their effect on the ionic currents and sodium channels in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes [

Impact on sodium channels causes a shift in the state of dynamic balance inactivation towards hyperpolarized potentials. Consequently, the cardiomyocytes are less susceptible to stimulation. Furthermore, it appears that omega-3 PUFAs are characterized by even higher efficacy in arrhythmia conditions triggered by fresh ischemia (this situation often results in ventricular fibrillation). It was also confirmed in a study involving an animal model. A concentrate of free fish-oil fatty acids in oral administration was tested with respect to its prevention effect on sudden cardiac death in dogs, and the obtained results indicate that purified omega-3 fatty acids could prevent ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation in the applied dog model [
