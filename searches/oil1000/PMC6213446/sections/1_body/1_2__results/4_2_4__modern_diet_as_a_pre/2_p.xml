<p class="p">A population study has shown that the foods typically consumed in Western diets are heavily laden with fatty acids of the omega-6 family. The current human diet has nothing to do with the diet of our ancestors, and it is generally accepted that hunter-gatherer societies, and other less “Westernized” populations, exhibited superior health markers, such as body composition and physical fitness, when compared to Western populations. Throughout 4–5 million years of hominid evolution, diets were abundant in omega-3 fatty acids from fish and raw meat, but relatively low in omega-6 seed oils. Simopoulos quotes several sources informing that human beings evolved on a diet with a specific proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids of approximately 1, whereas nowadays this ratio in Western diets is 15/1–16.7/1 [
