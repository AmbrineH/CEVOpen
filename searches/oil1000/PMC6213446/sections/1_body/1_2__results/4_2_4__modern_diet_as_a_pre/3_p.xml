<p class="p">Sources of omega-6 fats include the common vegetable oils used in cooking (corn, safflower, sunflower, etc.), hydrogenated versions of these oils used to make margarine and vegetable shortening, and animal origin food derived from livestock raised on grain, rather than on green pasture. The volume of omega-6 sources in the average diet largely exceeds the volume of omega-3 fatty acids sourcesâ€”green vegetables, wild ocean fish, flaxseed, walnuts, and animals raised on green vegetation. As a result, Americans usually have omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ratios in their tissues on a level of 10:1 to 20:1. With this preponderance of omega-6s in the diet, there is no wonder why people suffer from the consequences of excess omega-6, which are manifested in chronic inflammation, hypertension, as well as an increased blood clotting tendency that elevates the risk for heart attack and stroke.</p>
