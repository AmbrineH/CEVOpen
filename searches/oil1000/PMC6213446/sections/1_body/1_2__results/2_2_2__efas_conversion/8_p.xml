<p class="p">Omega-3s and omega-6s present various antagonistic activities. Arachidonic acid undergoes transformation to eicosanoids (leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and the precursor of the first series of prostaglandins), activating the inflammatory and prothrombotic processes, thus facilitating platelet aggregation. AA and EPA also are transformed into their respective hydroxy acids, which in turn are converted into leukotrienes (LTs). Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are highly biologically active, are characterized by pro-inflammatory activity, and are known to be involved in various pathological processes, such as atherosclerosis, bronchial asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and several other inflammatory conditions.</p>
