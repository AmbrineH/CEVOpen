<p class="p">The concentration of fatty acids in blood reflects both dietary intake and biological processes. When omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs are consumed, they compete for incorporation into cell membranes in all tissues of the body. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids precursors, i.e., ALA and LA, strive for the same metabolic pathways in the synthesis of longer polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as AA, EPA, and DHA) and for the availability of the same elongase and desaturase enzymes, particularly for Δ6-desaturase. It has been observed that too high an intake of LA would reduce the level of Δ6-desaturase available for the metabolism of ALA [
