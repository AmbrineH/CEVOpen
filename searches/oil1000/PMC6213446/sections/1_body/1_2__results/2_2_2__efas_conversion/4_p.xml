<p class="p">Burdge et al., designed a study to estimate the capacity of α-linolenic acid to be converted into omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Carbon isotope labelling was used and 13C-ALA was administered orally to six young male subjects who consumed it as part of their usual diet. The results obtained suggested that the liver was the principal site of ALA desaturation and elongation, but the analysis also indicated that approximately 8% of dietary ALA is converted to EPA. There was no significant 13C enrichment of DHA above natural abundance at any of the time points measured over 21 days, thus the percentage of ALA converted to DHA was estimated to be 0–4% [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Another study based on radioisotope-labelled ALA application suggested that its conversion to long-chain metabolites is approximately 6% for EPA and 3.8% for DHA in the case of a diet high in saturated fat. However, with a diet rich in n-6 PUFA, this conversion can be reduced by 40–50% [

 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The level of EPA and DHA was measured in rat’s liver, heart, brain, and serum after 60 days of dietary intake of linseed oil, fish oil, and groundnut oil. The obtained results indicated that to maintain a given level of EPA and DHA, required amount of dietary ALA is a few times higher than the combined amount of EPA + DHA (fish oil). Therefore, the efficacy of ALA is lower when compared to applied EPA + DHA in elevating serum and tissue long-chain n-3 PUFA levels [
