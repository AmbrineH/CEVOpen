<p class="p">In the omega-6 family, LA is converted to γ-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3, n-6) due to the activity of Δ6-desaturase enzyme, and then GLA is elongated to form dihomo-GLA (DGLA, 20:3, n-6), which is the precursor of the first series of prostaglandins (PGs). Through Δ5-desaturase action, GLA can also be converted to arachidonic acid (AA), which forms the precursor of the second series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes and the fourth series of leukotrienes.</p>
