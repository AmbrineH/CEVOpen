<p class="p">It is known that the activities of desaturases and elongases involved in the metabolism of EFAs are affected by a number of factors, many of which contribute to reducing the activity of enzymes responsible for ALA and EPA conversion (e.g., smoking, alcohol, stress (adrenaline), deficiencies of certain vitamins or minerals) [

 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. However, in recent years various publications have reported on compounds that could stimulate PUFAs conversion. Co-factors essential for normal ∆6-desaturase activity include pyridoxine, zinc, and magnesium. Δ6-desaturase is activated by insulin, whereas diabetics have reduced Δ6-desaturase activity [
