<p class="p">The first step of this process involves ALA conversion into EPA, which is an active metabolic product. This is performed through a double bond formation at the sixth and fifth position (by ∆6- and ∆5-desaturase catalysis) and double bond elongation at the sixth position (∆6-elongase). Then, EPA can be metabolized into DHA via ∆5-elongation and ∆4-desaturation [
