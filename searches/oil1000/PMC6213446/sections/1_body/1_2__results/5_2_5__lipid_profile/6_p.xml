<p class="p">It is worth mentioning that lipid profile disorders also include abnormalities in triglycerides (TGs) levels in blood plasma. Combined dyslipidemia concerns concurrent unbeneficial changes in various subfractions of lipids, including increased levels of LDL cholesterol and TGs and a reduced level of HDL cholesterol. It was demonstrated in numerous studies that statins, especially at higher doses, are able to reduce blood TGs level, however, it was proved that omega-3 fatty acids are more effective in this case [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The recent meta-analysis prepared by Alexander et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] mentioned a prominent effect of omega-3 long-chain PUFAs supplementation in lowering the concentration of serum TGs, and emphasized that an elevated TGslevel is responsible for an increased CVD risk. Thus, the combination therapy of statins and omega-3s may be useful when there is need for the optimization of TGs levels in the event of combined dyslipidemia [
 <xref rid="B62-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. It was demonstrated in the study by Weber and Raederstorff [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation may reduce serum TG levels by 20% to 40%, and the authors suggest that this is due to lowered production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDLs) or an enhanced clearance of chylomicron TGs [
 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. It was demonstrated in the study by Davidson et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] that the combined administration of statin (simvastatinâ€”40 mg/d) and omega-3 supplement (465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA per 1-g capsule) positively affected the blood plasma lipid profile (a decrease in non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, and TG), and this effect was more profound than in the case of statin or omega-3s alone [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Also, Micallef and Garg [
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] concluded in their study that the potential benefits related to blood lipid parameters such as cholesterol and TGs level can be enhanced using omega-3s as an adjunct to statin therapy.
