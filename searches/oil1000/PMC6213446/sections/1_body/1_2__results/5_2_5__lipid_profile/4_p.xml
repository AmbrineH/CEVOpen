<p class="p">A single LDL particle formed from apolipoproteins B (apoB) is about 220–275 angstroms in diameter, and typically transports 3000 to 6000 fat molecules including cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides (with the amounts of each varying considerably) [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Therefore, LDL, the so-called “bad” cholesterol, deposits an excess of cholesterol in the walls of blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, or, in some cases, to heart attack. As a quite simple measurement, a lipid profile can provide important information about the progression of diseases.
