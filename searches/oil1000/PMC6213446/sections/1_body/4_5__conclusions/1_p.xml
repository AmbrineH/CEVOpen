<p class="p">Exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids deserve special attention, given the importance of their physiological functions, determined by the limited capacity of fatty acid desaturation by human tissues. As is clear from the above facts, omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (the pharmacologically active precursor of EPA and DHA), have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective activities. There is, however, still need for further research into the function of ALA as an independent nutrient. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids and their esters have been previously documented in terms of both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular system disorders. It has to be highlighted, however, that the achievement of optimal performance requires an appropriate quantitative composition and the proper proportions of delivered fatty acids. A healthy balanced diet, especially when combined with regular physical activity and smart supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids, has been reported as being effective in preventing cardiovascular events, cardiac death, and coronary events, especially in persons with high cardiovascular risk. </p>
