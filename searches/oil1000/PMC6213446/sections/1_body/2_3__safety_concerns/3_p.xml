<p class="p">A study concerning the relationship between omega-3 fatty acid index and bleeding in the course of AMI was conducted by Salisbury et al. [
 <xref rid="B148-nutrients-10-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. The authors suggested that, despite numerous benefits related to CVDs, omega-3 acids can also inhibit platelet aggregation, thus increasing the risk of bleeding. However, following a study on a large, multicenter group of AMI patients, the authors concluded that there is no relationship between the bleeding and omega-3 index, and thus the concerns about bleeding should not prevent the use of omega-3 supplementation in the case of clinical indications.
