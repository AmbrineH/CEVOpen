<p class="p">In the same study, Elshafie et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that the bioactive treatments which exhibited the highest
 <italic class="italic"> in vitro</italic> activity were selected for further
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> experiments against the same postharvest pathogenic fungi and concluded that carvacrol and thymol showed a promising inhibition of the brown rot disease of peach fruit caused by
 <italic class="italic"> M. laxa</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> M. fructicola,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> M. fructigena</italic>. The antifungal effect is mainly attributed to the inhibition of both mycelium growth and spore germination. This hypothesis suggests that impeding the initial infection and the subsequent mycelial spread beyond the infection site will restrict the expression of disease.
