<p class="p">For the digestibility trial, daily amounts of the tested diets were weighed at the first day of the collection period and offered once per day. By the end of the digestibility trial, feed residues were weighed and subtracted from the total feed offered to obtain feed intake. The period of excreta collection lasted three days. Collected excreta of each bird were dried at 65 Â°C for 24 hours. Dried excreta were left for few hours to get equilibrium with the atmosphere then ground, mixed, and stored in screw-top glass jars for chemical analysis.
