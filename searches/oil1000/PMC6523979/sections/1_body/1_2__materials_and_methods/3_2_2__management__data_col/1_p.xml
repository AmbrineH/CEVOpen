<p class="p">Birds were fed ad libitum and fresh water was available at all times during the experimental period. Hens were maintained on a 17-7 h lightâ€“dark cycle throughout the experiment. A vaccination program was carried out under veterinarian supervision according to age stages. Egg number and feed intake were recorded daily for each replicate. Feed conversion was calculated as g feed/g egg. Egg weight (to the nearest 0.05 g) was recorded daily and individually for each replicate (of 3 hens) then expressed the result per hen. Egg mass was calculated as g egg per hen per day. </p>
