<p class="p">An experiment with a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement was performed to evaluate the effect of four levels of DDGS (0, 6, 12, and 18% of diet) and two levels of EEM (0 or 250 mg EEM/kg diet) on performance and egg quality of laying hens through 32–42 weeks of age. Laying hens underwent an adaptation period during the 31st week of age. A total of 144 Hisex Brown laying hens (31 weeks) were randomly divided into 8 experimental groups of 18 hens each (6 replicates with 3 hens). Birds (similar in body weight, 1650 g) were housed in a layer cage with 40 × 40 × 40 cm dimensions. Eight isocaloric-isonitrogenous diets in mash form were formulated to cover the nutrient requirements of laying hens from 32 to 42 weeks of age according to NRC [

The chemical composition of DDGS (USA) was as follows: 89.05% dry matter; 95.38% organic matter; 4.62% ash; 27.23% crude protein; 11.27% ether extract; 7.45% crude fiber; 38.48% nitrogen-free extract. The composition and chemical analysis of the experimental diets are shown in
