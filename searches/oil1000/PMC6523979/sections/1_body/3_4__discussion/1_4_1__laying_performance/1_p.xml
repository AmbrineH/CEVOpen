<p class="p">No statistical differences in egg production percentage were detected among the control and 6 or 12% DDGS diet groups (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This evidence that increasing DDGS inclusion up to 12 % does not have any adverse effects on hens production. In line with our findings, Bregendahl and Roberts [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] found that 23-week-old Hyline layers fed 100 g/kg DDGS diet had the same laying rate as that of the control group (0 g DDGS/kg diet), and Cortes–Cuevas et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] also observed non-significant differences in laying performance (egg production, feed intake, and feed conversion) among DDGS levels in Bovans–White hens at 69 and 77 weeks of age. Roberson et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported that hens fed diets containing up to 15% DDGS maintained their production rate, while Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] claimed that dietary inclusion of up to 6% DDGS did not have a negative effect on egg production, although the DDGS groups tended to have better feed efficiency. In contrast, Masa’deh [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] reported negative influences on egg production with increasing levels of DDGS from 0 to 250 g/kg for White Leghorn hens, and Ghazalah et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] showed that egg production and feed conversion of laying hens decreased significantly as dietary DDGS inclusion increased. The conflicting responses of laying hens fed corn DDGS diets is possibly due to the great variation in the availability and nutritional composition of different sources of DDGS [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In this study, the inclusion of 18% DDGS in a layer diet negatively affected productive performance traits (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Egg production decreased as the level of DDGS increased during 32–42 weeks of age. The high level of NSP is one of the reasons for the negative impact of the high DDGS inclusion (18%) in laying hen diets as explained by Abd El-Hack et al. [
