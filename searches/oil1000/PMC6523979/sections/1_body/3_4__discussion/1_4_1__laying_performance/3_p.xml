<p class="p">In the current study, EEM supplementation did not significantly affect egg production or FCR (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, Masa’deh [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] found no statistically significant increase or decrease in egg production due to enzyme addition. On the contrary, Świątkiewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that enriching the diet with enzymes significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) increased egg production in the second phase of the laying cycle. Our results are also aligned with those reported by Bölükbaşi et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], who reported no significant effect of enzymes on FCR of laying hens. On the other hand, Abd El-Hack et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] demonstrated that supplementing a layer diet with an enzyme cocktail (Gallazyme) improved (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.017) feed efficiency and decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.014) laying rate compared to the group that did not receive enzyme supplementation. In that study, the interaction between DDGS and Gallazyme had a statistically significant effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 or 0.01) on feed efficiency and egg output [
