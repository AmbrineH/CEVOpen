<p class="p">Previous studies did not show significant differences in hensâ€™ feed intake and feed conversion ratio as affected by DDGS dietary levels [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Contrary to our results, Roberson et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] found that feed intake and conversion was not affected by dietary supplementation of DDGS, and they suggested that DDGS (as an alternative feed ingredient) should be included in the layer diet at a lower level, such as 6%, to avoid the linear reduction of egg production parameters. Romero et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] also found no significant (
