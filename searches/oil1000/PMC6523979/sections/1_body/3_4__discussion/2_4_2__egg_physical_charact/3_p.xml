<p class="p">Our findings showed that all egg quality criteria (excluding shell thickness and shell percentage) were significantly (

 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). No specific interaction resulted in the best results for all egg quality criteria, but it is observable that elevating DDGS level up to 18%, plus 250 mg EEM/kg diet, gave the best Haugh unit scores (91.27) compared to the other interactions. Similar results were obtained by Abd El-Hack et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], who reported that the combination of 750 g DDGS/kg substituted for soybean meal, with 250 mg Gallazyme/kg diet, resulted in the best Haugh unit scores (90.03) compared to other experimental groups.
