<p class="p">Yolk color is considered one of the main attributes of egg quality for consumers, although it has no effect on egg nutritional value. Cutts et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] indicated that the majority of the people surveyed in some European countries (UK, France, Spain, Poland, Germany, and Greece) expressed a preference for egg yolks with the darkest color (color score 14; measuring 8, 10, 12, and 14 on the Roche Yolk Color Scale). Values of 
 <italic class="italic">L*</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">b*</italic> express the density of yolk color: the greater the 
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b*</italic> values, the denser the color. The redness (
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic>) measurement was more accurate for detecting differences in yolk color than either 
 <italic class="italic">L*</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">b*</italic> values [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and in this study, the highest 
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic> value was associated with the inclusion of 18% DDGS. Hens that did not receive dietary DDGS produced eggs with the highest 
 <italic class="italic">L*</italic> and the lowest 
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic> values. In agreement with our data, Cheon et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] found that yolk color density increased with increasing DDGS level up to 20%. Our results were also in accordance with those of Sun [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], Cortes-Cuevas et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], Świątkiewicz and Koreleski [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], and Loar et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] all of whom confirmed that yolk color density increased with increasing dietary DDGS. Contrary to our results, Lumpkins et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] found insignificant effects of DDGS supplemented diets on egg yolk color score. Roberson et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] also stated that a reduction in yellowness (
 <italic class="italic">b*</italic>) was detected in eggs laid by hens aged 64 weeks when fed 15% DDGS.
