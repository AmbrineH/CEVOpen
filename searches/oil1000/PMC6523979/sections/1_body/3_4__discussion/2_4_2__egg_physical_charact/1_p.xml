<p class="p">The data reported herein revealed that Haugh units increased in eggs produced by DDGS groups in comparison to the control group (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Sun [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] reported that DDGS may have positive effects on maintaining the physical state of egg albumin, and that albumin increased when DDGS was incorporated into the diet at rates of up to 50%. In the present study, increasing DDGS levels up to 18% also led to a reduction in shell thickness and shell weight. The low shell weight and shell thickness measures that were obtained from hens fed 18% DDGS diets might be due to the reduction in overall egg weight in the DDGS diet groups compared with the control [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. On the contrary, Elaroussi et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] indicated that small eggs tend to have thicker eggshell than large eggs when the same amount of calcium is deposited. The reduction in shell thickness might be due to the consumption of sulfur from sulfur-rich DDGS, which might interfere with the absorption of dietary calcium from small intestines [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], thus reducing eggshell quality. On the other hand, our results disagree with those obtained by Cheon et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and Mustafa [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], who found that DDGS did not significantly affect egg characteristics.
