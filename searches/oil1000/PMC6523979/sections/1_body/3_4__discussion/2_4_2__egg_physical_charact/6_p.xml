<p class="p">With regard to EEM supplementation, the reported data (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) agree with those of Shalash et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], who observed that yolk color density increased significantly due to enzyme addition to the diets of laying hens. Ghazalah et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found that hens fed a 75% DDGS diet substituted for soybean meal, with Avizyme supplementation, had a significantly higher egg yolk color score than the other treatment groups. This might be due to the dietary pigmentation released from cell wall contents [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. On the contrary, Deniz et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] reported that yolk color was not significantly influenced by enzyme cocktail supplementation at any inclusion level of corn DDGS.
