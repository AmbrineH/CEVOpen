<p class="p">The results reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> show that dietary DDGS levels significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> â‰¤ 0.0001) influence egg yolk lipid composition. Previous studies have shown that increasing levels of dietary DDGS results in a diet with higher fat content, results in greater levels of yolk lipids [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and that dietary fatty acid composition is the most important factor affecting the fatty acid composition of eggs [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The level of egg yolk cholesterol depends on its concentration in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), not in blood plasma [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], whereas yolk cholesterol was transported by VLDL [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. A higher content of unsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk could be attributed to the fact that DDGS contains a large amount of unsaturated fatty acids, and about 56% of these are linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Hence, a change of yolk fatty acids composition was expected when using dietary DDGS [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The latter authors also reported that the fat and cholesterol content in the egg yolk of 50-week-old ducks increased significantly when ducks were fed diets containing 12 and 18% DDGS [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], which was in agreement with our findings here. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] indicated that 18% dietary DDGS tended to increase the cholesterol content of yolk during the late laying phase. On the other hand, Cheon et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] showed that DDGS did not exert any influence on the crude fat content of egg yolk.
