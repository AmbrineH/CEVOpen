<p class="p">Hen eggs are considered among the most beneficial foods for human health based on their high content of omega 6 fatty acid (29.8%), as confirmed by Polat et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The composition of dietary fatty acids is the most essential factor affecting the fatty acid component of hen eggs and broiler meat [

 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The present study showed that different DDGS inclusion rates can influence the fatty acid composition of egg yolk due to the differences in fatty acid composition in DDGS diets (

 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] showed that different DDGS inclusion rates (0, 17, 35, and 50% DDGS) could influence egg yolk fatty acid composition due to the differences in DDGS dietsâ€™ fatty acid composition. Sun [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] also found that omega-3 (linolenic acid and EPA) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) fatty acids were influenced by DDGS diets. On the other hand, Cheon et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] concluded that neither saturated nor unsaturated fatty acids found in yolk were affected by dietary DDGS inclusion.
