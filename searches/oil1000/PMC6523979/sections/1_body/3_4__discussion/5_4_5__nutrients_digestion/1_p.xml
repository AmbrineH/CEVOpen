This depression may belong to the increasing dietary crude fiber along with increasing DDGS level. Elevated fiber contents may increase nitrogen endogenous losses and therefore decrease the apparent digestibility of protein [

 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] explained that the increase in dietary fiber is always attributed to a depression in the nutrients digestibility. Similar results obtained by Shalash et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] found that cockers fed diet contained 100% DDGS instead of soybean meal declined the digestion coefficient of the extract to 69.3% vs. 82.37 % for those fed 50% DDGS replacement. Ghazalah et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] demonstrated that elevating DDGS level up to 75% instead of soybean meal gave the lowest crude protein and crude protein digestibilities.
