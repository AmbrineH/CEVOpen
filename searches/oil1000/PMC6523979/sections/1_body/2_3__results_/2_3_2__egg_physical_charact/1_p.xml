<p class="p">Excluding egg shape index and yolk index, all egg characteristics studied were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) affected by DDGS levels (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Egg weights in the 6% and 12% DDGS groups were significantly higher than those of the control and the 18% DDGS group. There was no significant change in egg mass among the groups fed 0, 6, and 12% DDGS diets. Shell thickness and shell percentage were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) increased relative to other groups when hens were fed a diet containing 6% DDGS. Hens fed a diet supplemented with 6% DDGS had the lowest (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) albumin percentage, the highest yolk percentage, and the highest yolk: albumin ratio. Increasing dietary DDGS level led to an increase (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) in Haugh units relative to the control diet, and the highest value was obtained when hens were fed an 18% DDGS diet. Supplementing the diets with 250 mg EEM/kg diet significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) reduced values of egg weight, shell thickness, yolk percentage, and yolk:albumin ratio in comparison to EEM-free diets.
