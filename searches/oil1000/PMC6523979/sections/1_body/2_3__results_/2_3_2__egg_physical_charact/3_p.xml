 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.001) effects on L*, a*, and b* color values. As the dietary DDGS level increased, yolk color density increased. Birds fed 18% DDGS diets had the highest a* and the lowest L* values of all groups. Eggs produced from hens fed diets enriched with EEM had more condensed yolk color in comparison with those fed the un-supplemented diets. The interaction effect on the b* color value was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.001). Hens fed a diet containing 6% DDGS and supplemented with 250 mg EEM/kg diet had the highest b* value (39.42) compared to the other groups.
