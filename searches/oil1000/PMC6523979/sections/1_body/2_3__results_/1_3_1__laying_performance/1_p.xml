<p class="p">No statistical differences were found among the control and the experimental groups receiving 6 or 12% DDGS regarding egg production percentage (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.001) egg production Numerically, hens fed a diet including 6% DDGS had the greatest egg production. Neither EEM supplementation nor the combination of DDGS and EEM had a statistical effect on egg production percentage. For daily feed intake, hens fed the intermediate levels of DDGS (6 and 12%) consumed more feed (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.0001), consuming 116.54 and 113.59 g/day, respectively, than those fed the control or 18% DDGS diets. However, the lowest (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) value of daily feed intake was found with 18% DDGS diet. Supplementing the diet with 250 mg EEM/kg diet was found to reduce (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) the daily feed intake. Moreover, highly significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) effects were recorded as a result of the interaction between DDGS and EEM. The highest value of daily feed intake was detected with the combination of 6% DDGS and 0 mg EEM, while the lowest was found in the group fed 12% DDGS with 250 mg EEM.
