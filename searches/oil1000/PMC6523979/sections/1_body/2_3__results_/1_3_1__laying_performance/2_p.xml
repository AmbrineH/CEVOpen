<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the graded inclusion rates of DDGS in layer diets produced a significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) effect on feed conversion ratio (FCR). It is worth noting that the best FCR (1.62) was found in the control, while the worst (1.93) was found in the 18% DDGS group. EEM supplementation did not significantly affect FCR. Although not significant, supplementation with EEM improved FCR by about 2.79% when compared with EEM-free diets. The combination effect between DDGS and EEM was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Supplementing the control diet with EEM gave the best FCR (1.60). Meanwhile, the interaction between 18% DDGS and 0 mg EEM resulted in the worst FCR (2.05) compared to the other combinations.
