<p class="p">All unsaturated and saturated fatty acids (as a percentage of total yolk fat) were statistically (

 <xref rid="animals-09-00150-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). With regard to unsaturated fatty acids, hens fed the control diet had the highest values of egg yolk palmitoleic and oleic acids compared to the other groups. However, linoleic, α-Linolenic, and erucic acids increased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.001) with increasing dietary DDGS levels. For saturated fatty acids, DDGS significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.001) decreased egg yolk content of myristic fatty acids, while stearic, behenic, and lignoceric fatty acids did not show a definite trend regarding DDGS concentration. EEM supplementation and the interaction effect of DDGS and EEM did not show a significant effect on egg yolk fatty acid composition (
