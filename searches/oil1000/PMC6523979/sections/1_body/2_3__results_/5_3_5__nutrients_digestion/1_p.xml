The digestion coefficients were more preferable in hens fed diets included 8 % DDGS than the control and the other experimental groups. Conversely, hens fed 18 % DDGS had statistical depression in digestibility coefficients of all studied nutrients. EEM supplementation and the interaction between DDGS and EEM had a positive impact (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) on the digestibility of ether extract and crude fibers compared with EEM free diets (
