<p class="p">Transmission electron microscopy could intuitively reflect the morphological alterations of the cell wall (CW), cell membrane (CM) and cytoplasm. The growth inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> induced with different concentrations of CEO for 2 days was found to be well correlated with morphological changes of fungi exposed to control, MFC and 2MFC of CEO. The morphological changes of untreated and treated fungal cell were shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>. In the control samples, the cells were dense appearance (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold>). Results showed that the CW was uniform and thoroughly surrounded by an intact fibrillar layer for untreated fungi. Indeed, the CM was unfolded and uniform in shape (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold>). All organelles had a normal appearance, and were clearly observed. In treated fungi, the destroyed cell structures were marked in CW and organelles (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B,C</xref>
 </bold>). The major disruption was the endomembrane system, containing the CM and membranous organelles. 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> was treated with the MFC of CEO, the CW was deformed (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>
 </bold>). The fibrillar layers gradually lost their constitutions, becoming thinner and eventually detaching from the CW (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>
 </bold>). The fibrillar layers were hardly observed when the cells were treated with CEO of 2MFC (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3C</xref>
 </bold>). The CM of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> treated with CEO lost its linear structure, becoming rough and villous with invaginations of vesicles. The CM was ruptured and detached from the cytoplasm (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B,C</xref>
 </bold>). After treatment with CEO, most organelles were indistinct and many structures were unidentifiable (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B,C</xref>
 </bold>). The intracellular organization was noticeably disrupted with uneven distribution, showing cytoplasmic condensation and absent (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B,C</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, the damage in the intracellular organization was more severe with the increasing concentration of CEO (
