<p class="p">The antifungal property of EO may be contributed to its major components. 1, 8-cineole (56%) was the major component in

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). The compositions of CEO are greatly influenced by the species, part of plant used, geographic origin, time of harvest, stage of development, age of plants and extraction method (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Twenty components in CEO extracted from bark was identified, and twenty-one components of CEO extracted from leaf was identified. The major components of bark EO are methyl cinnamate (81.87%), linalool (3.90%) and α-pinene (2.41%). The major components of leaf volatile oil are linalool (67.60%), methyl cinnamate (17.32%) and α-pinene (2.74%) (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Malsawmtluangi et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have validated that the major components of CEO are 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde (
