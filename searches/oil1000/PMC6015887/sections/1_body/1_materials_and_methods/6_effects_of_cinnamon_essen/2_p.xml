 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> was treated with the MFC of CEO as described above. PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls. Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, and washed with 15 mL of SDW. The mycelium suspension was centrifuged at 4000 Ã—
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min to obtain mycelium, and the filtrate was collected for the determination of the leakage of intracellular content by the assays of total soluble protein, total soluble sugar, and nucleic acid. The content of soluble protein was determined with bovine serum albumin (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) as standard (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dubois et al., 1956</xref>). The protein or sugar leakage was expressed as g/kg wet weight of mycelia. To determine the concentration of the released nucleic acid, 1 mL of supernatant was used to measure the absorbance at 260 nm with a UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer (Shanghai AoXi Science Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) (
