<p class="p">The inhibitory effect of CEO on mycelial growth was determined using filter paper method with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, the mycelia disks (Ø = 5 mm) of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic>, cut from the edge of 7 days actively growing cultures on PDA, were placed upside down on the center of the inner side of the plate lid with 20 mL of PDA. The sterile filter paper (Ø = 5 mm) was added with different amounts of CEO (4.5, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5, 12.0, and 13.5 μL). The filter paper containing CEO were placed on the center of the bottom of the petri dishes to obtain final concentrations of 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150, 0.175, 0.200, and 0.225 μL/mL of air (
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>). PDA plates without CEO were used as negative controls. Each plate was sealed with Parafilm
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (Top Group Co. Ltd., Chengdu, China) to prevent leakage of CEO vapor and incubated in the dark at 25°C until the growth in the control plates (without treatment) reached the edge of the plates. The plates were incubated in inverted position. Each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice. The inhibition radius around the oil disk (colony-free perimeter) was measured using a digital vernier caliper (Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan). Mycelia growth (cm) was recorded and the percentage inhibition (PI) was determined after comparison with the control (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trabelsi et al., 2016</xref>). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of CEO at which the growth of microorganism was inhibited (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rasooli and Abyaneh, 2004</xref>). The fungus treated with the MIC of CEO was sub-cultivated on treatment-free PDA at 25°C for 2 days to determine whether the inhibition was reversible. The minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) was regarded as the lowest concentration in which the growth of any fungal colony was prevented on PDA (
