<p class="p">In 1968, the egg industry had to face American Heart Association recommendations that encouraged people to consume less than three whole eggs per week claiming that high dietary cholesterol equals high blood cholesterol and consequently higher cardiovascular disease risks. These recommendations impacted, not only the egg industry, but also partly influenced people’s dietary habits depriving them from an affordable food of high nutritional interest. By 1995, there was a concerted effort to unify all the US national dietary recommendations and to support in vitro and in vivo research to rehabilitate eggs [

 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and that it is worth incorporating such product in our diet with regard to its high nutrients content and its numerous bioactivities [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Some recent researches have highlighted the beneficial role of eggs for humans, including physically active people, and several authors have demonstrated that egg cholesterol was not well absorbed [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Consequently, consuming eggs does not significantly impact blood cholesterol concentration [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In parallel, egg consumers especially 6–24 month-old infants eat lower added and total sugars relative to non-consumers [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], which is likely correlated with its satiety effect [

 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It is now well established that egg can contribute to overall health across the life span, although people suffering from metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension still need to take caution with their dietary cholesterol intake [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Another concern relates to egg allergy, which is a common infant food allergy with a prevalence estimated to be between 1.8% and 2% in children younger than five years of age. Molecules that are associated with hypersensitivity to eggs are mainly concentrated in egg white, with ovalbumin, lysozyme, ovomucoid, and ovotransferrin being the major egg allergens [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Some yolk-derived proteins have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Egg allergy usually develops within the first five years of life, with 50% of children outgrowing egg hypersensitivity by three years [

 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Fortunately, in most cases, the prevalence of egg allergy decreases with age [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] and usually, it resolves by school age.
