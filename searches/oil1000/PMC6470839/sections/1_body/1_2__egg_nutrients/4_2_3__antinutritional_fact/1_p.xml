<p class="p">As mentioned above, major proteins of egg include protease inhibitors that may delay the proper degradation of egg proteins by inhibiting digestive enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Indeed, egg white is a major source of ovostatin, ovomucoid, ovoinhibitor, and cystatin [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Moreover, some of these molecules (ovoinhibitor, ovomucoid, cystatin) possess many disulfide bonds that are likely to confer moderate resistance to denaturation by proteases and gastric juices. Some of these antinutritional factors may be partly denatured by heat [

Moreover, some vitamin-binding proteins highly concentrated in egg may also limit some vitamin accessâ€”avidin that binds vitamin B12 (biotin) exhibits the highest known affinity in nature between a ligand and a protein [
