<p class="p">Egg does not contain any fibers and its content in carbohydrates is low (0.7%). Egg carbohydrates are distributed between egg yolk and egg white (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00684-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Glucose is the dominant free sugar in the egg (about 0.37 g per 100 g of whole egg) and is essentially present in egg white (0.34 g per 100 g of egg white versus 0.18 g per 100 g of egg yolk) [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Trace amounts of fructose, lactose, maltose, and galactose have been detected in raw egg white and raw egg yolk [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Carbohydrates are also highly represented in egg proteins, knowing that many of them are glycoproteins undergoing post-translational glycosylations prior to secretion by reproductive tissues of the hen to form yolk, membranes, and egg white.
