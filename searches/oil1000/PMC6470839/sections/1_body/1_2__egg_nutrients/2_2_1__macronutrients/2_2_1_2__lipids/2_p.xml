<p class="p">Lipids are part of yolk lipoproteins whose structure consists of a core of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and cholesterol in which apoproteins are embedded [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It is very difficult to change total lipid content in egg. An increase of fat in egg essentially depends on the increase of yolk-to-egg-white ratio, which is, however, poorly affected by hen’s nutrition. In contrast, fatty acid profile strongly depends on hen’s diet (See 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-nutrients-11-00684" class="xref">Section 4.2</xref>). This variability is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00684-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> by minimal and maximal values of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated). Noticeably, the relative amount of unsaturated (monounsaturated + polyunsaturated) to saturated fatty acids in yolk (5.31 g versus 2.64 g per 100g of whole egg, 
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00684-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) is particularly high compared to other animal-derived food sources. Yolk is also a rich source of essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid (FA 18:2 9c,12c (n-6)). The high content of cholesterol in eggs (400 mg per 100 g of whole egg) has contributed to the decline of egg intake 30 to 40 years ago, although many studies conducted in the 1990s have reported an absence of correlation between egg intake and high level of plasmatic cholesterol [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It is now assumed that variation in plasmatic cholesterol and associated cardiovascular disease risk results from food factors but also saturated fatty acids intake (such as dietary myristic (14:0) and palmitic (16:0) acids). Old studies performed in vivo on monkeys and gerbils have shown that dietary 14:0 (myristic acid) and 18:2 (linoleic acid) are the main fatty acids modulating plasma cholesterol—14:0 was the main saturated fatty acid raising plasma cholesterol and 18:2 was the only fatty acid that consistently lowered it [

 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In egg, 14:0 (myristic acid, 0.024 g per 100 g whole egg) is much less concentrated compared to unsaturated fatty acids 18:2 (linoleic acid, 1.38 g per 100g whole egg). These data all concur to corroborate that egg is not associated with higher cardiovascular disease incidence in healthy patients. However, egg intake has to be controlled in hyper-responders to dietary cholesterol (about 15% to 25% of the population), as an increase in egg consumption in these people affects plasma lipids to a greater extent than in hypo-responders.
