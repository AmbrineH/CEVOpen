<p class="p">Egg-laying performance also depends on general hen’s health as diseases and infections can induce loss of appetite and physiological failure thereby affecting animal growth, egg laying, and egg quality (eggshell deformation, eggshell defects, egg-white thinning, etc.). The most commonly found microbes in laying hens that affect hygienic egg quality are Salmonella enterica Enteritidis, mycoplasma, infectious bronchitis virus, and avian influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. Another major issue for hen welfare and egg quality is the poultry red mite that is found in most rearing systems for laying hens, regardless of the system type [
 <xref rid="B161-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. As a blood-feeder, this mite has dramatic effects on fowl host welfare including distress, anemia, reduced egg production, and reduced egg quality [
 <xref rid="B162-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. The prevalence of red mites is expected to increase, as a result of recent hen husbandry legislation changes (in favor of non-cage systems), increased acaricide resistance, climate warming, and the absence of efficient and sustainable solutions to control infestations [
 <xref rid="B163-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>]. It is also a major concern for public health as it may be a vector for food-borne pathogens including Salmonella species [
 <xref rid="B164-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>]. Amongst all these microbes, Salmonella enterica Enteritidis is the most critical for egg consumers as this pathogen can survive in egg white [
 <xref rid="B165-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>], even after several weeks of storage at 4 °C and 25 °C [
 <xref rid="B166-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>] and be responsible for food-borne diseases. It remains the dominant pathogen associated with egg consumption [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]; but, considerable efforts have been made by authorities to control Salmonella Enteritidis dissemination throughout the egg production chain. Reported salmonellosis case numbers continued to decrease thanks to the implementation of successful Salmonella control programs in poultry production [
 <xref rid="B168-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">168</xref>], including Salmonella detection and monitoring [
 <xref rid="B169-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>], the establishment of pre-harvest measures [
 <xref rid="B170-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>], management and sanitation measures [
 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>], and egg decontamination by washing under certain conditions [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. It is noteworthy that European legislation does not allow egg washing in Europe (Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008), “because of the potential damage to the physical barriers, such as the cuticle, may favor trans-shell contamination with bacteria and moisture loss and thereby increase the risk to consumers, particularly if subsequent drying and storage conditions are not optimal”.
