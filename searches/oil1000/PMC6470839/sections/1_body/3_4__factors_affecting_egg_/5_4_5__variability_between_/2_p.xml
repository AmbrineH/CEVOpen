 <xref rid="B190-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>], they possess some significant differences in terms of energy that are mostly explained by the change in relative proportion of yolk to egg white (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00684-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The energy (kcal/100g) for chicken, quail, duck, goose, and turkey eggs is 143, 158, 185, 185, 171, respectively. While the relative amount of proteins remains stable between species (about 13%), the lipid proportion varies from 9.5% (chicken) to more than 13% (duck, goose) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00684-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, which explains most of the variation in their respective energy value. Yolks from duck and goose species have relatively higher fat content and higher percentage of yolk compared to chicken egg [
 <xref rid="B189-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>]. In parallel, the lipid profile of egg yolk exhibits some specificities depending on species [

 <xref rid="B193-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">193</xref>]. Overall, the composition of duck egg resembles that of goose egg, which is consistent with their phylogenetic proximity.
