<p class="p">There is increasing evidence that egg is not solely a basic food of high nutritional value but that it also contains many bioactive compounds (lipids, vitamins, proteins, and derived hydrolytic peptides) [

In vitro analyses performed on purified proteins have revealed a great potential in egg proteins as they exhibit a diversity of biological activities. Various tools combining physicochemical, analytical, and in silico approaches [

 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] can be used to identify hydrolytic peptides with potential bioactivities. It is remarkable that a lot of egg proteins have no identified physiological function described yet, besides providing essential amino-acids for the embryo but also for egg-eating species including humans. In addition to egg proteins displaying a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities that could contribute to intestine health, many efforts have been made in the last decades to further characterize biological activities of egg-derived hydrolytic peptides that may naturally occur during the digestive process [

 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Interestingly, some of these bioactive peptides are specifically generated after limited proteolysis of denatured egg proteins [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], after boiling. Most of these studies were performed in vitro, but this finding opens many fields of research. To date, little is known on how egg proteins resist acidic pH of the stomach, digestive proteases, and intestinal microbiote, and how the presence of egg protease inhibitors in the diet can interfere with the degradation of egg proteins by digestive proteases. The kinetics of protein digestion is sequential, starting with the hydrolysis of proteins into peptides until complete degradation into dipeptides and, finally, free amino acids. But it is known that some egg proteins (ovalbumin, ovomucoid) are only partly digested [

 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] suggesting that some bioactive peptides may be generated naturally without undergoing complete degradation into amino acids.
