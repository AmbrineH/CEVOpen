<p id="Par28" class="p">The data on the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Menta spicata</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) essential oil cultivated in the Algerian Saharan Atlas has been reported for the first time. Previous studies have shown that monoterpenes, including carvone, limonene, and 1,8-cineole, to be the main components of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Similar chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> essential oil from Bejaia location in Algeria was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Interestingly, the essential oil under investigation in this study appears to be richer with some key constituents such as 1,8-cineole and oxygenated monoterpenes. A review of the literature available on this topic reveals that many studies have already been published on 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oils chemical composition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>], nevertheless there are no reports on the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> from Algerian Saharan Atlas region. Noteworthy, the composition of these volatile oils varies according to the countries, or the places in the same country. These differences seem to depend on climate changes and other factors like the method and the time of extraction, which can influence essential oil composition [
