 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. In this study, the observed anticancer activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> oil might be linked to its ability to neutralize free radicals in cancer cells. Tumor cells survive by complex molecular signaling pathways. Targeting the different signaling pathways, by multiple agents, to block, retard, or reverse the tumorigenesis has been an effective strategy in cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Essential oils are among of the most beneficial plant products utilized in medicine and complementary treatment approaches. Since 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil is generally recognized as safe, and thus widely used in food additives and cosmetics, the results of this study support the use of this oil as a potential source of new active anticancer agent. In order to assess the applied value of this potential therapeutic application, further investigation into the different mechanisms of action of the multiple components of the oil should be carried out.
