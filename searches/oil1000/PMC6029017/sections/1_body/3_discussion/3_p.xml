<p id="Par30" class="p">Additionally, the results of the ABTS and FRAP assays revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil possessed reasonable antioxidant activity in the two assays. This could be attributed to the presence of high quantity of carvone in sample. In addition, it has been previously reported that compounds such as monoterpenes, and oxygenated monoterpenes may have antioxidant potential equivalent to that of a strong antioxidant [

 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> oil would reasonably rationalize its moderate antioxidant activity.
