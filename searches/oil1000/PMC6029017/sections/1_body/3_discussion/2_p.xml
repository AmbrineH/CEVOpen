<p id="Par29" class="p">In an effort to characterize the biological activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was examined in the present study. Interestingly, reports from literature on the association between the essential oil phytochemical composition and its antimicrobial activity are found to be in great consistency with the findings of the present study. In particular, oxygenated monoterpenes were evidently reported as potent antimicrobial agent in the composition of several essential oils [
