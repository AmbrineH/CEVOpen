<p id="Par10" class="p">Essential oil was extracted from the dried aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> by hydro-distillation using an apparatus of Clevenger type. The extraction was carried out for 4 h to mix 200 g of plants in 1500 mL of distilled water. The extracts were dried with anhydrous sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure by rotatory evaporator to evaporate water. The pure oil was stored at − 4 °C until further analyzed. The essential oils yield is demonstrated by the oil quality (in mL) obtained for 100 g of dried material.
