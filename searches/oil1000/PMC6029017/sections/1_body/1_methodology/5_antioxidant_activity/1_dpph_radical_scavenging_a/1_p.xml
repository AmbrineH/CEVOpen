<p id="Par13" class="p">The antioxidant activity of the essential oil based on the scavenging activity of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl free radical was determined by the method described by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>].A volume of 0.1 mL of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> prepared at different concentrations was mixed with 1.9 mL of 60 μM DPPH methanol solution. The disappearance of the DPPH was measured at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. The inhibition percentage of the DPPH radical by the essential oil was estimated using the following equation: Scavenging effect (%) = [100*(A
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> -A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub>/Ac)], where Ac is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test sample) and A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub> the absorbance of the tested sample. The concentration of oil that could scavenge 50% of the DPPH radicals (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated. Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as standards for comparison.
