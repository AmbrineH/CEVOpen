 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil was measured by the ABTS cation decolorization assay as described by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] with some modifications. The ABTS radical cation (ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup>) was produced by reaction of 7 mM stock solution of ABTS with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate and allowing the mixture to stand in dark at room temperature (25 °C) for 12 h before use. The ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> solution was diluted with methanol to give an absorbance of 0.7 ± 0.01 at 734 nm.20 μL of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> prepared at different concentrations were allowed to react with 1980 μL of the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> solution and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm after 6 min. The scavenging rate and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value were calculated using the equation described for DPPH assay. Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as standards for comparison.
