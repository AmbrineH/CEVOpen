 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] with some modifications. 0.1 mL of various concentrations of essential oil in methanol was taken separately and mixed with 2 mL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). The diluted sample was then mixed with 2 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide[K
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>] and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. 2 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. 2 mL of the supernatant solution was mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 1% ferric chloride (FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value is the effective concentration at which the absorbance is 0.5 and is obtained by the equation described for DPPH assay. Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as standards for comparison.
