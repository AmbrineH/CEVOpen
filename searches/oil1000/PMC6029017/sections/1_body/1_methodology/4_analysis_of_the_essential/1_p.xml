<p id="Par12" class="p">The essential oil chemical composition assessments and the identification of the main constituents were conducted by GC and GC-MS analyses. GC/MS analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas-chromatograph equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, coating thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector. Analytical conditions were as follows: injector and transfer line temperatures 220 °C and 240 °C respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; injection of 0.2 μL (10% hexane solution); split ratio 1:30. The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of the retention times with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear retention indices relative to the series of
