 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. In brief, test samples were prepared by dissolving the essential oil in DMSO followed by further dilution with DMEM medium to reach the desired final concentration. The final DMSO concentration in the assay was kept as low as 0.1%. Test samples containing the desired concentration of the essential oil were added to the wells. After exposure period of 48 h, MTT solution was applied into each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Afterward, DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the purple formazan crystals formed. Then, absorbance was read using a micro-plate reader at 570 nm. Doxorubicin was used as the positive control and 0.1% DMSO in DMEM media as solvent control.
