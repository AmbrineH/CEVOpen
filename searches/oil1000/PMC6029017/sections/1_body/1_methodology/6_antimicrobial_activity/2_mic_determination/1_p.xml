<p id="Par17" class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, designated as the least concentration at which more than 80% of the microbial growth is inhibited, was carried out in 96 flat bottom microtiter plates (TPP, Switzerland) according to the microdilution method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Each microorganism was inoculated in each microtiter plate well at an inoculum size of 1 × 10

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>. Positive controls, Ampicillin for bacteria and Amphotericin B for fungi, and a negative control of the vehicle (DMSO), were prepared under the same experimental conditions. Bacterial testing plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, whereas Candida plates were incubated for 48 h at 33 °C, with shaking. To evaluate microbial growth, optical densities were measured at 600 nm (OD
