<p id="Par21" class="p">The essential oil was extracted by the hydrodistillation of the dried aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> from the Laghouat region (Algeria), and was analyzed by GC-MS. The yield of the oil was 1.04 mL per 100 g plant material, soluble in 80% alcohol, with a pale-yellow color and persistent aromatic-spicy odor. The refractive index, specific gravity, and acid value of the essential oil were 1.48; 0.88 and 1.30, respectively, which indicate high quality and purity of the volatile oil.
