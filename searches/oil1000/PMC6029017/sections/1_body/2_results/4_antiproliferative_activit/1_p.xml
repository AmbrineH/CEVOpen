<p id="Par27" class="p">To explore other possible biological activity of the essential oil, 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> hydrodistilled oil was further evaluated for its in vitro antiproliferative characteristics on three human cancer cell lines, including human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line, the human ductal breast epithelial tumor T47D cell line, and the human colon cancer HCT-116. Antiproliferative activities associated with

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated based on the dose-dependent curves and were 324 ± 81 μg/mL, 279 ± 52 μg/mL, and 975 ± 156 μg/mL for T47D, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Positive control Doxorubicin LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were in the range of 5–25 μg/mL. The anticancer activities that were observed on the three cancer cell lines under examination can be attributed to the significant abundance of some of the most naturally active anticancer components of the oil, such as1,8-cineole and limonene [
