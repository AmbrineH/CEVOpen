 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria.</italic> Therefore, they must be processed into a formulation capable of viable use in biological activity studies. Nanotechnology has been used to solve problems of hydrosolubility and stability for active substances. There are several nanocarriers of drugs including nanoparticles, liposomes, and nanoemulsions (NEs).
