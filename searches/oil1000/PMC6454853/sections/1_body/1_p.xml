<p class="p">Human schistosomiasis is caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma mansoni</italic> that uses molluscs of genus 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> as its intermediate host. In many cases, prevention methods like 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Oncomelania</italic> eradication using chemical pesticides are relevant to control the disease. Niclosamide (Bayluscide, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) is the only commercially available molluscicide recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for large-scale use in Schistosomiasis Control Programs.

 </xref> Therefore, the WHO encourages a search for alternative drugs in schistosomiasis control. Natural products can be seen as a promising alternative as they are plentiful in schistosomiasis-endemic countries and have a large number of different substances in their extracts, which hinders the appearance of vectors-resistance.
