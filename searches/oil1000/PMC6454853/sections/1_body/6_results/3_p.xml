 <italic class="italic">Nanoemulsion</italic> - The droplet size and PDI were used to select the HLB of the NE (
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table II</xref>). The formulation with a HLB of 9.26 (40% of Tween 20 and 60% of Span 80), showed values of droplet size as 114 ± 1 nm and a PDI of 0.1 ± 0.0, which in turn, are characteristic of a stable nanoemulsion. The selected NE exhibited a translucent and homogeneous appearance.
