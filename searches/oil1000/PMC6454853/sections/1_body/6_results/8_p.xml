 <italic class="italic">B. glabrata</italic> (Ressaca, MG), NE was tested at three concentrations 32, 47, and 78 ppm. Among juvenile molluscs with a size of 3-5 mm, 96.7% and 100% mortality was observed at the concentrations of 47 ppm (LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>/48 h) and 78 ppm (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/48 h), respectively, within 24 h. The NE could cause a higher mortality rate among adults of size 6-7 mm (100% at the concentration of 47 ppm). When it was used at a concentration of 32 ppm, the NE caused mortality in 96.7% adults from this region. Adult molluscs (between 8-10 mm) were affected to a lesser extent, exhibiting mortality of 3.3% in 24 h at the concentration of 47 ppm (
