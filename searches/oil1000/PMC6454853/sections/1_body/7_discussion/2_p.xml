<p class="p">Although the constituents of essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic> are related to relevant biological activities, they have low solubility in water, which hinders their dispersion into the environment in aquatic media. Thus, delivery in aqueous carriers as nanoemulsions (NEs) is required. NEs were successfully produced using a low energy method of spontaneous emulsification. This method is simple and only uses magnetic stirring.

 </xref> The aqueous phase was dripped over the organic phase under continuous magnetic stirring for 1 h. The transition of surfactants from the oil phase to aqueous phase produces interfacial turbulence and spontaneous formation of nanometric oil droplets that are involved and stabilised by surfactants

The following criteria were used for the analysis and selection of the formulation: size &lt; 200 nm; PDI &lt; 0.25; and organoleptic characteristics: absence of phase separation and precipitation. The formulation with HLB of 9.26 (40% of Tween 20 and 60% of Span 80) showed low values of droplet size and polydispersity index, which in turn, are characteristic of a nanoemulsion system. Development of a system to provide a suitable nanoformulation with a size below 200 nm for essential oil from

NEs as delivery systems for essential oils permit interaction between the active principles and biological membranes. In general, this occurs through one of four main routes: 1-increased surface area and passive transport across the plasma membrane of cells; 2-fusion of the droplets with the cell membrane occurring specifically upon delivery of the substances at the site of action; 3-reservoir effect with sustained release of essential oil; 4-electrostatic interaction between positively charged droplets and negatively charged biological membrane favouring bioadhesion and biological effects.

Moreover, the biodegradability of the formulation is another factor that minimises residual toxicity problems of molluscicidal agents to the environment.
