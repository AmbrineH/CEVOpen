 <italic class="italic">In conclusion</italic> - This study reported the molluscicidal activity and chemical composition of essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic>, a Brazilian endemic species. This is the first report on the activity of this species in the control of molluscs that are part of infectious diseases cycles, more specifically against 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> that are involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis. Thus, this result suggests the use of nanoemulsified essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic> as a promising alternative for 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> control, as this plant species is endemic to a country affected by schistosomiasis.
