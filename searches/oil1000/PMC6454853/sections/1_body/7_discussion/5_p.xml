<p class="p">NE also acts on oviposition with an inhibitory effect at the concentrations of 47 ppm and 78 ppm. All eggs, from more recent oviposition (two days), presented 100% mortality in 24 h. In eggs from older oviposition (five days), 100% inhibition of development was observed only in a period of 48 h, although inhibition was also observed at 24 h, at varying degrees. These results suggest a higher resistance to oil compounds by the more developed eggs of
