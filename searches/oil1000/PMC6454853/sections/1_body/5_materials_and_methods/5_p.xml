 <italic class="italic">Nanoemulsion characterisation</italic> - Droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI) of the nanoemulsions were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (Zetasizer ZS, Malvern, UK). Droplet measurements were performed in triplicate and average droplet size was expressed as the mean diameter Â± standard deviation.
