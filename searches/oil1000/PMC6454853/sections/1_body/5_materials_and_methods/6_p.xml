 <italic class="italic">Molluscicidal assays</italic> - Nanoemulsion of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic> (100 ppm) was diluted to three different concentrations (80 ppm, 60 ppm, and 40 ppm) in distilled water. For the assay, 10 adult snails of 
 <italic class="italic">B. glabrata</italic> species (measuring 10-12 mm diameter, from Sumidouro, RJ, Brazil) were exposed to 2 mL of the nanoemulsion, in a 24-well plate for 48 h at room temperature, according to the bioassay adapted from WHO, 1983

 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> infection were kept in breeding grounds at the Laboratory for Analysis and Promotion of Environmental Health (LAPSA/IOC). Snail mortality was recorded over the following 48 h, and was compared with the nanoformulation control (formulation without oil at 100 ppm), positive control [Bayluscide WP 70Â® (Niclosamide) at 1 ppm], and negative control (distilled water). Absence of snail retraction into their shells after stimulation of the cephalopodal mass and/or release of haemolymph were the criteria of death. These assays were performed in triplicate.
