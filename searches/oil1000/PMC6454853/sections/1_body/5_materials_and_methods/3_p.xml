 <italic class="italic">Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis</italic> - The essential oil recovered was analysed using a GCMS-QP5000 (Shimadzu) gas chromatograph, equipped with a mass spectrometer using electron ionisation. Gas chromatographic (GC) conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 260ºC; flame ionisation detection (FID) temperature, 290ºC; carrier gas, Helium; flow rate, 1 mL/min; and split injection with split ratio 1:40. The oven temperature was initially 60ºC and was increased to 290ºC at a rate of 3ºC/min. One microliter of each sample, dissolved in dichloromethane (1:100 mg/μL), was injected into a DB-5 column (0.25 mm I.D, 30 m in length, and 0.25 μm film thickness). Mass spectrometry (MS) electron ionisation was at 70 eV and scan rate was 1 scan/s. Retention indices (RI) were calculated by extrapolating the retention times of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C

 </xref> The MS fragmentation pattern of compounds was also compared with NIST mass spectra libraries. Quantitative analysis of the chemical constituents was performed by flame ionisation gas chromatography (CG/FID), under the same conditions as GC/MS analysis. Percentages of these compounds were obtained by FID peak area normalisation method.
