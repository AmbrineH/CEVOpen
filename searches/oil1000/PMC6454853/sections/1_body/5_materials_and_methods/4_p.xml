 </xref> Emulsions comprised 5% (w/w) of 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic> oil, 5% (w/w) of surfactants, and 90% (w/w) water. Tween 20 and Span 80 were used as surfactants to prepare the nanoemulsions. Various emulsions with HLB values ranging from 4.3 to 16.7 were prepared by mixing the surfactants in different proportions. For preparation of nanoemulsions, oily phase constituted by 
 <italic class="italic">X. ochrantha</italic> oil and surfactants was homogenised by magnetic stirring (400 rpm) for 30 min at room temperature. After this, the aqueous phase (distilled water) was added to the oily phase under the same continuous magnetic stirring (400 rpm) for 1 h. The formulations were analysed to verify their stability by analysis of droplet size and polydispersity index values. The formulation with the lowest values of droplet size and polydispersity index indicated the adequate oil HLB.
