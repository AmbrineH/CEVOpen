<p class="p">Complementary assessments of mortality and inhibition of posture development were performed with 
 <italic class="italic">B. straminea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. tenagophila</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. glabrata</italic> from other locations (Ressaca, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). For each analysis of mortality, according to a previous protocol, 2 mL of the DL

 <sub class="sub">90</sub> sample concentrations obtained in the previous analysis with 
 <italic class="italic">B. glabrata</italic> were used, and the groups of molluscs were divided into 10 individuals, and were separated according to size (3-5 mm, 4-6 mm, and 8-10 mm). Analysis of postures viability of 
 <italic class="italic">B. glabrata</italic> (Ressaca, MG) was performed by treating them (two and five days old) with 2 mL of DL
