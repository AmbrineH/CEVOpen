<p class="p">To demonstrate the effect of essential oils and their constituents on short-term exposures, dose–response kinetics was undertaken. In the present study, cases of instantaneous death were observed within 20 min of exposure. The essential oil of anise can eliminate 100% of larvae in 120 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL, while LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> is 5 µg/mL; on the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole, which is the major component of anise essential oil, does not remove 100% of the larvae even at concentrations higher than its LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (

Similarly, the Mexican oregano essential oil can eliminate 100% of the larvae in 20 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL. Similar results were obtained with carvacrol, one of its major components; however, thymol, another essential oil constituent, only eliminates 36% of larvae in 120 min (
