 <xref rid="fsn3668-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the SF and TPA of chorizo at 1 and 7 d of storage. Shear force was influenced statistically (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) by time, with SF for T2 being higher at d 7 than at d 1. Hardness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness were affected by interaction between treatments and days (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05), while adhesiveness and cohesiveness were influenced by storage days (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) only. At d 1, hardness was different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) between chorizos treatment with T1 &gt; T2; however, at d 7, the treatments were similar (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05), although T2 hardness was numerically higher than T1. Similar results by time occurred with springiness, gumminess, and chewiness when 0.1% OEO (T2) was used in the chorizo formulation.
