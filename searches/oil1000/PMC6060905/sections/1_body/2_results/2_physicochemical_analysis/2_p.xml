<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the pH and color parameters of pork chorizo at 1 and 7 d. The pH, redness (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>*), yellowness (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*), saturation index (Chroma), and browning index (BI) were affected statistically (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) by the treatments and days of storage. At d 1, the pH was lower in T2 than in T1, however, was not different at d 7. Measurements of 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* were different statistically (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) at d 7 with 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* for T2 being higher than in T1, as well as higher than T1 and T2 at d 1. Values for 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*, Chroma, and BI were also higher at d 7 for T2 compared to T1. 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>*, Hue angle, and ∆
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> were not influenced statistically (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05) by treatments at each time and within treatments on different days. These results could indicate that 0.1% MOO can improve the chorizo color, because color variables presented high values in T2.
