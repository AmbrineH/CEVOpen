<p class="p">Pork meat is an important component in the human diet and is a major commodity in the meat industry for the manufacture of sausage, ham, and chorizo. Chorizo is a raw sausage composed of beef, pork meat and fat, additives, and spices that give it its characteristic flavor (Porcella et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Chorizo preparation is still basically a family art employing techniques requiring rudimentary utensils and natural casings. The sausages are hand‐kneaded and stuffed without any aseptic measures being taken (González &amp; Díez, 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In Mexico, chorizo is commonly manufactured from pork meat and is classified as a fresh sausage product and comes in a variety of formulations and manufacture. This Mexican product has a pork meat content of 70%–80% and back fat content of 15%–20%. The color of Mexican chorizo is characteristically red and is seasoned with spices, salt, oregano powder, and vinegar.
