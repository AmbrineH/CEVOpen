 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) found no differences for color, aroma, rancidness, taste, and overall acceptability in dry‐cured sausages with natural extracts. Furthermore, they showed that the addition of grape seed extract (1 g/kg) as a natural antioxidant improved the acceptability of dry‐cured sausages. This could explain the oregano odor acceptability in the treatment with Mexican oregano oil that improved this sensory property. Furthermore, the stability found with color, appearance, smoothness, and acceptability could be considered stable because T2 (MOO) was not different from T1 (control) at 7 d of storage.
