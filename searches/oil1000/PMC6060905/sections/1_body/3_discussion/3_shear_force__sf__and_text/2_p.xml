<p class="p">A possible accelerated change in the product structure over time in T1 could explain a low SF value at d 7. The TPA results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</italic> Schauer MOO can be used to conserve the chorizo texture during storage, without changes in product structure over time. Lorenzo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) found at d 7 similar values in hardness, springiness, chewiness, and gumminess when testing 1 g/kg of grape seed or chestnut extract in cured chorizo sausage, but cohesiveness was similar at d 19 to that of the control treatment. Adhesiveness and cohesiveness values were low in T2 at d 1 and 7. These results could suggest a presentation of better quality with treatment of this chorizo with MOO. Similar results in hardness were obtained by Ledesma et al. (
