<p class="p">With respect to microbial evaluation in pork chorizo in the current study, Porcella et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) found similar Enterobacteriaceae and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> counts in the control treatment when evaluating soy protein isolate treatment in chorizos. In contrast, Casquete et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) obtained higher values for aerobic mesophilic bacteria on chorizos inoculated with autochthonous starter cultures with respect to the current study with 0.1% OEO. These authors suggested that differences in the counts were due to processing and the type of product. The MOO could allow increases in the mesophilic bacteria counts during storage or decreases in pathogen bacteria numbers. In the current study, the treatments were not different for mesophilic aerobes at 7 d, but T2 (MOO) gave low values. Hence, microbial counts did not increase after seven days in T2, which could be attributed to an effect of MOO. By comparison, T1 (control group) presented high values at 7 d and was higher than those at 1 d.
