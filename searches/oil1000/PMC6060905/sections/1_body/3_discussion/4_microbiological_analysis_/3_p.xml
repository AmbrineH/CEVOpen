<p class="p">The search for alternative methods to retard oxidative processes in meat has led to research with alternative natural antioxidants (Broncano et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In the current study, MOO was used in chorizo as a natural preserver followed by an evaluation its effect in the shelf life. It is possible that the differences found in antioxidant capacity were due to antioxidant activity of the total phenolic (e.g., carvacrol and thymol) content of MOO (García‐Iñiguez de Ciriano et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Also, Broncano et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) found higher antioxidant capacity values when using isolated and identified antioxidant compounds with chorizos stored in the ripening chamber (11°C and 78% RH) for 1 month and 20 d. These contrasts could be due to the ripening process over 1 month and 20 d compared with the current study with MOO in pork chorizo stored for 7 d only. However, MOO application in the chorizo formulation could improve the antioxidant capacity; hence, the shelf life could be increased. In the current study, antioxidant capacity was not different at 7 d, but T2 presented high values.
