<p class="p">The pH result obtained at d 1 and 7 may be attributed to the MOO pH (4.49 ± 0.05), because oregano powder pH was higher (6.28 ± 0.02). Salgado et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported lower pH values in onion chorizo than those reported here, while Bozkurt and Bayram (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) obtained similar values in respect to this study with 0.1% MOO from 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</italic> Schauer. On the other hand, at d 7, Bozkurt and Bayram (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) obtained similar values for 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>*, ∆
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>, and BI, but lower values for 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* of the spicy sausage sucuk during ripening. These authors indicated that the color is the most important quality attribute of sucuk, as it influences consumer acceptability. Therefore, the results presented for 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* (significant), 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>*, Hue, and ∆CT (not significant) when MOO was used could indicate that MOO can be used to maintain the redness of pork chorizo, as well as to maintain lightness, saturation, and color change, potentially enhancing consumer preference. Finally, similar results for pH and color were obtained by Lorenzo, González‐Rodríguez, Sánchez, Amado, and Franco (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) at d 20 of storage when examining the effects of 1 g/kg of grape seed or chestnut extract in cured chorizo sausage.
