<p class="p">The pork chorizo pH was determined with a puncture electrode (Orion 3 Star Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Chorizo color values were measured with a colorimeter (CR‐400 Konica Minolta
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Tokyo, Japan). Lightness (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>*), redness (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>*), yellowness (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*), Chroma (saturation index), and Hue angle were recorded. Total color change (∆
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>) and browning index (BI) were estimated according to Ledesma et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The pH and color were measured in triplicate at four sections of the chorizo for each replicate per treatment (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 24 per treatment). The colorimeter was standardized and calibrated using a white plate.
