 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>) in triplicate on two sections at 1 and 7 d per replicate (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 per treatment per day). A total of 10 g per sample were collected aseptically, transferred to sterile polyethylene bags to which was added 90 ml of sterile phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Each sample was subjected to three 1.5‐min mixing cycles in a Stomacher (Seward Lab., London, UK). A 1‐ml portion was transferred onto a nutrient agar plate (gelatin peptone [5.0 g/L], meat extract [3.0 g/L], and agar [15.0 g/L]) (Becton Dickenson de México S.A. de C.V., Mexico State, Mexico). Inoculated plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 hr, and aerobic mesophilic bacteria colony counts were determined.
