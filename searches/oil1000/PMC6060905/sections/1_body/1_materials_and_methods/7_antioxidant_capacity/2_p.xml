<p class="p">Antioxidants have been widely used for preservation of foods and feed (Silva‐Vazquez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and their effects are principally measured with antioxidant assays containing the radical 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) or 2,2′‐azino‐bis (3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) (ABTS), principally. The DPPH activity was determined according to method of Mielnik, Aaby, and Skrede (

Fifty microliters of each diluted chorizo sample was added to 1 ml of DPPH in ethanol solution (25 mg/L). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 20 min in darkness. Sample optical densities were measured in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV‐VIS 1800, Kyoto, Japan) at 517 nm. All samples were measured at d 7 of storage in triplicate on two sections for each treatment (
