<p class="p">Each treatment was formulated in two replicates of 2.0 kg each. The formulation was established according to González and Díez (
 <xref rid="fsn3668-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), with some variation. The formulation (w/w) consisted of 75.0% lean pork meat, 18.0% pork back fat, 2.2% guajillo chili pepper powder, 0.1% paprika powder, 0.1% Mexican oregano powder, 0.5% garlic powder, 1.7% NaCl, and 2.4% acetic acid (white vinegar; Clemente Jacques, Sabormex S.A. de C.V., Mexico City, Mexico). The meat and pork back fat, maintained at 4.0°C, were ground through a 3/8‐in (9.5‐mm) grind plate using a TORREY
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> grinder (Model MV‐22R‐SS; Grupo Torrey, S.A. de C.V., Nuevo Leon, Mexico). Next, powder ingredients were added and mixed manually for 8 min into the ground meat. For the treatment T2 preparation, MOO was added in place of the MOP. White vinegar was added and mixed manually for 5 min into the meat and until a homogeneous chorizo batter was obtained. The chorizo batter was placed in a TORREY
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> mixer (Model MV‐25; Grupo Torrey, S.A. de C.V., Nuevo Leon, Mexico) for 25 min. Finally, the chorizo batter was encased in 3.0‐cm‐diameter cellulose synthetic casing and 15‐cm individual links were prepared from each treatment replicate. The chorizo links were stored at 4.0°C for evaluation at 1 and 7 d.
