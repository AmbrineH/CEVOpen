<p class="p">The SF and TPA of the chorizo were determined at 4°C with a TA.XT Plus texturometer (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK) in eight sections per replicate of chorizo (two replicates per treatment; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 16 per treatment). The SF was performed using a Warner–Bratzler shear blade with a triangular slot cutting edge. Ten cylindrical segments (3.0 cm diameter × 4.5 cm long) were used to evaluate the SF. The test conditions used in the instrument were a velocity of 2 mm/s pretest, 2 mm/s during the test, 10 mm/s post‐test, and a distance of 40 mm. The SF value was taken from the maximum point of the curve obtained from the test.
