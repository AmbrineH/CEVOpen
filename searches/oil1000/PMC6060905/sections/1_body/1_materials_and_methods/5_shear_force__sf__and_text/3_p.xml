<p class="p">The TPA was determined in eight standardized cylinders per replicate (3.0 cm diameter × 2.5 cm high). A cylindrical piston (75 mm in diameter) was used to compress the sample during two test cycles, compressing the sample up to 60% from the original height within a time span of 5 s between cycles. Force–time curves of deformation were obtained from the conditions established in the texturometer. The velocities used were pretest 1.0 mm/s, during the test 5.0 mm/s, and post‐test 5.0 mm/s. The following parameters were obtained according to Bourne (
