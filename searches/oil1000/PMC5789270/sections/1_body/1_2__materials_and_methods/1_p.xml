<p class="p">The EOs of thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>) and savory (
 <italic class="italic">Satureja montana</italic>) used in the assays were prepared by Soave (Turin, Italy). The compositional analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a mass spectrometer GCMS-QP 2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) and a split-splitless injector. The gas chromatograph was fitted with a 30 m × 0.25 mm fused silica capillary Zebron ZB-5MSi column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with 0.25 μm film thickness. Helium carrier gas using a linear velocity of 37 cm/s with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was used. The pressure was 55 kPa and total flow was 105 mL/min. Ion electron impact spectra at 70 eV were recorded in scan mode (30–700 m/z).
