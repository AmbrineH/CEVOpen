<p class="p">The antifungal activity of EOs is determined by their chemical composition. In particular, aldehydes, phenols and ketones considerably inhibit pathogen growth. Thymol, carvacrol and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-anisaldehyde have a proven fungicidal activity and EOs rich in these components showed the highest inhibitory activity against many postharvest pathogens, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium digitatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">R. stolonifer</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. EOs of thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>) and savory (
 <italic class="italic">Satureja montana</italic>) are mainly composed of thymol and carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], which are highly effective in controlling fungal pathogens. Generally, the efficacy of EOs is investigated through direct contact with fruit, by application through spraying or dipping [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, these application methods can have undesired effects, including phytotoxicity and organoleptic modification of treated fruit. Only a few studies have reported the efficacy of EO treatments through biofumigation, focusing on phytopathological aspects [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Scientific research recently started to pay particular attention to the assessment of the antifungal activity of EO vapors [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Fumigation with thyme and savory EOs resulted in effective control of several postharvest pathogens, showing antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] The use of EOs through fumigation avoids the direct contact with the product, reducing the possibility of influencing the sensorial profile.
