<p class="p">Savory and thyme essential oil vapors demonstrated a high antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> even at low concentrations. 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> was less sensitive to EO vapors and could develop when 
 <italic class="italic">M. fructicola</italic> was inhibited. EO concentrations require a careful optimization depending on fruit cultivars. Although in in vitro tests the efficacy is directly correlated with EO concentrations, when applied on fruit EO vapors could have phytotoxic effects, which reduce treatment efficacy. EO vapors did not influence the overall quality of the fruit, but showed a positive effect in maintaining nutritional values avoiding ascorbic acid and carotenoids oxidation, preserving the quality of the final product. The application of thyme and savory essential oils represents a promising tool for reducing postharvest losses and preserving quality in peaches and nectarines.
