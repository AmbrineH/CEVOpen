<p class="p">EO fumigation was effective in controlling postharvest rots of peaches and nectarines, but the efficacy was different in the two experimental conditions. During cold storage, no rots developed either on nectarines ‘Sweet Red’ or on ‘Vista Rich’ peaches. Rot incidence on nectarines ‘Sweet Red’ and peaches ‘Vista Rich’ greatly differed during shelf life (5 days at 20 °C). After shelf life, on nectarines the rot incidence in untreated fruit was 23.3%, while most peaches (99.3%) were rotten in untreated control (
