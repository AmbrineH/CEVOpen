<p class="p">To explore the mechanism of synergism caused by select plant essential oils, we assessed the degree to which select plant essential oils inhibited various detoxification enzyme systems. Of the detoxification-enzyme systems screened, plant essential oils inhibited both cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase and glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). All of the synthetic enzyme inhibitors utilized in this study as positive controls significantly inhibited each respective enzyme system. Of the synthetic enzyme inhibitor studies, DEF, a potent inhibitor of esterase activity, was most capable of inhibiting the Î±-naphthyl esterase system. Both PBO and DEM significantly inhibited cytochrome P450 activity and glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase activity compared to the control, respectively. For this study, only the oils that caused significant synergism of various pyrethroids were screened as enzyme inhibitors. Glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase activity was most significantly inhibited by geranium, basil, and CWT. Basil, geranium, patchouli, and CWT all significantly inhibited cytochrome P450 enzyme activity compared to the control. CWT and basil oil significantly inhibited glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase and cytochrome P450 activity. CWT produced significant synergism when applied in combination with permethrin against the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> Liverpool strain and the 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> G3 strain. Therefore, CWT oil may act as a potent synergist of permethrin by inhibiting permethrin detoxification mediated by both glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase and cytochrome P450 activity. Although basil oils significantly inhibited both glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase and cytochrome P450 activity, this oil did not produce significant synergism of permethrin or deltamethrin in any of the species/strains tested in this study. The 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase activity detected in this assay may be caused by distinct cytochrome P450 isoforms that are not involved in pyrethroid metabolism. It is possible that basil oil inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes that are actively involved in 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase activity but not permethrin or deltamethrin detoxification. Similarly, basil oil may inhibit glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferases that are not actively involved in pyrethroid metabolism and excretion. Alternatively, only one of these enzyme processes may be more involved in the degradation of pyrethroids than the other. This exploration demonstrates the ability of plant essential oils to inhibit these processes compared to a vehicle control. Overall, plant essential oils significantly enhanced the efficacy of both type I and type II pyrethroids against susceptible and resistant strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes. In general, more types of plant essential oils enhanced permethrin compared to deltamethrin. Moreover, the cotoxicity factors of various oils were higher in the type I pyrethroid, permethrin, compared to deltamethrin, the type II pyerthroid. Synergism of pyrethroids by plant oils was more significant and common on the two pyrethroid-susceptible strains of both 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> compared to the corresponding pyrethroid-resistant strains for each species. This is congruent with documented and multiple mechanisms for resistance involved in both strains. Estep et al. noted that numerous cytochrome P450 enzymes were significantly upregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Puerto Rico) [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The increased detoxification capacity, coupled with the well-established 
 <italic class="italic">kdr</italic>-type resistance of this strain may limit the ability of plant oils to significantly synergize pyrethroids against this strain. Multiple resistance mechanisms in the AKRON strain may also significantly predispose the mosquito to the toxic effect of plant essential oils. Previous studies revealed the presence of a 
 <italic class="italic">kdr</italic> mutation in the AKRON strain and upregulated 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase activity [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Despite lower levels of synergism observed in these resistant strains, enhancement (i.e., greater kill than the pyrethroid applied alone) was observed for most of the plant essential oils tested. In many cases, plant oils outperformed the commercially available PBO.
