<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that plant terpenoids enhance the toxicity of other select terpenoids. Pavela demonstrated that specific combinations of terpenoids caused significantly higher mortalities than the expected mortalities produced via additivity [

 <xref rid="B40-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. These studies in concert suggest the potential of plant essential oil and terpenoid chemistries in enhancing insecticides for public-health vector control. Thangam and Kathiresan (1991) suggested that the inhibition of detoxification enzymes by natural products could account for these synergistic interactions [
 <xref rid="B41-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Our study provides additional evidence plant oils significantly inhibit detoxification enzymes. While plant essential oils may synergize synthetic insecticides via multiple mechanisms, these results highlight that observed synergism in select mixtures of plant essential oils and synthetic insecticides is produced, at least in part, by the inhibition of detoxification enzymes.
