<p class="p">Mosquito strains were chosen in this study to represent significant vector species and populations with varied levels and mechanistic underpinnings for insecticide resistance. The observed synergism caused by plant oils and their ability to significantly increase pyrethroid toxicity against both insecticide-resistant and insecticide-susceptible mosquito populations demonstrates the potential utility of these agents in insecticide formulations. Plant oils are a promising additive for deployment in concert with pyrethroids in the field, both because of the data shown here, and because of their inherently low level environmental or toxicological impact on nontarget organisms. For example, Olyset

Utilizing similar LLIN technologies with plant oils in place of PBO has potential for the successful control of resistant species of mosquito. Likewise, while PBO is not heavily used in indoor residual spray campaigns, Nikpour et al. demonstrated the potential of PBO to enhance the efficacy of deltamethrin in a field study in Iran, increasing the toxicity of deltamethrin applied to various surfaces at later time points in the study [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Plant oils may also be able to effectively synergize or enhance the toxicity of deltamethrin in these formulations, assuming they perform in a similar manner as topical applied mixtures. Plant essential oils are relatively volatile and may readily evaporate off a treated surface. As such, technologies aimed at incorporating them into indoor residual spray campaigns and bed nets would need to overcome this technical deployment hurdle to ensure that the plant oils in formulation would be persistent and bioavailable for long enough to successfully synergize formulations. Selecting less volatile plant oils and better formulations that diminish this volatility may be most appropriate for designing future insecticide formulations. Finally, space spraying with formulations of plant oils and pyrethroids may be relevant and efficacious in the control of various mosquito species. In these deployment scenarios, volatility would be less important and should not diminish the delivery of these agents to the target pests.
