<p class="p">To assess the ability of plant essential oils to enhance the efficacy of various pyrethroids against these mosquito species/strains, we utilized percentage enhancement as a metric of increased insecticidal efficacy, as did Gross et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. For the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> strains screened, plant essential oils significantly increased the toxicity of both permethrin and deltamethrin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values associated with comparisons of percentage enhancements caused by PBO or plant oils are highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-09-00132" class="xref">Supplemental Information 3</xref>. Multiple oils outperformed PBO when applied in combination with an LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> of permethrin. On the pyrethroid-susceptible Liverpool strain, geranium, cinnamon bark, cedarwood Texas (CWT), patchouli, 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic>, and basil showed significantly greater enhancement than a comparable application of PBO at either the 1% or 5% levels. Enhancement was less pronounced against the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain; however, cinnamon bark, patchouli, and 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> outperformed PBO at enhancing permethrin. Indeed, PBO did not enhance permethrin activity for the Puerto Rico strain. Multiple oils also positively enhanced deltamethrin against the pyrethroid-susceptible strain (Liverpool), but none enhanced deltamethrin to a greater degree than PBO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Patchouli oil caused higher numerical enhancement compared to PBO, but this effect was not statistically significant. Some oils did not outperform PBO, but many performed as well or better than PBO at enhancing this particular pyrethroid. This was not the case for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Puerto Rico), for which deltamethrin was significantly enhanced by various plant oils, and many to a greater extent than PBO. In particular, clove leaf, 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic>, patchouli, and CWT oils enhanced deltamethrin better than PBO when applied at either level (1% or 5%). The other oils screened performed as well as PBO at both the 1% and 5% levels when applied in combination with deltamethrin against this strain.
