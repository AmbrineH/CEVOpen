<p class="p">Numerous plant essential oils also significantly synergized permethrin against both strains of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> explored in this study (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Geranium, CWM, clove bud, and CWT significantly enhanced the efficacy of permethrin against the pyrethroid-susceptible strain of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic>, G3. These plant essential oils synergized permethrin at the 1% level and not the 5% level. Although little synergism was observed at the higher 5% level, significant enhancement was observed for many oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). No plant oils synergized permethrin against the AKRON strain, but again a number of oils significantly enhanced its efficacy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Deltamethrin was synergized by geranium oil at the 1% and 5% level in the G3 strain. For the AKRON strain, multiple plant oils synergized deltamethrin at the 1% and 5% level. Geranium oil synergized this pyrethroid but only at the 5% level against 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (G3). 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> and clove leaf oils also strongly synergized this pyrethroid against the AKRON strain at the 1% level. This synergism was only observed at this concentration. The lack of observed synergism at the 5% level may be due to high percentage mortality caused by these plant essential oils at this level. As was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti,</italic> different plant oils synergized deltamethrin than those that synergized permethrin. If the combined percentage mortality caused by each component is too high, the ability to assess synergism is diminished.
