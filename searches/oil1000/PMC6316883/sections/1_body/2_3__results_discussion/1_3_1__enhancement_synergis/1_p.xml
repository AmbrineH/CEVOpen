<p class="p">This study revealed the bioactivity of several plant essential oils to enhance various pyrethroids against both pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae.</italic> In order to quantify the resistance of each strain to the insecticides used in this study, we compared the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for both permethrin and deltamethrin of the pyrethroid-susceptible strains to the pyrethroid-resistant strains (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The AKRON strain of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> was resistant to both permethrin and deltamethrin compared to the insecticide-susceptible G3 strain. The resistance ratio of approximately 28.4 to deltamethrin was much larger than the resistance ratio of 6 for permethrin in this strain (Akron), indicating greater fold resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin than permethrin. These values are similar to the values reported in the literature, with slightly different resistance ratios as compared to those reported in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. These differences might be attributed to different rearing conditions and differences in the subpopulations reared from the parent colony obtained from the CDC. The 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> Puerto Rico strain showed significant resistance to pyrethroids; a 29-fold difference in the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was observed compared to the susceptible Liverpool strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti.</italic> A lower resistance ratio of 1.8 was observed for deltamethrin. To test if resistance to pyrethroids had been lost in our colony, both Liverpool and Puerto Rico strains were challenged with natural pyrethrum extract. We observed significant resistance to pyrethrum (RR = 4.8) was still present in the Puerto Rico strain. As such, the relatively low resistance ratio to deltamethrin might be attributed to relative tolerance to this pyrethroid in the Liverpool strain. Although the Liverpool strain is not reported to be insecticide-resistant to our knowledge, nor was it continually pressured with insecticide in this study, differences might exist due to differing rearing conditions and other factors that could affect the vigor or tolerance of the mosquito strain. The LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value calculated for deltamethrin in the Puerto Rico strain is within the same order of magnitude to another reported value in the literature [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In fact, the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value is higher in our report, indicating a significant resistance to deltamethrin in the Puerto Rico strain. More detailed analyses of the doseâ€“response curves for each insecticide on each strain used in this study can be found in
