<p class="p">Upregulated cytochrome P450 enzymes in various resistant populations of mosquitoes highlight the diverse enzyme isoforms, which may be involved in the metabolism of distinct pyrethroids from mosquitoes (4, 29, 36, 41). These different strains may also predominantly rely on distinct detoxification enzyme isoforms for clearance of the same pyrethroid. This may allow for the differential efficacy of plant oils as synergists on various strains. For deltamethrin, a similar pattern was observed. Two plant essential oils, CWM and clove leaf, successfully synergized the effect of deltamethrin on

 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Both clove leaf and CWT oils synergized deltamethrin for the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain. This was unexpected as CWT oil did not synergize deltamethrin against the Liverpool strain. These results reveal some interesting nuances in reliance on different detoxification enzyme isoforms in the detoxification of these distinct pyrethroids.
