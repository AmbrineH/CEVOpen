<p class="p">The assessment of the knockdown response of these various strains challenged with permethrin also highlighted significant differences between strains. 
 <italic class="italic">Ae aegypti</italic> (Liverpool) were more susceptible to permethrin knockdown as compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Puerto Rico) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Puerto Rico strain mosquitoes also recovered from permethrin exposure to a greater extent than Liverpool strain mosquitoes did, with a lower percentage of knockdown and mortality compared to that of the Liverpool strain at 1 h and 24 h, respectively, after being moved out of the exposure tube chamber. These differences in knockdown and 24 h mortality may be due to the presence of a 
 <italic class="italic">kdr</italic>-type target site mutation and upregulated CYPs in the Puerto Rico strain compared to the Liverpool strain. The mutation in the target site may decrease the initial potency of permethrin in exposed mosquitoes. The difference in 24 h mortality may be due to increased metabolic clearance of the pyrethroid in the Puerto Rico strain compared to the Liverpool strain, leading to greater recovery after an initial insult with an insecticide. Little difference in the response to permethrin existed between the AKRON and G3 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). It is evident from this exploration that knockdown susceptibility between these strains was similar, highlighted by the overlap in the logarithmic response regression included in this dataset. No statistically significant differences in knockdown or mortality at 24 h after removal from the exposure tubes were noted between these strains. Although a resistance ratio of 6.0 was observed between these two strains in topical applications, this relatively low resistance ratio may not be large enough to detect statistically significant differences in this bioassay. Numerically lower levels of both 1 h knockdown and 24 h mortality were observed in the AKRON strain compared to the G3 strain; however, these differences were not significant.
