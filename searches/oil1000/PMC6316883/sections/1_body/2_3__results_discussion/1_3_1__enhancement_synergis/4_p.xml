<p class="p">The enhancement of pyrethroids by plant essential oils was also observed in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> strains. Enhancement by both PBO and plant essential oils were much higher than those for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (LVP) and (Puerto Rico) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00132-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). On average, the permethrin LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> caused approximately 11.7% mortality at 24 h post application. This may be due to the lower percentage mortality caused by the expected LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> value; lower mortality caused by the LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> on the G3 strain allowed for higher detectable enhancement. This lower-than-expected mortality observed after deltamethrin with and without plant essential oils may be due to slightly more resilient or robust mosquito cohorts screened in the dose–response studies performed earlier in this project. However, this low percentage mortality should not affect the characterization of plant-oil efficacy in enhancing this pyrethroid. In the permethrin challenges, plant-oil enhancement ranged from 1310 ± 20.5% for the 5% application of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> to 100 ± 43.3% for CWT against the susceptible strain. A similar effect was noted for deltamethrin challenges with the average percentage mortality for the LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> of deltamethrin across all experiments being 12.9% at 24 h. For the permethrin exposures to both strains, numerous oils outperformed PBO.
