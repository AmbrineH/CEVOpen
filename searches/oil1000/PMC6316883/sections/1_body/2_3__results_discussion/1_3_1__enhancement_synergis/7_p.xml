<p class="p">To assess whether this enhancement was caused by synergistic interactions between the plant oils and the pyrethroids used in this study, a co-toxicity factor was calculated similar to the method outlined by Mansour et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Plant essential oils significantly synergized pyrethroids against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> strains (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="insects-09-00132-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). PBO was synergistic to the Liverpool strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> at the 1% level but not the 5% level. Of the plant essential oils screened, patchouli, CWT, geranium, clove bud, and cinnamon bark oils all synergized permethrin at the 1% application level. Many of these values were significantly higher than those observed for PBO. At the 5% level, PBO did not synergize permethrin against this strain, and it antagonized permethrin significantly. CWT, geranium, and cedarwood Moroccan (CWM) synergized to a much higher degree than PBO. Many oils also antagonized permethrin but produced positive enhancement percentages (

 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Puerto Rico), PBO significantly antagonized the efficacy of permethrin. Patchouli produced significant synergism at the 1% application level. No other oil significantly enhanced permethrin against the Puerto Rico strain. Unexpectedly, of the oils that synergized this pyrethroid in the pyrethroid-susceptible strain, only one (patchouli oil) significantly synergized this pyrethroid in both strains. This may indicate that constituents of this oil significantly inhibits detoxification enzymes required for the clearance of permethrin in both the insecticide-susceptible and insecticide-resistant strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>.
