 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic>, geranium, and patchouli, enhanced the effect of permethrin at the 1% level against the G3 strain. For the AKRON strain, most plant oils performed as well as PBO, with a few exceptions. Basil, CWT, and cinnamon bark did not enhance permethrin as well as PBO when applied at the 5% level against this strain. Deltamethrin was significantly enhanced by a number of plant essential oils to a greater extent than PBO. 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic>, geranium, patchouli, cinnamon bark, and basil all caused greater enhancement than PBO at either the 1% or 5% level against the G3 strain. Again, almost all other oils performed as well as PBO with few exceptions. High enhancement values were also observed for a majority of oils applied in combination with deltamethrin against the AKRON strain. Patchouli oil significantly enhanced the efficacy of deltamethrin to a higher level than PBO against the AKRON strain at both the 1% levels. No oil outperformed PBO at enhancing permethrin or deltamethrin at the 5% level against this strain, however.
