<p class="p">Overall, select plant oils caused percentage enhancement values that were significantly greater than PBO or equal to PBO in all combinations against both mosquitoes and all four strains. Percentage enhancement is a metric that measures the increase in toxicity of a mixture compared to the toxicant (i.e., pyrethroid) applied by itself. Percentage enhancement could be caused by inherent toxicity of the additive when applied in the mixture (i.e., PBO or plant oil). This metric was chosen to highlight the potential of plant oils to increase the insecticidal character of pyrethroids when applied in combination with select pyrethroids against multiple strains of mosquitoes. These results indicate that specific plant essential oil/pyrethroid combinations significantly enhance the efficacy of synthetic insecticides such as pyrethroids. It is likely that some of this percentage enhancement is caused by additive toxicity. A previous study highlighted that these plant essential oils are toxic to both

The toxicity of plant essential oils may lead to improved insecticidal mixtures, to which mosquitoes are less likely to become resistant. Multiple mechanisms of action in single insecticidal applications might lead to slowing the development of resistance [
