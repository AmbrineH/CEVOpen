<p class="p">To assess glutathione 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferase activity, WHO guidelines were followed again but with minor changes in the protocol. Mosquitoes were treated with DEM (10 μg/mosquito) and homogenized in 500 μL of 1× PBS. A concentration of 10.6 mM reduced glutathione was made in 2.5 mL of PBS. A 63 mM solution of chlorodinitrobenzene (CDNB) in 10 mL of methanol was also made. A volume of 125 μL of CDNB was added to 2.5 mL of the reduced glutathione to produce a solution of 3 mM CDNB and 10 mM reduced glutathione. Each well contained 40 μL of homogenate, 40 μL of PBS, and 150 μL of working solution. This was incubated for 20 min and stopped with 40 uL of a 1% Fast Blue stain solution. Absorbance was recorded at 340 nM.
