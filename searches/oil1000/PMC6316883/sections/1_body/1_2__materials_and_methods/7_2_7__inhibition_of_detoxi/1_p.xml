 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-transferases, esterases, or cytochrome P450 enzymes by selected plant essential oils was assessed using model substrate enzyme activity assays. Methods outlined by the WHO were utilized for the assessment of esterase and glutathione s-transferase activity [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Acetone was the delivery vehicle for all plant essential oil/inhibitor treatments. For each treatment, mosquitoes were topically treated with 0.2 μL of 5% enzyme inhibitor (DEM or DEF) or plant essential oil in acetone 4 h prior to the homogenization of mosquitoes for assay preparation. Mosquito homogenates were maintained on ice until aliquoted into the microplate to assess enzyme activity. A minimum of 3 biological replicates were completed for each plant essential oil or inhibitor treatment (DEF or DEM). Bradford assays were used to standardize treatments, so that differences in weight among mosquito cohorts were adequately accounted. Bradford assays were performed for 3 mosquitoes for treatment in each microplate to obtain representative protein content for each replicate. Enzyme activity was reported as the normalized percentage activity (AU/RFU) compared to an acetone control. Averages of the percentage activities for each replicate were used for statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA with a posthoc Student Newman–Keuls test (α = 0.05) were performed to assess significance between the treatment and the acetone control.
