<p class="p">Monooxygenase activity was assessed by the methods previously described for the other enzyme assays, but using the protocol outlined by Anderson and Zhu (2004) with some optimization [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In short, mosquitoes were treated with 0.2 μL of 5% PBO or plant essential oils 24 h prior to the assay of enzyme activity. Mosquitoes were again collected and homogenized similarly to the other assay systems, and enzyme homogenate was kept on ice until each assay. Ten mosquitoes from each treatment group were collected and homogenized in 5 mL of 1× PBS. Enzyme homogenates were transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and were centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min to remove large debris from the homogenate and isolate the microsomal fraction. The supernatant was used as the enzyme preparation. In each well, 40 uL of a working solution of 54 mM reduced NADPH and 52.5 mM 7-ethoxycoumarin were added to 80 μL of the enzyme homogenate for each treatment group. This plate was incubated in the dark for 45 min at 27 °C, after which it was removed from the incubator. In order to remove excess reduced NADPH (fluorescent in the same range as 7-hydroxycoumarin), 10 μL of 100 mM oxidized glutathione and 1.0 U glutathione reductase were added to each well, and the plate was further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was recorded at 465 nM with an excitation wavelength of 390 nM.
