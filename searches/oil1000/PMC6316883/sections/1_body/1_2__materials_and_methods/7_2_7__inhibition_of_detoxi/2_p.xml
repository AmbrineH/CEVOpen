<p class="p">To assess α-naphthyl esterase activity, we followed the WHO guidelines with minor modifications. Mosquitoes treated with either plant essential oils or DEF (10 μg/mosquito) were homogenized in individual microcentrifuge tubes in a volume of 500 μL of 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Forty microliters of this homogenate solution was introduced into each well of the microplate, followed by the addition of 40 μL of PBS and a working 1-naphthyl acetate solution. This working solution contained 3 mM naphthyl acetate with 1% SDS by weight. The final concentration of naphthyl acetate was 1.95 mM per each assay well. Microtiter plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, after which Fast Blue Stain was used as a counterstain and to stop the reaction. Absorbance values were recorded at 490 nM. </p>
