<p class="p">Permethrin Z:E 40:60 (purity 98%) was obtained from EcoSMART Technologies, Inc., Roswell, GA, USA. Deltamethrin (purity 99.7%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., St. Louis, MO, USA. Plant essential oils were provided by EcoSMART Technologies, Inc. and originally sourced by Berjé, Inc., Carteret, NJ. S,S,S-tributyl phosophorotrithioate (DEF) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were obtained from Chem Service, West Chester, PA, USA. Plant essential oils were sourced and stored in the refrigerator (4 °C) in a dark environment to prevent breakdown. This also served to prevent batch variability, which can be a significant hurdle in the efficacy testing of plant essential oils. The major components (obtained via gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy) of all of the oils used in this study can be found in
