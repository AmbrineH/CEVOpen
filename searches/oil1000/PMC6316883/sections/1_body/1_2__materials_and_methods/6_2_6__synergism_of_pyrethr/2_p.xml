<p class="p">Observed percentage mortality was calculated for mosquitoes at 24 h post exposure, and expected mortality was calculated as the mortality caused by the pyrethroid applied alone + the mortality caused by the oil alone at each application rate (1% or 5%). Mixtures that possessed cotoxicity factors greater than 20 were defined as synergistic, and values lower than â€“20 were defined as antagonistic. Values between this range were defined as purely additive. </p>
