 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> colonies were reared according to standard laboratory procedures. Briefly, adults were placed in colony cages (47 cm × 47 cm × 47 cm) and reared at constant temperature and humidity (27 °C and 70% RH). Cotton pads moistened with 10% sucrose solution were provided to mosquitoes ad libitum. Mosquitoes were provided defibrinated sheep blood (Hemostat Laboratories, Dixon, CA, USA) to promote egg laying. Eggs were collected from colony cages shortly after laying. All strains, except for

 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> pupae were separated based on size dimorphism. 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> adult females for both strains were aspirated shortly after eclosion. This ensured that the females used for testing were virgins. Adult mosquitoes used for testing were kept in 1 pt cartons (Hihtamaki, De Soto, KS, USA) in densities of approximately 50 females per carton and provided 10% sucrose solution via moistened sucrose pads. All mosquitoes used for testing were 2–5 days old and not bloodfed.
