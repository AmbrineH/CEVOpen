Mosquitoes from each strain were then gently blown into the exposure chamber (with the treated filter paper draping the lining of the walls) for 1 h, and knockdown was recorded at various time points throughout the assay (1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min). A nonlinear logarithmic curve was used to model the time-course knockdown response of each mosquito strain over time.
