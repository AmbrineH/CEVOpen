<p class="p">Topical applications were performed to evaluate the toxicity of permethrin and deltamethrin on all four strains of mosquito in this study. For this work, we followed a modified World Health Organization (WHO) protocol [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In short, pyrethroids were dissolved in acetone at concentrations that would cause between 10% and 90% mortality. Mosquitoes were dosed with 0.2 μL of each solution, with 25 mosquitoes treated per replicate. For each insecticide, at least 5 concentrations were applied (as individual replicates) with a minimum of 3 biological cohorts. Treated mosquitoes were placed into a small deli cup (8 ounces) with a tulle placed over the top to prevent escape. Treated mosquitoes were provided with 10% sucrose solution via cotton pads, and maintained at a constant temperature of 27 °C, with a relative humidity of 80%, and a relative light:dark cycle of 16:8 h. A Probit model (PROC PROBIT, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to calculate the LD

A minimum of 750 mosquitoes were used for each insecticide treatment. A lack of overlap among the 95% confidence intervals between two insecticides illustrated a statistically dissimilar response.
