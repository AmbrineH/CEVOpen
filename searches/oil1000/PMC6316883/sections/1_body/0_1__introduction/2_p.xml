<p class="p">By promoting the continued influx of sodium ions across the membrane of neurons in insects, pyrethroids cause hyperexcitability of the insect nervous system, contributing to spastic paralysis and the eventual death of the insect [

This insecticidal class has relatively low mammalian toxicity, so it can be used in close proximity to people; indeed, it is widely used in indoor residual sprays, ultralow volume applications, insecticide-treated bed nets, spatial repellents, and insecticide-treated clothing [
