<p class="p">We reasoned that the utility of these formulations could be extended to enhance the efficacy of pyrethroids against pyrethroid-resistant mosquito strains, and ultimately could replace PBO in insecticide formulations. For this study, we aimed to characterize select plant essential oils to enhance the efficacy of pyrethroids against pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae.</italic> The goal was to assess the ability of these oils to enhance the efficacy of both type I and type II pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin, respectively) to represent the products currently in use. We obtained a 
 <italic class="italic">kdr</italic>-resistant strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Puerto Rico) and a strain of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (AKRON strain), both of which are resistant to pyrethroids [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Both of these strains possess multiple mechanisms that confer resistance to pyrehtroids, and may shed light on the potential of plant essential oils to enhance or synergize pyrethroids when applied against insecticide-resistant populations of mosquitoes. We compared the enhancement of pyrethroids in susceptible strains of mosquitoes to the enhancement of pyrethroids in insecticide-resistant strains to characterize the potential of plant oils to enhance this incredibly important class of control chemistry.
