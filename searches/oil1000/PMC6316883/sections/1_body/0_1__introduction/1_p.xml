<p class="p">Synthetic insecticides have proven immeasurably valuable in the fight against economically relevant insects and pests of public-health importance. A select few have been particularly important in mosquito-borne-disease control programs in recent decades [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]; in particular, pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, and organochlorines have been main-line defenses against mosquito-borne disease. However, resistance to these insecticides has been documented on every continent where mosquitoes are present, and will continue to challenge communities in the coming decades unless new chemistries are explored [
