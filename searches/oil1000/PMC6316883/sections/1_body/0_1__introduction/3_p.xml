<p class="p">Insecticide resistance evolves rapidly through mutations in genes that encode proteins that are targeted by insecticides or facilitate the metabolism or excretion of toxic insecticidal agents. Case in point, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in knockdown resistance (
 <italic class="italic">kdr</italic>) lead synthetic pyrethroids and DDT to have lower affinities to their molecular target, that is, voltage-gated sodium channels [

This, in turn, lowers their efficacy, and mosquitoes become less susceptible to higher amounts of insecticide used in the field. Upregulation of genes that encode detoxification enzymes can also confer resistance by enabling insect pest species to more effectively metabolize or remove xenobiotics from their cells and tissue [
