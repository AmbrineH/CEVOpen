<p class="p">To overcome insecticide resistance, insecticide synergists are commonly used to increase the bioavailability of insecticides in the insect body, allowing more insecticide to reach its molecular target. These synergists act by inhibiting various detoxification enzymes [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-09-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], thereby altering chemical metabolism or excretion. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is the most commonly used insecticide synergist on the market today. It acts by inhibiting monooxygenases that metabolize toxins. Although PBO is a valuable tool in synergizing the efficacy of select pyrethroids, its persistence in the environment and toxicity to mammals and other nontarget organisms are concerning. Numerous studies have demonstrated that PBO causes significant hepatotoxicity in mice and rats, is carcinogenic, and is teratogenic in mice exposed to threshold levels [

As such, novel insecticide development should involve formulating both new insecticidal agents and insecticide synergists.
