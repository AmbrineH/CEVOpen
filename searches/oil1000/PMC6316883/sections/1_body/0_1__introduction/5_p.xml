<p class="p">Plant essential oils are emerging as an attractive alternative to PBO to synergize select pyrethroids. Gross et al. characterized the combinatorial efficacy of permethrin and 35 plant essential oils against both

It was hypothesized that plant oils were capable of enhancing permethrin toxicity via both additive and synergistic interactions, depending on the oil in question. This effect warrants further investigation, as this study highlights the potential of plant essential oils to synergize insecticides that are fundamental elements of mosquito-borne disease control programs.
