<p class="p">Numerous plant oils significantly increased the toxicity of permethrin and deltamethrin, two pyrethroids commonly utilized for the control of mosquitoes, and were capable of synergizing pyrethroids in some combinations. This synergism was concentration-dependent and primarily observed in pyrethroid-susceptible mosquito strains challenged in this study. Further optimization of insecticidal formulations that include both plant oils and pyrethroids may lead to better technologies that actively synergize or enhance pyrethroids against a wider variety of mosquito species and strains that are relevant vectors. Moreover, future work may be considered that aims to better understand the specific constituents of plant oils that are most effective in enhancing or synergizing pyrethroids against public-health vector species. This may lead to better sourcing of plant oils in future insecticide formulations or the creation of specific formulations of pyrethroids and the most bioactive single-molecule constituents of plant oils. The need for new insecticides and insecticidal formulations should be a major focus in research programs aimed at the control of neglected tropical diseases vectored by arthropods. Here, we highlighted the potential of plant essential oils to act as both enhancers and synergists, which could replace PBO in future insecticide formulations. </p>
