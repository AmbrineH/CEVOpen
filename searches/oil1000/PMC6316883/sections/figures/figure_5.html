 <p> Inhibition of various detoxification enzyme systems via application of plant essential oils or synthetic inhibitors (diethyl maleate (DEM), S,S,S-tributyl phosophorotrithioate (DEF), or PBO). All synthetic inhibitors caused significant levels of inhibition of respective enzyme processes compared to the acetone control. Select plant essential oils also significantly inhibited specific enzyme systems. CWT, basil, and geranium oils significantly inhibited both glutathione s-transferase activity and cytochrome P450 activity. Glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450 enzyme systems were the most significantly inhibited by the plant essential oils screened in this study. </p>
