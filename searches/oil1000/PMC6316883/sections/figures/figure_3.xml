  <p class="p">Percentage enhancement caused by plant essential oils applied in combination with select pyrethroids against two 
   <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> strains. Percentage enhancement of (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) permethrin + plant essential oils against the Liverpool strain; (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) deltamethrin + plant essential oils against the Liverpool strain; (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) permethrin + plant essential oils against the Puerto Rico strain; and (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) deltamethrin + plant essential oils against the Puerto Rico strain. Asterisks denote significantly higher percentage enhancement caused by oils applied at the 5% level than PBO applied at the same concentration. Octothorpes (#) denote significantly higher percentage enhancement caused by plant oils applied at the 1% level than PBO applied at the same concentration.
