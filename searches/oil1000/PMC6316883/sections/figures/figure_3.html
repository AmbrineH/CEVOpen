 <p> Percentage enhancement caused by plant essential oils applied in combination with select pyrethroids against two Aedes aegypti strains. Percentage enhancement of ( a) permethrin + plant essential oils against the Liverpool strain; ( b) deltamethrin + plant essential oils against the Liverpool strain; ( c) permethrin + plant essential oils against the Puerto Rico strain; and ( d) deltamethrin + plant essential oils against the Puerto Rico strain. Asterisks denote significantly higher percentage enhancement caused by oils applied at the 5% level than PBO applied at the same concentration. Octothorpes (#) denote significantly higher percentage enhancement caused by plant oils applied at the 1% level than PBO applied at the same concentration. </p>
