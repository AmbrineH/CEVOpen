<p class="p">This research indicates that an optimized composition of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion using D-optimal MED is an excellent approach for topical delivery systems by combining five different variables, Tween80, CO:LO, KMO, xanthan gum, and deionized water, for droplet size as response. ANOVA analyses demonstrated the fitness of the model with

The nanoemulsion displayed good stability and homogeneity against phase separation at different temperatures during 90 days of storage. The suggested storing temperature for the nanoemulsion was 4°C–25°C which was able to maintain the nanosized droplets over time. The nanoemulsion was affected by Ostwald ripening during storage at 45°C where the droplet size became larger. Under the freeze–thaw study, the nanoemulsion with pH 6.28±0.01 served as the lowest condition for obtaining satisfactory stability. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay of the nanoemulsion showed that a less toxic formulation indicated safety and could be applied for cosmeceutical applications since the IC
