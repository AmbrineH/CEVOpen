Hydroquinone, a well-known compound that inhibits tyrosinase activity with skin bleaching effect, is one of the lightening agents that causes more skin irritation and contact dermatitis which can only be cured by topical steroids. It has been reported that a rare side effect of using hydroquinone is the development of exogenous ochronosis, sooty hyperpigmentation in the treatment area, which is difficult to cure.
