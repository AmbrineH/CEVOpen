<p class="p">Kojic acid (KA) ester, derived from KA (production of a fungal metabolite from species of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus, Acetobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic>), acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor to treat overproduction of melanin in the human skin.
 <xref rid="b3-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> As enzymatic esterification technique using fatty acid has been revealed to be the best approach to produce KA ester, the esters are also excellent in quality than the original starting material (KA) making them more advantageous in terms of cosmetic purposes.
 <xref rid="b4-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> Kim et al showed that KA ester has excellent storage stability and is less toxic as compared to KA.
 <xref rid="b5-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref> Moreover, KA derivatives proved that more activities of tyrosinase inhibition were performed rather than that of KA. Kojic monooleate (KMO), a palm-based fatty acid derivative of KA was found to have significantly superior tyrosinase inhibition activities than kojic monolaurate and kojic monopalmitate. The tyrosinase inhibition activity effect of KMO was not very different to KA at doses ranging from 62.5 to 250 Âµg/mL.
 <xref rid="b6-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> This proves that KMO can be used as an active ingredient for tyrosinase-related skin problems such as hyperpigmentation.
