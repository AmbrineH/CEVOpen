<p class="p">Nanotechnology concepts have been used in dermatology for years. The carrier system helps to load the active ingredients to the targeted area efficiently. The nanoemulsion is a carrier system which consists of oil and water stabilized by a surfactant produced by high or low or both energy emulsification. It is considered to be the most advanced nanoparticulate system for cosmeceutical uses because it involves submicron sizes ranging from 20 to 200 nm which can penetrate into deep skin cells easily.
