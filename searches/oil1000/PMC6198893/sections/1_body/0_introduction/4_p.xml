<p class="p">Therefore, a mathematical approach using D-optimal mixture experimental design (MED) is favorable for determining the optimum mixture composition and to study the relationship between variables. This systematic and scientific method not only improves the traditional method but also could develop a method for characterizing formulations and process. As reported by Borhan et al, this model has been widely implemented in industries such as food, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical sectors.
 <xref rid="b10-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref> This approach saves time and requires less energy whereby the experimental run can be reduced. There have been no studies reported on the optimization of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion using D-optimal MED yet and only some research has been reported using this mathematical approach for cosmeceutical applications. Thus, in this study, D-optimal MED was utilized for optimizing the composition of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion and to study the interaction variables (surfactant, oils, KMO, xanthan gum, and deionized water) against response (droplet size). Furthermore, the optimized nanoemulsion, which potentially can be used as a carrier for hyperpigmentation treatment, was then characterized for its physicochemical properties.
