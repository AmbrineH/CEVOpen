<p class="p">The composition of a mixture is an important aspect in D-optimal mixture design. Five factors were utilized to study the composition effect of Tween80 (A), CO:LO with a ratio of 9:1 (B), KMO (C), xanthan gum (D), and deionized water (E) on the response considered to be the droplet size. Potassium sorbate (antimicrobial agent) was kept constant at 0.7% w/w.
