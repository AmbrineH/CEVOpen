<p class="p">The nanoemulsion was prepared using both high and low energy emulsification techniques. The oils used were a mixture of CO and LO in the ratio of 9:1. CO was chosen to be used as a carrier oil to blend with LO for better enhancement of nanoemulsion. A nonionic surfactant (Tween80) was selected to acquire better solubilization and stability of the dispersion system developed. Thus, due to its suitable HLB value, it was chosen as an O/W emulsifier. The oil phase was obtained by blending KMO and CO, while in the aqueous phase Tween80 and xanthan gum were added to the deionized water. Both oil and aqueous phases were separately heated up to 30Â°C with continuous stirring using a magnetic stirrer to form a homogenous solution. Then, both phases were separately sonicated using an ultrasonic bath sonicator (Power Sonic 405, Hwashin Technology Co., Seoul, Korea) where it cavitated bubbles induced by high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid for 20 minutes. Using a high shear homogenizer (T25 digital; IKA-Werk, GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany), the oil phase was gradually added dropwise into the aqueous phase until completion for 15 minutes at 6,000 rpm. The final mixture was further homogenized for 3 hours while adding LO and 0.7% w/w of potassium sorbate dropwise using an overhead stirrer (RW20 digital; IKA-Werk) at 250 rpm.</p>
