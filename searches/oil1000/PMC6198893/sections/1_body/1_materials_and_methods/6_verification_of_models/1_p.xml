<p class="p">Verification of the final model was carried out to study the adequacy of the predicted response values in the validation set. In order to validate the model, some random formulations with different percentages of composition were considered. The actual and predicted response values as well as percentage of the residual standard error (RSE) were calculated. The final optimum composition suggested was also used to confirm the predicted optimum values from the model.</p>
