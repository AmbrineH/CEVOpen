<p class="p">The solubility of KMO (3% w/w) in five different types of oil (VCO, PKOE, SO, SSO, and CO) was investigated. To increase the solubility, LO was added to the selected oil in the ratio 1:9. The total volume was 5 mL. The mixture was vortexed (VTX-3000L Mixer Uzusio; LMS, Tokyo, Japan) for 5 minutes to reach equilibrium and then centrifuged (EBA 200; Hettich Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 4,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Phase separation was observed and recorded.</p>
