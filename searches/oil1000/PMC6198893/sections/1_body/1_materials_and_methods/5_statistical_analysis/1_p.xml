<p class="p">Optimum compositions of the nanoemulsion were selected upon the condition resulting in minimum droplet size. The goodness of fit of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and coefficient of determination (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were determined to study the significant differences among the independent variables in terms of lack-of-fit test. The best final reduced model can be achieved with probability value (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value) that is significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05).
