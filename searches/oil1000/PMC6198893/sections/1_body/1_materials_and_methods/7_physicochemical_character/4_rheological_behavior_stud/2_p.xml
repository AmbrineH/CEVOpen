<p class="p">The viscoelastic characteristics of the optimized nano-emulsion were studied using oscillatory strain sweep analysis at different strain amplitudes (1%–1,000%) at a fixed frequency (1 Hz). This study was implemented to determine the storage (G′) and loss (G″) modulus for a linear viscoelastic region (LVR).</p>
