<p class="p">Viscosity of the optimized nanoemulsion was studied by using an AR-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The measurement was carried out with 4°C/40 mm cone and plate geometries (gap of 0.100 mm) at 25°C. The steady rheological behavior of the sample was analyzed at a controlled rate varying from 0.1 to 100 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Before measurements were taken, the sample was allowed to stand for 10 minutes after being loaded to achieve an equilibrium state. The experimental data were fitted to the power law model as in
