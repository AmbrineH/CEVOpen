<p class="p">The stability study of the optimized nanoemulsion involved the following: 1) stability under centrifugation, 2) freeze– thaw cycles tests, and 3) thermal stability under storage for 90 days (at room temperature; 25°C, 45°C, and 4°C). For stability under centrifugation, the sample was subjected to a centrifugal force for 15 minutes at 4,000 rpm. Stability of the sample was observed. In the freeze–thaw cycle test, the sample was kept in a vial and frozen in the refrigerator at 4°C for 24 hours. Then, the sample was thawed at room temperature for another 24 hours. These steps were repeated for five cycles (10 days). Phase changes of the sample were observed for each cycle. Three analyses, coalescence rate, Ostwald ripening, and freeze–thaw cycle, were performed for better interpretation of the stability of the optimized nanoemulsion.</p>
