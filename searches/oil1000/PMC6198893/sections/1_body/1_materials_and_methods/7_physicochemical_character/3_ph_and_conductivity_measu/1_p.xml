<p class="p">The pH and conductivity of the optimized nanoemulsion were determined using a Delta 320 pH meter (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and a conductometer (Mettler Toledo), respectively. Calibration with three pH standard buffer solutions (pH 4.00, 7.00, and 10.00) was performed before pH measurements were taken. The pH measurement is crucial to check the compatibility of a sample with human skin. Conductivity value determines the number of free ions in the system. High conductivity indicates that the aqueous phase is the continuous phase of the system. Therefore, the type of nanoemulsion can be investigated as either O/W or vice versa.</p>
