<p class="p">TGA/SDTA851 (Mettler Toledo) was used to determine the thermal properties of the optimized nanoemulsion. This technique is used for measuring changes in the mass of the nanoemulsion that occur in response to temperatures ranging from 50°C to 600°C. Liquid nitrogen was used as a gas carrier in the system. The sample was then loaded into the instrument in the aluminum pan and the empty pan was set as a reference.</p>
