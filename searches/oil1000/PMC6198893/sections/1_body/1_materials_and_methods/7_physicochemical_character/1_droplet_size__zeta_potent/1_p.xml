<p class="p">Dynamic light scattering method was used to measure the droplet size, stability, and size distribution of molecules in the nanoemulsions system using a droplet size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS90; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK), scattered at an angle of 173° (temperature 25°C). The required concentration of samples was obtained using dilution with deionized water to reduce multiple scattering effects before being filled into a folded capillary cell (DTS1070; Malvern Instruments). The count rate was kept between 100 and 300 kcps. The droplet size (20–200 nm) was analyzed based on the intensity weighted distribution (
