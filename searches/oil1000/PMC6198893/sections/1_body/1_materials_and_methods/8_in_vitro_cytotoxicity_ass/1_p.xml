<p class="p">Cytotoxicity activity of the optimized KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on the 3T3 cell of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Cell culture with a concentration of 2×10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/mL was performed and was plated (100 µL/well) onto 96-well plates. Diluted ranges of sample extracts were added to each well with identified concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 10, and 1 µg/mL further incubated for 72 hours. MTT solution was added at the end of incubation to the cells and incubation was then further continued for 3 hours. After solubilization of the purple formazan crystals using DMSO, the optical density of the samples was measured using an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.
