<p class="p">Vegetable oils contain many beneficial fatty acids that are widely used in cosmeceutical formulation. The therapeutic effects are well maintained when they are encapsulated in nano carrier systems.
 <xref rid="b13-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> The solubility of KMO in a mixture of selected oil:LO at a ratio of 9:1 was studied. Based on the centrifugation force test, all mixtures showed separation of layers and demonstrated precipitation at the bottom of the test tube except for VCO and CO mixtures. Both oils, VCO and CO, showed good homogeneity toward LO and the active ingredient, KMO. However, CO was chosen over VCO because it contained a higher percentage of ricinoleic acid (89%) as compared to the other carrier oil, which usually is used in the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries.

 <xref rid="b15-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref> Moreover, CO was chosen because it is more cosmeceutical desirable as oil based on having a lower comedogenicity rating than VCO. The comedogenicity rating defines how various oils and emollients are categorized based on the degree to which they are likely to clog pores which may lead to breakouts, and irritant and allergic reactions to human skin.
