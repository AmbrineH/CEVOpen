<p class="p">Cosmeceutical products with nanosizes ranging between 20 and 200 nm are more desirable as the size would be easier to carry active ingredients to penetrate through the stratum corneum of the skin. Therefore, by using nanosized molecules, the potential active ingredient may pass through the pores and hair follicles of the skin and mucosal membranes, without disrupting normal tissues.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">2</xref> show the optimization of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsions contours and three-dimensional surface graphs on droplet size using the Design Expert software (version 7.1.5). Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, increasing the surfactant concentration (Tween80) will eventually decrease the droplet size. This is because Tween80 acts as an emulsifier to lower the interfacial tension whereby the Laplace pressure,

 <xref rid="b19-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref> This behavior was similar for the concentration of oils (CO:LO) in the KMO-enriched nanoemulsion. When the concentration of oils increased, the droplet size also decreased. Tween80 and the oils mixture (CO:LO) were the vital compositions that ensured decreasing effects of droplets size of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion.
