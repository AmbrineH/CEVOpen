 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, it is obvious that increasing the xanthan gum concentration will decrease droplet sizes. Xanthan gum was used as a thickening agent in the nanoemulsion system. It would provide a gel network in the continuous phase and would form a network that keeps the water molecules from easily sliding from each other. Thus, this would provide a thicker structure and viscosity to the nanoemulsion.
 <xref rid="b20-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref> The more the xanthan gum concentration along with higher amount of deionized water, the more viscous the aqueous phase. Despite that, a low amount of deionized water with a higher concentration of xanthan gum would give rise to a more viscous nanoemulsion making it difficult to homogenize with other compositions. Larger droplet sizes occur when the viscosity in the system increases due to the efficiency of decreased particle disruption. The same observation has been described earlier by Krstonošić et al and Rodd et al in the use of xanthan gum as an emulsifier.

 <xref rid="b22-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> Decreasing the active ingredient content and increasing the surfactant concentrations seem to ensure smaller droplet sizes of the nanoemulsion. However, at a certain point, decreasing and increasing the active ingredient and surfactant, respectively, show an increase in droplet size. The surfactant and oil mixture reaches the overlap concentration where the molecules begin to physically interact each other. Thus, after that overlap concentration, flocculation occurs and promotes larger droplet size.
