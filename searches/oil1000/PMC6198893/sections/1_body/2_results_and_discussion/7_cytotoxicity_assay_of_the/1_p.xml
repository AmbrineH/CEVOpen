<p class="p">The toxicity test was implemented to test the safety assessment of the final formulations. Toxicity between the optimized KMO formulation and KMO oil was tested on the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (3T3). Concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of the samples was examined by MTT colorimetric assay to determine the cellular response of the 3T3 cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> shows IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (50% inhibition of cell viability) between the KMO formulation and KMO oil. The MTT assay indicated that the cell viability decreased by increasing concentrations of samples to &gt;50% at the highest concentration of 100 µg/mL. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of both the KMO formulation and KMO oil was &gt;100 µg/mL. Moreover, cell survival on KMO formulation was found to be higher compared to KMO oil. This suggested that the KMO formulation was safe and could be used for cosmeceutical applications since the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of the formulation did not reach the highest concentration tested as an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value &gt;30 µg/mL was considered less toxic.
