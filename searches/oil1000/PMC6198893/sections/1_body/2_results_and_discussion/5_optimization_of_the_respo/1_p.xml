<p class="p">The optimized formulation was developed based on the maximum amount of KMO resulting in the minimum droplet size of the nanoemulsion (
 <xref rid="t6-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Based on the D-optimal MED, an optimized formulation with the composition of KMO (10.00% w/w), Tween80 (3.19% w/w), CO:LO (3.74% w/w), xanthan gum (0.70% w/w), and deionized water (81.68% w/w) was suggested wherein the nanoemulsion would have a droplet size of 110.01Â±0.14 nm. 
 <xref rid="t7-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> shows the response values of the optimized KMO formulation. The desirability of the optimum KMO formulation was 1.00. This showed that the quality of the formulation was agreeable and excellent. However, it was reported that when the value was 0.63, the formulation quality would be considered insufficient.
