<p class="p">At higher temperatures, the kinetic energy and collision rate increased between the oil droplets causing coalescence of nanoemulsion droplets. Freezing the nanoemulsion would cause the aqueous phase to solidify easily. Alternate conditions of freezing and thawing interrupt the nanoemulsion system leading to an increment of droplet size.
