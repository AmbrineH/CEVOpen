 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, the KMO nanoemulsion at three different temperatures showed an increment in droplet size. However, the nanoemulsion at 25°C and 4°C was only able to maintain its nanosize (20–200 nm) range. In addition, the nanoemulsion was able to maintain homogeneity at three different temperatures up to 90 days even at a higher temperature (45°C). The capability of the nanoemulsion to withstand the temperatures might be due to the nonionic surfactant, Tween80, wherein it forms a steric barrier at the oil or water interface and prevents droplet collision.
 <xref rid="b30-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref> Stoke’s law states that the rate of creaming or sedimentation is inversely proportional to the continuous viscosity phase. The viscosity of the formulation increases with the addition of xanthan gum in the system. Xanthan gum would reduce the droplets collision and therefore reduce the coalescence effect.
