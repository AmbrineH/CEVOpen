<p class="p">Determination of the optimized formulation on the creaming or sedimentation (phase separation) rate can be examined by the centrifugation test. Hadzir et al suggested that the formulation’s shelf life can be estimated by this test.
 <xref rid="b32-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref> The optimized formulation tested displayed no phase separation after centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The properties of the formulation would be affected if phase separation occurred. Thus, this indicates good stability of the formulation. The physical stability of the KMO-enriched O/W nano-emulsion at different storage temperatures (25°C, 45°C, and 4°C) for a period of 90 days is shown in
