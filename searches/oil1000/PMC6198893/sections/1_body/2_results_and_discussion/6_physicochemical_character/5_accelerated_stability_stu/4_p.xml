<p class="p">Ostwald ripening occurs when particles of the discontinuous phase diffuse from small to larger droplet sizes through the continuous phase (water) of the nanoemulsion system.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). The droplet size of the nanoemulsion increased slowly during storage at 25째C resulting in low Ostwald ripening effect. In contrast, storage temperatures of 4째C and 45째C resulted in higher Ostwald ripening effect; thus, the droplet size became larger showing low stability of the nanoemulsion as compared to storage at the room temperature (25째C).
