<p class="p">The KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion remained in the homogenous phase (stable) even after undergoing five cycles over 10 days under the freezeâ€“thaw cycling test. However, the droplet size of the emulsion slightly increased from 110.01 to 120.67 nm, which still lies in the nanosize range. The actual color of the KMO nanoemulsion changed from white to a yellowish emulsion which may due to the emulsifier which exhibits higher interfacial tension and caused Laplace pressure, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>, and the stress to form larger droplet sizes and changes in color. Besides, the emulsifier at the interfacial layer formed a physical (steric) barrier between prooxidants and the lipid phase. Thus, in this case, the changes of size and color of the nanoemulsion impacted lipid oxidation remarkably.
