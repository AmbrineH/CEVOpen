<p class="p">TGA is one of the techniques used to distinguish thermal stability and physicochemical characteristics of KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsions by percent weight loss. The TGA thermogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>) indicates three distinct transformation regions with a mass loss observed in the system. The melting of KMO nanoemulsion first occurred at 53.34°C with a weight loss of 67.45% which may be due to the removal of the continuous phase (deionized water) in the nanoemulsion. The second stage of weight loss was observed in the temperature range of 190.01°C–336.54°C. At very high temperatures, 6.26% of the residue was left and was completely decomposed at 494.97°C. This could be because of the decomposition process of oil occurring during the combustion of organic-bound carbon in the oil. Shorter time with broader temperature ranges was needed to decompose the nanoemulsion over higher temperatures.
