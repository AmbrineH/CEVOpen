<p class="p">The behavior of the respective nanoemulsions can be determined by utilizing two rheological tests: 1) steady state and 2) oscillatory state. The KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion demonstrated a shear thinning behavior in both tests. The existence of weak attractive forces (weak elastic gel-like network) between the nanoemulsion droplets showed that the system had a shear thinning behavior.
 <xref rid="b30-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref> Shear thinning (pseudo-plastic) formulation exhibits a low viscosity fluid behavior (low resistance) to flow when tested under high shear conditions and zero flow under gravity stress. The cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries usually demand more of this type of behavior for topical formulation products.
