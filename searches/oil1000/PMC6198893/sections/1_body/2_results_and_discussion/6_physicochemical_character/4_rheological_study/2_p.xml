 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows that the optimized KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion exhibits pseudo-plastic behavior (nonlinear relationship) in the steady state test. Besides, the higher value of consistency coefficients, 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> (7.1033), of the optimized formulations indicated that a stronger nanoemulsion structure was prepared. A desirable nanoemulsion with elastic properties is more preferable for cosmeceutical application. In the oscillatory test, the KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion exhibited elastic properties as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. Based on the LVR, the optimized nanoemulsion showed a higher G′ value (storage modulus) with elastic component compared to G″ value (loss modulus) with viscous component.
 <xref rid="b30-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref> This proved that the KMO nanoemulsion exhibited an elastic behavior system. G′ and G″ were steady at low deformation with undamaged and better structured nanoemulsion. Hence, the broad LVR allowed the optimized KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion to acquired good rigidity and stability toward phase separation.
