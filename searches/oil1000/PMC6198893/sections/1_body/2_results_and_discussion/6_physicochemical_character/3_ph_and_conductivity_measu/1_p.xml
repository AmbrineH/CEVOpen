<p class="p">The pH value of the optimized formulation was 6.28±0.01 showing its suitability to be used topically as stated by Martínez et al, who reported that the pH values should be in the range of 4.0–7.0.
 <xref rid="b28-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref> The KMO nanoemulsion was detected to be O/W nanoemulsions since high conductivity measurements (14,92.00±0.03 µScm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were obtained. Conductivity refers to the measurement of the free amount of water and ions in a system; this could therefore investigate the ability of the nanoemulsion to conduct electricity, which in turn would determine if the system formed is an O/W or W/O system. Studies by Korhonen et al have reported that O/W systems possess higher conductivity measurements than W/O systems because the external phase is water. In addition, an O/W nanoemulsion was more favorable in the formulation of cosmeceutical products because it is less greasy and more economical.
