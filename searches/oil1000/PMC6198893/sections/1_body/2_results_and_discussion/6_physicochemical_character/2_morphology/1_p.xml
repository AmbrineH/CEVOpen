 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-6465" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> presents the TEM image of the KMO-enriched O/W nanoemulsion. The spherical shape of the oil droplets was distributed uniformly and homogenously throughout the formulation without any aggregation in the system. Moreover, the droplet size analyzed from TEM corresponded with the size obtained from the Zetasizer analysis.
