<p class="p">Based on the optimized formulation, a droplet size of 110.01±0.14 nm with PDI 0.25±0.01 was obtained, indicating a monodisperse system. The zeta potential value of −43.60±0.23 mV demonstrated higher electrostatic repulsion which ensured that the nanoemulsion system was stable. The zeta potential measures the electrokinetic potential of a particle and determines the stability of the formulation system. The formulation is considered stable when the value is more than +25 mV and lower than −25 mV.
 <xref rid="b24-ijn-13-6465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref> PDI analyzes the size distribution and the abundant amount of light scattered can be determined from various sizes of the nanoemulsion. The PDI value of the optimized formulation indicated a fairly monodisperse system (PDI &lt;0.25).
