 <xref rid="B27-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] suggested that the chemical compositions of essential oil depend largely on its colour. Moreover, the alteration of the essential oil colour as a result of their compositions is suggested to be due to thermal degradation, oxidation, isomerisation, dehydrogenation and polymerisation [
