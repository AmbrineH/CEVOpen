<p class="p">Basils are widely distributed in tropical areas and are likely to have originated in South Asia (India). These herbaceous plants are of annual type, usually propagated through seeds [

 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> comprises of more than 65 species and is the biggest genera in Lamiaceae family worldwide [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Different basil species can be identified by morphological characterisations such as leaf shape and its colour, flower structures and its colour, seed structures and its characteristics (
 <xref rid="foods-07-00175-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, due to extensive cultivation, inter and intra-specific cross hybridisation has occurred leading to polyploidy and different numbers of species, subspecies, and varieties that are not significantly different in their appearances [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In our study, five 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. types had distinct morphological characteristics. The 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> of white and red varieties (viz., Rama and Shyama) possessed different leaf colours. 
 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. thyrsiflorum illustrated unique seed characteristic which was mucilaginous after soaking in water. 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> possessed a large leaf size about 45 cm

 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorum</italic> conferred leaf size around 3.5 cm
