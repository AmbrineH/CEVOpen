<p class="p">A study on the attribute of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. (
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> L.) by Calín-Sánchez et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] evaluated the same attributes that are herbaceous (herb), spice, woody, and sweet. These attributes were also identified in our study. This group of researchers also found that the Sweet basil (
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic>) essential oil extracted from the dried leaves, gave stronger sweet and woody attributes than the essential oil extracted from fresh leaves. In our study, the citrus attribute is a principle characteristic of essential oils from most Thai basil types analyses especially the Lemon basil as confirmed by both chemical and sensory evaluations. This is consistent with the previous research by Al-Kateb and Mottram [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] who studied the relationship between growth stages and volatile compositions of Lemon basil (
 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorum</italic> Vis.). They found that citral, linalool, and estragole are major compounds of the essential oil and they contributed to the citrusy aroma.
