The oven temperature was set at 60 °C for 3 min, and increased by 2.5 °C/min until 240 °C where it was held at this temperature for 10 min. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.1 mL /min. The interface with MS was at 200 °C and mass spectra were taken at 70 eV in electron impact ionisation mode, with a scanning speed of 0.5 scans/s from
