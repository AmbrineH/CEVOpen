<p class="p">To obtain reliable sources of material, the aerial parts of different stages were collected from five 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. types viz., 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> var. Rama (red), 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> var. Shyama (white), 
 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. thyrsiflorum, and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> (100 plants/type) at their flowering stages. Plants were grown at Mae-Hia Agricultural Training and Research Centre, Division of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Chiang Mai University in an open-area (100 Ã— 2500 cm plot with a plant spacing of 50 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and maintained by watering for 2 h, 3 times per week using drip irrigation, and fertilising (Urea (46-0-0) and NPK fertiliser (15-15-15) in the ratio 1:3) once a month until flowering. After collection, plant specimens (leaf and floral specimens) were separated and their morphological appearances were recorded prior to sending them to the Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University for taxonomic confirmation.
