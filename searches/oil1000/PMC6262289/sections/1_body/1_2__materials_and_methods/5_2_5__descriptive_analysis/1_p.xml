<p class="p">Prior to sensory testing, five semi-trained panellists with extensive experience in Thai food (two males, three females, and age ranged from 25 to 37 years old) were chosen based on their abilities to discriminate differences and ranking/rating the intensity scents. They also completed a 3-day orientation and a 12 h descriptive training course. Thereafter, they then developed attribute terms describing the odour of five essential oils on cotton balls (200 ÂµL). Panellists tasted all samples and discussed the attribute definitions, attribute references, reference intensities, and evaluation procedures. References were consistent with those of the previous studies as described in
