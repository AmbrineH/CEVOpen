<p class="p">From this research, we conclude that the major components of essential oils from the five types of basils used as food ingredients in Thailand are estragole, eugenol, and methyl eugenol. From this chemical analysis we can then distinguish 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. plants from the odour characteristics into two groups: citrus and spice-like. Sensory analysis also confirmed that citrus is the main feature in these 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. essential oils. It is also possible to sensorially separate the aromatic scent of the two Holy basil (var. red and white) essential oils by using anisic attributes. Future research could be extended to the use of the natural products from these plant species in food as additives active against food microbials and in agriculture (i.e., methyl eugenol) as bio-control agent.
