<p class="p">Essential oil, as well as any other plant based natural ingredients, have been the beneficiary of legal, regulatory, and consumer preference as the result of a shared opinion on food safety [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Recent demands are for their essential oils, not only for medicinal industries but also for food industries [

 <xref rid="B10-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Thus, it has come as no surprise that food suppliers of ethnic food ingredients quest for authentic Thai basils essential oil. However, the diversity of basil varieties, available as raw material for essential oil extraction, may lead to the confusion of basil aroma for Thai food. Varietal variations could also affect levels of volatile ingredients and profiles, thereby illustrating their distinctively sensorial aroma. Thai basils of different genotypes could be well differentiated on the basis of both essential oil compositions and sensory properties [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>, the major constituents of essential oils are also diverse. From plants grown under the same condition, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> oil consisted of linalool with other constituents being camphor and humulene which gave the sweet-subtle aroma to its essential oil, while 
 <italic class="italic">O. sanctum</italic> comprised a higher content of chavicol, eugenol, and eucalyptol [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. None the less, there is limited data on aromatic profiles particularly of descriptive sensory analysis among five basil types available in Thailand viz., white and red Holy basil, Thai basil, Lemon basil, and Tree basil. The aim of this study is therefore to describe the aromatic identities of common Thai basils by chemical and sensory analyses.
