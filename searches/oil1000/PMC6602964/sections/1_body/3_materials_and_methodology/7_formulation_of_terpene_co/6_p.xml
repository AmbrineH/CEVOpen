<p id="Par29" class="p">The effect of a combination was designated as synergistic when the calculated χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value was found greater than the table value at respective degrees of freedom at 95% confidence interval and if observed mortality was found greater than the expected mortality. Again, if the calculated χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value for any combination was greater than the table value at definite degrees of freedom but observed mortality was found lower than the expected one, then that treatment was considered as antagonistic. While if in any combination, calculated χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value found less than the table value at respective degrees of freedom then that combination was considered to have no effect.
