 </sup> was followed for adulticidal bioassay against 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>, where acetone was used as a solvent. Initially, 100 and 1000 ppm concentration of each EO were tested against adult 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>. 2 ml of each prepared solution was applied on Whatman no. 1 filter papers (size 12 × 15 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and allowed to evaporate acetone for 10 minutes. Filter paper treated with 2 ml of acetone alone was used as control. After evaporation of acetone, both the treated and the control filter paper were placed in cylindrical tubes (depth 10 cm). Ten numbers of 3–4 days old non-blood fed mosquitoes were transferred in each of the three replicas of each concentration. Based on the result of initial test, different concentrations of the selected oils were tested. Mortality was recorded at 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 5 hour, 6 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour respectively from the time of the mosquito released. LC50 value was calculated at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of exposure period. If mortality exceeded 20% in the control batch, the whole test was repeated. Again, if mortality in the controls was above 5%, results with the treated samples were corrected using Abbott’s formula
