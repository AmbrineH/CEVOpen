 </sup> was used with slight modification to investigate the larvicidal toxicity. DMSO was used as emulsifying agent. Initially 100 and 1000 ppm concentration of each EO was tested exposing 20 larvae per replication. Based on the result, a series of concentration was applied and the mortality was recorded from 1 hour to 6 hours at one-hour time interval and at 24-hour, 48 hour and 72 hours after treatment. The sub-lethal (LC50) concentration was determined after 24, 48- and 72-hour of exposure period. Each concentration was assayed in triplicate along with one negative control (water only) and one positive control (DMSO treated water). If the pupation occurred and more than 10% larvae died in the control group then the test was repeated. If mortality occurred in the control groups between 5–10% then, then Abbot’s correction formula
