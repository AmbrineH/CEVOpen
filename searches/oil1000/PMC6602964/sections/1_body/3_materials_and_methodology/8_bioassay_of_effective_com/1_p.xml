<p id="Par30" class="p">Based on the observed mortality in binary mixtures having synergistic action and the LC50 dose of each terpene compound present in the respective mixture, three to four potential synergistic combinations were selected to test for larvicidal and adulticidal activity against large number of insects (100 larvae and 50 adults) by following the method described above. Along with the mixtures, the individual compound present in the selected mixtures were also tested against same numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae and adults. The proportion of the combination was one part of LC50 dose of one candidate compound and one part of LC50 dose of another constituent compound. In adulticidal bioassay, selected compounds were dissolved in acetone solvent and applied in filter paper wrapped inside a cylindrical plastic vessel with 1300 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> volume. The acetone was evaporated for 10 minutes before releasing adult insects. Again, in case of larvicidal bioassay, LC50 doses of the candidate compounds were first dissolved in equal amount of DMSO and then mixed in 1 liter of water kept in 1300 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> plastic vessel and the larvae were released.
