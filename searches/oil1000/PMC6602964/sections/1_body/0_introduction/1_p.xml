<p id="Par2" class="p">Plant essential oils (EO) are secondary metabolites comprising different bioactive compounds and have been getting importance as alternative to synthetic insecticide. They are not only ecofriendly and user-friendly but being a mixture of different bioactive compounds, also offer less chance of resistance development
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. With the accessibility of GC-MS technique, researchers explored the constituent compounds of different plant EOs and more than 3000 compounds from 17500 aromatic plants have been identified
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> most of which were tested for their insecticidal properties and reported to have insecticidal effects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. Some of the studies highlighted equal or higher toxicity of major constituent compound than its crude EO. But application of a single compound may again leave chance for resistance development like that of chemical insecticides
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, emphasisis are now-a- days given to prepare mixtures of EO based compounds to enhance insecticidal effects as well as to reduce the probability of development of resistance by the targeted pest population. The individual active compound present in an EO may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic effects in combinations representing the overall activity of the EO and the fact is highlighted well in studies carried out by previous workers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. In vector control programme also, EOs and their constituents are incorporated. Mosquitocidal activities of EOs were extensively studied upon 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic>. Few studies also attempted to formulate effective insecticide by combining different botanicals with commercially used synthetic insecticide aiming to increase the overall toxicity as well as to minimize the side effects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>. But study of such formulated compounds against 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> is still scanty. Advancement of medical science with development of medication and vaccination help to handle some of the vector transmitted diseases. But presence of different serotypes of viruses transmitted by 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> makes vaccination programme unsuccessful. Thus, in cases of such diseases, vector control programme is the only option to prevent disease transmission. In the present context, control of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> is very much important as it is the key transmitter of different viruses and their serotypes causing dengue, zika, dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever etc. Most notably the number of cases of almost all of these 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> borne diseases has been increasing globally every year and the trend is increasing. Therefore, it is an urgent need in this situation to develop ecofriendly and effective measures to control 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> population. In this respect EOs,constituent compounds and their combinations are potential candidate. Therefore, the present study was attempted to find out effective synergistic combinations of major plant EO compounds of five plants having insecticidal property namely 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum sanctum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus maculata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Allium sativum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Callistemon linearis</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>.
