<p id="Par14" class="p">The combination between Eudesmol and Eucalyptol was found synergistic against both larval and adult stages of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> which might be due to their different mode of action because of their dissimilar chemical structures. Eudesmol, which is a sesquiterpene might target respiratory system

 </sup> while Eucalyptol, which is a monoterpene might affect acetylcholine esterase enzyme

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup>. The combined effect of constituents on two or more target sites might boost total lethal actions of the combination. In case of adulticidal bioassay, Malathion was found to show synergism with Carvone or Eudesmol or Eucalyptol or Diallylldisulfide or α-pinene reflecting it as a good synergistic adulticidal candidate for combination with the entire terpene compounds except Limonene and Diallyltrisulfide. Similar finding of synergism of Malathion with plant extracts was reported by Thangam and Kathiresan
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>
 </sup>. This synergistic response might due to the combined toxic effects of Malathion and phytochemicals on detoxifying enzymes of insect body. Organophosphate like Malathion generally exerts their effect by inhibiting esterases, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, combination of Malathion having these modes of action with terpene compounds having different mode of actions might enhance the total lethal effect against the mosquito.
