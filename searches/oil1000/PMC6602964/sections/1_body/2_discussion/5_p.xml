<p id="Par16" class="p">Considering LC50 values and observed mortalities, the two best synergistic combinations of terpene compounds viz.pair of Carvone plus Limonene and Eucalyptol plus Eudesmol and one best synergistic combination of the synthetic organophosphate Malathion with terpene compound i.e. Malathion plus Eudesmol were chosen for adulticidal bioassay to test against large insect mass to confirm whether these effective combinations would work against large number of individuals in comparatively larger exposure space. All these combinations showed synergistic response against large insect mass. Similar results were found for the best larvicidal synergistic combinations which were tested against large numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> larvae. Therefore, it can be stated that the effective synergistic larvicidal and adulticidal combinations of plant based EO compounds are competent candidate against existing synthetic chemicals and can further be used to control 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> population. Similarly, the effective combination of synthetic larvicide or adulticide with terpene compounds may further be used to reduce the dose of Temephos or Malathion to be applied against the mosquito. These synergistic combinations with potent efficacy may offer solution to check resistance evolution in 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in future.
