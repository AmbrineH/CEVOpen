<p id="Par7" class="p">Seven compounds (Diallyldisulfide, Diallyltrisulfide, Eucalyptol, α- pinene, Eudesmol, Limonene and Carvone) those were identified as major compounds of effective EOs were tested individually against adult 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>. From probit regression analysis, Eudesmol was found as the most potential with LC50 value of 1.82 ppm followed by Eucalyptol with LC50 value of 17.60 ppm at 24 h exposure time. Other five tested compounds were found to have moderate adulticidal effects with LC50 laid between 140.79 ppm to 737.01 ppm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The efficacy of the synthetic organophosphate Malathion showed lower adulticidal effects than Eudesmol and higher than other six compounds with LC50 value of 5.44 ppm at 24 h exposure period (Table
