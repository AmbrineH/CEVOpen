<p id="Par6" class="p">Total nine compounds (Diallyldisulfide, Diallyltrisulfide, Eugenol, Methyl Eugenol, Carvone, Limonene, Eucalyptol, Eudesmol, α- pinene) those were identified as major constituent compounds of the effective EOs were individually bioassayed against the larval stages of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>. The highest larvicidal potency was recorded for the compound Eudesmol with LC50 value of 2.25 ppm after 24 h exposure period. Potential larvicidal effect was also found for the compound Diallyldisulfide and Diallyltrisulfide having median sub-lethal doses ranging between 10–20 ppm. Again, moderate larvicidal activities were observed for the compound Eugenol, Limonene and Eucalyptol with LC50 value of 63.35 ppm, 139.29 ppm and 181.33 ppm at 24 h respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). However, Methyl Eugenol and Carvone were not found to have much larvicidal potential even at the highest dose applied and hence LC50 value was not calculated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The synthetic larvicide Temephos showed 0.43 ppm median lethal concentration at 24 h of exposure period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) against
