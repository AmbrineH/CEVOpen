<p id="Par8" class="p">Seven effective major compounds along with the organophosphate Temephos were selected for preparing binary combinations at their LC50 dose at 1:1 ratio. All total 28 binary combinations were prepared and tested for their larvicidal efficacy against 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>. Of them nine combinations were found synergistic, fourteen combinations as antagonistic and five combinations were found to have no larvicidal effect. Among the synergistic combinations, the combination between Diallyldisulfide and Temephos was found as the most effective with 100% observed mortality at 24 hours (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Again, mixture of Limonene with Diallyldisulfide, Eugenol with Temephos showed good potentiality with 98.3% observed larval mortality, (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Other 4 combinations i.e. Eudesmol plus Eucalyptol, Eudesmol plus Limonene, Eucalyptol plus α- pinene, α- pinene plus Temephos also showed remarkable larvicidal efficacy with more than 90% observed mortality against almost 60–75% expected mortality (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). However, combination of Limonene with α-pinene or Eucalyptol showed antagonistic response. Similarly, mixtures of Temephos with Eugenol or Eucalyptol or Eudesmol or Diallyltrisulfide were found antagonistic. Again, combination between Diallyldisulfide and Diallyltrisulfide and combination of anyone of these compounds with Eudesmol or Eugenol were antagonistic in larvicidal action. Combinations of Eudesmol with Eugenol or α-pinene were also recorded antagonistic.
