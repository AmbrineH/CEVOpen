 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>. For selection of combinations to be tested against large insect mass, at first emphasis was given on the best two synergistic combinations of terpene compounds that was combination of Carvone plus Limonene and Eucalyptol plus Eudesmol. Secondly one best synergistic combination was selected from the pair of synthetic organophosphate Malathion with terpene compound. Here we consider the combination of Malathion plus Eudesmol as the best combination to be tested against large insect mass because of its maximum observed mortality and the very low LC50 values of the constituent candidates. Malathion showed synergistic action while combined with α-pinene, Diallydisulfide, Eucalyptol, Carvone and Eudesmol. But if we look at the LC50 values, the value for Eudesmol was the lowest (2.25 ppm). The calculated LC50 values for Malathion, α-pinene, Diallydisulfide, Eucalyptol, Carvone were 5.4, 716.55, 166.02, 17.6, 140.79 ppm respectively. These values indicated that the combination between Malathion and Eudesmol as the best combination from the dose point of view. The results revealed that the combination of Carvone plus Limonene and Eudesmol plus Malathion showed 100% observed mortality against 61% to 65% expected mortalities. Another combination, Eudesmol plus Eucalyptol showed 78.66% mortality against 60% expected mortality after 24 h exposure period. All the three selected combinations showed synergistic action in combination even in large-scale applications against adults of
