<p id="Par10" class="p">Based on synergistic effects and sub- lethal doses, finally four combinations (Eudesmol plus Limonene, Eugenol plus Limonene, Diallyldisulfide plus Limonene and Diallyldisulfide plus Temephos) were selected and further tested for their larvicidal toxicity against large numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>. The results showed 100% observed larval mortalities in response to binary combinations of Eugenol–Limonene, Diallyldisulfide-Limonene, Diallyldisulfide–Temephos against 76.48%, 72.16% and 63.4% expected larval mortalities respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The combination between Limonene and Eudesmol was comparatively less effective showing 88% observed larval mortality at 24 h exposure period (Table
