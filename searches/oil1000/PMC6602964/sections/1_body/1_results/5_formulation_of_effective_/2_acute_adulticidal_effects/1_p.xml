<p id="Par9" class="p">Among all the 28 binary mixtures tested for adulticidal activity, seven combinations were found to have synergistic actions, six with no effect while other fifteen were recorded with antagonistic effect. The mixture of Eudesmol plus Eucalyptol and Limonene plus Carvone were found more effective with 76% and 100% observed mortality respectively after 24 h than other synergistic combinations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Malathion was observed to show synergistic action in combination with all the compounds excepts with Limonene and Diallyltrisulfide. On the other hand, combination between Diallyldisulfide and Diallyltrisulfide and any one of them with Eucalyptol or Eudesmol or Carvone or Limonene were found antagonistic. Similarly combination of α-pinene with Eudesmol or Limonene, Eucalyptol with Carvone or Limonene, Limonene with Eudesmol or Malathion showed antagonistic larvicidal effects. For other six combinations, the expected and observed mortalities were not found to be significantly different (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>).
