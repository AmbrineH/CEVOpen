  <p class="p">TAG comparison between winter and spring rapeseed. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of rapeseed samples (one minus Spearman correlation coefficient was used as the distance, two dimensions) demonstrating a clear segregation of winter and spring rapeseed samples. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) The difference in the TAG mass fractions between winter and spring rapeseed. Color indicates which cultivar possesses a higher amount of certain TAG. Circle size represents the absolute difference in mass fractions. Grey circles correspond to the TAGs that do not show statistically significant differences.
