 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Throughout the sunflower and rapeseed crop improvement history, seed oil content and oil quality were the traits which have drawn most attention. Triglycerides composition is one of the main directions in sunflower and rapeseed selection [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Quality of sunflower oil is usually determined by the ratio between oleic and linoleic acids. The typical fatty acid components of sunflower oil are linoleic acid (55–65%), oleic acid (20–30%), and the remaining FAs, first of all, palmitic and stearic, and the minor ones [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In rapeseed oil, oleic acid usually predominates (about 61%), linoleic acid is the second most abundant (20%), and saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic constitute less than 10%. Since rapeseed oil is widely used in both the food industry and for non-food purposes, rapeseed breeding lines with the varying fatty acid composition are of great value to the oil crop market. One of the most important goals of rapeseed breeding programs is the creation of breeding lines and varieties from which oil with low linolenic acid content (C18:3 ≤ 3%) can be extracted. Low content of polyunsaturated linolenic acid prevents oxidation and rancidification of the oil, which renders possible its use for deep frying. In addition, oil with low linolenic acid content serves as an important source of raw material for biofuel production because of its high stability [
