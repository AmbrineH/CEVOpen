<p class="p">Rapeseed varieties can be divided into two types based on the specific features of their growth and development, namely, annual (spring)-type varieties, which are seeded in the spring and complete their life cycle in a single growing season and biennial (winter)-type varieties, which are usually seeded in the autumn, pass the winter as seedlings, and then complete their development the following spring [

 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], the knowledge on which storage lipids are associated with cold tolerance in seeds can shed light on the evolution of this trait in plants and its regulating mechanisms.
