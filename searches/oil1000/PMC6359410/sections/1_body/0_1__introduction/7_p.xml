<p class="p">In the present study, we applied ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) to TAG profiling in sunflower and rapeseed. This is the first attempt to use a high-throughput technique to explore a Russian oilseed crop germplasm collection. Triglycerides composition in 50 sunflowers and 48 rapeseed lines from the VNIIMK (Pustovoit All-Russian Research Institute of Oil Crops) collection has been compared and the main differences in the TAG content between the breeding lines of these two plants have been revealed. In addition, TAG content and fatty acids saturation levels in the detected TAGs have been compared in the winter-type and spring-type rapeseed. The observed differences may give new insights into the mechanisms of
