<p class="p">Vegetable oil has been used by humans for thousands of years [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Nowadays, vegetable oils are still widely utilized by the food and chemical industry as well as acting an important source for fuel production [

 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Plants generally accumulate oil in their seeds and fruits to provide energy for germination and the early stages of seedling development. Triacylglycerols or triglycerides (TAGs) are the main component (up to 97%) of vegetable oil and play various physiological roles in plants including energy balance maintenance, lipid homeostasis, and growth and development [

 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Triglycerides are composed of three fatty acids (FAs) esterified to glycerol, where FAs determine the biochemical properties of TAGs [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Fatty acids differ by the carbon chain length and saturation level. The number of double bonds and their position determine oil heat stability and its nutritional properties, while FA chain length affects the detergent properties of the soap derived from the oil which can make vegetable oil so advantageous for special industrial needs [
