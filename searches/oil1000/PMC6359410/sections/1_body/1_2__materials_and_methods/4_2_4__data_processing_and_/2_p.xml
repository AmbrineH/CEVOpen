<p class="p">To identify peaks that correspond to triacylglycerols, all possible chemical formulas that correspond to TAGs with the total chain length varying between 30 and 85 carbon atoms (n) and with the number of double bonds varying from 0 to 12 (k) defined as C

 <sub class="sub">6</sub> were generated. Isomers were not distinguished on this step and were annotated as a single TAG species. For example, 54:6 denotes a TAG with the total length of fatty acid chains and with the total number of double bonds equal to 54 and 6, respectively. MS2 spectra were used to identify the exact fatty acid content of each TAG. The masses for all possible TAGs with the ammonia adduct were calculated, and all peaks that matched these masses within 20 ppm (for two masses m1 and m2 ppm = abs(m1 − m2)/max(m1, m2) × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>) were found. Then peaks were manually selected based on the net-like patterns as described by Giavalisco et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Briefly, it has been observed that the extension of the total chain length increases retention time, while the addition of a double bond reduces retention time. As a result, TAG peaks form a net-like pattern on RT-m/z plots (
