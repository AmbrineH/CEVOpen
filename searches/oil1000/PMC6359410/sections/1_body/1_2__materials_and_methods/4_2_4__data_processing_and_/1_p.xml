<p class="p">Xcms package [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] was used for UPLC–MS data processing. Optimal parameters were chosen with the aid of the IPO (Isotopologue Parameter Optimization) package [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Peak intensities were obtained using the peak Table function implemented in the xcms package with method = ‘maxint’. As a result, a set of peaks characterized by the retention time, mass divided by charge, and intensity were obtained for each sample.
