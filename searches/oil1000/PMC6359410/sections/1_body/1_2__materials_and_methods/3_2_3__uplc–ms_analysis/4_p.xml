<p class="p">Ultra-performance liquid chromatography separation was carried out on the C8 Acquity Beh column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm particle size; Waters) and the Acquity BEH C8 1.7 μm Vanguard precolumn (Waters) at 60 °C. To prepare UPLC gradient, mobile phases consisted of two solvents: solvent A: 1% of 1 M NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Ac solution and 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B: acetonitrile/isopropanol (7:3, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>:
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>; 1% of 1 M NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Ac solution; and 0.1% formic acid), with the injection volume of 3 µL. The following gradient profile was applied: 55% B, 1 min; linear gradient from 55% B to 80% B, 3 min; linear gradient from 80% B to 85% B, 8 min; linear gradient from 85% B to 100% B, 3 min. After washing the column for 4 min 50 s with 100% B, the proportion of buffer B in the mixture was set back to 55%, and the column was re-equilibrated for 4 min 10 s (24.5 min total run time), with the mobile phase flow rate of 400 µL/min.
