<p class="p">For lipid extraction, 10 mg (for each line) of 
 <italic class="italic">sunflower</italic> (1 sample—1 seed) and 
 <italic class="italic">rapeseed</italic> (1 sample—several seeds) seeds were homogenized using six 2.8 mm zirconium oxide beads in the Precellys Evolution homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) coupled with the Cryolys cooling system filled with dry ice at the temperature not exceeding 10 °C. Homogenization parameters were as follows: 6800 rpm, three times for 20 s, pause 30 s. 400 µL of methanol/methyl 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl ether mixture (1:3,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was added to each sample prior to homogenization. After homogenization, another 400 µL of methanol/methyl 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl ether mixture was added, and samples were vortexed. After sonication for 10 min in the ice-cooled ultrasonic bath and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with shaking, samples were transferred into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and 560 mL of water/methanol mixture (3:1, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>:
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was added. After the addition of water/methanol, samples were vortexed for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,700 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. This led to the separation of two phases: the lipophilic phase and the polar phase. The upper lipophilic phase was collected and vacuum-dried in Concentrator plus (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 30 °C for 1.5 h. The pellet was stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. This protocol was based on the protocol described by Giavalisco et al [
