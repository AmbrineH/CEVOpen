<p class="p">High-throughput molecular phenotyping techniques such as UPLCâ€“MS allow highly sensitive profiling of many lipid molecules at the same time. This profiling may be very useful in oilseed crop breeding enabling the comparison of lipid content among different lines and varieties, as well as in the studies of plant biochemical pathways on the whole. The comparison of the TAG composition in sunflower and rapeseed samples revealed the similarity in the content of the most intense TAGs 54:3, 54:4, 54:5, and 54:6 between these two plants. Apart from those mentioned above, the current technique used also allowed to find significant differences in the TAG amounts between sunflower and rapeseed.</p>
