<p class="p">Importantly, winter rapeseed lines were demonstrated to be enriched in the TAGs with higher amount of double bonds (52:4, 52:5, 52:6, 54:6, and 54:7), while spring rapeseed lines were shown to contain mostly the TAGs with higher level of fatty acid chain saturation (48:1, 48:2, 54:2, and 54:3). The presence of TAGs with more than three double bonds has a significant impact on the plantâ€™s resistance to cold. The observed differences in the saturation levels of TAGs in the winter-type and spring-type rapeseed may provide new insights into the cold tolerance mechanisms in plants which is highly important in terms of global climate change.</p>
