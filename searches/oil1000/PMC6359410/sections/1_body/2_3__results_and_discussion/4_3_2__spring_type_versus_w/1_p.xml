Interestingly, the TAGs with higher amount of double bonds (52:4, 52:5, 52:6, 54:6, and 54:7) are more abundant in the seeds of winter lines, while the TAGs with higher level of FA chain saturation (48:1, 48:2, 54:2, and 54:3) are more abundant in spring lines. These results may most likely be accounted for by the chemical properties of FAs. The degree of saturation is highly important for the FA crystallization processes. Triglycerides containing double bonds have significantly lower melting points than completely saturated TAGs [
