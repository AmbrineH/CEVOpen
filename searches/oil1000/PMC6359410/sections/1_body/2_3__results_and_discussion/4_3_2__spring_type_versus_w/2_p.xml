<p class="p">Winter-type rapeseed seeds were shown to contain TAGs with a lower degree of saturation, which probably has an impact on winter-type rapeseed cold resistance. Freezing tolerance is one of the most important plant traits allowing them to survive in the low temperatures. Freezing tolerance correlates well with winter survival [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The unsaturated fatty acid content of the plasma membrane is associated with cold resistance in plants. Plants with higher content of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes are more resistant to cold [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Storage lipids, TAGs, are produced by the extension of the membrane-lipid biosynthetic pathway that is why in the majority of plants, TAGs found in most seeds usually contain the same acyl groups as those found in membrane lipids. At the same time, while membrane lipid composition is highly conservative across plant species, the variability in the fatty acyl chains found in the seed oil is very high [

 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. It may appear that the FA content patterns detected in the seeds of winter-type and spring-type rapeseed are just a footprint of the total membrane lipid content specific for the winter-type and spring-type plants, since during the germination period in oilseed plants storage lipids, mainly TAGs, are catabolized with polar lipids, phospholipids, and galactolipids being synthesized de novo [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. But it cannot be also excluded that TAGs play their own specific role in the seeds of winter-type rapeseed. Since winter-type rapeseed lines start their germination late in the autumn and resume growth early in the spring, storage lipids with lower melting points may enable their growth at the relatively low temperatures and allow them to activate their metabolism early in the spring.
