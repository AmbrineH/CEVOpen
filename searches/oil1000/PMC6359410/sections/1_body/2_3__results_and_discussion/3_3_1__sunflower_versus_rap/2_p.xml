<p class="p">Control samples were analyzed in the MS2 scan mode in order to reveal the precise FA content in TAGs. This allowed to carry out a more detailed comparison between the sunflower and rapeseed TAGs. Triglycerides 54:3 is the most abundant in rapeseed. According to the MS2 results, this TAG contains three FAs 18:1 (oleic acid) (fragmentation pattern is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00009-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A), which is in good correspondence with the literature data [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The most abundant in sunflower are TAGs 52:4 and 54:6, which according to the MS2 data, contain two linoleic (18:2) and one palmitic (16:0) acids and three linoleic acids, respectively (fragmentation pattern is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00009-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B,C). Linoleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in sunflower on the whole.
