<p class="p">The intensities of TAGs in sunflower were compared with those in rapeseed. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis revealed clear clustering based on all 34 TAGs common for the two plants (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00009-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). Triglycerides 52:2, 52:5, 52:6, 54:3; 54:4, 54:7, 56:3, 56:4, and 56:5 showed the highest variability levels between sunflower and rapeseed with the higher presence in rapeseed. Triglycerides 50:2, 52:3, 52:4, 54:5, and 54:6 also showed substantially high variability, but were the most abundant in sunflower.
