<p class="p">Triglycerides in 50 sunflowers and 48 rapeseed lines (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-09-00009" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were measured by UPLCâ€“MS. After the obtained measurement results were filtered, 34 TAGs in common between sunflower and rapeseed were identified (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-09-00009" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3A,B</xref>). The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00009-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A,B. The total amount of double bonds per TAG varied from 1 to 7. All TAGs showed variability in their intensity. The most intense TAGs in sunflower were 54:3, 54:4, 54:5, 54:6, 54:7, 52:2, 52:3, and 52:4 and in rapeseed, 54:3, 54:4, 54:5, and 54:6. Based on their

 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-09-00009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00009-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> that TAGs with the same FA chain length lie on the same line, and all identified TAGs were taken together to form parallel lines on the graph. From bottom to top these lines contain lipids with the increasing fatty acid chain length, while the number of double bounds decreases from left to right.
