<p class="p">Previous studies on the chemical composition and medicinal properties of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> have mainly focused on its crude extract and essential oil, but only few reports have dealt with the organic fractions of the plant and searched for their anti-inflammatory and anticholinesterase activities as well. The present study aimed mainly to (i) assess the essential oil content and composition of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> with regard to time of its leaves collection; (ii) investigate the influence of the seasonal variation on the antioxidant, antibacterial, anticholinesterase capacities of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>leave essential oils; (iii) explore the
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory efficiency of the most active fraction, Ml EtOAcF, with reference to its phenolic compounds richness and antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.
