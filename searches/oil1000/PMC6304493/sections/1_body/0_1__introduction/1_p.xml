 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Medicinal plants have been used in developing countries as alternative treatments to solve health problems. In recent years, scientists have focused remarkably on seeking natural antioxidant molecules to protect cells and tissues from biological damage induced by oxidative stress. Plant secondary metabolites, especially polyphenols, are naturally occurring compounds largely distributed in the plant extracts [
