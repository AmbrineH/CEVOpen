<p class="p">Additionally, phenolic compound activities, acting as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), have also been revealed and were closely correlated with their structure and could be used as effective and safe Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. AD results from decreasing cholinergic functions in the brain by rapid and excessive hydrolysis of acetylcholine [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Therefore, one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of this disease was to inhibit the AChE. Investigations of plants with an anticholinesterase action have therefore gained attention in this field. Many secondary plant metabolites have been shown to exert an anti-AChE activity [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and therefore can be used as novel natural drugs reducing side effects and providing numerous beneficial effects on human health. Various studies are currently carried out in order to find adequate phytocompounds which can be used as activators of antioxidative defence enzyme systems to delay or suppress the cellular damage in biological systems [
