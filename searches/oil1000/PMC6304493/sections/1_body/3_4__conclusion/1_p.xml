<p class="p">The study highlighted the effect of the harvesting time on the essential oils composition and biological activities of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic>. The essential oils extracted from the fresh leaves were characterized by their richness in oxygenated monoterpenes. Significant variations of the essential oils composition were shown depending on the harvesting time.
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> essential oils have a remarkable antibacterial activity and an effective inhibitory effect against the enzyme related to Alzheimer's (AChE). However, the levels of these biological activities vary according to the harvest time. In fact, the interesting antibacterial and AChE inhibitory activities were observed in the winter crops, corresponding to the flowering stage. These results may be useful in choosing the optimal collection time for the production of the plant active agents with high medicinal value. The present study also revealed that the Ml EtOAcF obtained from winter leaves has a significant anti-inflammatory capacity and the uppermost anticholinesterase activity. The richness of the extract in various chemicals such as phenolic compounds could clearly contribute to its medicinal properties. Further studies are still recommended to accurately identify the bioactive molecules in this extract for the exploitation of this plant in various pharmaceutical fields and the promotion of the desired biological activities.
