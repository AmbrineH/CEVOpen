<p class="p">The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity was carried out using the spectrophotometric method developed by Mata et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] using electric eel acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7, type VS). The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 405 nm. Acetylthiocholine iodide (AChI) was employed as substrate of the reaction and 5, 5′-Dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) was used for the measurement of the anticholinesterase activity. The galanthamine·HBr was used as positive control. The obtained results were expressed as IC
