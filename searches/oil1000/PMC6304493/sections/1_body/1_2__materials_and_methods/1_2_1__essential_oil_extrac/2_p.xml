<p class="p">The essential analysed oils in this study were extracted by hydrodistillation of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> fresh leaves (100g) for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The essential oils were performed in triplicate for each oil sample. The oil was extracted with dichloromethane (3×50 ml) and dried with anhydrous Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. For yield determination, the solvent was evaporated using a rotavapory vacuum evaporator (BUCHI R-200), the yields were calculated according to dry weight of the plant material. The resulting samples were transferred to opaque glass and stored at 4°C during the experimental period. The
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> essential oil was diluted in
 <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-Hexane for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS).
