<p class="p">The acute toxicity study was performed according to the World Health Organization recommendations (2000) with some modifications. Healthy rats (175g) were randomly divided into five groups (n=10). The control group (group I) received only a solution of Tween-80 (3%), while groups II, III, IV and V were treated with Ml EtOAcF at doses of 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Following the fasting period, the graded doses of Ml EtOAcF dissolved in Tween-80 (3%), were administered orally by gavage. The animals were maintained on standard animal diet and water. All animals were daily observed for behavioral pattern, body weight, and physical appearance changes and checked for mortality during the 2-week observation period.</p>
