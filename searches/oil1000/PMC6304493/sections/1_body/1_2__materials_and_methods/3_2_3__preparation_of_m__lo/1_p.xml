<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>powdered leaves (from winter crops) were crumbled into small parts using a blender and were macerated three times in ethanol-water (8:2, v/v). The resulting extract was filtered and ethanol was evaporated and lyophilized to yield the hydroalcoholic crude extract (Ml EtOH-H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>OE). The dried hydroalcoholic crude extract (23g) was sequentially partitioned with n-hexane (3 × 350 ml) and ethyl acetate (3 × 350 ml). The filtered solution was evaporated at reduced pressure (Rotary Evaporator Buchi R-200, Switzerland) and the remaining aqueous layer was lyophilized to give the water fraction. The resulting three fractions were evaporated under vacuum to dryness to give the hexane (Ml HexF), the ethyl acetate (Ml EtOAcF), and water (Ml WF) fractions. The stock solutions were kept at 4°C in the dark until tested and analyzed.
