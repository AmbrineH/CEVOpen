<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of the
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> essential oil was performed with an Agilent 6890N Network GC system (Agilent Technologies). The system was equipped with an HP-5 MS column having 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film as dimensions. The used system was coupled to a mass selective detector and the carrier gas was Helium. The GC oven temperature started at 40°C and was held at 100°C for 1 min and then programmed to rise from 100 to 280°C at a rate of 5°C/min. The identification of essential oil constituents was performed by comparing their kovats index and mass spectra with those of the authentic standards stored on the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 7th edition (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and National Institute of Standards and Technology 05 MS (NIST) library data.
