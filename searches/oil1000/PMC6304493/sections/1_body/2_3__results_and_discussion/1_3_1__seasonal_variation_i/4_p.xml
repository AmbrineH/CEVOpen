<p class="p">The variation in the composition of the
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> essential oils investigated in this study was quantitatively significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Most fluctuations in the essential oil components includes oxygenated monoterpenes, namely, pulegone (26.92-38.2%), 1, 8 cineole (2.37-21.3 %), L- Menthone (4.68-10.66 %), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> pinene (0.24-1.22), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> pinene (0.12-0.93 %), cis iso-pulegone (0-0.86 %), and piperitenone (1.18-9.62 %) from spring and winter, respectively. The yield of most of the compounds was higher in the flowering stage (winter), while pulegone was found to be high in the spring plant collection.
