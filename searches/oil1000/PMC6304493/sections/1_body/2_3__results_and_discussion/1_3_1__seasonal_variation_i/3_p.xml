<p class="p">The content of oxygenated monoterpenes in the essential oils was higher during the winter (81.19%) and lower during the spring (53.48%). Apart from the similarity in the major compound, the oils collected in winter and spring showed notably quantitative differences. In the winter crops, the prominent components were pulegone (26.92%), L-menthone (10.66 %), and 1,8 cineole (21.3 %). However, the major constituents in the spring oil were found to be pulegone (38.2 %) and fatty acids. This oil harbors also menthone (4.68%), menthol (4.29%), and 1,8 cineole (2.37%) but with less quantities. Fatty acids, not detectable in the winter oil, were represented mainly by oleic acid (23.79%) and palmitic acid (15.26%) and to a lesser extent by linoleic acid (3.27%) in the postflowering stage essential oil. Moreover, the tested
