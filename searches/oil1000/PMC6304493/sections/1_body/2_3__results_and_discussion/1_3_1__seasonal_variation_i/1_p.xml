<p class="p">The oil yield-revealed data are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The largest amount of oil was found during the winter season corresponding to the flowering stage (2.5%) whereas the
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> oil content decreased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the spring season to reach 0.5%. The results revealed that essential oil accumulation in
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> appears to be metabolically regulated during vegetative and flowering stages of crop growth. Such results were expected as the flowering stage is well known to be the most suitable for essential oil extraction compared to vegetative stage [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and were in agreement with other research findings reporting a maximum essential oil yield during flowering stage [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. It was also shown by Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] that many tested
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha</italic> species revealed higher essential oil yield when the plants were in full bloom than when they reached the end of their growth cycle. The climatic factors variability such as temperature, total duration of exposure to sun, and precipitation could directly influence the oil yield during the two harvesting seasons [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. It was reported that the temperature influenced the oil yield of
 <italic class="italic"> O. basilicum</italic> with the highest yields in the winter season [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>].
