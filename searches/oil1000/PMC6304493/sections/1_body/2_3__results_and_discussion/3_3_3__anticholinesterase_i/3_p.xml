<p class="p">Monoterpenes, reported in
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>essential oils, are known for their biological activities and beneficial effects [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Numerous essential oils and their isolated monoterpenes have been investigated for their effects on AChE. It was proven that purified 1.8-cineole, a monoterpene one of the major compounds of winter
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>essential oil, exhibited a potent inhibitory capacity on AChE activity and showed synergistic effect with other constituents [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. It was reported by Mata et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] that the essential oils of the two
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha </italic>species,
 <italic class="italic"> M. pulegium</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> M. spicata</italic>, exhibited only moderate AChE inhibition with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 324 and 357 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. The main components of these oils were pulegone and carvone. These compounds are reported as moderate inhibitors of AChE [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. According to previous observed data, the AChE inhibition in our case by
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>essential oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 21.9 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml) led to the suggestion that the activity is probably due to the synergistic effects of several components major and minor ones mainly monoterpenoids.
