<p class="p">Plants have been traditionally used to enhance cognitive functions and alleviate other symptoms nowadays associated with Alzheimer's disease [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Most of the drugs used in Alzheimer therapy are formed by an enzyme inhibitor, e.g., galanthamine, isolated from the snowdrop extract [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. There has been a lot of research on the biological effect of plants traditionally used as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
 <italic class="italic"> in vitro </italic>and also as memory enhancers

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The great inhibitory effect of Ml EtOAcF made us think that this fraction contains neuroprotective phytochemical molecules like phenolic active compounds which could be responsible for the plant potent anti-AChE activity. The AChE inhibition efficacy of Ml EtOAcF observed in this work comes probably from its richness in various effective chemical compounds present in the extract such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, proven to have an inhibitory ability against key enzymes involved in the cholinergic nervous system [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The bioactive compounds can act synergistically or individually to induce an AChE inhibitory activity. Further analyses have to be performed to delineate rationally the Ml EtOAcF active compound(s).
