<p class="p">A wide variation in the antioxidant activity of
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>was observed in the literature. Mkaddem et al. [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] showed a moderate IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of essential oil (&gt; 8000 mg/ml) assayed by DPPH. It was also found that the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of the methanol extract of Turkish
 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia</italic> was in the range of 57.4 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ ml [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In addition, a lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of methanol extract in the range of 20 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml was obtained by Hajlaoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>].
