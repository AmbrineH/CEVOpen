 <italic class="italic"> M. longifolia </italic>methanol extract (obtained at the flowering stage) was more effective in scavenging DPPH free radical than the essential oil. The antiradical efficiency due to a hydrogen atom transferring reaction showed a positive correlation with phenolics content (R
