<p class="p">Our results also showed that essential oil samples exhibited high antibacterial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the Gram-negative ones,

According to previous reports, Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be less effective in the action of various plant essential oils. This resistance against Gram-negative ones might be related to their highly complex outer membrane which protects them [
