<p class="p">Among the tested extracts, only Ml EtOAcF and Ml EtOH-H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>OE exhibited an antibacterial activity. Ml HexF and Ml WF remained inactive in the range of the used concentration (2.5 mg/wells). Active extracts showed a potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The inhibition zone diameters and MIC values were in the range of 17-27 mm and 0.039-1.25 mg/ml for the Ml EtOAcF and 12-20 mm and 0.078-2.5 mg/ml for the EtOH-H2OE. The Ml EtOAcF was the most active fraction with the lowest MBC values ranging from 0.0.78 to 1.25 mg/ml, respectively (
