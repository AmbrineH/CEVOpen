<p class="p">Pulegone, 1.8-cineole, and L-menthone were proven to have a potential antibacterial activity. Therefore, the winter essential oil efficiency may be especially related to its richness in such compounds. Pulegone was found to have an antibacterial activity through dissipating the pH gradient and altering the cell membrane potential [
