 <italic class="italic"> Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis</italic> were the most sensitive microorganisms to the essential oils. They also exhibited the lowest MIC values varying between 0.078 and 0.156mg/ml, 0.156 and 0.312 mg/ml, 0.312 and 0.625 mg/ml, and 0.078 and 0.625mg/ml, respectively. As shown in
