<p class="p">The paw oedema tissues from all the groups were histologically examined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The control group showed normal tissue whereas the carrageenan inflamed group displayed an intense oedema, characterized by conjunctive tissue with a substantial number of inflammatory cells infiltration. The carrageenan groups pretreated with indomethacin (10 mg/kg) or Ml EtOAcF (200mg/kg) exhibited a significant decrease in oedema as well as reduction in the inflammatory cells (
