<p class="p">The development of oedema inflammation is a biphasic event: the first phase is caused by the release of histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, and cyclooxygenases in the first hour of the injection of carrageenan, and the second phase is linked to an increased generation of prostaglandins in the inflammatory tissue [

This result suggests that the Ml EtOAcF anti-inflammatory efficacy may be due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase synthesis. Such an effect is similar to that produced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin [
