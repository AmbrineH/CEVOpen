<p class="p">Concentration-dependent interactions occurring between rosemary EO and lipid nanoparticles components could explain PIT lowering as rosemary EO content increased. As reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], rosemary EO hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) is 16.5 while cetyl palmitate has an HLB value of 10.0. Therefore, increasing the percentage of rosemary EO in the lipid phase would lead to an increase in hydrophilicity of the lipid mixture. In conventional emulsions, an increase in hydrophilicity is expected to lead to an increase in PIT values [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. As NLC BEO1–4 and CEO1–3 contain both solid and liquid lipids, they could be classified as multiple NLCs [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Being comprised of complex structures, with a matrix consisting of oil droplets embedded in solid lipids and a shell of surfactants, the interactions among different components could affect PIT values differently from conventional emulsions. Therefore, further studies have been planned to elucidate the interactions occurring between rosemary EO and other nanoparticle constituents.
