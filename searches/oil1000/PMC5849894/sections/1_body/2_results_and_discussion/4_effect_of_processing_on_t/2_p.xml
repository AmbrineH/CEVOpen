<p class="p">The changes in mineral composition of walnut seeds during processing are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>. It can be observed that the nuts contain important amount of macrominerals, among which calcium, magnesium, and potassium are the most represented. Sodium and phosphorus were also present, but at low concentration compared to the previous minerals. The importance of these mineral elements in human health has already been proven. They are implicated in several body functions such as enzymatic reactions, energy production, transmission of nerve impulses, and multiple biological reactions (Steinberg, Bearden, &amp; Keen,
