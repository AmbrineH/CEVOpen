 <p> (A) Examining Cocos nucifera class A fatty acid thioesterase ( FATA) candidates for functionality through the quantification of changes in the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) content, using the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression assay. The Arabidopsis thaliana homolog ( AtFATA1) was used as a positive control. The sample ‘p19 Only’ refers to the background infiltration of AtWRI1 and AtDGAT1. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 4). (B) Analysis of the major fatty acids in the TAG fatty acid composition, associated with the testing different FATA candidates, using the N.benthamiana transient expression assay. All treatments were performed in the background of AtWRI1 and AtDGAT1 co-expression. The A.thaliana homolog ( AtFATA1) was used as a positive control. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 4). At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cn, Cocos nucifera. </p>
