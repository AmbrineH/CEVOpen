 <p> (A) Examining Cocos nucifera DGAT1 candidates for functionality through the quantification of changes in the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG), using the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression assay. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 4). (B) Analysis of major fatty acids in the total fatty acid profile from the N.benthamiana transient expression assay, associated with the testing of different diacylglycerol acyltransferase ( DGAT1) candidates. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 4). (C) Yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complementation assay of quadruple mutant strain H1246, investigating the functionality of DGAT1 through restoration of function. Transformants were fed C18:1Δ9 free fatty acids. Yeast transformants were resuspended in sterile water and diluted to OD600 = 1. Samples were further diluted in four consecutive dilutions, each at 1:10. From each dilution 5 μL was spotted on to YPD+FFA plates. The plates were incubated at 28�C for 3 d. Negative control, H1246::pYES2; Positive control, H1246:: AtDGAT1; pKR.B1, H1246:: CnDGAT1_V1. At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cn, Cocos nucifera. </p>
