 <p> Confocal microscopy showing the localization of CnOLEOSIN-mCherry in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, 3 d post-infiltration (DPI). Lipid droplets were stained with BODIPY-505/515 and are shown in green, chloroplast autofluorescence in blue and CnOLEOSIN-mCherry in magenta. In all panels, white arrowheads point at lipid droplets, while empty arrowheads highlight CnOLEOSIN signal in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and stars highlight the nucleus of the cell (M–P). In leaves infiltrated with p19 only (A–D), the lipid droplets were very small. In leaves infiltrated with p19+ CnOLEOSIN-mCherry (E–H), CnOLEOSIN localized to the ER and lipid droplets, and the size of the lipid droplets was not increased compared to p19 alone. In leaves infiltrated with p19+ AtWRI1+ AtDGAT1 (I–L), the lipid droplets increased in both size and abundance. Finally, in leaves infiltrated with p19+ AtWRI1+ AtDGAT1+ CnOLEOSIN-mCherry (M–T), CnOLEOSIN was still detected in the ER (M–P) and was also found to coat the lipid droplets (Q–T). TL is transmitted light. Scale bars represent 20 μm except the lower row where they represent 10 μm. At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cn, Cocos nucifera. </p>
