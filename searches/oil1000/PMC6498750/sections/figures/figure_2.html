 <p> Analysis of coconut oil composition. Extracted coconut oil from developing Cocos nucifera endosperm was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (A). The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TAG) was compared between commercial coconut oil (Murray River Organics, Australia) and oil extracted from freshly harvested developing coconut endosperm (B). LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; MAG, monoacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; FFA, free fatty acid; TAG, triacylglycerol. </p>
