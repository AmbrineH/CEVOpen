 <p> (A) Investigating the ability of CnOLEOSIN to enable greater accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, following 5 d of expression. The WRI1 and DGAT1 genes were both from Arabidopsis thaliana. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 6). (B) Investigating the ability of CnOLEOSIN in protecting lipid droplets by minimizing the turnover of TAG, by measuring the incorporation of [14C] labelled acetate into TAG. Error bars are representative of standard error ( n = 3). At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cn, Cocos nucifera. </p>
