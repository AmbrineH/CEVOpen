  <p class="p">(A) Examining 
   <italic class="italic">Cocos nucifera DGAT1</italic> candidates for functionality through the quantification of changes in the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG), using the 
   <italic class="italic">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> transient expression assay. Error bars are representative of standard deviation (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4). (B) Analysis of major fatty acids in the total fatty acid profile from the 
   <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> transient expression assay, associated with the testing of different diacylglycerol acyltransferase (
   <italic class="italic">DGAT1</italic>) candidates. Error bars are representative of standard deviation (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4). (C) Yeast (
   <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) complementation assay of quadruple mutant strain H1246, investigating the functionality of DGAT1 through restoration of function. Transformants were fed C18:1Δ9 free fatty acids. Yeast transformants were resuspended in sterile water and diluted to OD600 = 1. Samples were further diluted in four consecutive dilutions, each at 1:10. From each dilution 5 μL was spotted on to YPD+FFA plates. The plates were incubated at 28�C for 3 d. Negative control, H1246::pYES2; Positive control, H1246::
   <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic>; pKR.B1, H1246::
