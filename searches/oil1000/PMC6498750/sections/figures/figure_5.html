 <p> (A) Investigating the ability of phosphatidylcholine-diacylglycerol acyltransferase ( PDAT) to increase production of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, following 5 d of expression. Error bars are representative of standard deviation ( n = 3). Treatments were grouped by their respective PDAT expression including no PDAT, PDAT from Arabidopsis thaliana ( AtPDAT) and Cocos nucifera ( CnPDAT). (B) Investigating the changes in fatty acid composition of different lipid groups associated with the overexpression of PDAT, using the N.benthamiana transient expression assay. The lipid pools analyzed included were TAG, phospholipids and total fatty acids (TFA). Treatments were grouped by their respective PDAT expression including no PDAT, PDAT from Arabidopsis thaliana ( AtPDAT) and from C.nucifera ( CnPDAT) ( n = 3). </p>
