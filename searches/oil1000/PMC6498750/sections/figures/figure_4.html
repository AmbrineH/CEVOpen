 <p> Investigating the substrate specificity of Cocos nucifera DGAT1 candidates for functionality through analyzing the changes in both the total triacylglycerol (TAG; block dots) content and the TAG fatty acid profile, using the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression assay ( n = 4). The results were grouped by the corresponding class B acyl-ACP thioesterase ( FATB), where control refers to the expression of p19 only. On the x-axis, the treatments were grouped into respective diacylglycerol acyltransferase ( DGAT) expression. Control refers to samples that were infiltrated with the corresponding FATB only (Control = p19 only). The annotation of CnDGAT represents those treatments that exhibited CnDGAT1+ AtWRI1 co-expression. At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cc, Cinnamomum camphora; Cn, Cocos nucifera; Uc, Umbellularia californica. </p>
