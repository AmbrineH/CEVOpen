 <p> Graphical representation of the primary pathways involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) production, highlighting the lipid synthesis genes of interest (grey bubbles). The asterisk represents those genes that have been investigated in this study following the construction of the Cocos nucifera (coconut palm) endosperm transcriptome. FAS, fatty acid synthase; FAT, fatty acid thioesterase, class A ( FATA) and class B ( FATB); GPAT, glycerol phosphate acyltransferase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PDAT, phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PC,phosphatidylcholine; DAG, diacylglycerol. </p>
