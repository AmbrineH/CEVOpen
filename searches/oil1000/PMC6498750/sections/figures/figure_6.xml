  <p class="p">Confocal microscopy showing the localization of CnOLEOSIN-mCherry in epidermal cells of 
   <italic class="italic">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves, 3 d post-infiltration (DPI). Lipid droplets were stained with BODIPY-505/515 and are shown in green, chloroplast autofluorescence in blue and
