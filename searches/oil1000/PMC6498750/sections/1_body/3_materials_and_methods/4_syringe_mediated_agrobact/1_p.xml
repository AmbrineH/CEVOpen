 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were grown at 24�C in a growth room with 16 h days (250 μmol m

 <sup class="sup">1</sup>). The infiltrations were performed using 5-week-old plants. Transient expression in 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> leaves was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wood et�al. 2009)</xref>, with some minor modifications. 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (AGL1) cultures containing the gene coding for the p19 viral suppressor protein and the chimeric gene(s) of interest were mixed such that the final OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of each culture was equal to 0.1 prior to infiltrations. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in an infiltration buffer containing 10 mM MES pH 5.7, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 100 μM acetosyringone. The samples being compared were randomly located on leaves, with a p19 control infiltrated for each plant. After infiltrations, the 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> plants were grown for a further 5 d before leaves were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then freeze-dried (Flexi-Dry MP: FTS Systems, Stone Ridge, NY, USA), typically overnight before processing. For samples that were used for confocal microscopy, fresh disc samples were harvested 3 d post-infiltration and processed immediately.
