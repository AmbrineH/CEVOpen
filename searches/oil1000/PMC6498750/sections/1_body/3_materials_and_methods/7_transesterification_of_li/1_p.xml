<p class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of total lipids were produced by incubating the dry leaf sample or extracted lipid in 1 N methanolic-HCl (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) at 80�C for 3 h. Following the incubation phase, 500 μL of 0.1 M NaCl and 300 μL of hexane were added to the sample, and mixed via shaking with a ‘Multi Tube Vortex Mixer’ (Ratex Instruments, Australia) for 5 min. The hexane, containing FAMEs, fraction was then separated by centrifugation at 1,700�
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 2 min. The hexane phase was then transferred to inserts for analysis via gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID).
