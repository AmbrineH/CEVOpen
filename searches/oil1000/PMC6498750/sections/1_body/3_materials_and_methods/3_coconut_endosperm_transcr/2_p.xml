<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembled transcriptome was used as a BLAST platform using previously characterized genes to identify similar genes from 
 <italic class="italic">C.nucifera</italic>. Identified candidate sequences were analyzed using the online Transeq tool (European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute 2018) to enable identification of the full length open reading frames. Following the identification of candidate genes, cDNA was synthesized from RNA (First Strand cDNA Synthesis; New England Biolabs, USA). Primers were then designed for full length amplification of the transcripts using Phusion-PCR (Phusionï¿½ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase; NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA).
