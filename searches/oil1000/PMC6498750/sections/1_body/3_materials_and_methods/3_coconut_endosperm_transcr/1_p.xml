QC and read filtering was performed using BioKanga (v3.8.4; NGSQC and filter), discarding reads that overlapped less than 50% with any other read or contained ambiguous bases. Assembly was performed using BioKanga (v3.8.4; assemb) using default parameters, with an initial overlap of 150 bp with a final overlap of 35 bp (PE) and 25 bp (SE). Scaffolding was performed using BioKanga (v3.8.4; scaffold) using default parameters with an insert length of 100–750 bp. The scaffolded
