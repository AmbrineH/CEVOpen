<p class="p">Total lipid extraction protocol was followed for the extraction of lipids from freeze-dried 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> leaves. Freeze-dried leaf tissue samples were first weighed using an analytical balance (AE100: Mettler, Port Melbourne, VIC, Australia) and then ground to powder in a microcentrifuge tube containing a metallic ball using a Reicht tissue lyser (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) for 3 min at 20 Hz. An internal standard of triheptadecanoin (TAG 51:0; Sigma, USA) was added for the quantification of both TFA and TAG contents. Chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) was added and mixed for a further 3 min on the tissue lyser before the addition of 0.1 M KCl (1:3, v/v). The sample was then mixed for a further 3 min before centrifugation (5 min at 14,000�
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>), after which the lower lipid phase was collected. The remaining phase was washed once with chloroform, and the lower phase extracted and pooled with the earlier extract. Lipid phase solvent was then evaporated completely using nitrogen gas flow and the lipids were then resuspended in 2 μL chloroform per mg of the leaf original dry weight. Lipid extractions from
