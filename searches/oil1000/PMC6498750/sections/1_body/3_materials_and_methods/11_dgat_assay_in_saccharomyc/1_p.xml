 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain H1246 (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sandager et�al. 2002)</xref> is completely devoid of 
 <italic class="italic">DGAT</italic> activity and lacks TAG and sterol esters as a result of knockout mutations in four genes (
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">LRO1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">ARE1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ARE2</italic>). The addition of free fatty acid (1 mM C18:1
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>) to H1246 growth media is toxic in the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">DGAT</italic> activity. Growth on such media can therefore be used as an indicator or selection for the presence of DGAT activity in this yeast strain. A functional DGAT will restore the capability of the mutant yeast strain to accumulate TAG, and hence restores growth. 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> H1246 was transformed with the pYES2 construct (negative control), a construct encoding 
 <italic class="italic">A.thaliana DGAT1</italic> in pYES2 (positive control), or a construct encoding 
 <italic class="italic">C.nucifera DGAT1</italic> in pYES2 (designated pKR.B1). Transformants were fed C18:1
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup> free fatty acids.
