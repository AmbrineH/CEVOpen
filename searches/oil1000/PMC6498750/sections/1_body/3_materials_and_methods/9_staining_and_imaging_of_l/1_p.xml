<p class="p">Fresh leaf discs were harvested from plants 3 d post-infiltration. The leaf discs were cut in half, with one half being stained with 2 �g/mL BODIPY 505/515 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Scoresby, VIC, Australia ) in 50 mM PIPES pH 7.0 for 10 min and washed in 50 mM PIPES pH 7.0. The other half was used as a negative control for the BODIPY stain and was immediately placed in 50 mM PIPES pH 7.0. Leaf discs were then imaged using a Leica, Wetzlar, Hesse, Germany SP8 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica microsystems) equipped with a 20� water immersion objective [NA = 0.75] and the LasX software (version 3.3.0). Imaging was done sequentially. In the first track, signals from BODIPY (excitation 505 nm; emission 510–540 nm) and chloroplasts (excitation 650 nm; emission 670–690 nm) were collected, together with the transmitted light. In the second track, mCherry (excitation 587 nm; emission 600–630 nm) was imaged alone.</p>
