<p class="p">Total lipids were first fractionated by TLC in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (68:22:6:4, v/v/v/v), which was run until the solvent front was approximately halfway through the plate. The lipids were then further separated in a second solvent system of hexane:diethyl-ether:acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), which was run until the solvent front had run through the entire length of the plate. The utilization of the dual-phase TLC for the analysis of lipid extractions enables the total separation of the lipid classes.</p>
