<p class="p">TAG and polar lipids were fractionated by TLC (Silica gel 60, MERCK, Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany) in a solvent system of hexane:diethyl-ether:acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), visualized by spraying primuline (Sigma, USA) 5 mg/100 mL acetone:water (80:20, v/v) and exposing plate under UV light at a wavelength of 254 nm (‘UV Cabinet 4’: CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland). All TLC analyses were performed in glass TLC developing tanks (Sigma, USA). TLC analysis was primarily used for the identification of TAG species from lipid extraction samples, enabling the determination of the total TAG content of each sample. The TAG fractions were scraped from the TLC plates and collected for transesterification.</p>
