 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C] acetate, leaf discs were pooled and lipid biosynthesis was stopped with the addition of 100 μL chloroform. Total lipid extraction and TLC fractionation were performed as described above. The TLC plate was exposed to phosphor imaging screens overnight and analyzed by a Fujifilm FLA-5000 Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Radiolabeled lipid spots were measured using a Beckman-Coulter Ready Safe liquid scintillation cocktail and Beckman-Coulter LS 6500 Multipurpose Scintillation Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
