<p class="p">FAMEs were analyzed by an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with flame ionization detector (GC-FID; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), on a BPX70 column (30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 �m film thickness, SGE) essentially as described previously (

The column temperature was programmed at an initial temperature of 100�C holding for 3 min, ramping to 240�C at a rate of 7�C/min and holding for 1 min. NuChek GLC-426 was used as the external reference standard. Peaks were integrated with Agilent Technologies ChemStation software (Rev B.04.03). All analyses of calculating statistical significance were performed using a student’s
