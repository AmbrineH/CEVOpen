<p class="p">For the rapid cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based procedure, 900 �L of extraction buffer (2% CTAB w/v, 2.5% PVP-40 w/v, 2M NaCl, 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 2% of β-mercaptoethanol added just before use) was heated at 65�C in a microcentrifuge tube. Samples (150 mg) were powdered in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, then added to the extraction buffer and incubated at 65�C for 10 min. An equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) was added and the tube was inverted vigorously and centrifuged at 11,000�

The supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tube and LiCl (3 M final concentration) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and RNA was selectively pelleted after centrifugation at 21,000�

 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min at 4�C. The supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tube and the RNA was precipitated overnight at −20�C with 0.7 volume of cold isopropanol and then centrifuged at 21,000�
