<p class="p">Following the assembly and quality analysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> coconut endosperm transcriptome, the transcriptome was initially used as a BLAST sequence database for the identification and confirmation of previously discovered and characterized genes from coconut, including the thioesterases (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knutzon et�al. 1995)</xref>. The identified transcripts from the assembled transcriptome were then aligned against the published sequences. In all cases, there was high consensus with the previously characterized genes and the sequence identified from the transcriptome (

 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome and their high sequence consensus provided further confidence in the transcriptome being a powerful and reliable tool for the discovery of new genes of interest.
