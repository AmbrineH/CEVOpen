<p class="p">Before proceeding with RNA extractions, total lipids were extracted from a sample of coconut endosperm to determine the fatty acid composition. The total lipids were analyzed via thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gunstone et�al. 2007)</xref>. Following analysis of the coconut endosperm TAG content and composition it was hypothesized that the genes of interest, those involved in the MCFA lipid synthesis pathways, were being highly expressed at this developmental stage as the oil composition reflects active accumulation of MCFAs.
