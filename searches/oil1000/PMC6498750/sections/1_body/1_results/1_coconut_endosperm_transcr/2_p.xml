<p class="p">A transcriptomic approach was undertaken for the identification of genes involved in the metabolic processes of oil production. Illumina RNA-Seq technology was used to generate 473,728,278 short reads (236,864,139 pairs). The quality control analysis of the raw reads using BioKanga next generation sequencing did not show any concerns with the data quality (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruffalo et�al. 2012</xref>). Due to the scarcity of reference sequences for coconut palm available in the NCBI and other databases, 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembly was performed to create a platform of sequence information for the discovery of novel functional genes from coconut palm. After filtering (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), there were 271,312,922 reads (135,656,461 pairs, mean length of 100 bp; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), which contained no ambiguous bases. These filtered reads were used for the assembly of the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome using BioKanga v3.8.4 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The resulting assembly contained 838,319 contigs (total length: 278,262,217 bp). Scaffolding of the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembly was constructed using BioKanga with a fragment length of 100–750 bp (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), with the final assembly containing 219,807 contigs (total length: 204,112,078 bp). Aligning reads using BioKanga (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) and allowing up to four substitutions, showed 90,611,882 pairs of 100 bp that uniquely mapped back to the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome (45,572,443 sense, 45,039,439 antisense), at approximately 32.6� coverage.
