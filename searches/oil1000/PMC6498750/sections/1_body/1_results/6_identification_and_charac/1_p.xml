<p class="p">Although MCFA is the main constituent of coconut oil, long chain fatty acids are also an important component representing 15% of the total fatty acid (TFA) composition (

 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA candidates identified from the assembled transcriptome (

 <italic class="italic">A.thaliana</italic> homolog to determine sequence homology (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Further examination of the protein sequences revealed that both of the candidate sequences contained the acyl-ACP thioesterase domain. The sequence similarity of 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>FATA with the identified coconut candidates 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA_V1 (65%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA_V2 (50%) provided further evidence that they may be functional FATA proteins.
