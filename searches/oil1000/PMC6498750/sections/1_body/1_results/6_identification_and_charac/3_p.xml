<p class="p">For each combination the fatty acid composition of TAG was also analyzed (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F8" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>B
 </bold>). The changes in the fatty acid composition following expression of either 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic> candidate were similar to that observed in the positive control with 
 <italic class="italic">AtFATA1</italic> overexpression. In all three scenarios, compared to the 
 <italic class="italic">AtWRI1 </italic>+
 <italic class="italic"> AtDGAT1</italic> control, a significant increase was observed for both C16:0 and C18:0 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.005), as well as significant decreases in both C18:1 and C18:2 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.005). Together these results confirm the functionality of both 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA candidates, although 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA_V2 outperforms 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>FATA_V1 in terms of ability to increase TAG production.
