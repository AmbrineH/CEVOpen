<p class="p">The FATA function was tested through a transient expression study for its ability to not only increase TAG production but also modify the fatty acid composition of TAG using the 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> infiltration assay. The 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic> candidates were co-infiltrated with 
 <italic class="italic">AtWRI1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic> to model an increased oil background. The 
 <italic class="italic">A.thaliana</italic> homolog (
 <italic class="italic">AtFATA1</italic>: NM_113415) was used as the positive control for direct comparison and to enable analysis of functionality. With the co-expression of both 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic> candidates a significant increase in TAG production (

 </bold>) was achieved (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0005), although TAG production was significantly higher with the co-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic>_V2 when compared to 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic>_V1 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.047). It was also determined that the TAG content following 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic>_V2 expression was similar to the TAG content achieved with 
 <italic class="italic">AtFATA1</italic> co-expression (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.1).
