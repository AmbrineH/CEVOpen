<p class="p">Through analysis of the fatty acid composition (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>B
 </bold>) of TAG, it was also demonstrated that in treatments of 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic> expression, that the C12:0 content of TAG was significantly improved following the co-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT when compared to both 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic> only and 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.03). However, when comparing treatment combinations of 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>LPAAT+
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>GPAT9, there was no significant difference in the C12:0 content of TAG (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.06) following the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT. Although there was no difference in the C12:0 composition following the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT, the TAG content was significantly higher, suggesting that more TAG was being produced by the PC-DAG pathway. This concept was reaffirmed by the phospholipid fatty acid composition, where itâ€™s clear that C12:0-containing PC lipids were being used for TAG assembly. Analysis of the TFA composition (data not shown) revealed that the highest level of MCFA accumulation was achieved where the combination of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>LPAAT+
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>GPAT9+
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT was being used for assembly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01).
