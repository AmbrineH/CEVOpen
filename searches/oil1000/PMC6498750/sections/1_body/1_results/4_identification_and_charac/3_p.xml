<p class="p">The PDAT function was tested using transient 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> infiltration assays. When 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT and 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT were tested individually for their ability to increase TAG production (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>A
 </bold>), the expression of either PDAT was associated with a significant increase in TAG compared to the p19 control (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.05). In scenarios following the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">U.californica</italic> 12:0-ACP thioesterase (
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic>) and other acyltransferases (
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>LPAAT�
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>GPAT9), the further addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT resulted in further increases in TAG production (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.002). The co-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT also recovered the chlorotic phenotype previously associated with a build-up of MCFA-containing PC lipids (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et�al. 2015)</xref>. In contrast, a TAG increase was not observed in the scenario of 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT expression (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.3), which is suspected to be a result of 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT not being capable of utilizing C12:0 as a substrate for TAG incorporation.
