<p class="p">The translated protein sequences of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT candidates identified (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) were examined through multiple sequence alignments with 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT and the predicted 
 <italic class="italic">Eg</italic>PDAT sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). This sequence alignment revealed that all of the products were highly similar at both the N and C termini, but varied significantly through the middle of the proteins with variation in the length of deletions. It may be that the smaller products are alternative splice variants of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT_V1, which appears to be the full length transcript based on sequence homology with both the 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>PDAT (75%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Eg</italic>PDAT (96%). The full length protein sequence was analyzed through BLAST, which confirmed the presence of the abhydrolase domain, a characteristic feature of 
 <italic class="italic">PDAT</italic>. Based on the results of analyzing sequence homology and features, it provided confidence that the 
 <italic class="italic">CnPDAT</italic>_V1 should encode a functional PDAT.
