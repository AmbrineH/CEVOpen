<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>Oleosin was also examined for the function of lipid droplet stabilization and protection, via analyzing the incorporation of [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>B
 </bold>). In the control sample, expression of p19 alone, the [
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C] acetate incorporation into TAG did not exceed 500 disintegrations per minute (dpm) during the 15 min time course. There was no significant difference in the amount of [
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C] acetate incorporation following the co-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">CnOleosin</italic> alone (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.07). In leaf samples exhibiting the expression of p19+
 <italic class="italic">AtWRI1</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic>, TAG accumulation continued to occur in the first 10 min of the assay, followed by rapid degradation. Although the additional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">CnOleosin</italic> did not result in further increasing the production of TAG, its expression enabled a higher final TAG content through reducing TAG turnover. The demonstrated ability of this protein to both increase TAG accumulation and improve TAG stability, along with its physical co-localization with lipid droplets provide confirmation of a functional
