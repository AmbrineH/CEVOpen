<p class="p">The full length transcripts of 
 <italic class="italic">CnOleosin</italic> candidates identified from the assembled transcriptome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) were examined through multiple sequence alignment to determine similarity with 
 <italic class="italic">A.thaliana</italic> homologs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Further examination of the protein sequences revealed that only one of the candidate sequences contained the characteristic proline-knot that defines an oleosin (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hsieh and Huang 2004)</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>Oleosin_V4. This candidate sequence was further analyzed using online protein property analysis tools (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lear and Cobb 2016</xref>), which revealed that the sequence was 49.3% hydrophobic and contained a 75 amino acid central hydrophobic region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), a characteristic feature of oleosin which enables the formation of the hairpin-like structure that interacts with lipid droplets (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li and Fan 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcy247-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maurer etï¿½al. 2013)</xref>. The 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>Oleosin_V4 protein had highest similarity with 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>OLEO4 and 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>OLEO5 with the sequences being 35.6% and 36.6% identical, respectively. Based on sequence homology and the peptide characteristics identified it was predicted that the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>Oleosin_V4 should be functional.
