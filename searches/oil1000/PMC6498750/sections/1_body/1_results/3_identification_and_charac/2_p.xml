<p class="p">The function of the three 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGATs were tested through transient expression studies for their ability to increase TAG production, using the 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> infiltration assay. It has previously been shown that DGAT1 functions synergistically with WRI1 to further increase the TAG content in leaves (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vanhercke etï¿½al. 2013)</xref>. This concept was explored here, with each DGAT being co-infiltrated with 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>WRI1 to both amplify increases in TAG content and evaluate gene functionality. It was observed that one of the isolated coconut DGAT1 candidates (
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1_V1) was functional in 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic>, based on the significantly increased TAG (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0004) and TFA (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.03; data not shown) contents compared to the p19 control infiltrated leaf samples (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>A
 </bold>). Changes in the fatty acid profile provided further confirmation that the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1_V1 candidate was functional (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>B
 </bold>), with significant increases observed for both C16:0 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0008) and C18:1 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.03) and also a significant decrease in the C18:3 content (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.005), when compared to the p19 alone control.
