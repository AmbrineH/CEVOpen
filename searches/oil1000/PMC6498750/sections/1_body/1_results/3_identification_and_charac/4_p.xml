<p class="p">Following confirmation of functionality for 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1_V1, further experiments were conducted to investigate substrate specificity. The 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1 fatty acid substrate specificity was determined through analyzing both the fatty acid composition of TAG and the TAG content of 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> infiltrated leaves, following expression with and without the co-expression of different type B thioesterases (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>
 </bold>). In most 
 <italic class="italic">FATB</italic> combinations the fatty acid composition of TAG was not significantly different with the absence or presence of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> expression, except for combinations involving 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATB3</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic> expression. The total increase in MCFA accumulation was more pronounced in samples expressing 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic>, with a more significant increase in C12:0 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than compared to C14:0 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0003). Although the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">AtWRI1</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> led to a significant increase in oil production in all combinations, the most significant increase was associated with the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Based on this data the fatty acid substrate preference of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> is C12:0 &gt; C14:0 &gt; C16:0.
