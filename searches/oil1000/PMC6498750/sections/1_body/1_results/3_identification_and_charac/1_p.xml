<p class="p">The translated protein sequences of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1 candidates identified (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) were compared to the 
 <italic class="italic">A.thaliana</italic> and oil palm homologs through multiple sequence alignments to compare sequence homology (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), which revealed that the CnDGAT1 candidate sequences were 56–60% identical to the 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>DGAT1 homolog. It was also identified that the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1_V1 sequence was highly similar to the 
 <italic class="italic">Eg</italic>DGAT1_V1 sequence, with 90% homology. The translated protein sequences were analyzed through BLAST, which confirmed the presence of the membrane-bound acyltransferase (MBOAT) domain, a characteristic feature of DGAT1 required for functionality (
