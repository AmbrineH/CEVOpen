<p class="p">The assembled coconut endosperm transcriptome was used as a BLAST reference to identify candidate transcripts of genes that are involved in lipid synthesis and assembly pathways. Of particular interest were acyltransferases as they are crucial to both the assembly and fatty acid composition of plant oils. BLAST analysis of the assembled coconut transcriptome revealed many candidate sequences. These candidate sequences were analyzed via the Transeq online tool (
