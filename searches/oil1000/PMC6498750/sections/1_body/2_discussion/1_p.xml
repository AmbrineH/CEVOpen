<p class="p">Deep sequencing strategies were undertaken for the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembly of a transcriptome from developing endosperm of 
 <italic class="italic">C.nucifera</italic> (coconut palm), which has enabled the identification of functional genes that are involved in the metabolic processes of TAG biosynthesis. This transcriptome has been successfully utilized for the identification of candidate genes involved in fatty acid profile determination (
 <italic class="italic">FATA</italic>) and that are essential to both the assembly (
 <italic class="italic">GPAT9</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">DGAT1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PDAT</italic>) and protection (
 <italic class="italic">oleosin</italic>) of TAG, which were then examined using heterologous expression assays. Due to the requirement of these genes for increased TAG production, they are likely to be the targets of future metabolic engineering studies targeted towards increasing vegetable oil yields. The further understanding of how coconut palm achieves such high oil yields, at 67% of the seed weight (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arkcoll 1988</xref>), may be crucial to future directions of increasing global vegetable oil production. As it has been demonstrated in this study, the assembled transcriptome now provides a platform for further discovery of important lipid synthesis related genes.
