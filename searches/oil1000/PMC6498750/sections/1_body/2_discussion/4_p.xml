<p class="p">TAGs are present in subcellular spherical lipid droplets of approximately 0.5–2 �m in diameter, surrounded by a matrix of phospholipids and structural proteins, for example oleosin (

 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>Oleosin expression was localized in the ER and as a surrounding layer of lipid droplets. This result is consistent with the understanding that the oleosin protein is contained within the ER and becomes part of the phospholipid layer surrounding lipid droplets (

 <italic class="italic">oleosin</italic>, or other lipid droplet associated proteins, will be important for future studies that aim to both increase oil production and stabilize the synthesized oil by providing protection against degradation (
