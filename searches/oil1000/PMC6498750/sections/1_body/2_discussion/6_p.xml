<p class="p">Currently, crop sources of MCFA-enriched oils are supplied predominantly by the production of coconut palm and oil palm (both palm oil and palm kernel oil which are derived from the mesocarp and endosperm, respectively) (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arkcoll 1988)</xref>. With the continued growth in the world population there will be a correlating increased demand for both food and industrial products derived from vegetable oils. Methods of increasing global oil production have previously been proposed including the expansion of agricultural land, and increasing the yields of current oilseed crops through conventional breeding or genetic technology approaches (

With these reasons considered, it provides motives for the transition of MCFA-enriched oils into new crops, whether that may be through traditional oilseed crops or the further development of leaf oil production. In this study, the components needed for the development of a MCFA-enriched oil have been identified, although it remains to be assembled into a complete pathway as previously demonstrated (
