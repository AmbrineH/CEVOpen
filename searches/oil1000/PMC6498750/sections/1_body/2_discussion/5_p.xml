<p class="p">The specificity of acyl-ACP thioesterases play an important role in determining the fatty acid composition of plant oils (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salas and Ohlrogge 2002)</xref>. The relative activities of the acyl-ACP thioesterases and acyl-ACP desaturases are responsible for the export of a variety of FAs exported from the plastid, including saturated, mono- and poly-unsaturated FAs (

 <italic class="italic">FATA</italic>s from coconut palm are first described, showing that 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATA</italic> overexpression resulted in a TAG profile predominantly composed of saturated FAs (60%) compared to a more unsaturated TAG profile in the p19+
 <italic class="italic">AtWRI1</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic> control (40%). This indicates that the increased flow of saturated FAs are efficiently utilized for TAG assembly, assisted by the additional pull capability created by 
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic> overexpression (
