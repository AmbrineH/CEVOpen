<p class="p">With the high abundance of C18:3 in the fatty acid profile of the 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> leaves, it was reasoned that the major metabolic pathway in these leaves for TAG production is the PC-DAG pathway. In this study, the first 
 <italic class="italic">PDAT</italic> from coconut palm was identified and investigated for functionality. It was demonstrated that TAG accumulation can be increased by the overexpression of 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT. It was also previously hypothesized that the expression of a substrate-specific PDAT may assist in the recovery of the chlorotic phenotype observed following the build-up of MCFA-containing PC lipids associated with the expression of

 <italic class="italic">CnLPAAT</italic> (

 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>PDAT was able to recover the chlorotic phenotype previously observed (data not shown). However, in the 
 <italic class="italic">PDAT</italic> context of this study, there is still C12:0 in phospholipids as the MCFA-containing PC lipids are being used as a substrate by PDAT for TAG assembly.
