<p class="p">For the first time, this study identified and confirmed functionality for a 
 <italic class="italic">DGAT1</italic> from coconut palm. The transient 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> assay demonstrated that the 
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>DGAT1 outperformed the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1v1 in respect to ability to increase TAG and TFA contents. It was also observed in the yeast complementation assay that the positive control (
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic>) had a much faster growth rate compared to 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic>_V1. The reduced growth rate of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic>_V1 may be attributed to its reduced capacity of utilizing C18:1 for TAG assembly, evident by the lower C18:1 content (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01) in 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> leaves compared to 
 <italic class="italic">AtDGAT1</italic>. Both of these results could be explained by the differences in substrate specificities, and hence the 
 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1v1 may require an increased flux of MCFA in order to perform optimally (

 <italic class="italic">Cn</italic>DGAT1 would exhibit a preference for MCFA based on the high MCFA content of coconut oil (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcy247-B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Laureles et�al. 2002</xref>). The fatty acid substrate specificity of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> was investigated through utilization of the transient 
 <italic class="italic">N.benthamiana</italic> infiltration assay. TAG fatty acid compositions were examined following the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> with and without the co-expression of different class B acyl-ACP thioesterases. In combinations involving 
 <italic class="italic">CnFATB3</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic> expression, significant increases in TAG content and MCFA incorporation were observed following the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic>. Fatty acid substrate preference of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> was determined on significant increases in fatty acid composition increase and hence described as C12:0 &gt; C14:0 &gt; C16:0. This fatty acid substrate preference could be validated through the preparation of microsomes from a transformed yeast mutant strain H1246 expressing the 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic>, followed by subsequent radiolabeled feeding of DAG and different non-labelled acyl-CoAs. This would allow accurate quantification of fatty acid utilization and hence preference of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> for TAG production (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhou et�al. 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcy247-B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et�al. 2015</xref>). This system can be used to reveal the biochemistry of TAG assembly in coconut endosperm. Investigating the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">CnDGAT1</italic> to efficiently utilize C8:0 or C10:0 acyl-CoAs for TAG assembly may reveal that other DGATs are important in determining the composition of coconut oil.
