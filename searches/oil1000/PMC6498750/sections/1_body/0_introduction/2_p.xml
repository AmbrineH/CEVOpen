<p class="p">The unique composition of coconut oil raises interest in understanding how the coconut palm produces oil of a high saturated MCFA content, and if such an oil profile could be replicated in another species via biotechnology interventions. To date, there has been limited success in a variety of species. In transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic> (canola) seeds, high lauric acid content has been achieved to a peak of 67% (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dehesh et�al. 1996)</xref> with the co-expression of a class B fatty acid thioesterase (
 <italic class="italic">FATB</italic>) from 
 <italic class="italic">Umbellularia californica</italic> (California bay laurel; 
 <italic class="italic">UcFATB</italic>) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase from coconut palm (
 <italic class="italic">CnLPAAT</italic>). More recently, transcriptomic analyses have enabled the identification of 
 <italic class="italic">FATB</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LPAAT</italic> genes from many 
 <italic class="italic">Cuphea</italic> species (cigar plant), which have been used to both modify the fatty acid profiles and improve the incorporation of MCFA into the triacylglycerol (TAG), respectively, of transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Camelina sativa</italic> seeds (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim et�al. 2015b</xref>). However, during seed development the laurate content in phosphatidylcholine (PC) increases, suggesting that there is a bottleneck in the efficient utilization of lauric acid during oil synthesis. This concept has also been demonstrated in attempts to accumulate unusual fatty acids in the seed oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bates and Browse 2011)</xref>. In the high-laurate canola lines, laurate levels in PC remained high (up to 26%) until the late stages of TAG deposition (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wiberg et�al. 1997)</xref>. The subsequent work from 
 <xref rid="pcy247-B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knutzon et�al. (1999)</xref> showed that the addition of the 
 <italic class="italic">LPAAT</italic> from coconut (
 <italic class="italic">CnLPAAT</italic>), although specific for the acylation of laurate to the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), did not reduce the flux of laurate into PC. We hypothesize that the MCFA content of transgenic oils may be influenced through the specificity and activity of biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, better manipulation of fatty acid and oil biosynthesis pathways will be essential for improving the performance of MCFA accumulation in transgenic oils. The discovery of genes involved in the assembly of MCFA-enriched oils is an important step forward in achieving this. However, such efforts have been hindered by the limited genomic resources available.
