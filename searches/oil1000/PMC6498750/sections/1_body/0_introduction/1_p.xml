 <italic class="italic">Cocos nucifera</italic> (coconut palm) is a member of the Arecaceae family, being widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions as an economically important plant, accounting for 1.8% of the global vegetable oil market with production of 3.2 million metric tonnes per year (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B152" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">OECD 2017)</xref>. The coconut palm is well known for its ability to accumulate and store large amounts of oil, approximately 65% of the seed weight (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar 2011</xref>). In physiochemical terms, coconut oil varies significantly from other vegetable oils as it is rich in saturated fatty acids (93%) with 85% of these being medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; C8–C16), predominantly lauric (C12:0) and myristic (C14:0) acids. Oils that are rich in lauric acid exhibit characteristics that are important for application within both the food and chemical industries including increased oxidative stability, low melting points and the ability to produce stable emulsions (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar 2011)</xref>. Currently, lauric oils are used in the manufacture of soaps, detergents, textiles, paints, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and are also used within the food industry (

 <italic class="italic">Elaeis guineensis</italic> (African oil palm), both being limited to growth in tropical and subtropical climates. The large investment required and the long wait before the palms yield a return of profit is discouraging the establishment of new plantations (
