<p class="p">Recent gene discovery studies of coconut palm have focused on identifying genes involved in yield, with transcriptomes built using material from leaves and mature fruits (H.

 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome from developing coconut endosperm. This transcriptome was utilized to identify and isolate genes involved in the synthesis of lipids, particularly TAG. It was hypothesized that some of these genes may exhibit a strong substrate preference for MCFA, and so could be used for the future development of vegetable oils with an enriched MCFA content. Of particular interest are thioesterases, acyltransferases and oleosins (
