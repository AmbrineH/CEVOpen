<p class="p">In prospect of improving the MCFA content of oils the identification of genes involved in TAG assembly were of particular interest, specifically MCFA-specific acyltransferases. Although

 <xref rid="pcy247-B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim et�al. 2015b</xref>) have previously been identified and characterized, other MCFA-specific acyltransferases remain unknown. The 
 <italic class="italic">AtGPAT9</italic> (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) was recently identified and was demonstrated to have functions in both initiating TAG assembly through the mediation of 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 esterification and increasing TAG content (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singer et�al. 2016)</xref>. The final step of TAG assembly through the Kennedy pathway involves the esterification of a third fatty acid to the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 position of G3P, which is performed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (
 <italic class="italic">DGAT</italic>).

 <italic class="italic">DGAT</italic> gene from 
 <italic class="italic">Cuphea avigera</italic> var 
 <italic class="italic">pulcherrima</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CpuDGAT1</italic>, which was combined with the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">CvFatB1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CvLPAT2</italic> to achieve high levels of C10:0 incorporation in the oils of transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">C.sativa</italic> seeds (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iskandarov et�al. 2017)</xref>. Another acyltransferase that contributes to TAG synthesis is phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (
 <italic class="italic">PDAT</italic>), which uses DAG as the substrate and PC as the fatty acid donor for TAG production (
 <xref rid="pcy247-B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dahlqvist et�al. 2000)</xref>. Thus the involvement of acyltransferases in both the efficient production of oil and the tailoring of fatty acid composition makes these important targets for the improvement of MCFA oils.
