 <italic class="italic">Oleosins</italic> have also become an attractive target of metabolic engineering in the production of stable oils in transgenic plants, particularly for non-seed platforms for the production of oil (

 <xref rid="pcy247-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maurer et�al. 2013)</xref>. Oleosin proteins contain a hydrophilic N-terminus, a central hydrophobic stretch of 72 residues and a hydrophilic C-terminus. The central stretch of 72 hydrophobic residues is the hallmark of oleosins as no other protein contains such a long hydrophobic stretch. Another key feature of an oleosin protein is the formation of the proline-knot in the center of the long hydrophobic region that forms via the interaction of one serine and three proline amino acid residues (
