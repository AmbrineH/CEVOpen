 <p> GC-MS chromatogram of headspace of the desorption (60Â°C) from dead flies previously fumigated with (A) ( R)-pulegone/citronellal (70:30) and (B) ( R)-pulegone/citronellal (30:70). Linear retention index (RI) and retention index (RI lit) taken from literature ( Adams, 2007) were as follows: menthofuran 1160 and 1164; citronellol 1221 and 1226; ( R)-pulegone 1232 and 1237; citronellic acid 1315 and 1312, respectively. </p>
