<p class="p">Most studies on the toxicity of terpene mixtures, following the classical model, tend to combine the most active terpene in 50:50 proportion (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hummelbrunner and Isman, 2001</xref>), or mix them in their LC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> to demonstrate synergism (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kanda et al., 2017</xref>). However, if the minor terpene were to act with an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO (=A), more interesting results could be obtained by testing different proportions in order to allow a major terpene to be a target of the metabolic process, while a minor terpene intoxicates the insect (metabolic model). The lists of best possible combinations arising from these two approaches differ appreciably (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with only one combination [(
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone/1,8-cineole] being common to both lists.
