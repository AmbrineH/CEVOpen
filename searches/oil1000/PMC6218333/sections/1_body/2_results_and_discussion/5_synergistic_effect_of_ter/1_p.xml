<p class="p">Our third case of study, the mixture of (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone and citronellal, showed quite different results from those predicted by MM (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>), with observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values being markedly lower than expected. Moreover, CI values were quite far below one, suggesting a real synergism between these two terpenes, which was supported also by the isobolograms (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Therefore, we used a convenient tool for the study of synergism by calculating the DRI (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chou, 2006</xref>), that estimated how much the dose of each compound in the synergistic combination may be reduced compared with the doses of each compound alone. According to DRI values, the (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone/citronellal combination allowed for a reduction of up to 8 times the dose of (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone and up to 10 times the dose of citronellal, thus showing high effectiveness and strong synergic interaction for this combination, possibly at the site of action (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>).
