<p class="p">The combinations of linalool and citronellal assayed against 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> produced observed-LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values very close to those predicted from MM (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Moreover, the CI values obtained for these combinations were close to one (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>), suggesting an additive interaction and supporting our hypothesis that the major component represented the target of the oxidative system while the minor terpene was less or not detoxified. These and the above results allow us to postulate that not all mixtures that are considered synergistic in the literature are necessarily so, but might actually turn out to be additive, if the MM is considered.
