<p class="p">When we assayed some of the best combinations predicted by the MM (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and compared the observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> with values predicted by each model, we found that MM showed a better fit to observed values than CM. In fact, the observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were always lower than those predicted by CM, but were quite similar to those calculated following MM (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>: entries 4, 5, 6), thus suggesting additive effects between the terpenes if the metabolic contribution is discounted. However, observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for the mixtures with (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>: entries 1, 2, 3) were lower even than predictions from MM. So, we further explored both types of situation by testing mixtures with a variety of proportions, as discussed below.
