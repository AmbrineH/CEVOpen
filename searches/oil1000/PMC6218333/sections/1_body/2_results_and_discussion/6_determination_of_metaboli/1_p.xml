<p class="p">Due to the low LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values observed for the (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone/citronellal mixture, the metabolic contribution to such values could not be inferred from their comparison. To deal with this problem, we explored the metabolic response of 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> to these mixtures at molecular level. It is known that flies fumigated with (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone transform this compound into menthofuran (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rossi et al., 2012</xref>), but the metabolic product of citronellal was not known. Therefore, we first studied the metabolism of citronellal and determined that this terpene is converted to citronellic acid. Then, we determined the metabolites of a mixture dominated by (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone [i.e., (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone/citronellal 70:30], which yielded menthofuran but no detectable citronellic acid (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>), whereas in a citronellal rich mixture [i.e., (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone/citronellal 30:70], we detected citronellic acid and citronellol but not menthofuran (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). These results confirm our interpretation that the major terpene in a mixture is preferentially metabolized by the fly, while the minority component is not usually dealt with.
