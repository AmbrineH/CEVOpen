<p class="p">The LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the studied terpenes on 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> adults, with and without previous topication with PBO (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), show that nearly all of the assayed terpenes were more toxic (lower LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO) when P450 were inhibited, suggesting that they are actually detoxified by this oxidant complex. Only (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone was less toxic when the detoxificant mechanism was inhibited, which reflects the high toxicity of the oxidized (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone metabolite, menthofuran, to 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> adults (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rossi et al., 2012</xref>). The largest LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO ratio was observed for linalool and citronellal, which became highly toxic for this insect under P450 inhibition, despite being some of the least effective terpenes in normal conditions, thus suggesting a very efficient fly detoxification for these compounds. Both compounds have easily oxidizable functional groups, which crucially allow the necessary structural changes for easier detoxification of these substances.
