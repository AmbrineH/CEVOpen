<p class="p">The bioassay against 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> was performed as previously reported (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Palacios et al., 2009a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). Briefly, ten 4–5-day-old adult houseflies, both sexes, were placed in a glass jar (1.2 L) fitted with a screw cap which held a 7-cm length of cotton yarn suspended from the center of its inner surface. Dosages of a given terpene or a mixture of two terpenes (dissolved in 20 μL acetone) were applied to the yarn. The jars were sealed tightly and kept in a room at 26 ± 1°C for 30 min. Each test was replicated three times. The control vessel had only acetone on the cotton yarn. Mortality in each group was assessed after 30 min of exposure by softly stimulating each fly with the tip of a pen. Flies that did not respond were considered dead. The mortality thus determined was used to calculate the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the corresponding compound. Mixtures were prepared from pure terpene in the desired proportions, dissolved in acetone, and assayed as described above.
