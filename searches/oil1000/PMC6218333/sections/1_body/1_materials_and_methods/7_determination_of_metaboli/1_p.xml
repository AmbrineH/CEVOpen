<p class="p">After a fumigation bioassay with citronellal (with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 50), the dead flies (∼250 mg) were collected in a vial (10 mL volume) with a septum. The vial was then placed in a bath at 60°C for 15 min. The terpenes desorbed from the 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> to the headspace of the vial were captured using a SPME microfiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, United States; with polydimethylsiloxane, thickness 30 μm, length 1 cm). The microfiber was injected in a Perkin-Elmer Clarus 600 gas chromatograph coupled with an ion trap mass detector (GC-MS) for terpene and metabolite identification. An ELITE 5-ms capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 mm coating thickness) was used for the separation of components. The chromatographic conditions were: injector at 200°C; oven temperature programming 80°C (5 min) to 240°C at 5°C/min; constant detector temperature of 240°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas (flow rate 1.5 mL/min). Compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with available libraries (NIST) and confirmed by co-injection of pure standards (Sigma, United States).
