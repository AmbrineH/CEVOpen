 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> originated from adults collected from the experimental farm of the Universidad Católica of Córdoba, in Córdoba, Argentina in February 2016, using a sweep net. The flies were reared in entomological cages (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm), under the following conditions: 26 ± 1°C, 70% humidity and 12:12 light–dark cycle, with a diet of powdered milk and water. A mixture prepared with bran (90 g), baker’s yeast (0.5 g) and milk powder (10 g) provided oviposition sites.
