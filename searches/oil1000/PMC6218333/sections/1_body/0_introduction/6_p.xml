<p class="p">In order to test our model, we used 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> L. (Diptera: Muscidae) as a target insect and a group of 10 terpenes which we previously proved to be effective fumigants against this pest. We determined the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of these terpenes as well as their LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO, which we used as a close estimation of LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = A. Then, we bioassayed mixtures of these terpenes in varying proportions, and the observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were compared with the values predicted for each mixture according to both models.
