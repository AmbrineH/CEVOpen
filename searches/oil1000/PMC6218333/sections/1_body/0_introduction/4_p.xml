<p class="p">The toxicity of a given terpene is usually described in terms of the observed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> which, considering the metabolization discussed above, could actually be conceived as LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = A + B, where A accounts for the dose fraction necessary to reach the action site and produce the effect, and B represents the dose fraction lost by the insect metabolic response. However, the contribution of A and B to each terpeneâ€™s LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value is not known. An approximation can be provided by inhibiting the metabolic pathway, for example using PBO as a P450 inhibitor. In this case, the A-value would approximate what we will call LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO, i.e., the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> observed when applying terpene on insects previously treated with PBO, so that the metabolic response is inhibited and therefore B = 0 (at least for terpenes detoxified by this via).
