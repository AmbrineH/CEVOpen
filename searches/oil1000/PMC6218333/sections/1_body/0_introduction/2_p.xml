<p class="p">The biological activity of essential oils depends not only on their qualitative composition, but also on the quantitative ratio of their components (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pavela, 2008</xref>). These oils have been repeatedly found to be more active, i.e., showing lower lethal concentration (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>), than the most active of their component terpenes. For example, in fumigation experiments, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Minthostachys verticillata</italic> was toxic to 
 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic>, but it took 3.4 times more of its main component, (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone, to obtain the same toxicity (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rossi et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, fumigant thyme oil was 2.7 times more toxic than thymol, its major terpene (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tak et al., 2016</xref>), and lemongrass essential oil showed a lower topical LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> against 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoplusia ni</italic> larvae than its most abundant terpene, citral (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tak et al., 2016</xref>). As yet, there is no conclusive explanation of this discrepancy. Some studies have found synergy between the terpenes that compose an essential oil (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pavela, 2014</xref>), but others have not or have only partially demonstrated synergy (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Passreiter et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tak and Isman, 2016</xref>). Recent studies have also shown that enhanced penetration of a given terpene by the presence of another less toxic terpene may result in a synergic combination (
