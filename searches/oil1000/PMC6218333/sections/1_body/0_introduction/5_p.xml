 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = A + B will be composed mostly of portion A, as this terpene is not or hardly detoxified (B â‰ˆ 0). With this idea in mind, we propose a novel way of analysis for the study of synergistic effects of terpenes on insects, which incorporates the insect metabolic response. In what we have called the Metabolic Model (MM), the major terpene in a mixture is expected to intoxicate the target insect with a typical LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = A + B) whereas the minority terpene would do the same with an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = A). Instead, the classical approach (which we have called Classical Model, CM) expects toxicity of a given terpene to be represented by its LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>.
