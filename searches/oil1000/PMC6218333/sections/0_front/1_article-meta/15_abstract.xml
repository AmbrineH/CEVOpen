 <p class="p">Essential oils, which are mixtures of terpenes, frequently show stronger insecticide activity, i.e., lower lethal dose 50 (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>), than their most abundant terpenes. Synergy between terpenes provides a plausible explanation, but its demonstration has been elusive. In the present work, we look for an alternative explanation, by considering the influence of insect metabolic detoxification. Basically, we propose a model (metabolic model, MM) in which the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the major terpene in a mixture is expected to include a fraction that is detoxified by the insect, whereas a minor terpene would act unimpeded, showing a lower LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> than when acting alone. In order to test this idea, we analyzed the effects of inhibiting the cytochrome P450 detoxification system with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), on the lethal concentration of terpenes as fumigants against 
  <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic>. We found that, within a group of 10 terpenes [linalool, citronellal, (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, γ-terpinene, limonene, α-terpinene, (
  <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-β-pinene, thymol and (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone], seven showed the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO (the lethal concentration for PBO-treated flies) between 1.7 and 12.4 times lower than the corresponding LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> when P450 was not inhibited. Only in one case, that of (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone, was the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO greater than the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>, while two terpenes [(
  <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-β-pinene and thymol] showed no changes in toxicity. The increased activity of most terpenes (particularly linalool and citronellal) in PBO-treated flies supports our hypothesis that normally the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> includes a fraction of inactive compound, due to detoxification. Having previously determined that 
  <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> preferentially oxidizes the most abundant terpene in a mixture, while terpenes in smaller proportions are poorly or not detoxified by the P450 system, we assessed whether the toxicity of minority terpenes in a mixture is similar to their activity under P450 inhibition. We chose suitable binary combinations in such a way that one terpene (in greater proportion) should be the target of P450 while the other (in smaller proportion) should intoxicate the fly with LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO or similar. Combinations of 1,8-cineole-citronellal, 1,8-cineole-linalool, linalool-citronellal, (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone-linalool, (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone-1,8-cineole and (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone-citronellal were assayed against 
  <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>, and the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of each mixture was determined and compared to values predicted by MM (considering the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>PBO for minor component) or by the classical approach (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> for both components). The MM showed the best fit to the data, suggesting additive rather than synergistic effects, except for the combination of (
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pulegone-citronellal that was clearly synergistic. Thus, the experimental data indicate that the insect preferentially oxidizes the major component in a mixture, while the terpene in lesser proportion acts as a toxicant, with higher toxicity than when it was assayed alone. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the higher toxicity of essential oils compared to their component terpenes and provide important information for the design of effective insecticides based on essential oils or terpenes.
