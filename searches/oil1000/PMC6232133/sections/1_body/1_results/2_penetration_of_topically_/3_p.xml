<p id="Par15" class="p">The ToF-SIMS analysis was performed by acquiring data from numerous analysis areas covering most of the skin thickness of each cross section, from SC to the border to the hypodermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b–d</xref>). Carvacrol was monitored by the molecular peak, (M-H)
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, in negative ion mode at m/z 149.10. The results show a low but significant carvacrol signal throughout the entire cross section (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). No accumulation was observed at the skin surface, indicating a relatively fast penetration of EO through the skin surface, in agreement with the GC-MS results.
