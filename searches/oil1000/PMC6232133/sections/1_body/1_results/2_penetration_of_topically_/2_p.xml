<p id="Par14" class="p">The GC-MS analysis showed that most of the detected carvacrol was found in dermis, whereas only small amounts were detected in SC and viable epidermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Significant amounts were detected in the receptor fluid of the Franz cell, indicating that some carvacrol penetrated through the entire thickness of the skin sample. Furthermore, only 25–30% of the applied carvacrol was accounted for by the detected quantities. Despite occlusion of the donor compartment with aluminium foil during exposure, most of the applied carvacrol was thus evaporated from the skin surface during application and analysis, due to its high volatility.
