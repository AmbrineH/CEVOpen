<p id="Par16" class="p">For some samples, very strong carvacrol signals were observed at certain structures in the deeper parts of dermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). Comparing the carvacrol distribution with other ion images revealed that these carvacrol-rich structures are closely correlated with structures of high signal intensities from DAG ions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>), suggesting a preferential location of carvacrol to fat-rich structures in dermis. The appearance, location and high triglyceride content of these structures indicate that they correspond to adipocytes, possibly associated with the secretory coil of an eccrine sweat gland. However, although SEM images of the same area indicate the presence of a hair follicle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> arrow, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), the association of the fat-rich structures to a sebaceous gland is less likely, due to the expected location of sebaceous glands to the upper parts of dermis.
