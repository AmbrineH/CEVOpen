<p id="Par10" class="p">Analyses focusing on the epidermis region of the skin cross section confirm the exclusive localization of the C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids to SC and cholesterol sulfate mainly to the epidermal region just below SC, i.e. the viable epidermis (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Furthermore, negative ion mass spectra generated exclusively from specific regions of the cross section, corresponding approximately to SC, viable epidermis and dermis, respectively (indicated in the total ion image of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), demonstrate a very different lipid composition of SC compared to the other two skin regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). In the mass range m/z 650–750, a number of peaks are observed in the SC spectrum that can be identified as molecular ions of some of the most abundant ceramides in SC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. The different subclasses of ceramides in SC are characterized by 4 different types of sphingoid bases and 3 variants of the fatty acid groups, involving hydroxylation or esterification

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,

 </sup>, adding up to 12 different combinations that make up the different subclasses of the SC ceramides. The most abundant of these subclasses are NP, NH, AP and AH, where N and A refers to non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated fatty acid groups, respectively, and P and H refers to two different sphingoid bases, phytosphingosine and 4-hydroxysphingosine, respectively. Furthermore, the most abundant fatty acid chain lengths have been reported to be C24 and C26, with only small contributions from C16 and C18

 </sup>, and C18 being the most abundant chain length of the sphingoid base

 </sup>. The peaks observed in the SC mass spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) are consistent with NP, NH, AP and AH ceramides, each with added chain lengths of the acyl group and sphingosine base of C42, C44 and C46, e.g., corresponding to C18:0 in the sphingosine base and C24:0, C26:0 and C28:0 in the fatty acyl chain. However, since the P and H sphingosine base groups only differs stoichiometrically by one double bond, it is not possible to distinguish NH (or AH) with saturated carbon chains from NP (or AP) with one double bond in the carbon chains.
