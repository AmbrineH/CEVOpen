<p id="Par9" class="p">In addition to the compounds mainly observed in dermis, several lipids were found with strong localisation to the upper part of the skin cross section, i.e., epidermis, such as the saturated long-chain fatty acids (C24:0 and C26:0) and cholesterol sulfate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Whereas cholesterol sulfate shows appreciable signal in the upper ≈200 µm of the cross section, the C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids are present only at the very top edge, consistent with the known localization of these fatty acids to SC.
