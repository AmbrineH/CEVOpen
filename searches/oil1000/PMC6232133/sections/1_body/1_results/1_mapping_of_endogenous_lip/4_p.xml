<p id="Par11" class="p">In the lower mass range, m/z 320–430, the negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra reveal the presence of several long-chain fatty acids in SC, from C21:0 to C28:0 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The most abundant ones are C24:0 and C26:0, in agreement with previous studies

 </sup>, but interestingly, significant signal is observed for all chain lengths between C21 and C28, including those with odd numbers of carbon atoms, i.e., C21:0, C23:0, C25:0 and C27:0, consistent with previous observations of odd carbon fatty acyl chains in human SC ceramides

 </sup>. It should be emphasized that both free fatty acids and fatty acids bound to lipids (including ceramides) are expected to contribute to the ToF-SIMS signal.
