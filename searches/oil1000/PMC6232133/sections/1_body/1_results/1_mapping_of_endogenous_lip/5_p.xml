<p id="Par12" class="p">The localizations of the SC lipid components in the skin cross section are further investigated in ToF-SIMS images obtained with the instrument optimized for high lateral resolution in combination with SEM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The ToF-SIMS images and the overlay with the SEM image clearly shows that the long-chain fatty acids (C24:0 + C26:0) are exclusively located to the layered structures in the SEM image that correspond to SC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and that cholesterol sulfate is mainly located to the region just below SC, corresponding to the viable epidermis, in good agreement with previous reports

 </sup>. The PE fragment signal shows an increasing intensity towards the deeper layers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref>), consistent with the interpretation that these ions represent phospholipids, which are mainly present in viable cell membranes. Additional ion images show clear localization to SC of the molecular ceramide peaks listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and the odd carbon fatty acids (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Cholesterol shows some localization to SC, although the signal is appreciable over the entire cross section area, consistent with its known presence in SC but also in the viable cell membranes. An interesting ion image was obtained for the phosphate ion, PO

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The origin of these aggregates is, however, unknown. Chlorine ions display an enhanced signal from the entire epidermis, including SC, and considerably lower signal in dermis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>).
