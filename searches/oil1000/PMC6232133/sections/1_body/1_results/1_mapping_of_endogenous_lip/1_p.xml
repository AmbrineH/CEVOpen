<p id="Par8" class="p">The distribution of endogenous lipids within different skin layers was mapped at various length scales across the skin cross sections. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> displays ToF-SIMS data from an analysis covering the entire thickness of the skin, from the SC at the top to hypodermis at the lower edge of the cross section. The mass spectra show peaks from a range of specific lipids that are frequently observed also in other types of tissue, including phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA)), cholesterol and diacylglycerols (DAG), see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–b</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The phospholipids are all relatively homogeneously distributed over the entire cross section, suggesting that these lipids represent cell membrane components throughout dermis and viable epidermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Cholesterol (not shown) and typical protein fragments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) are also homogeneously distributed across the skin cross section, suggesting the same origin, although the protein signals may also be generated from collagen fibers, which could be observed by SEM throughout dermis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The DAG ions are assumed to represent triacylglycerol (TAG), since it is known that TAG is effectively fragmented in ToF-SIMS, producing mainly DAG ions and only low yields of intact TAG ions

 </sup>. The DAG image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) shows strong localization to three parts of the skin cross section; (i) the upper edge of the cross section (at the skin surface), (ii) the bottom edge of the cross section (border to the hypodermis) and (iii) specific structures deep into dermis (further discussed in the next section). The fatty acid ions C16 and C18 (16 and 18 carbon atoms, respectively) are primarily fragments of phospholipids and TAG and should not be considered to represent free fatty acids.
