<p id="Par18" class="p">The penetration of ceramide into human skin was also investigated by mapping the ceramide distribution in skin cross sections using ToF-SIMS. The exogenous ceramide in the topical formulation was distinguished from the endogenous ceramides in SC by their molecular weights. Whereas the ceramide contained in the topical formulation was CerNS18, with a molecular weight of 565 Da, the endogenous SC ceramides are in the 650–750 Da mass range (as demonstrated above), thus, allowing for unambiguous and independent detection of the two types of ceramides, given that they are monitored using the intact, or nearly intact, molecular ions.</p>
