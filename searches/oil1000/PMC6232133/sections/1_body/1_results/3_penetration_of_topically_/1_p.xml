<p id="Par17" class="p">As for oregano essential oil (EO), the distribution of an exogenous ceramide (CerNS18 or Cer(d18:1/18:0)) was measured both by ToF-SIMS and cutaneous absorption analysis (now LC-MS), after topical application using a Franz cell. Using a validated LC-MS-MS method, the exogenous ceramide was mostly found in SC and in epidermis, with lower amounts detected in dermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Ceramide was undetected in the receptor fluid. This distribution profile is consistent with the lipophilic properties of ceramide, which causes this chemical to be retained in the upper layer of the skin.
