<p id="Par22" class="p">SEM analysis of the same area, and an overlay of the SEM and ToF-SIMS images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b,c</xref>), provide additional information about the location of the exogenous ceramide. The SEM image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>) shows that the analysis area corresponds to a skin cross section region where SC has been folded into the skin in a wrinkle structure and that the SC regions exposed for analysis display various characteristics: whereas parts of the exposed SC correspond to the characteristic layered structure of the SC cross section, a relatively large region appears to be a flattened part of the top SC surface. Furthermore, the ToF-SIMS overlay with the SEM image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>) shows that the exogenous ceramide is mainly located to the SC region corresponding to the top SC surface, whereas the endogenous SC lipids are located mainly to the layered cross section region of SC, although both the exogenous and endogenous components produce significant signals in both regions. The observation that the exogeneous ceramide is mainly located to the top SC surface and thus not homogeneously distributed in SC indicates that ceramide does not easily penetrate into SC. Additional ToF-SIMS/SEM overlay images supporting this conclusion is provided in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>. These results are in good agreement with previous studies showing that the penetration of topically applied ceramides is limited to the superficial layers of SC, except in the presence of penetration enhancers or for very short carbon chains in the fatty acyl groups
