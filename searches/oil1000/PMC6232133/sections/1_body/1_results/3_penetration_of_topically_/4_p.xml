<p id="Par20" class="p">In the negative ion mode, exogenous ceramide was detected by the deprotonated molecular ion (m/z 564.50), which is also the dominating peak in the ceramide reference spectrum in this mass range (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Also in this case, the exogenous ceramide signal was exclusively located to SC, and the untreated skin sample showed no significant signal at this peak.
