<p id="Par21" class="p">The spatial distribution of the exogenous ceramide was investigated at high image resolution, in order to allow for detailed comparison with the distributions of the endogenous SC lipids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref> shows three sets of ion images, in which each row includes images that represent (from left) molecular components of the viable epidermis, exogenous ceramide, endogenous SC lipids, and a 3-colour overlay image of these three images, respectively. Detailed inspection of the images shows that the three images representing SC lipids (cholesterol, ceramides and C24:0 + C26:0 fatty acids, respectively) share a similar lateral distribution. Furthermore, the three images representing exogenous ceramide also display similar distributions. However, there is a small but consistent difference between the distributions of the exogenous ceramide and the SC lipids, in that most of the exogenous ceramide appears to be located slightly closer to the skin surface, whereas the signal at the deeper parts of SC are considerably lower (particularly evident in the 3-colour overlay images of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). The different distributions of the exogenous ceramide and the SC lipids (green) thus indicate that the exogenous ceramide is not homogeneously distributed in SC, but rather exhibits a gradient with lower concentrations towards the bottom layers of SC.
