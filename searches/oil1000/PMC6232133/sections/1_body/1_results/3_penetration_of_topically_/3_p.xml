<p id="Par19" class="p">The ToF-SIMS data from the skin cross sections revealed a clear localization of the exogenous ceramide to SC, but no ceramide could be detected at the deeper layers. It was further observed that CerNS18 was preferentially detected in locations corresponding to furrows in the skin, where SC bends slightly into the deeper layers of epidermis (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, Supplementary Figs

 </sup>. In the positive ion mode (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b,c</xref>), the exogenous ceramide was detected not only by the protonated molecular ion (m/z 566.56), which is the main peak of the pure ceramide reference spectrum in the mass range of the intact ceramide molecule, but also by two peaks at m/z 588.53 and 562.52, which can be assigned to sodium complexes of the intact ceramide molecule and of the ceramide molecule after loss of a minor fragment, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). The latter assignment is motivated by the presence of the corresponding protonated ion at m/z 540.56 in, both, the skin cross section and ceramide reference spectra. The assignment of all these peaks to the exogenous ceramide is confirmed by their absence in spectra of the SC region in cross section samples of skin that has not been treated with the ceramide-containing formulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). In addition, the endogenous SC ceramides could be detected with relatively strong signal and clear localization to SC by their sodium molecular complex ions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), thus allowing for comparison of the endogenous ceramide composition (and distribution) in the treated skin sample with that of the untreated skin. In the present case, however, no significant difference could be observed between the untreated and ceramide-treated skin samples with respect to the relative peak intensities of the endogenous ceramides (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>).
