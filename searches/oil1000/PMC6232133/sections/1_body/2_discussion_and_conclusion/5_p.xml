<p id="Par27" class="p">An important advantage of the presented approach using skin cross sections is the possibility to access the entire depth of the skin for detailed analysis of specific structures, and the clarity of the results that this provides with respect to the identity and location of specific molecular species in the skin. However, an important disadvantage is that only skin explants can be analysed, as opposed to fresh or viable skin. Also, the preparation of the cross-section samples is critical and can be problematic, especially considering that embedding of the skin sample should be avoided due to the added data complexity related to the strong organic signals generated by the embedding medium and the compromising effect that the embedding process may have on the lipid localisation. A final disadvantage of using cross section samples is that the sensitivity is probably lower than that of direct analysis of the skin surface, e.g., through analysis of successive tape strips

 </sup>. However, it is likely that the sensitivity can be improved for the analysis of cross sections by the use of argon cluster ion sputtering, which would increase the sample volume (i.e., depth) available for analysis.
