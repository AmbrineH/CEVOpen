<p id="Par41" class="p">The analytical column used was a HP1 MS (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (0.2 mm × 50 m × 0.33 µm). The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.28 ml/min. The initial column temperature of 80 °C increases to 260 °C within 12 min and then held for 5 min. Injections (5 µl) were made in a split mode with ratio 20. Injection temperature was set at 250 °C. Ionization mode used was Electron Impact. Single Ion Monitoring (SIM) was used for quantification with ion at m/z 135. Ion at m/z 150 and m/z 91 were used for confirmation.</p>
