<p id="Par45" class="p">The analytical column used was a Luna C8 from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) (30 × 2.1 mm, 5 µm) and analysis were carried out with a gradient elution with mobile phases of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (A) and MeOH (B). The column temperature was fixed at 50 °C, the volume of the injection was 10 µl and the flow rate at 0.8 ml/min. Ionization mode used was APCI positive. Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) was used for detection with the following transition 566.6 → 266.4.</p>
