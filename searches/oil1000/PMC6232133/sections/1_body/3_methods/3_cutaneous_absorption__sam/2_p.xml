<p id="Par38" class="p">The specificity of the analytical method was controlled for each blank matrix (e.g. strips, viable epidermis, dermis and receptor fluid). Linearity was determined between the LLOQ and ULOQ ng/ml, with an accuracy below ± 15%, except at the LLOQ, which was below ± 20%. Accuracy and precision was determined at least at two QC theoretical concentrations: low and middle. All QCs remained within the acceptance criteria (accuracy% &lt;  ± 15%). QC were used to control matrix effect and recovery extraction.</p>
