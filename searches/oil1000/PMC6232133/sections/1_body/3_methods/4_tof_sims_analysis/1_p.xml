<p id="Par47" class="p">The skin cross section samples were prepared at Histocenter AB (Västra Frölunda, Sweden) by cutting ca 10 µm thick slices of the skin samples (without embedding medium) using a cryosectioning device at −20 °C, placing them on a slightly warmed-up silicon substrate (for attachment) and then quickly freezing the substrate again to −20 °C. After cryosectioning, the cross section samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis (&lt;10 days).</p>
