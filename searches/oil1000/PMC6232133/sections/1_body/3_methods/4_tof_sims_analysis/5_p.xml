<p id="Par51" class="p">The full thickness of the skin was analysed for all samples, in most cases using the so called macro raster utility of the instrument (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Data from relevant parts of the skin cross section were then acquired in several analysis areas (10–15) with the instrument in the high mass resolution mode (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The analysis of ceramide penetration was thus focused on the epidermis region, whereas carvacrol penetration was studied across the entire depth of the skin. Finally, specific areas of interest were analysed at higher magnifications with the instrument optimized for high image resolution (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
