<p id="Par50" class="p">The ToF-SIMS analyses were conducted under static SIMS conditions in a TOFSIMS IV instrument (IONTOF GmbH, Münster, Germany), using 25 keV Bi
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> primary ions and low-energy electron flooding for charge compensation. Positive and negative ion data were acquired with the instrument optimized for high mass resolution (m/Δm ≈ 3000–6000, lateral resolution ≈ 3–5 µm) or for high lateral resolution (m/Δm ≈ 300, lateral resolution ≈ 500 nm). The identification of lipids in the acquired mass spectra were based on agreement between theoretical mass and observed peak positions in spectra obtained at high mass resolution (see Table
