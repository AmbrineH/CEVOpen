<p id="Par48" class="p">The ToF-SIMS analyses were conducted at a sample temperature of −80 °C, except for the samples used for investigation of ceramide penetration, which were analyzed at room temperature. For analysis at −80 °C, the frozen cross section samples were mounted on the precooled sample holder inside a container partly filled with liquid nitrogen. The sample holder was then quickly transferred to the vacuum chamber of the ToF-SIMS instrument, equipped with liquid nitrogen cooling and temperature control facilities, making sure that the sample temperature never increased above −80 °C prior to ToF-SIMS analysis. The samples for analysis at room temperature were quickly thawed in a dry atmosphere before they were mounted on the sample holder and transferred to the ToF-SIMS instrument. The oregano essential oil reference sample was analyzed at −80 °C after deposition on a silicon substrate and immediate cooling by liquid nitrogen. The ceramide reference sample was analyzed at room temperature after deposition/drying of the solution on a silicon substrate.</p>
