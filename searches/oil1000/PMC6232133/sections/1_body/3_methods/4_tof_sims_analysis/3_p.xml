 </sup>. Each measurement normally involves scanning the primary ion beam over a selected analysis area and acquiring mass spectrometry data from each pixel within the analysed area. The acquired data can be displayed as mass spectra of the entire analysis area or of selected regions of interest (ROI) within the analysis area, or as ion images showing the signal intensity distribution of selected ions over the analysis area. Absolute quantification of analyte concentrations is difficult in ToF-SIMS because the measured secondary ion yields depend not only on analyte concentration but also on other factors, such as matrix effects (and internal calibration is usually not possible). In contrast, relative concentrations, comparing analyte abundances between samples or in different regions of a sample, is normally reliable if proper consideration to possible matrix effects is taken.
