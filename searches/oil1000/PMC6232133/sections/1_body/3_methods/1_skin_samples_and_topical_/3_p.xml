<p id="Par30" class="p">Studies on the penetration of carvacrol and ceramide were performed according to OECD guidelines (OECD, 2004b. OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals. Skin absorption: 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> method. 428. Adopted 13 April, 2004). The skin samples were mounted on static Franz cells having 2 cm² exposure areas. The receptor chamber was filled with an aqueous solution of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 0.25% (w/w) Tween 80. This surfactant was added in the receptor fluid (RF) to guarantee sufficient solubility of the studied chemicals in the receptor fluid. A circulating bath was used to maintain a constant temperature of each cell. The RF was stirred during the entire experiment to ensure a good homogeneity. The skin was equilibrated for one hour before formula application to guarantee reproducible skin hydration and skin temperature. The skin temperature was measured using a digital contact probe and remained at 32 ± 1 °C. The skin integrity was checked using trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL, Tewameter TM 300, Monaderm, Monaco) and skin samples having TEWL values higher than 10 g/(cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>h) were rejected. This cut off TEWL value was based on historical data.
