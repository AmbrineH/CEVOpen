 <italic class="italic">ex vivo</italic> human skin samples were frozen at −20 °C and then stored for less than 6 months before preparation for analysis. After thawing, the skin samples were checked visually, where those having stretchmarks, holes, damage, etc. were discarded prior to punching. All skin samples were then gently cleaned with pure water and remaining subcutaneous fat was removed. The thickness of each skin sample was measured using a micrometer and the mean thickness ± sd was determined to 1248 ± 315 µm and 2749 ± 490 for the skin samples used in the ceramide and carvacrol study, respectively. Full thickness 
 <italic class="italic">ex vivo</italic> human skin was used instead of split thickness skin, as split thickness skin is much more difficult to handle and the skin consumption is greater. A list of all samples included in the study, and the analyses conducted on each of them, is provided in Supplementary Table
