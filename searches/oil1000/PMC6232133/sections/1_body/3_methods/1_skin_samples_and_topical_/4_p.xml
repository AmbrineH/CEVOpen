<p id="Par31" class="p">Green Oregano essential oil (EO) and Ceramide were formulated at 1% (w/w) in a gel and at 1% (w/w) in emulsion, respectively, see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> for complete compositions. The formulations were applied homogeneously onto the skin at 5 mg/cm² using a spatula. The spatula was weighed before and after application to determine the exact amount of formulation applied on the skin. For the application of Green Oregano EO, the skin was covered with aluminium foil to limit carvacrol evaporation.
