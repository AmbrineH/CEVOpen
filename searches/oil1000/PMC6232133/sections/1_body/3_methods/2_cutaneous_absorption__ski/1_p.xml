<p id="Par36" class="p">For the cutaneous absorption studies, the washing and receptor fluids were collected for analysis. Tape Stripping was performed using standardized adhesive tapes (D-Squame™, CuDerm Corporation, Dallas, TX, USA). A maximum of 20 strips were performed on each skin sample to remove the major part of SC. Strips were pooled in groups of 10 tapes in a scintillation vial prior to extraction). After tape stripping, viable epidermis was removed from dermis by heating the area of interest for 30 seconds to 1 min with a hair dryer, leading to a temperature of the skin surface of 60 °C measured with an infrared probe. The viable epidermis was then gently removed from dermis. Both viable epidermis and dermis were placed into individual scintillation vials.</p>
