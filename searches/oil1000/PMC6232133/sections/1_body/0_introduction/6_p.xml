<p id="Par7" class="p">In this paper, ToF-SIMS was used to obtain unprecedented molecular imaging data of the major skin lipids together with the distribution of two topically applied exogenous compounds, carvacrol and ceramide. Whereas carvacrol is the main component of oregano and thyme essential oil (and has also been reported to be an efficient penetration enhancer

The ToF-SIMS analysis was combined with cutaneous absorption analysis using GC-MS and LC-MS, to obtain quantitative penetration data, and SEM imaging for structural correlation. The results demonstrate the simultaneous imaging of exogenous compounds and the endogenous lipid components in human skin cross sections at micrometre spatial resolution. This approach allows not only for analysis of molecular penetration, but also for monitoring the skin status in terms of lipid composition and distributions, as well as the effect of exogenous compounds on the endogenous lipid composition and distributions.
