 </sup>. A common method to study the molecular penetration is to monitor the diffusion through the skin in a so-called Franz cell, in combination with analysis of different separated skin layers using, for example, mass spectrometry methods. This approach provides highly sensitive and quantitative concentration data, but the spatial information is limited to the various skin layers that can be isolated. Furthermore, various imaging techniques have been applied to obtain better spatial information, including CLSM
