 </sup>. The main advantage of ToF-SIMS is the spatial resolution, which is routinely in the submicrometer range, as compared to typically 10–50 µm for MALDI imaging, and the fact that no matrix deposition is needed for ToF-SIMS analysis. However, relatively few studies have been reported for ToF-SIMS analysis of skin
