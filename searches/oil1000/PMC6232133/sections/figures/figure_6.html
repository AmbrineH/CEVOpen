 <p> High resolution ToF-SIMS and SEM images of the SC region of a cross section skin sample treated with a ceramide-containing formulation. ( a) Ion images representing (in each row) viable epidermis components, exogenous ceramide and endogenous SC lipids. The right images are 3-colour overlays of the left three images in the same row. Top row (from left, positive ions): PC fragments (m/z 58 + 86 + 184, blue in 3-colour overlay), ceramide fragment (m/z 284, red), cholesterol (m/z 369 + 385, green). Center row (from left, positive ions): protein fragments (m/z 30 + 44 + 70, blue), exogenous ceramide (m/z 562 + 566 + 588, red), endogenous ceramide (m/z 688 + 704 + 718 + 732 + 746 + 760, green). Bottom row (from left, negative ions): cholesterol sulfate (m/z 465, blue), exogenous ceramide (m/z 564, red), C24:0 + C26:0 (m/z 367 + 395, green). Field of view: 250 × 250 µm 2. ( b) SEM image of the same area, ( c) SEM image with superimposed ToF-SIMS overlay image of exogenous ceramide (red) and endogenous ceramide (green). Intensities in different ion images do not reflect the relative abundances of the corresponding analytes. </p>
