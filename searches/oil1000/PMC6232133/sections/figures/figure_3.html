 <p> High-resolution ToF-SIMS and SEM images of the epidermal region of a skin cross section. ( a) Negative ion images of (from left) C24:0 + C26:0 (m/z 367 + 395), cholesterol sulfate (m/z 465), and PE fragments (m/z 140 + 180). ( b) SEM image of the same area and ( c) SEM image with a superimposed 3-colour ToF-SIMS overlay image of C24:0 + C26:0 (green), cholesterol sulfate (red) and PE fragments (blue). Intensities in different ion images do not reflect the relative abundances of the corresponding analytes. </p>
