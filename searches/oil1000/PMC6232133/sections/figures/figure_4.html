 <p> Localization of topically applied carvacrol in skin cross section. ( a) GC-MS analysis of the carvacrol concentrations in different skin layers (SC – stratum corneum, EP – viable epidermis, D – dermis, and RF – receptor fluid). See also Supplementary Table  S2. ( b) Large-area SEM image (stitched) of the skin cross section (the arrow indicates the position of a possible hair follicle, see also Supplementary Fig.  S1), ( c) negative ToF-SIMS images of carvacrol (m/z 149) and ( d) positive ion 3-colour images of DAG (m/z (575–579)+(601–605), green), representing triglycerides, PC fragments (m/z 86 + 184, red) and silicon (m/z 28, blue), acquired at the same skin cross section area as the SEM image in ( b). The yellow circles indicate the location of a possible secretory coil of an eccrine sweat gland (see text). Intensities in different ion images do not reflect the relative abundances of the corresponding analytes. </p>
