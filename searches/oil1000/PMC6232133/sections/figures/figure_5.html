 <p> Detection and localization of topically applied ceramide in skin cross sections. ( a) LC-MS analysis of the ceramide concentration in different skin layers (SC – stratum corneum, EP – viable epidermis, D – dermis, and RF – receptor fluid). See also Supplementary Table  S2. ( b) Positive ToF-SIMS spectra in the mass range of the ceramide molecular ion for a ceramide reference sample (top), the SC region of a skin sample treated with a ceramide-containing formulation (center, arrows indicate peaks assigned to ceramide), and the SC region of an untreated skin sample (bottom). ( c) Ion images of the epidermal region of a skin sample treated with a ceramide-containing formulation, showing (from left); exogenous ceramide (m/z 562 + 566 + 588), endogenous ceramide (m/z 690 + 704 + 716 + 718 + 732), and total ions. Field of view 500 × 500 µm 2. Intensities in different ion images do not reflect the relative abundances of the corresponding analytes. </p>
