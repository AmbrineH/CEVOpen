 <p> Negative ion ToF-SIMS data of the epidermal region of a skin cross section. ( a) Ion images of (from left) C24:0 + C26:0 (m/z 367 + 395), cholesterol sulfate (m/z 465), a 3-colour overlay image of these two, also including PE fragments (m/z 140 + 180, in blue), and a total ion image. Field of view 500 × 500 µm 2. ( b) Spectra from regions of interest (ROIs) indicated in the total ion image in ( a), representing dermis (blue), viable epidermis (red) and stratum corneum (green). The spectrum of SC shows a number of peaks that can be assigned to endogenous ceramides (marked by triangles and specified in Table  1). The peaks at m/z 687–688 (dermis and viable epidermis) correspond to SM16:0. Intensities in different ion images do not reflect the relative abundances of the corresponding analytes. </p>
