  <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits are subjected to a diversity of postharvest diseases caused by various pathogens during picking, packing, storage and transportation. Green and blue molds, caused by 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium digitatum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium italicum</italic>, respectively, are two major postharvest citrus diseases and cause significant economic losses during the commercialization phase. Currently, the control of postharvest citrus diseases relies mainly on the use of synthetic fungicides, which usually result in the resistance against fungal attack, environment pollution and health hazards. In recent years, much attention has been given to the preservation of citrus by naturally isolated edible plant extracts, medicinal plant extracts, 
  <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> extracts and volatiles, et al. Scientists worldwide devote their time and energy to discover the high effect, low toxicity, safety and inexpensive plant-derived fungicides. The current review will highlight plant-derived fungicides and chemical constituents that aim to inhibit 
  <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> in vitro and in vivo. Coatings enriched with plant extracts could be good alternative methods for 
  <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits preservation. Problems and prospects of the research and development of plant-derived natural fungicides will also be discussed in this article.
