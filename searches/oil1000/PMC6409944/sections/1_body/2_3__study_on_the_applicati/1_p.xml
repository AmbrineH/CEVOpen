<p class="p">The effective plant extracts by screening for antifungal activity can be further studied for their application in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservation. Plant extracts can be directly dipped, fumigated, or compounded with other coating materials to improve antifungal and preserved ability. The citral applied as a fumigant was used to study the postharvest diseases of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> caused by 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. citri-aurantii</italic>. The results [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] showed that fumigation of punctured oranges with citral delayed spoilage by sour rot at room temperature by 7–10 days and at 5 °C, by 13–30 days. Meanwhile volatile citral delayed the development of blue mould in abraded, but not punctured, oranges stored at 5 °C. The preserved effect of direct immersion fruit of clove ethanol extract with a good antifungal activity on "Newhall" navel orange was studied previously in our lab [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. The immersion of fruit of 100 mg/mL clove ethanol extract for 3 min can significantly reduce the rot rate and weight loss of "Newhall", and the rate of decay was only 5.9% after 100 days of storage. However, the decay rate of the control group was 10%. This means that the deal delayed the decrease of TSS, TA and VC content in the pulp, and increased the activity of SOD, POD and chitinase (CHI) during the storage period. Oyourou et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] studied the preserved effect of leaf extracts from two plants (
 <italic class="italic">Lantana camara</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia javanica</italic>) rich in verbascoside on “valencia” 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>. In the trial, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> handling with extract containing 1 g/L or 2 g/L. The decay rate of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> was less than 20% while the control 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> decay rate was 100%. Verbascoside was isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">L. camara</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. javanica</italic> methanol extracts by column chromatography and high speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). in vitro experiments [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] showed that 500 μl/L of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia scaberrima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> volatile oil, R-(-)-carvone and 1,8-cineole could inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and the inhibition rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> is over 50%. When the concentration reached 3000 μl/L, the inhibition rate was 100%. However, (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>)-limonene inhibits 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> by only 50%. The combination of 
 <italic class="italic">L. scaberrima</italic> volatile oil and 
 <italic class="italic">Brazilian tropical palm</italic> coating can significantly reduce the rot rate of “Tomango” 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic>, and it was not significantly different from chemical fungicides.
