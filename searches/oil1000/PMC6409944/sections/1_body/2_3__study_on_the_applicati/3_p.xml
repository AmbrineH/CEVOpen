<p class="p">There are diverse application models of plant extracts used in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits preservation. Other than for direct immersion of the fruits, it can also be compatible with some 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservative coating materials or fruit wax to form a composite coating preservative to improve its preservation ability [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Chitosan, or chitin, is the product of N-deacetylation chitin. Chitosan is easily dissolved in a weak acid solvent, and the dissolved chitosan solution contains an amino group (NH
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>), which can inhibit fungi by binding negative electrons. A large number of experimental studies have confirmed that chitosan has a good inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> postharvest pathogenic fungi [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. It is a commonly used 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> postharvest coating material, and it is often compounded with other plant antifungal extracts to improve the preservation performance. The experimental results of our research group [
 <xref rid="B92-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] showed that the coating significantly reduced the decay rate and weight loss of the navel lorange fruits, delayed the decrease of the content of total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and vitamin C (Vc), and effectively inhibited the content of MDA. Furthermore, the coatings maintaining enhanced the activity of SOD, CAT, POD and PPO delay the senescence of fruits, and improve the disease resistance of navel orange fruits. Meanwhile, compared with chitosan coating, cinnamaldehyde-chitosani coating could significantly reduce the decay rate and had no adverse effects on fruit quality.
