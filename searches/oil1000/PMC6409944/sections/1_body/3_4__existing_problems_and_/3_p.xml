<p class="p">(2) If the effect is not good, it should be combined with other preservatives or food additives to improve the preservative effect. Compared with chemical fungicides, the antimicrobial and antiseptic effects of plant extracts are still very poor. It is difficult to achieve the ideal preservation effect by using a single plant-derived antiseptic. Several kinds of preservatives with different properties can be used together to improve the antimicrobial effect. For instance, the combination of plant extract tea saponins and prochloraz (chemical fungicide) can improve the activity and reduce the use of prochloraz. Also, the combination of plant volatile oils and other coating materials (fruit wax, volatile oil of
