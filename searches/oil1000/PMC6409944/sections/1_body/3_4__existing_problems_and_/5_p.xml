<p class="p">(4) In addition, most of the plant-derived 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservatives are plant crude extracts, and the separation and identification of active ingredients is not deep enough. It is difficult to determine the structure of active ingredients, which greatly restricts the research of plant-derived preservatives. Furthermore, the origin, harvesting season, processing methods of plants will affect the content of effective components. Also, the quality of the preservation effect of plant crude extracts is difficult to control. Extraction, isolation, identification of botanical active ingredients form the necessary basis of research and development of botanical 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservatives. On the basis of discovering and determining the structure of active compounds, further and systematic studies on structure-activity relationship, pilot optimization, biomimetic synthesis and quality control can be carried out step by step.
