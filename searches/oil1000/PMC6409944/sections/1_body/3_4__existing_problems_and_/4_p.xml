<p class="p">(3) The antimicrobial and antiseptic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> plant extracts are closely related to the contents of their active substances. The extraction conditions (extraction solvent, temperature, time and frequency, etc.) are the main factors affecting the contents of the active substances in the plant extracts. In order to make the plant extracts play the best antimicrobial effects for preservation, the optimal extraction process should be further studied by response surface analyses that would illustrate the potential extraction conditions of these plant extracts.
