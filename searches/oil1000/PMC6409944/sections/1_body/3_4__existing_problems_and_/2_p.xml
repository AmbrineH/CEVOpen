<p class="p">(1) The main pathogen inhibiting activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> were screened out in vitro. The screening of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> botanical fungicides was based on in vitro. The effects of the fungicides on mycelial growth, spore germination and germ tube elongation of various pathogenic fungi were observed, but the defensive mechanism was not studied in-depth. In addition, the research on 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservation is still smaller and only remains at the small-scale experimental stage in the laboratory, and the commercial application of experimental research is even more rare. Plooy et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] studied the effect of coating with various volatile oils (
 <italic class="italic">L. scaberrima</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> volatile oils, limonene and R-(-) carvone) on the quality of "Tomango" 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>. The amount of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> used reached 2.4 tons in the experiment, reaching the commercial application scale.
