 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> (Family Rutaceae, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantioideae Citrus</italic>) is considered to be a major fruit crop internationally, with mandarin, orange, pomelo and lemon as prominent varieties. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is being cultivated in all parts of the world, but it has a long history spanning 4000 years in the Chinese agriculture system. In China, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Hunan provinces are the major areas of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> cultivation. Cultivation and selection over the millennia have gradually formed plenty of local varieties including Gannan navel orange, Guangdong sugar orange, Nanfeng tangerine, Wenzhou tangerine and many more. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is prone to mechanical damage during picking, packaging, storage, transportation and shelf life. Following skin damage, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is vulnerable to a variety of pathogenic fungi. Over 20 different kinds of diseases in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> during postharvest period have been reported thus far. Among them green and blue molds caused by 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> respectively, are the worst that easily deteriorate fruits by rotting. The fruit rot rate remains around 10â€“30% in general, but in severe conditions it increases up to 50% and causes huge economic losses, especially in developing countries [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Currently the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> postharvest diseases are mainly controlled by chemical fungicides such as imazalil, benzimidazole, thiabendazole, prochloraz and pyrimethanil. Many other control methods involving biological and physical treatments are supplemented by using various natural fungicides. Longer and continuous use of chemical fungicides are likely to make the pathogens resistant and pollute the environment. The fungicides that remain on the surface of the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel have also been reported to harm human health. As such, the development of high-efficiency, low-toxic, safe and inexpensive natural plant-derived 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> preservatives are considered of supreme interest.
