 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> essential oils had a good effect on inhibiting the pathogenic fungi of

 <xref rid="B81-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] studied the relationship between the volatile oil components of various 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peels and the inhibition of the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic>. The antifungal activity of the volatile oils of citrange, lemon, grapefruit and tangerine was strong, while the activity of the volatile oil of sweet orange and sour orange was slightly weak. It was found that the antifungal activity of volatile oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel was related to the content of sesquiterpenes and total monoterpenes (except limonene). Sweet orange, sour orange and grapefruit contain more than 90% limonene, and the content of limonene in citrange, lemon and tangerine is about 70%.
