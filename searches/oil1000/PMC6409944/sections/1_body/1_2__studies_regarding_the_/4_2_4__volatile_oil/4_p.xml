<p class="p">Thymol (22) and carvacrol (23) are the two most common volatile components in the Labiatae members (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00026-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). They have good inhibition of plant pathogens activity. These components are mainly distributed in plants such as oregano, thyme, mint and 
 <italic class="italic">Elsholtzia</italic>. Yahyazadeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] studied the inhibitory effect of volatile oils of four plants (clove, thyme, fennel and sage) on 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>. It showed that 600 ppm of clove and thyme volatile oils can completely inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>. Analysis of their components by using GC-MS indicates that the main components of clove oil are eugenol (21) and β-caryophyllene. The main ingredients of thyme oil are thymol (22), p-cymene and δ-terpinene. Daferera et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] studied the effects of volatile oils from seven Greek aromatic plants on the inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>, and analyzed the chemical constituents by GC-MC. Four members of the Labiatae including 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum majorana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum dictamus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> could completely inhibit the growth of mycelia, spores germinate, and/or form in the concentration range of 250-400 μg/mL. GC-MS analysis of its components found that it mainly contains p-cymene, thymol (22) and carvacrol (23). The IC50 of thymol and carvacrol that inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> were 47 μg/mL and 79 μg/mL, respectively, and the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentrations) were 160 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL, respectively. The result showed that their antifungal activity has a synergistic effect. Alfonso et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] also studied the inhibition activity of thymol (22) and carvacrol (23) on 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> by in vitro and in vivo experiments of lemon. The results showed that they significantly inhibited the growth of fungi at a concentration of 250 μg/mL, reduced the rate of decay, exhalation strength, ethylene release and total acid loss of lemon. Scora et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] screened the effects of more than 200 kinds of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids on the inhibition of three 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> postharvest molds. Some phenolic compounds such as eugenol (21), thymol (22), carvacrol (23), isoeugenol (24), phenol (25), phenylacetaldehyde (26), 2-allylphenol (27) and methyl anthranilate (28) were found to have strong inhibitory effects. The volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] can inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> at a concentration of 250 μl/mL. GC-MS analysis mainly contained 81-83% of carvacrol (23).
