<p class="p">Propolis extract has good antifungal, antiviral, antioxidation, scavenging free radical and anti-tumor activities. Propolis [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] ethyl acetate and ethanol extract can inhibit the spore germination of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic>, and the mycelium is deformed to inhibit its growth, while the activity is related to the total flavonoid content. Propolis ethanol extract was extracted with systemic solvent, and the antifungal activity showed that ethyl acetate was the most active part. Four flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], galangin (33), chrysin (34), pinocembrine (35) and pinobanksin (36), were identified by TCL- bio-autography, column chromatography separation and HPLC-MS technology. The galangin (33) was also identified from the

 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] by antifungal activity tracking separation. 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> were most sensitive to the 0.01 mg/mL concentration of galangin (33), and the inhibition rate is about 30%. Emmanuel et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] studied the activity of two species of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia javanica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia rehmannii</italic>, suppressing a Guazatine-resistant strain of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>. The plant extract of 0.6 mg/mL could inhibit the growth of mycelium, and verbascoside (37) was identified as the main active ingredient.
