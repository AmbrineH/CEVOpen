 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> itself contains many antifungal substances (

 <xref rid="plants-08-00026-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The presence of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel, leaves and flowers by water distillation has strong antifungal effects on both the fungal strains 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Further studies have shown that the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel contains a large number of flavonoids, coumarins and volatile oils, which have the activity to resist the postharvest pathogenic fungi of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel itself also has a certain ability to resist pathogenic fungi, mainly through endogenous and induced (phytoalexins) antimicrobial substances. 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> coumarins are a class of phytoalexins that inhibit the growth of postharvest pathogenic fungi. Phytoalexins refer to the kind of a substance that inhibits the growth of pathogenic fungi when the pathogenic fungi has invaded the fruits. It means this is the substance that is related to plant resistance to disease. After the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruit is treated by physical (exposure to Î³-ray, ultraviolet, heat treatment, skin damage etc.) or chemical (pathogenic fungi, fungicides, etc.) agents, the skin of the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruit can induce some plant antitoxin (mainly coumarins). These phytoalexins are low or absent in normal 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>. When 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> is treated by physical or chemical agents, these phytoalexins can be produced or their presence was significantly increased. These phytoalexins significantly inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms.
