<p class="p">In addition to scoparone (1), some other antifungal components of coumarin were isolated and identified from

 <italic class="italic">P. citrophthora</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>. Meanwhile some phenolic components (3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde) with xanthyletin (4) can synergistically improve its antifungal activity. Seselin (5) was isolated from the

 <italic class="italic">P. citrophthora</italic>, which is a pyranocoumarin phytoalexin. However, this compound was not detected in other parts, indicating that seselin (5) mainly exists in the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> trees. Several endogenous coumarins, umbelliferone (6), osthol (7), auraptene (8) and 7-geranoxycoumarin (9), were isolated from the peel of grapefruit [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and result showed they have antifungal effects. Angioni et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] further studied the synthetic method of 7-geranoxycoumarin (9), and obtained 7-geranoxycoumarin (9) through the synthesis of geranyl bromide and umbelliferone (6). The inhibitory activities of umbelliferone (6) and 7-geranoxycoumarin (9) against 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> were compared. The EC50 values were 95 μg/mL and 110 μg/mL, 57 μg/mL and 43 μg/mL, indicating that the structure of umbelliferone (6) can be modified to improve the antifungal activity. Ben-Yehoshua et al. [

One induced and four endogenous antifungal substances in lemon peels were identified by TCL-bioautography, GC-MS and NMR. There are citral, scoparone (1), limettin (10), 5-geranoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (11) and isopimpinellin (32). The EC50 of citral, limettin (10) and 5-geranoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (11) inhibiting the elongation of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> sprouts was 170-242 μg/mL, 860-886 μg/mL and 1578 μg/mL, respectively. The content of limettin (10), which is the active ingredient of green-skinned lemons, is higher than that of yellow-skinned lemons. Therefore, the green-skinned lemon is more resistant to storage. Dubery et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] identified a new inducible antifungal substance, 4-(3-methyl-2-butenoxy) isonitrosoacetophenone (12), from γ-ray treated 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus sinensis</italic> and lemon peel.
