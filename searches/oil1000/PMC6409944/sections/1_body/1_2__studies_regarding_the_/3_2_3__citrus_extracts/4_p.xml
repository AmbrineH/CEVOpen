<p class="p">In addition to coumarin, there are some flavonoids in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peels. In particular, polymethoxy- flavones are also resistant to the attack of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum and P. italicum</italic>. The waxy components of various 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel and hexane extract [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] have resistance effects on a variety of fungi and bacteria, and the MIC concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> is inhibited below 1000 Î¼g/mL. And separating and identifying three activities ingredient: tangeritin (16), nobiletin (17) and scoparone (1). Further studies [

 <xref rid="B78-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] have shown that naringin (13) and hesperidin (14) of dihydrogen flavonoids, diosmin (15) of flavonoids, tangeritin (16), sinensetin (18), heptamethoxyflavone (19) and nobiletin (17) of polymethyl-flavonoids are closely related to the susceptibility of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>. The high content of flavonoids in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peels is resistant to the infection of 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium spp</italic>. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) not only affects the content of coumarin in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel, but also affects the flavonoids. Arcas et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] studied the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on the content of flavonoids in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> and the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>. After five days of inoculation with 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic>, the orange was irradiated by ultraviolet irradiation, and the content of naringin (13) in the peel decreased, while the content of tangeritin (16) increased. The inhibitory activity of tangeritin (16) is stronger than that of naringin (13), which showed that ultraviolet irradiation treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> can improve its antifungal activity.
