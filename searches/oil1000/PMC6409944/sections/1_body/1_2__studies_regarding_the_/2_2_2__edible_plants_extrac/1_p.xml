<p class="p">Many of the edible plants also have good antifungal effects and can potentially inhibit the growth of postharvest pathogenic fungi in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits. The extracts of edible plants contain some edible flavorings. Aqueous and 20% ethanolic extracts of garlic (Family Amaryllidaceae) plant showed a significant inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum and P. italicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of 9 edible wild herbs were studied on common mold of fruits and vegetables, and we found that both 
 <italic class="italic">Sanguisorba minor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago lanceolata</italic> could significantly inhibit the germination of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> spores and the extension of germ tubes [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This occurrence is possibly related to the presence of caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoids in extracts. Studies have shown that extracts of soybean flour possess strong antifungal effects [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and further studies confirmed the various components of soybean protein such as β-conglycinin and glycinin [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The results showed that the soy protein fractions contain β-conglycinin significantly inhibited in vitro growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> at a wide concentration range (50-3,000 mg/L), and complete inhibition of spore germination at 2,000 mg/L was stated. The soy protein fraction containing β-conglycinin totally inhibited the development of green mold in fruits at 250 mg/L for 7 days after inoculation with the fungal pathogen.
