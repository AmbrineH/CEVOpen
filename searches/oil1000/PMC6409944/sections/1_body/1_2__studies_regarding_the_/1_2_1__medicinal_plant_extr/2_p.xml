<p class="p">The antifungal activity of medicinal plant extracts is affected by many factors such as origin, season of harvest, processing method and extraction conditions, etc. In order to make extracts that exert optimal antifungal activity, some studies reported the effects of variable extraction conditions on the antifungal activity of plant extracts, and optimized the extraction procedures of some plants with antifungal effects. Our lab [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] has performed certain experiments to optimize the extraction conditions of antifungal extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">F. hirta</italic> fruit. The results of this study indicated that the optimal extraction parameters for maximum antifungal activity were: 90% (v/v) ethanol concentration, 65 min extraction time, 31 mL/g solvent to solid ratio at 51 °C. The experimental diameters of inhibition zone (DIZs) values against 
 <italic class="italic">P. italicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> were 57.17 ± 0.75 and 39.33 ± 0.82 mm, respectively, which were very close to the values of 57.26 and 39.29 mm predicted by the standard model.
