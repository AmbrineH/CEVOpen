<p id="Par13" class="p">Both limiting and non-limiting amino acids were detected in the BSFL, with the choice of substrate significantly affecting their concentrations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Yet, in general and for the most limiting amino acids like lysine, methionine, isoleucine and tyrosine no significant substrate effect was found. Tryptophan was not detected in the analysis, as it might have been destroyed during the acid hydrolysis process. However, no significant substrate effect was detected in the BSFL for the most important amino acids in animal nutrition, especially for non-ruminants, i.e. methionine (p = 0.2891), lysine (p = 0.9296), isoleucine (p = 0.7181) and leucine (p = 0.342). KW reared larvae showed significantly higher levels of the non-essential amino acids’ proline (DF = 2; F = 59.69; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.888; p &lt; 0.0001), hydro-proline (DF = 2; F = 4.48; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.374; p = 0.0298) and tyrosine (DF = 2; F = 11.27; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.600; p = 0.001) compared to the larvae fed on the other tested substrates. Glutamine was detected in larvae reared on KW. Glutamic acid (DF = 1; F = 28.97; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.743; p = 0.0003) was only detected in CM fed BSFL, while KW fed BSFL in most cases showed the highest concentrations of the different amino acids especially in the Phenylalanine (DF = 2; F = 20.07; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.727; p &lt; 0.0001) content, followed by SG and CM fed BSFL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
