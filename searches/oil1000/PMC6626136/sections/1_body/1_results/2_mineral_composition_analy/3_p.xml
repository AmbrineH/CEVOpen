<p id="Par12" class="p">There was no significant correlation between phosphorus concentrations of the rearing substrates and those of the BSFL (p = 0.0354 for CM; p = 0.1591 for KW; and p = 0.8562). Moreover, there was no significant correlation between potassium concertation of KW rearing substrate and that of the BSFL (p = 0.0153). However, there was a high correlation between potassium concentrations of CM and SG rearing substrates and those of the BSFL (DF = 1; F = 74.15; R
