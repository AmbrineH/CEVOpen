<p id="Par11" class="p">BSFL fed on the different substrates exhibited different accumulation patterns of minerals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Five major minerals, i.e. required in amounts greater &gt;100 mg/day, were detected. Of those, potassium (DF = 2; F = 13.41; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.641; p = 0.0005), calcium (DF = 2; F = 68.58; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.901; p &lt; 0.0001) and magnesium (DF = 2; F = 3.65; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.328; p = 0.051) significantly differed among the tested BSFL whereas sodium did not.
