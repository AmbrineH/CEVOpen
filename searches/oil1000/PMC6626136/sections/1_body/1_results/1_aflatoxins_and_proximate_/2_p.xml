<p id="Par8" class="p">There was an effect of substrate in all the proximate nutritional parameters of the BSFL except for ash (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The DM (DF = 2; F = 7.70; R2 = 0.507; p = 0.0050) content of the BSFL was higher in KW fed ones. Crude protein (DF = 2; F = 38.48; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.838; p &lt; 0.0001) was high in the CM and SG fed larvae and lowest in the KW fed ones, though larvae fed on the latter substrate showed higher crude fat (DF = 2; F = 27.65; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.787; p &lt; 0.0001) content than the others. Organic matter (DF = 2; F = 306.09; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.976; p &lt; 0.0001) was lower in CM fed larvae as compared to larvae fed on the two other substrates. Both NDF (DF = 2; F = 32.91; R2 = 0.814; p &lt; 0.0001) and ADF (DF = 2; F = 6.33; R2 = 0.456; p = 0.0101) contents were higher in SG fed BSF.
