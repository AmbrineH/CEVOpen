<p id="Par7" class="p">LC-Qtof-MS analysis for mycotoxins did not identify any traces of aflatoxin in the BSFL. There was an effect of substrate in all the proximate nutritional parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The DM content of SG substrate was lower in comparison to the two other rearing substrates (DF = 2; F = 23.23; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.939; p = 0.0149) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The ash content of CM was higher while the KW and SG ash contents were comparable (DF = 2; F = 233.89; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.851; p = 0.0005). Organic matter was lower in KW while the values obtained from CM and SG were comparable (DF = 2; F = 115.42; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.987; p = 0.0015). Crude protein content was higher in KW in comparison to CM and SG (DF = 2; F = 169.8; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.991; p = 0.0008). Moreover, the values of NDF (DF = 2; F = 87.89; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.983; p = 0.0022) and ADF (DF = 2; F = 36.87; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.983; p = 0.0077) contents in SG were higher in comparison to the two other rearing substrates. The EE contents (DF = 2; F = 45.51; R2 = 0.968; p = 0.0057) of the three substrates were rather low (2.7–7.2% DM) with CM the lowest.
