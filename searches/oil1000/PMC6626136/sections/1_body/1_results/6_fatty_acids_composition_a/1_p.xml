<p id="Par16" class="p">In total, eleven fatty acids were detected in BSFL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>). Except for linoleic and arachidonic acid, concentrations of fatty acids in SG fed BSFL were always higher, and in some cases even significantly higher than in BSFL fed on the two other substrates (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>).
