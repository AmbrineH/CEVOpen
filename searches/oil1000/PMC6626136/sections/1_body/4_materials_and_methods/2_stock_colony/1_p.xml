 <italic class="italic">icipe</italic> insectarium maintains a population of BSF adults which act as a stock colony. The population of the stock colony was originally collected from the surroundings of 
 <italic class="italic">icipe</italic> in Nairobi and was maintained in the insectarium for 1 year before use in this study. Adult BSF are housed in an outdoors metal framed cage with screen mesh (1.8 × 1.8 × 1.8 m with 1.5 mm mesh) with strong access to daylight spectra and temperatures maintained at 28 ± 5 °C to encourage mating to occur. The flies are supplied with water to prolong their life. Corrugated cardboard and some SG are placed within the cage to attract adult females for egg laying.
