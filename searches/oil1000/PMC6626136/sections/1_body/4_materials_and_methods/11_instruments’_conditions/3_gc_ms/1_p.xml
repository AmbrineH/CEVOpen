<p id="Par43" class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC/MS on a 7890 A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA) linked to a 5975 C mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA) by using the following conditions: inlet temperature 270 °C, transfer line temperature of 280 °C, and column oven temperature programmed from 35 to 285 °C with the initial temperature maintained for 5 min then 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 280 °C, and held at this temperature for 20.4 min. The GC was fitted with a HP-5 MS low bleed capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm) (J &amp; W, Folsom, USA). Helium at a flow rate of 1.25 ml min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> served as the carrier gas. The mass selective deceptive was maintained at ion source temperature of 230 °C and quadrapole temperature of 180 °C. Electron impact (EI) mass spectra were obtained at the acceleration energy of 70 eV. A 1.0 µl aliquot of sample was injected in the splitless mode using an auto sampler 7683 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Beijing, China). Fragment ions were analyzed over 40–550 m/z mass range in the full scan mode. The filament delay time was set at 3.3 min.
