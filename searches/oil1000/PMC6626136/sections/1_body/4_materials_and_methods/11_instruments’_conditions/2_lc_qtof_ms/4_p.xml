<p id="Par41" class="p">MassLynx version 4.1 SCN 712 (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) was used for data acquisition and processing. The elemental composition was generated for every analyte. Potential assignments were calculated using mono-isotopic masses with a tolerance of 10ppm deviation and both odd- and even-electron states possible. The number and types of expected atoms was set as follows: carbon &lt; 100; hydrogen &lt; 100; oxygen &lt; 50; nitrogen &lt; 6; sulphur &lt; 6

 </sup>. The empirical formula generated was used to predict structures which were proposed based on the online database, fragmentation pattern, literature and confirmed using authentic standards.
