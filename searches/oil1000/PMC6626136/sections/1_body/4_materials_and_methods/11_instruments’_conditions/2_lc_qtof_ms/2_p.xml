<p id="Par39" class="p">For analyses of flavonoids and aflatoxin, a UPLC was fitted to a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 µm particle size; Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) heated to 40 °C and an auto sampler tray cooled to 15 °C. Mobile phases of water (A) and methanol (B), each with 0.01% formic acid, were employed. The following gradients were used for i) flavonoids: 0–0.2 min, 10% B; 0.2–3 min, 10–60% B; 3–5 min, 60–80% B; 6–8 min, 80% B; 8–9 min, 100% B; 9–10 min, 100% B; 10–10.5 min 100–10% B; and 10.5–12 min 10% B; ii) aflatoxin: 0–0.2 min, 10% B; 0.2–3 min, 10–90% B; 3–5 min, 90% B; 5–6 min, 90–10% B; and 6–7 min, 10%B. The flow rate was held constant at 0.4 ml min
