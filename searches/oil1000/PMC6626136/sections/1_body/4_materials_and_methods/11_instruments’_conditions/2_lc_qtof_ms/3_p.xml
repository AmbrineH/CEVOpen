<p id="Par40" class="p">The UPLC system was interfaced with electrospray ionization (ESI) to a Waters Xevo QToF-MS operated in full scan based on independent information acquisition (MS
 <sup class="sup">E</sup>) in positive mode. Data were acquired in resolution mode over the 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> range 100–1,200 for flavonoids: 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 100–700 for amino acid analysis with a scan time of 1 s using a capillary voltage of 0.5 kV, sampling cone voltage of 40 V, source temperature 100 °C and desolvation temperature of 350 °C. The nitrogen desolvation flow rate was 500 L/h. For the high-energy scan function, a collision energy ramp of 25–45 eV was applied in the T-wave collision cell using ultrahigh purity argon (&gt;99.999%) as the collision gas. A continuous lock spray reference compound (leucine enkephalin; [M + H)
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>  = 556.2766) was sampled at 10 s intervals for centroid data mass correction. The MS was calibrated across the 50–1,200 Da mass using a 0.5 mM sodium formate solution prepared in 90: 10 2-propanol/water (v/v).
