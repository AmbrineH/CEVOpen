<p id="Par31" class="p">Prior to the proximate analysis and after reaching the prepupal stage, the insects were harvested, washed with tap water, oven dried at 60 °C for 48 hours, crushed using a laboratory blender and then stored for subsequent analyses in a refrigerator at −20 °C. Then, the BSFL samples were taken for proximate analysis using standard methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemist

 </sup>. Dry matter was calculated by the weight difference between before and after drying the sample in the oven at 135 °C for two hours; ash was determined by heating the samples in a muffle furnace set at 600 °C for three hours while CP was determined using the Kjeldahl method and a nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor of 4.76 was used in the calculation of CP

 </sup>. Diethyl ether was used as an extractant in the determination of crude fat using the Velp solvent extractor (SER 148/6). Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were analyzed with a Velp fiber analyzer (FIWE 6) (VELP Scientifica, Usmate Velate, Italy) using reagents described by Van Soest and colleagues
