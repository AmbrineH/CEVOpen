 </sup>. Ten (10) g of every sample were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, crushed into fine powder and extracted in 40 mL acetonitrile-water (86:16, v/v) for 30 min while sonicating. Each mixture was allowed to settle for 30 min and then 6 mL of each sample was filtered through a solid phase extraction cartridge Multisep® 228 AflaPat multifunctional columns (Roer Labs, USA). An aliquot (4 ml) of each cleaned extract was evaporated to dryness in a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried samples were re-dissolved in 400 μL methanol-water (20:80, v/v), vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min prior to analysis using a Waters liquid chromatography coupled to quadruple time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QtoF-MS) (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA). Samples derived from different substrates were analyzed in five replicates.
