<p id="Par17" class="p">With the rapid rise in urban populations in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, the problem of waste management increases. Organic waste accounts for more than 78% of the entire solid waste stream in developing countries

 </sup>, waste in Africa and beyond in the Global South is often dumped in landfills without prior separation of organic waste streams leading to the loss of valuable organic resources that could otherwise be reclaimed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. Centralized waste management systems that are widely applied in the developed world require sophisticated infrastructures and are often economically beyond the means of most developing countries. Therefore, there is a need to establish alternative waste management systems that can valorise and recycle organic waste streams yet within the economic means of the developing world. In addition, rapid population growth in Africa and Asia, coupled with urbanization and changes in consumer preferences lead to an increasing demand for food, particularly in terms of animal protein

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. Because of the ecological and economic shortfalls of common protein sources like fish and soy meal in most animal feed
