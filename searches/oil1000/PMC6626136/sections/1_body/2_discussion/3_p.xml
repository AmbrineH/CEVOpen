<p id="Par19" class="p">In addition to CP, other nutritional components of livestock feed can greatly enhance the quality of animal production, including several minerals and vitamins including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, cobalt and vitamins A or D. For example, calcium and phosphorous play important roles in x physiological functions of animals including muscle mass reductions, neuro-signaling, enzymatic activity, metabolic reactions, construction of proteins, maintenance of osmotic and acidic- alkaline equilibria, construction of membranes etc.

 </sup>. When referring to bone and egg formation in layer hens, calcium in particular plays a crucial role as it contributes to more than 90% of the mineral matrix in the bones

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup> reported higher calcium concentration for BSFL reared on poultry manure in comparison to the concentration we obtained from BSFL reared on a similar substrate. Such a variability could be further justified by the fact that the outer layer of the larvae’s skin releases a deposit of calcium carbonate (CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) which may lead to the high calcium and ash content

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> reported higher levels of phosphorus in BSFL reared on poultry manure than those reared on swine manure. This variability could also be attributed to the influence of the rearing substrate on the mineral content of BSFL.
