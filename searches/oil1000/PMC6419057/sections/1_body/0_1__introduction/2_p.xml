This technique has been demonstrated to be effective in creating protective nano-coatings on silicized high-barrier polymer substrates, such as PET-SiOx films, by the facile deposition of highly hydrophobic silane precursor molecules (alkylsilanes and (fluoro)alkylsilanes) on the SiOx layer of the substrate. However, despite the simplicity of the SAM technique, the formation of a reproducibly well-defined monolayer is exceedingly difficult [

 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. One of the main issues with this system is the casual formation of polycondensed silane (i.e., multilayered products) or physically adsorbed silane molecules on the SiOx surface, particularly when no activation step to promote the grafting is used. Furthermore, the deposition process is especially complicated; it proceeds through a number of stages and strongly depends on various parameters, including solvent and adsorber concentrations, silanol density at the active surface, cleaning procedures, aging of solutions, water content, deposition time, and temperature. Initial reports claimed water traces to be essential for the formation of well-packed monolayers. Recent studies have shown that the increase in water content or age of the adsorbed solution promotes island-type growth. To further complicate the debate, the film growth seems to proceed by different mechanisms under “dry” or “wet” conditions [
