<p class="p">In this context, we are carrying out a study aimed to develop a simple route to change the wettability of PET-SiOx films for high barrier applications. In previous works, we developed a method to obtain flexible and transparent hydrophobic SAM nanocoating using different alkyl- and fluoroalkylsilanes as precursor molecules, by means of simple and effective single-step process carried out at room temperature and applied to a polyethylene terephthalateâ€“silicon oxide substrate (PET-SiOx), with the demonstrated efficacy of SAM in improving the oxygen and water barrier characteristics of commercial PET-SiOx films, normally used in photovoltaics, without losing significant transparency and assessing high durability of the developed systems in aggressive environments [

 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In this work, using as precursor molecule the best among those already tested, i.e., 1H,1H,2H,2H-per-fluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS), we intended to optimize the conditions of the deposition reaction to minimize the film wettability. To this aim, the SAM reaction was carried out using different compositions of the FDTS reagent mixture, in order to evaluate the effect on the water and oil wettability of the modified PET-SiOx films and select the optimal reaction conditions for the lowest wettability. Optical transparency and the surface roughness have also been measured.
