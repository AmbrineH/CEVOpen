<p class="p">A similar evolution of the static contact angle was also observed with oil as test liquid, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. However, in this case the CAo values show more statistical fluctuations. This result is coherent with what is reported in the literature: Yang et al. have obtained several correlations between different surface substrates and contact angles for crude oil, demonstrating that this measurement is strongly dependent on oil properties [
