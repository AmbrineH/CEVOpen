<p class="p">As expected, the SiOx coating strongly increases the surface water wettability of the film, as it comes out comparing the CAw values of the two sides of the substrate. The phenomenon is due to the higher polarity of the SiOx coating layer, with respect to the uncoated PET, which allows favorable Coulomb interactions (i.e., interactions among permanent–permanent dipoles, e.g., hydrogen bonds and interactions among permanent-induced dipoles) with the water droplets. On the other hand, almost no effect on the oil wettability was detected, since both sides of the films have similar CAo values, maybe due to the very low surface tension of the oil (27.5 mN/m at 25 °C [
