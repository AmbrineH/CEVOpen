<p class="p">As a consequence of this change, as it comes out from DMA curves reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>, a reduction of the storage modulus E’ of the film was also observed, associated with the film’s “stiffness” in the low temperature range where the material is in the glassy state. However, the Tg value, measured as the peak temperature of the loss modulus E’’ curve, remained unchanged. This indicates that the SAM treatment has not altered the morphological state of the polymer, but only affected the SiOx coating layer. This result also highlights the need for the SiOx coating layer to be protected from possible physical–mechanical actions that can damage its integrity and functionality.
