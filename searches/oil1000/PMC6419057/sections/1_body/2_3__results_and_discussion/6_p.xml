<p class="p">The graph reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows that the SAM treatment significantly increased the CAw values, not only for the SiOx-coated side, but also, unexpectedly, for the uncoated one. The increase is particularly relevant on the SiOx coating layer, whose behavior changes from very hydrophilic (CAw = 21.5°) to hydrophobic (CAw &gt; 90°), with a gain of CAw ranging in the interval of 65–80° depending on the reaction conditions, and a maximum value of CAw equal to 101° measured for the S-d sample. The same trend was measured also on the uncoated PET side of the substrate, with CAw values only slightly lower with respect to the SiOx-coated side, and a maximum equal to 97.5° for the S-d sample. Of course, the gain of CAw measured on the PET side of the film is always smaller in this case, ranging in the interval of 10–30°, since the starting CAw value of the uncoated PET side is already high (CAw = 67.7°).
