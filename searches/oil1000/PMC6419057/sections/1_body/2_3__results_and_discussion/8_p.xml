<p class="p">The water and oil wettability changes of the uncoated film surface suggests that, in the adopted experimental conditions, FDTS is also able to give the condensation reaction with the hydroxyl groups of PET molecules. A possible reaction mechanism, involving a step in which the PET chains are activated by acid hydrolysis, is schematically depicted in
