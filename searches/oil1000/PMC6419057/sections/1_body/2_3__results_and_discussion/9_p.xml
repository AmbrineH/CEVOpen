<p class="p">In order to investigate if the SAM treatment, together with the reduced wettability, was effective in decreasing the moisture transport properties of the film, water vapor permeability measurements were carried out. The results, listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00257-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, show that all treated films have WVTR values about five-fold higher than the original untreated substrate, independent from the reaction conditions. Since the high barrier against moisture is provided by the SiOx coating layer, it may be hypothesized that, in the adopted experimental conditions, the manipulation operations related to the SAM process execution, rather than to the SAM reaction itself, produce a deterioration of the coating layer integrity.
