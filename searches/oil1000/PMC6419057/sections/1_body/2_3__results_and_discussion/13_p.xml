<p class="p">In order to evaluate the effects of the SAM treatment on sample transparency, a critical parameter for possible application of the used PET-SiOx film in technical fields where optical properties are crucial (e.g., photovoltaics, optical displays, greenhouse screens, etc.), all treated systems were submitted to UV-Vis spectroscopic analyses. The obtained UV-Vis transmittance spectra, reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>, underlines that the original PET-SiOx substrate shows a high transparency, close to 86% in the wavelength range 400â€“800 nm. This transparency slightly decreases after SAM treatment up to a value of 80% for the S-d film; however, it still remains acceptable for the application areas of interest.
