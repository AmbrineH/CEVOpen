<p class="p">With the aim of verifying this hypothesis, the films S-0 and S-d, chosen as examples, were tested by AFM and DMA analyses. The AFM gave information on the surface roughness and quality of the SiOx coating layer, whereas DMA is a very sensitive technique for detecting the dynamic mechanical behavior of polymers at the molecular level and their main thermal transitions, providing information on the filmâ€™s morphology.</p>
