<p class="p">The results of AFM measurements, reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, show that the adopted experimental procedure for SAM treatment execution altered the SiOx coating layer, significantly increasing its roughness with respect to the original substrate. However, it is interesting to note that the effects are similar with and without FDTS, indicating that the most critical point of the procedure lies in the handling operations of the film rather than in the reaction with the silane molecule [
