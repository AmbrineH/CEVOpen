 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>. In the case of complete wetting (spreading), the contact angle is 0°. This means that the solid sample has a much high surface energy than the liquid; between 0° and 90°, the solid substrate is wettable, and above 90° it is not wettable. This means that the solid has a surface energy much lower than the liquid.
