<p class="p">The polymeric substrate used for the experiments was a flexible and transparent silicon oxide (SiOx)-coated polyester film provided by AMCOR (Zürich, Switzerland), consisting of a 12 μm thick polyethylene therephthalate (PET) coated by a 50 nm thick SiOx layer deposited by electron beam evaporation. The molecule used as precursor for the SAM deposition was 1H,1H,2H,2H-per-fluorodecyl-trichlorosilane 96% (FDTS; C
