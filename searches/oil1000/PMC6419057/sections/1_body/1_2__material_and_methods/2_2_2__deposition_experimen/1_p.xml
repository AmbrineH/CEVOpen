<p class="p">Before the functionalization experiments, the PET-SiOx substrate films were accurately cleaned in order to remove all the impurities from their surfaces. The cleaning procedure consisted of three consecutive cycles of soaking in ethanol for 5 min, drying in a nitrogen flow, and rinsing in distilled water, with a final drying in a nitrogen flow. The deposition experiments were performed at 25 Â°C in a glass batch reactor, preliminarily flame-dried in order to remove any trace of water. Subsequently, an N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere was maintained in the reactor. The silane was deposited under anhydrous conditions for 24 h, submerging the substrate films (having surface area equal to 1.00 dm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in ethanolic solutions containing different volume amounts of FDTS, thereby realizing different values of silane amount per film surface area. The reaction is sketched in
