<p class="p">In order to verify that in the adopted experimental conditions, the FDTS condensation reaction on the PET–SiOx substrate films successfully occurred, film samples before and after deposition were submitted to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis, according to procedure described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-polymers-11-00257" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref>. The FTIR spectra of the S-0 (uncoated) and S-c (coated) samples evidenced changes in spectral regions of the Si–OH bands (3600–3100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and of the broad Si–O band (1300–1100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00257-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The graph shows that in the S-c curve the Si–OH bands almost disappear, because during deposition experiments they combine with FDTS to form new Si–O–Si linkages. At the same time, a new feature in the region of the Si–O band appears, consisting of a shoulder at approximately 1220 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which is attributed to the Si–C linkages of the FDTS fluoroalkylsilane chains condensed on the PET-SiOx substrate [
