<p class="p">Static contact angle measurements were performed with a First Ten Angstrom Analyzer System 32.0 mod. FTA 1000 (First Ten Angstroms, Inc., Portsmouth, VA, USA), according to the standard test method ASTM D5946, using distilled water and synthetic polyalphaolefin base oil PAO6 as test liquids. The drop volume was taken within the range where the contact angle did not change with the variation of the volume (2 ± 0.5 μL). Each reported value of the θ angle is the average of five replicate measurements.</p>
