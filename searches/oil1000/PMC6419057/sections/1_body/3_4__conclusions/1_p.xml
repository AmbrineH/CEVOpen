<p class="p">In this work, the self-assembled monolayer technique was used as a tool for surface and wetting property modification of commercial PET-SiOx films, suitable for high-performance technical applications in power, electronics, and construction fields. The SAM reaction was carried out using different compositions of the reagent mixture, in order to evaluate the effect on the water and oil wettability of the modified films, and to select the optimal reaction conditions for the lowest wettability, as well as the best self-cleaning capacity and performance stability. In particular, for the PET-SiOx film used, the best FDTS/film surface ratio for both the lowest water and oil wettability was found equal to 26.5 mM/dm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, which changes the surface behavior from very hydrophilic (CAw = 21.5°) to hydrophobic (CAw = 101°), and gives a significant increment of the CAo from 27° to 60°. Interestingly, the results demonstrated that the SAM reaction also occurred on the uncoated layer of the PET-SiOx substrate; therefore, it is able to reduce, even if for a minor entity, the film wettability on the PET side, too. The wettability reduction is accompanied by a small increase of the water vapor permeability, probably due to a cracks or defect onset of the SiOx coating of the SAM modified films. On this point, AFM analyses demonstrated an increment of the SiOx coating layer roughness after the SAM treatment execution. Finally, the transmittance lowering of the SAM treated films, measured in the wavelength range 400–800 nm, is always small and acceptable for their use in high-barrier applications where high transparency is required.
