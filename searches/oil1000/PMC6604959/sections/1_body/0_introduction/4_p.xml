<p class="p">The present study is restricted to the effects exerted during the initial pre-symbiotic phase. This period, which involves spore germination of AM fungi, hyphal growth, plant recognition and formation of appressoria is crucial for the unfolding of the whole colonization process. The plant signals that stimulate spore germination and hyphal branching are associated with root exudates and more precisely with strigolactones 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[26]</xref>, while the growing extraradical hyphae produce mycorrhizal factors that activate symbiosis-related plant genes 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. During this early root colonization phase, the regulatory role of various secondary plant compounds, such as flavonoid
