<p class="p">The involvement of a large number of vascular plants in symbiotic relationships with fungi in diverse habitats, indicates the importance of fungi for the plant soil complex. The colonization of plants by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) affects the quality and the quantity of the host plant root exudates, the structure of the microbial communities in the rhizospheres and the chemotactic responses of specific bacteria 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. Moreover, interesting interactions are developed between AM fungi and soil bacteria, including the binding of the latter to the fungal spores, the production of volatiles by free living bacteria, and the degradation of fungal cellular walls 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>. On the other side, specialized “mycorrhiza helper bacteria” promote the activity and development of AM fungi with their effects being fungal specific. In particular, the AM fungus

 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. Inoculation with this fungus significantly influenced the development of the bacterial community of tomato rhizosphere

 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>. Due to their interactions with members of the rhizosphere microbial community, AM fungi have been used as biofertlizers to increase the strawberry fruit yield under reduced chemical fertilizers

 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Moreover, AMF were characterized as microbial biostimulants because of their positive contribution to plant nutrition efficiency, water balance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress
