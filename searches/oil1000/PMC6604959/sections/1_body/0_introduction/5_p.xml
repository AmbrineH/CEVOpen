<p class="p">Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi interact with the members of the soil microbial community producing suppressive or stimulative effects while essential oil could be toxic to some microbes and beneficial to some others acting as food source. In this line, the hypothesis that was explored in this paper is that the joint effect of AMF inoculation and essential oil addition would be synergistic to the members of the soil microbial community resulting in higher microbial biomasses compared to values recorded in singly treated pots. Moreover, we hypothesized that these changes in the community would be reflected on the soil enzyme activities.</p>
