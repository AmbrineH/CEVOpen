Increased urease activity in the inoculated pots, at the second sampling date, can function as a nitrogen providing mechanism serving the increasing needs of growing AMF 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. On the contrary, glutaminase and arylamidase exhibited low activity in inoculated samples at the second sampling date. It appears that AMF exerted an inhibitory effect on the activity of these enzymes. However, in the case of glutaminase, the low activity in inoculated samples could be also associated with low substrate availability, since fungal spores absorb glutamine from the soil to support their germination 
 <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[68]</xref>. It seems that in AMF pots, urease activity was mainly responsible for providing nitrogen, while in the non-inoculated ones the activities of arylamidase and glutaminase were dominant.
