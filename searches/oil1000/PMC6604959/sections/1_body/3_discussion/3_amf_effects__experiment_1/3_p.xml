<p class="p">The activity of enzymes showed idiosyncratic response to inoculation and time of sampling. The activity of NAG, which is involved in N- and C-cycling 
 <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[63]</xref>, was high in both inoculated and non-inoculated pots at the first sampling date. This can be related to the decomposition of dead microbial cells (especially fungal) resulting from the initial sterilized substrate. Through this process, nutrients became available in the experimental substrate that was poor in C and N so as to satisfy the requirements of growing roots and free living microbes. In inoculated pots, the response of NAG activity is similar to that of chitinases. The activity of the latter is triggered by signals exchanged between AM symbionts during the early stages of the colonization process
