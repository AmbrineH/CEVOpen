<p class="p">Depending on the sampling time, differences in the response of microbial biomass to inoculation was revealed. After 30 days the total microbial biomass was lower in the inoculated pots compared to the non-inoculated ones, but the reverse was recorded after 60 days when mycelia started growing. Although, to the best of our knowledge, such reversals have not been reported before, there is some information in support of this phenomenon. For instance, Christensen and Jakobsen 
 <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[59]</xref> reported that four weeks after inoculation of cucumber pots with AMF, the bacterial biomass was decreased, which is in agreement with our first-sampling results, while Zarea et al. 
 <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[60]</xref>, in a clover pot experiment, observed an increase of microbial biomass at the end of the growing period, after three months; the latter is consistent with our second-sampling results. A positive effect of AMF on the biomasses of free-living microbes was recorded by Ladygina et al. 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[61]</xref> after 20 weeks of inoculation and it was attributed to the positive contribution of AMF to soil aggregation. In our case, such an improvement of soil conditions was not supported because the time since inoculation was limited (8 instead of 20 weeks). The positive relations among AMF and free microbes could be due to the fact that AMF amplify the pool of plant root exudates and could provide carbon and nutrients to free-living microorganisms 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[62]</xref>. This is further supported by the fact that in inoculated pots the difference in the size of the microbial biomass between the two samplings was non-significant, contrary to what happened in the non-inoculated pots. In these latter, as tomato plants are grown a strong competition among plants and soil microbes could be developed, decreasing the microbial biomass. We could hypothesize that at the first sampling this competition was alleviated by possible flush of nutrients in the substrate induced by sterilization
