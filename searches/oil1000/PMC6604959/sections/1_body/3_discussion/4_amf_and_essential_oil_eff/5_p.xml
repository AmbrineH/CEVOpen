<p class="p">The second finding contrasts reports demonstrating a positive correlation among the microbial biomass and the soil enzymatic activity 
 <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[78]</xref>. The negative association between these two profiles could be explained by the suggestion that there is no one to one match between microbial species and enzymes; each microbial population is able to produce a relatively wide range of enzymes, whereas different microbes may produce similar enzymes 
 <xref rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[79]</xref>. Moreover, the categorization of microbes to generic groups such as G
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, G
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’</sup>, actinomycetes etc didn't contribute positively to the identification of such a relation. Furthermore, for many enzymes, e.g. phosphatases, the activity of extracellular enzymes that are stabilized in soil colloids contributes to the estimated activity, though these specific forms are not subjected to factors regulating the current microbial activity
