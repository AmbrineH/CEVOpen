<p class="p">Analysis of the specific PLFA profiles brings forth the idea of partially diverging selective powers of AM fungi and essential oil on the structure of the microbial community. Actually, in the AMF inoculated pots, the soil microbial community was characterized by three Gram
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and one Gram
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’</sup> biomarkers, whereas in pots treated with oil the community was dominated by actinomycetes, that slowly mineralized relatively stable organic carbon substrates 
 <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[81]</xref>, and micro eukaryotes which are grazers of microbial biomass. This activity of micro eukaryotes results in enhanced rates of nutrient recycling. The biomasses of these specific PLFAs were most abundant in these singly treated samples, seemingly due to competition release. In contrast, the microbial community in samples subjected to both treatments was not characterized by particular microbial clusters, displayed a high PLFA richness and low total PLFA biomass.
