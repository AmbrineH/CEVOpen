<p class="p">From the PCCA phase graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microbiol-03-04-938-g006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>), two major findings were revealed: (a) unique PLFA and enzymatic profiles for some treatments and (b) negative association of microbial biomass, particularly that of bacteria, with hydrolytic enzymes (apart from NAG activity). The first reflects unique microbial community structure and unique metabolic capacity of the communities in inoculated and non-inoculated pots at 60 days and in (−AMF, +OIL), (−AMF, −OIL) and +AMF pots independently of oil addition. This finding highlights the effect of inoculation on microbial community structure, although it is not clear herewith whether this effect is exclusively due to 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> or to bacteria that fungal spores carried. Also, it is noticeable to mention that only in non-inoculated pots the addition of essential oil resulted in distinct microbial community composition and enzymatic profile. Unique but strong related microbial and enzyme profiles were recorded by Kaiser et al.
