<p class="p">The benefits for some microbes induced by AMF inoculation and oil addition are potentially accompanied by negative influence on other microbial strains. Inspection of the Gram

 <sup class="sup">+</sup> bacteria are known to cope with severe side effects of compounds, such as atrazine 
 <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[66]</xref>, which could be partly explained by their relatively thick walls and ability to form endospores 
 <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[72]</xref>. Likewise, several monoterpenes, e.g. R-carvone which is the major constituent of the essential oil of

 <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[74]</xref>. Hence, the repeated weekly application of oil, for a period of one month, might cause damages to membranes of certain strains, while the cell wall structure may have helped other groups to overcome the severe effect of R-carvone. A shift in dominance among fungi and bacteria was declared by the inspection of the F/B ratio, and in our case was accompanied by analogous changes in the iso/anteiso ratio; both ratios increased their value in the non-inoculated pots. The higher values of the iso/anteiso ratio were considered indicators of nutrient limitation 
 <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[75]</xref>, and under these conditions the fungal growth seems to be mostly favored. Moreover, this nutrient limitation was recorded in pots without AMF, supporting the ideas that (a) AMF contribute positively to nutrients capture and (b) there is competition among arbuscular mycorrhizal and free living fungi for N and C
