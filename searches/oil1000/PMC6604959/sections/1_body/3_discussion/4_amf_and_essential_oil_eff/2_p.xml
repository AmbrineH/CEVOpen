<p class="p">The biomass of the various microbial groups was higher in samples subjected to single treatment, either with inoculum or essential oil, compared to control samples or to samples subjected to both treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microbiol-03-04-938-g004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Increase of microbial biomass with essential oils has been often reported and interpreted as resulting from the supply of a readily decomposable carbon source to microorganisms 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[19]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. Increase in NAG activity with oil addition could be attributed to the detrimental effect of oil on specific microbial strains as opposed to the beneficial effect on others 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[17]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[69]</xref>, leading to the predominance of chitinolytic bacteria 
 <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[70]</xref>. Alternatively, it could be considered a response to changes in microbial stoichiometric demand, according to the microbial resource allocation theory 
 <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[71]</xref>. Specifically, as essential oil provided a labile C source, microbial cells increased production of NAG to meet their demand in N.
