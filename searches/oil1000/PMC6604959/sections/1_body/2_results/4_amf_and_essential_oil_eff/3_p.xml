Biomass markers were negatively loaded on the first axis and pointed towards pots subjected to single treatments, either addition of oil or inoculation. On the contrary, enzymatic activity pointed either to pots subjected to both treatments or to control pots. Glutaminase and arylamidase were associated with control pots, while urease, asparaginase and phosphatase were associated with inoculated pots. Again, apart from the overlapping between +AMF, +OIL and +AMF, −OIL samples, the samples of the rest treatments were clearly distinct indicating unique PLFA and enzyme profiles.
