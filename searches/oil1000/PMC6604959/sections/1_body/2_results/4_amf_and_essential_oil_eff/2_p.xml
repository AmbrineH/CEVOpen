Lower values were recorded in control samples (−AMF, −OIL) followed by samples subjected to both treatments (+AMF, +OIL). Inoculation and essential oils affected microbial biomasses in opposite directions. Inoculation per se influenced significantly the ratios F/B and iso/anteiso biomarkers. High values of F/B and iso/anteiso ratios were recorded in the non-inoculated samples (−AMF) while the ratio Gram

 <sup class="sup">−</sup> was higher in oil treated samples. Regarding enzymatic activity, a joint effect of the two treatments was detected on asparaginase and glutaminase with the activities of both being high in the control samples and in samples subjected to both treatments. On the contrary, NAG and phosphatase activities were affected only by oil, though exhibiting a reverse pattern; NAG activity was higher in oil-treated samples while that of phosphatase in samples without oil (
