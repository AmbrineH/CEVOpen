<p class="p">The specific PLFAs profiles were further analyzed by PCCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microbiol-03-04-938-g007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The centroids of treatments' groups were not significantly distinguished along the first axis, whereas their discrimination along the second axis was significant (one way-ANOVA). The Gram
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> biomarkers i15:0, a15:0, 15:0, the Gram
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> marker 16:1ω9 and the microbial marker 14:0 were positively loaded on the second axis along with inoculated samples. In contrast, the actinomycetes marker 10Me18:0 and the micro eukaryotes markers 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0 were negatively loaded along the second axis running with non-inoculated but treated with essential oil samples.
