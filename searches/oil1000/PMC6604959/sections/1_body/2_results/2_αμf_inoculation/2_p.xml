<p class="p">There were no signs of AMF colonization of the non-inoculated pots even sixty days after the start of the experiment. In inoculated samples, appressoria were visible and low percentage colonization was observed at both first and second sampling dates; mean colonization rate were 0.13% and 0.77%, respectively. The addition of the essential oil resulted in the decrease of the mean abundance of formed arbuscules (from 0.75 to 0.15) (

The fact that the current study took place the period preceding the switch to the symbiotic phase was supported by the data collected at 66, 76 and 90 days after inoculation in inoculated pots. In 66 days the rate of root colonization and arbuscules' formation was 48.5% and 53% respectively.
