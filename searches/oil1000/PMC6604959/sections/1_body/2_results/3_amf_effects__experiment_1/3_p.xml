<p class="p">On the contrary, inoculation exerted a significant effect on the activity of arylamidase, glutaminase and urease, whereas sampling time had an effect on the activity of arylamidase, NAG and urease (

At the first sampling, the biomass of every microbial group examined was negatively affected by inoculation, whereas the activity of urease was positively affected. In contrast, at the second sampling, inoculation had a positive effect on bacteria and fungi and a negative one on micro eukaryotes. The activities of arylamidase and glutaminase were affected negatively by AMF and that of urease positively at this second sampling. Concerning the PLFAs ratios, their values were affected mainly by sampling time; they decreased from first to second sampling. Moreover, the iso/anteiso ratio was lower in inoculated pots compared to the non-inoculated ones.
