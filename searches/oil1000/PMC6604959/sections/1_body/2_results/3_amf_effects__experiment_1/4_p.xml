<p class="p">The ordination of treatments in relation to the biomass of the various microbial l groups, PLFA ratios and enzymatic activity values, as a result of the PCCA analysis, is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microbiol-03-04-938-g003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. One-way ANOVA applied on to the sample scores estimated for both axes revealed significant separation of treatments. Along the first axis, explaining 49% of data variability, the effect of sampling time was clearly depicted. The inoculation effect was expressed in relation to the second axis, in samples taken at the second sampling date. In fact, inoculated and non-inoculated samples from the second sampling date tended to be ordinated towards the opposite ends of the second axis, whereas the distance between their groups' centroids was significantly different from zero. In contrast, the distance between the centroids of the inoculated and non-inoculated groups taken at the first sampling date was not significantly different from zero. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microbiol-03-04-938-g003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, PLFA data were ordinated along with samples taken at the first sampling. In contrast, higher enzymatic activities were associated with samples from the second sampling. Specifically, high urease activity was ordinated along with inoculated samples, while high asparaginase and glutaminase activity were classified along with the non-inoculated ones. The lack of overlapping between inoculated and non-inoculated samples at the second sampling, figured on the PCCA plot, indicates unique PLFA and enzyme profiles associated with inoculation.
