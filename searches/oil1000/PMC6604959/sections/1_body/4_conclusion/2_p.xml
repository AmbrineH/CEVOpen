<p class="p">The results of this study showed that both AMF inoculation and essential oil modulate, either independently or in concert microbial biomass, microbial community structure and enzyme activity operating as selective forces during the fungal pre-symbiotic phase. In pots treated only with essential oil, microbial community was dominated by actinomycetes and micro eukaryotes. In contrast, in pots subjected concurrently to both treatments, the diverging effects of inoculation and oil on the composition of the microbial community compensated one another and resulted to a new microbial community, suggesting non-synergistic effects of these two agents. On the contrary, a synergistic effect of the two treatments was found for asparaginase and glutaminase activity since the higher activity was recorded in pots jointly treated with oil and AMF. Therefore, we could assume that these two agents of sustainable agriculture cannot be used concurrently during the pre-symbiotic phase. In order to suggest which of them results in increased fertility, further research on the concentrations of available soil nutrients, plant development and fungal colonization process is needed.</p>
