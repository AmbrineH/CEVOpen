<p class="p">Ten days after root inoculation, we reintroduced the pre-existing bacterial community of the soil, by adding a bacterial inoculum prepared from the initially collected soil. For the preparation of the bacterial inoculum, 10 g of the initially collected soil were mixed with 50 ml of deionized water, the soil suspension was filtered through a 21 Âµm sieve, and 10 ml of it was added to each pot near the rhizosphere zone. The 10-days delay between AMF inoculation and the addition of bacterial inoculum was necessary for plant-fungus interactions to take place
