Pots were surface sterilized (2 L volume) and filled with sterilized soil-sand mixture (1500 g in each pot at a soil:sand ratio 1:1 w/w). Soil was an acid (pH 5) sandy loam one, poor in organic carbon (C% 1.62) and nutrients (N% 0.096, Pextr 2.1 mg/100 g, K 1.62 mg/Kg, Ca 1.17 mg/Kg, Mg 0.18 mg/Kg and Na 0.136 mg/Kg). Its chemical properties ensured the successful colonization of plants with the AMF. Further, to eradicate the indigenous AMF and other soil borne biota, the soil-sand mixture was sterilized by autoclaving (4 h at 120 Â°C).
