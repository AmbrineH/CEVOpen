<p class="p">Six pots (three inoculated and three non-inoculated) were not further treated and were destructively sampled 30 days after the AMF inoculation as this time was sufficient for the development of the extraradical structures of 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> (Experiment 1). The remaining 12 pots (six inoculated and six controls) were further treated as follows: half of the inoculated pots (three) along with the three non-inoculated pots were treated with 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil. The spearmint oil was supplied by Etherio, Research and Commerce, Eratera, Greece and it was pure essential oil produced after distillation of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> plants. The major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> oil were carvone 63.9% and limonene 13.3% followed by 1,8-cineole, β-pinene, myrcene and α-pinene in percentages 7.1, 2.8, 2.4 and 1.4%, respectively. Thus, during the experimental period, a bifactorial design with two independent factors (AMF inoculation and oil addition) was set up. The oil was added at a weekly rate of 1.33 ml per pot, for a period of one month. The quantity of essential oil was according to a scheme developed and tested earlier and repeatedly applied since

 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse under natural light conditions for a two-month period (from mid-June to mid-August). During the period of plant growth, the day temperature ranged from 28–37 °C and the night temperature from 20–27 °C. The plants were watered daily in order to achieve 60% of the water holding soil capacity. No fertilizers were added.
