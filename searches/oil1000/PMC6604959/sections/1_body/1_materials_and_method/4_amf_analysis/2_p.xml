<p class="p">Plant roots were cleaned from any soil or sand particles by use of an ultrasonic bath at 50 Hz. Then, the roots were excised carefully with scissors or scalpel and forceps, as appropriate, and stored at −20 °C before use. Prior to estimating the colonization rate by AMF, all roots were put in 50% (v/v) ethanol at 5 °C. For the estimation of the AMF colonization, 40% stratified random root samples were used. Roots were rinsed with distilled water, and then stained with 0.05% (w/v) Trypan Blue in acidic glycerol. They were then incubated in 10% (v/v) KOH, at room temperature, for 24 h. The method was originally proposed by Koske and Gemma

 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[39]</xref>. Two slides from each sample containing 15 root fragments were mounted in glycerol. These fragments were observed under the microscope and the level of mycorrhizal colonization and abundance of arbuscules were estimated.
