<p class="p">The total amount of PLFAs was used to account for the total microbial biomass. The fatty acid nomenclature was according to Papadopoulou et al. 
 <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[44]</xref>. Overall, 21 fatty acid methyl esters were identified and considered for further analysis, including the internal standard 19:0. These are i15:0, a15:0, 15:0, i16:0, i17:0 which are indicators of Gram
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> bacteria 
 <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[46]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[47]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>, the bacteria indicators 16:0, 17:0 
 <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[49]</xref>, the Gram
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> bacteria indicator 16:1ω9c 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref> and the indicators of actinomycetes 10Me16:0, 10Me17:0, 10Me18:0 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[50]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[51]</xref>. All these are considered to be of bacterial origin only and were chosen to represent bacterial biomass. The 18:1ω9c and 18:2ω9,12 fatty acids are used as indicators of fungal biomass 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[49]</xref>, while the fatty acids 17:1, 18:0 and 14:0 are mainly of microbial origin. Finally, the PLFAs 20:0, 22:0, 23:0, 24:0 are considered as indicators of microeukaryotes (algae, protozoa, nematodes) 
 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[52]</xref>. Moreover, the ratios Gram
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>/Gram
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, fungi/bacteria (F/B) and iso/anteiso are estimated. Iso biomass is equal to the sum of i15:0, i16:0 and i17:0 biomasses, while anteiso is represented by the biomass of a15:0.
