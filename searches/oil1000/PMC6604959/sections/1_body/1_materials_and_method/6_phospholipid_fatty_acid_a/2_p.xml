<p class="p">Extraction and analysis of phospholipids from soil samples was performed always within a week, as described by Papadopoulou et al. 
 <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[44]</xref>. The steps are briefly the following: (i) extraction of lipids, (ii) separation of phospholipids by column chromatography, (iii) methylation of esterified fatty acids in the phospholipid fraction, (iv) chromatographic separation and identification of the main components on a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled with a Trace ISQ mass spectrometry detector, a split-splitless injector, and an Xcalibur MS platform. The column was a 5% phenyl methylsiloxane fused silica capillary column (HP-5MS, 26 m length × 0.250 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm). The injector and transfer line were at 250 °C, the interface at 275 °C, and electron energy in electron impact was 70 eV. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 120 °C (held for 7 min), then raised to 170 °C (4 °C/min) isothermally held for 3 min, and finally raised to 250 °C (3 °C/min) and held for 2 min. Helium was the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min; 1 µL of each sample was injected in the splitless mode (90 s). Mass spectrometry acquisition was carried out using the continuous [electron ionization (EI) positive] scanning mode from 40 to 500 amu. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were identified by (i) comparison of their relative retention times and mass fragmentation to those of authentic commercial fatty acids methyl esters standard mixtures FAME (47885-U) and BAME (47080-U) (Supelco, United Kingdom) and (ii) computer matching against a NIST98 commercial library, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD. Quantification of each fatty acid (in nmol g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was achieved by one point calibration against the GC response of the internal standard 19:0 ME. Under the above described conditions the GC response to 19:0 methyl ester was linear in the range of 25–200 µg ml
