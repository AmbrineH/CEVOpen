<p class="p">At each sampling occasion we followed a destructive sampling. From each pot we collected six subsamples (2 cm diameter × 15 cm height) at a distance of 5 cm in a circle around the plant. The subsamples were mixed in order to get one composite soil sample per pot. These composite samples were analyzed for PLFAs concentration and enzyme activities. Each composite sample was sieved through a 2 mm mesh to remove roots and organic debris and from 1 mm mesh to keep sand particles away. Then samples stored at a constant temperature at 4 °C until used, within the same week.</p>
