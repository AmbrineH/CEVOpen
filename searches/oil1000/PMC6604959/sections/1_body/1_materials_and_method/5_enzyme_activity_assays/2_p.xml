<p class="p">The activities of six soil enzymes were studied. These were 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphatase, urease, asparaginase, glutaminase and arylamidase. 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase activities were determined according to the procedures of Allison and Jastrow 
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[40]</xref>, as these were modified in order to be applicable for 96-well microplates. Approximately 1–2 g fresh soil (equivalent to 0.5 g dry weight) were added in 60 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and homogenized in a blender for 1 min. Then, 50 µL of homogenized soil slurry were combined with 150 µL substrate solution and incubated for 3 h (NAG) or 1 h (acid phosphatase) at 21 °C under constant shaking. Substrate solutions were 2 mM

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-acetylglucosaminide for NAG and 5 mM 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenyl-phosphate for phosphatase, all in acetate buffer. After incubation, 100 mL of the slurry-substrate supernatant (without soil particles) were carefully transferred to another microplate for colorimetric determination of product concentrations. The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-nitrophenol (pNP) reaction product from the phosphatase and NAG assays was measured at 405 nm, after addition of sodium hydroxide. Eight replicates were run per sample; in each case, we included appropriate controls to estimate the background absorbance of the substrate and homogenate. The activity of the two enzymes is presented in units of µmol pNP g
