<p class="p">The activities of asparaginase and glutaminase were determined according to the methods of Tabatabai 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[42]</xref>. Briefly, the methods are based on the determination of NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> released when soil is incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 0.1 M tris-hydroxymethyl-aminomethane (THAM) buffer, toluene and L-asparagine or L-glutamine for asparaginase and glutaminase, respectively. The NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> released was determined by treating the incubated soil sample with 2 M KCl containing Ag
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (to stop the enzymatic activity) followed by steam distillation of an aliquot of the resulting soil suspension with MgO. The activities of these enzymes were assayed on &lt;2 mm field-moist samples, at the optimal pH value, in duplicates and one control, and are expressed on a moisture-free basis. Moisture was determined after weight reduction when drying at 105 °C for 24 h.
