<p class="p">Urease activity was determined according to the methods of Sinsabaugh et al. 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[41]</xref>. The microplate configuration was similar to that described for the NAG assay. The concentration of urea in the assay wells was 20 mM. The plates were incubated at 20 °C for approximately 18 h. Ammonium released by the reaction was quantified using colorimetric salicylate and cyanurate reagent packages from Hach. Urease activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 610 nm. Activity is expressed as micromoles of ammonium released per hour per g soil (µmol NH
