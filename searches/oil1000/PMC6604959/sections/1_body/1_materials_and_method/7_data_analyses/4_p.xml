<p class="p">Prior to analysis, for both data sets, we estimated values for skewness, which indicated asymmetry in most variables. Therefore, we applied analyses of variance (ANOVA) by using the Generalized Linear Model package (Statsoft Inc. Tulsa, USA) for completely randomized full factorial designs, each with 2 × 2 treatments (three genuine replicates per treatment). In Experiment 1, AM fungus inoculation (levels: +AMF, −AMF) and time of sampling (levels: 1 and 2) were the independent variables, with Gamma and Log being the distribution and link functions, respectively. Similarly, a two-way analysis of variance was applied on the data of Experiment 2 with AM fungus inoculation (levels: +AMF, −AMF) and addition of essential oil (levels: +OIL, −OIL) being the independent variables.</p>
