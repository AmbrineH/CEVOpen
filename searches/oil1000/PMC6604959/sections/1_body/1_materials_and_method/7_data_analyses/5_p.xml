<p class="p">The Principal Component and Classification Analysis (PCCA) module of STATISTICA was chosen to explore further the effect of treatments on the values of enzymatic activity, PLFA of certain microbial groups, and PLFA ratios in each treatment. Due to differences in the measurement scales, data were rescaled in the range 0â€“1 before statistical analysis. Moreover, to correct non-normality in data distribution for actinomycetes biomass, the ratio F/B and the NAG activity, a square root for the first two variables and an inverse square root transformation for the latter were performed. The analysis was separately conducted for data from each experiment.</p>
