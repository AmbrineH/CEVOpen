<p class="p">It is difficult to detect the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) precisely by the unaided eyes because the cinnamon extracts are brown. Dilutions were used to dispense 0.1 ml into each of the sterile 96 wells of a standard tray. Each well contained 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/ml of test bacteria, serially diluted test samples, and tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium. The positive control well contained inoculated medium without test samples. Microdilution trays were incubated at 37°C for 20 hr in an ambient air incubator. For determination of minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), 100 μl samples were taken from wells of microdilution trays and spread on freshly prepared TSA plates, and then incubated at 37°C for 24 hr to determine the MBC. The MBC was regarded as the lowest concentration of the samples that allowed &lt;0.1% of the original inoculum treated with the extract or compound samples to survive and grow on the surface of the medium used. Triplicate samples were performed for each test concentration.
