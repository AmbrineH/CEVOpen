<p class="p">Agar‐well diffusion method was applied for the determination of antibacterial activity. All the bacterial strains were suspended in sterile physiological saline and diluted to the density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6 </sup>CFU/ml. The suspension of 100 μl was spread onto the surface of TSA medium. 4.6‐mm wells in diameter were cut from the agar, and 50 μl sample solutions were delivered into them. 5 mg/ml kanamycin was used as positive reference standard to determine the sensitivity of each microbial species. Negative controls were prepared using PBS solution. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) surrounding the wells. DIZ was expressed in millimeters. Tests were performed in triplicate.
