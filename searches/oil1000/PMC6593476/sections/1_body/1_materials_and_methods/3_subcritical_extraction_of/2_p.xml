<p class="p">Four 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species were extracted with n‐butane and ethanol separately using subcritical extraction methods. The extractions were conducted in a 5‐L extraction vessel. The parameters of subcritical n‐butane extraction were as follows: extraction time 30–50 min, temperature 30–50°C, and solvent‐to‐solid ratio 1–3. The parameters of subcritical ethanol extraction were as follows: extraction time 50–70 min, temperature 120–160°C, and solvent‐to‐solid ratio 12–16. The extracts were filtered and removed solvent by using rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C. The resulting extracts were kept at 4°C for further analysis. The percentage of extracts yield was calculated as the weight of extracts divided by the weight of bark powder.
