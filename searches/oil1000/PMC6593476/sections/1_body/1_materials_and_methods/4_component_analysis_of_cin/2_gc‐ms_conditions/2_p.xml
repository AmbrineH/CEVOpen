<p class="p">The n‐butane extracts were diluted in methanol and analyzed using Agilent GC System 6890 Series coupled to Agilent 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector. Samples were injected with an Agilent 7683 Series Autosampler. The injector temperature was 260°C, and injection was in splitless mode. The HP5‐MS column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness) was used with helium as a carrier gas (99.999% purity) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The GC oven temperature was raised from 75 to 190°C at the rate of 10°C/min, then raised to 280°C at the rate of 20°C/min, and held for 5 min. The temperature of transfer line and ion source was 260 and 200°C, respectively. Screening of the chromatograms was performed in scan mode from
