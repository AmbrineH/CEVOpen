<p class="p">The ethanol extracts were analyzed using Agilent 1100 Series LC/MSD Trap with an electrospray ion source (ESI). All data were acquired employing Agilent Quantitative Analysis data processing software. Chromatographic separation was achieved by gradient elution using Polaris C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>‐A column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Varian). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in methanol). The gradient program was as follows: 0–20 min, 50% B; 20–35 min, 50%–80% B; and 35–45 min, 80% B. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The UV detector was set at 280 nm. The LC elute was introduced directly into the ESI interface without flow splitting. The scan range of ESI‐MS was

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 120–1,200. The ESI voltage was 4.5 kV in positive ion mode. The velocity of 9 L/min and temperature of 325°C of drying gas were applied for ionization using nitrogen. The nebulizer pressure was 40 psi. Relative percentage amount of major components was calculated according to individual peak area and total peak area of LC chromatogram as mean values of three injections from each sample.
