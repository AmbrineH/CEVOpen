<p class="p">The aim of the present study was to assess the antibacterial activities of cinnamon extracts and to compare their effectiveness against four foodborne pathogens (two gram‐positive and two gram‐negative) by agar‐well diffusion assay and twofold microdilution broth method. The inhibition zone of the cinnamon extracts is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. The inhibition zone above 5 mm in diameter was taken as positive result. The results revealed that all the n‐butane extracts and ethanol extracts exhibited antibacterial activities to gram‐positive and gram‐negative pathogens with varying values. N‐butane extracts of cinnamon showed significant inhibitory effect against

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. anatum</italic> with inhibition zone from 18.98 to 37.45 mm. Ethanol extracts of cinnamon were potentially active against four foodborne pathogens with inhibition zones ranging from 7.11 to 10.11 mm. Both n‐butane extracts and ethanol extracts showed no significant differential between gram‐positive and gram‐negative bacteria.
