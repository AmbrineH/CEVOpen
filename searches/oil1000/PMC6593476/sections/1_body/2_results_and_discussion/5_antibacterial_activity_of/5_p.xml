<p class="p">Antibacterial activities of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> also have been investigated (Abdelwhab et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Broad‐spectrum antibacterial property was exhibited by essential oil which is in accordance with our research. Antibacterial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> extracts have not been reported according to the literature. Moreover, Shan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) reported that the 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> exhibited antibacterial properties with much higher MBC (≥2,500 μg/ml) to 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> than essential oil extracted by water (Awang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Gupta, Garg, Uniyal, and Kumari (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) found the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic>'s essential oil were more potent than 50% ethanol extract. Mukhtar and Ghori (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) demonstrated that antibacterial properties of ethanol extract of the cinnamon plant were more effective against both gram‐negative and gram‐positive bacteria than the aqueous extract. In consideration of extracts polarity, they were coincided with our study and can be deduced initially that the lower the polar extracts, the higher the antibacterial activity.
