<p class="p">The antibacterial activity has been attributed to the presence of some active compounds in the extracts, and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde is known to inhibit bacterial acetyl‐CoA carboxylase and responsible for major antibacterial activity (Lopez, Sanchez, Batlle, &amp; Nerin, 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The antibacterial action of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde is considered to obstruct the bacterial cell membrane and its structures which lead to ion leakage (Unlu, Ergene, Unlu, Zeytinoglu, &amp; Vural, 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Eugenol and linalool also have been reported to have antibacterial activity in direct contact (Herman, Tambor, &amp; Herman,

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde has been proven to possess stronger antibacterial activity in comparison with eugenol and linalool (Mith et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which could explain the higher antibacterial activity of
