<p class="p">The MBCs of cinnamon extracts were determined, and the results are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. N‐butane extracts of cinnamon were found much more sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. anatum</italic> than ethanol extracts, especially 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic>. The MBC values were ranged from 0.31 to 2.50 mg/ml for n‐butane extracts and 20.00 to 160.00 mg/ml for ethanol extracts. MBC values of N‐butane and ethanol extracts showed no significant differential between gram‐positive and gram‐negative bacteria which were in accordance with inhibition zone. N‐butane extracts of cinnamon had better antibacterial activities especially for 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> and more potential to be used as food biopreservatives than ethanol extracts.
