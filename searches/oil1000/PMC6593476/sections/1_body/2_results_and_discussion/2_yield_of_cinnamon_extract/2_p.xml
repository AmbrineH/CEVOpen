<p class="p">The parameters of subcritical extraction were optimized to get higher yield. The optimal conditions of subcritical n‐butane extraction were as follows: extraction time 45 min, extraction temperature 40°C, and liquid‐to‐solid ratio 2. The optimized parameters of subcritical ethanol extraction were as follows: extraction time 60 min, extraction temperature 150°C, and solvent‐to‐solid ratio 15. Extraction solvent and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species are major factors that influence the yield. The yields of n‐butane extracts for 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> were 3.45% and 2.95%, and for 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmanni</italic> were 1.89 and 1.56%, respectively

 <italic class="italic">.</italic> The yields of ethanol extract were much higher than n‐butane extract, which could be due to higher polarity of ethanol and also higher extraction temperature. More extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> were got than 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmanni</italic>. It is difficult to compare the yield with the literature. According to Geng et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), the yield of 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation varied within 0.41%–3.11%; not only the extraction method and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species, but also the age and segment (top, center, and lower) of the tree influence the yield.
