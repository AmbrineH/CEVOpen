<p class="p">The major components of extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species were different from each other. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde was one of the most important components occurring in four 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species, especially in 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic>. Linalool and citral were main compounds only in 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> and eugenol in 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic>. Coumarin was also important in 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic>. Some quantitative and qualitative differences were found in our study and other reports of cinnamon oils. Huang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and Li et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde was a major component and accounted for 66.28%–77.21% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> barks oil and 81.97% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> bark oil. Chairunnisa et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and Shan, Cai, Brooks, and Corke (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) found (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde was predominant component in 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> bark oil but with no eugenol was detected. According to the study of Tao et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamyl acetate (21.14%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde (16.46%), and linalool (7.65%) were major components in 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> bark oil. The sequence of major components in 
 <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> bark oil was different from our research. These results point out the method of extraction influencing the composition of extracts. Although in the same species, a variation of the compounds can be found in cinnamon plant which grows in different places (Guenther, 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Still, the major components in the same species are almost the same with different quantity.
