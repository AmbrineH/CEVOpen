<p class="p">Previous reports on 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> spices mainly focused on the essential oils, but fewer reports studied the nonvolatile components. He et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) used methanol as extraction solvent and RP‐HPLC to determine the components of cinnamon bark extracts, and only four characteristic components including cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were found. Shan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) extracted the 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> with 80% methanol, and 10 compounds, mainly (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins, were identified by LC‐MS. Gu et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) also reported that cinnamon contained very high levels of proanthocyanidins. The major components in polar extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> spices were basically in accordance with our study.
