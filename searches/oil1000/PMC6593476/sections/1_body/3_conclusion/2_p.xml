<p class="p">Subcritical n‐butane extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species were much more sensitive to foodborne pathogens than ethanol extracts, especially for 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic>. It can be attributed to the presence of the principle bioactive constituents, especially (
