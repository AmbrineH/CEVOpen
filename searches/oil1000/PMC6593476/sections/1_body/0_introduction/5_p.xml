<p class="p">Essential oil was extracted mostly by water distillation, if different polar solvents are used for bioactive compounds extraction, and subsequent solvent partition allows finer division into different polarity fractions. Subcritical extraction is an excellent extraction that has numerous advantages such as lower operating temperature and pressure, shorter extraction time, and environmental compatibility (Herrero, Cifuentes, &amp; Ibanez, 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). It can be used with different polarity subcritical fluids and considered a technological revolution in the extraction industry. Subcritical extraction used in cinnamon was researched only by Pramote et al. (

 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> using subcritical water and found the components might degrade during subcritical water treatment because of high temperature. Better results are more likely to get using different polar subcritical solvent with lower temperature in cinnamon extraction. N‐butane is used mainly as low‐polarity solvent because of excellent dissolving power for lipophilic components, and it needs lower subcritical pressure and temperature (Herrero et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Ethanol is a high polar solvent and widely used as subcritical solvent for more polar compound extraction and relatively safe for human (Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Subcritical temperature of ethanol is much lower than water. In this project, four important
