<p class="p">Foodborne illness outbreaks are common and often cause considerable morbidity throughout the world in recent years (Havelaar et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Natural substances of plant origin which have good antibacterial activities could be excellent resources to control microbial growth and reduce the incidence of food poisoning and spoilage. 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species have long been used in food not only for their flavor but also for their preservative properties (Geng et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31065-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Cinnamon bark essential oil, as one of the most important products of cinnamon, has been studied widely on compound compositions and antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens. Nevertheless, information regarding the different

The evaluation of antibacterial activities of cinnamon extracts would be useful for their applying in the prevention of food spoilage and deterioration and also in extension shelf life of foods.
