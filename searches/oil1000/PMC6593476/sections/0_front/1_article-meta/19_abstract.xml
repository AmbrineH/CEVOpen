 <p class="p">Four important 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species in China including 
  <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> were chosen to be extracted by subcritical n‐butane and ethanol. The chemical compounds of extracts were identified by GC‐MS and HPLC‐MS, and the antibacterial activities were evaluated by agar‐well diffusion assay and twofold microdilution broth method. There were 47 compounds identified in n‐butane extracts and 11 compounds in ethanol extracts totally. The major compounds in n‐butane extracts varied significantly among different 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species, and (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde and coumarin were major compounds for 
  <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> with area percentage of 74.32%; (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde and α‐copaene for 
  <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> with area percentage of 67.83%; linalool, (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde, and citral for 
  <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> with area percentage of 58.74%; and eugenol, (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde, and coumarin for 
  <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> with area percentage of 76.43%. The maximum compounds in ethanol extracts were (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde and (
  <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)‐cinnamaldehyde, and others varied among the 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species. All cinnamon extracts showed antibacterial activities that n‐butane extracts were much more sensitive than ethanol extracts. The inhibition zone for N‐butane extracts against 
  <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Salmonella anatum</italic> was from 18.98 to 37.45 mm while for ethanol extracts from 7.11 to 10.11 mm. The minimum bactericidal concentrations for n‐butane extracts were ranged from 0.31 to 2.50 mg/ml and for ethanol extracts ranged from 20.00 to 160.00 mg/ml. N‐butane extracts of 
  <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> processed much higher antibacterial activities than 
  <italic class="italic">C. wilsonii</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. burmannii.</italic> N‐butane extracts of 
  <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. loureiroi</italic> have the potential to be used as food biopreservative.
