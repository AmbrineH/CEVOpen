  <p class="p">CNB oil decreased cell viability and compromised cell membrane integrity in RSY150. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Growth curves of RSY150 exposed to 125, 62.5, 31.25 and 15.125 µg/mL of CNB oil, with absorbance measured at 30 min intervals to show the antifungal time course of the CNB oil. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Methylene blue staining of cells exposed to CNB concentrations as in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) showed decreased cell viability. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Corresponding CFU counts of viable CNB exposed cells as compared to control. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> Leakage of cellular content as a function of absorbance at 260 nm following exposure to CNB oil at concentrations as in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) confirm a dose dependent compromise of the cell membrane in (
