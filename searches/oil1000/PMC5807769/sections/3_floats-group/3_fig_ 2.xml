  <p class="p">CNB oil exposure induces a cell wall stress response with altered chitin distribution in RSY150. Epifluorescence (top panel) and bright field (bottom panel) images of CFW stained cells. Cells were grown in YPD in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) while cells in (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) were grown in YPD plus 10% serum for hyphal induction. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> RSY150 cells were incubated for 24 h with and without 1/2 and 1/4 MIC CNB oil in YPD media and stained with CFW. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Mid log phase RSY150 were exposed to MIC and 1/2 MIC for 4 h stained with CFW and imaged. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Cells grown in YPD with 10% serum were exposed to the same concentration as in (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) for 4 h, stained with CFW and imaged. (
