<p id="Par35" class="p">For accurate adhesive measurements of the cell surface, 1 μm QI™ AFM images (128 px
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> resolution) were captured at the center top of the cells to eliminate artifacts from cell curvature. The adhesive properties of both RSY150 (treated 7.1 ± 0.5 nN vs. control 5.5 ± 0.3 nN) and the clinical isolate (treated 7.6 ± 0.6 nN vs. control 5.7 ± 0.4 nN) were significantly increased (RSY150 p = 0.0016, clinical isolate p = 0.0025) in response to CNB oil. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b, f, j and d, h, l shows whole cells, high resolution images, roughness and adhesive forces on the center top of RSY 150 and clinical isolates, respectively, grown for 24 h in the presence of sublethal (62.5 μg/mL) CNB oil. Exposure to CNB oil altered cell shape, increased the average cell volume and roughness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>j, f), with a twofold increase in elasticity for RSY150 (treated 7.8 ± 0.9 GPa vs. control 4.7 ± 0.4 GPa) and the clinical isolate (treated 15.0 ± 2.7 GPa vs. control 8.1 ± 0.7 GPa) compared to their respective controls. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> shows a summary of these differences in RSY150 and the clinical isolate.
