<p id="Par28" class="p">To determine morphological changes, we analyzed bright field images of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> in stationary and logarithmic phases exposed to sublethal concentrations of CNB oil for 24 h. Stationary phase 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> RSY150 cells exposed to sublethal CNB were oval and swollen, with distinct changes in chitin distribution, but with normal budding compared to control cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, d). Epifluorescence images of stationary phase control RSY150 show an even distribution of chitin around the cell wall and septal region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, d). In contrast, cells treated with CNB oil at 62.5 μg/mL (1/2 MIC) had an increase in chitin content in the lateral cell wall and more intense staining at septal regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, d). This effect was absent at lower concentrations (31.625 μg/mL; 1/4 MIC) of CNB oil.
