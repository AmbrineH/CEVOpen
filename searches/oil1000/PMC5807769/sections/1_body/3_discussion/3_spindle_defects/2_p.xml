<p id="Par46" class="p">We observed pseudohyphal growth in CNB oil treated RSY150 at MIC, an effect which became less prominent at 1/2 MIC, a common response of yeast experiencing cell wall stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. For instance, toxins and chemicals that arrest cells in the S phase or mitosis display polarized growth due to activation of the CWI pathway [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>]. The CWI pathway activates the MAPK cascade to manage stress, and its components are key elements in controlling the cell cycle. There are three MAPK pathways, namely; the pheromone response pathway, the high osmolality glycerol (HOG) pathway and the

 <italic class="italic">SSU81</italic> knock-out mutant (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c) suggests that the HOG pathway is activated in the presence of CNB oil. Under stress there is cross talk between these pathways and cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in a delayed cell cycle [
