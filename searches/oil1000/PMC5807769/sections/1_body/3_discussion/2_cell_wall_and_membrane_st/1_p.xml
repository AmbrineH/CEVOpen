<p id="Par41" class="p">CNB oil treated RSY150 cells in the stationary phase had an irregular chitin distribution found on the lateral wall of budding cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Such effects became pronounced in metabolically active cells grown in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c, f), with intense chitin staining at the hyphal tip. Similar staining patterns have been reported for cells exposed to high sugar or salt concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>], for which hypo-osmotic pressure induced chitin synthesis or polymerization at the growing hyphal tip. Consistent with this idea is the larger cell volume of RSY150 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and sensitivity of the 
 <italic class="italic">SSU18</italic> mutant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c) exposed to CNB oil. Cell wall reinforcement with chitin in response to stress is a well-known phenomenon in yeast [
