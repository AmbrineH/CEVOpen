    </ext-link> Spindle morphology of cinnamaldehyde and linalool treated 
    <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. Live LSCM of mid log phase cells after 4 h exposure to MIC and 1/2 MIC of cinnamaldehyde and linolool. Cinnamaldehyde treated 
    <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> at MIC showed a similar spindle morphology of those treated with CNB oil at MIC, whereas linalool treated cells showed a complete absence of tubulin at MIC, with decreased cell size. At 1/2 MIC for both cinnamaldehyde and linalool, tubulin expression appeared as fluorescent spots near the nucleus. Bar = 5 μm.
