  <p class="p">(A) Testes of control mice showing active spermatogenesis within most of the seminiferous tubules. (B) Testes of BPA treated mice showing severe necrosis and loss of the spermatogonial layers with multiple spermatide giant cells formation (arrow) in most of the seminiferous tubules. (C) Testes of BPA treated mice showing congestion of the interstitial blood vessel, destructed and abnormal spermatid formation (thin arrow), spermatid giant cells (thick arrow) and loss of most of the spermatogonial cell layers. (D) Testes of PSO treated mice before BPA treatment showing marked protection of the spermatogonial cells layers with active spermatogenesis (arrow) in the lumen of some seminiferous tubules. (E) Testes of PSO treated mice concurrently with BPA showing necrosis of some spermatogonial cells (thin arrow) with starting of active spermatogenesis (arrow) in some other seminiferous tubules. (F) Testes of PSO treated mice after BPA treatment showing degeneration and pyknosis of some spermatognial cells with active spermatogenesis in some other tubule (arrow), notice interstitial edema (thin arrow).
