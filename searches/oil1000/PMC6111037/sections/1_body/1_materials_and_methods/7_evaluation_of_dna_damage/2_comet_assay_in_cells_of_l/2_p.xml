<p id="par0075" class="p">The comet assay was performed in liver and testes cells according to Bandyopadhyaya et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Briefly, 50 μL of cell suspension was mixed with 100 μL of 1% low melting point (LMP) agarose and added to fully frosted slides coated with 80 μL of 1% normal melting point (NMP) agarose. The cells were then incubated in a lysis solution (2.5 mol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> NaCl, 100 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> EDTA, 10 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> Tris−HCL, 1% Triton X-100, pH 10) at 4 °C for at least 2 h, at which the slides were placed into an alkaline solution (300 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> NaOH, 1 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> EDTA, pH 13) at 4 °C for 20 min so as to allow DNA unwinding, and electrophoresed at 25 V (300 mA) for 20 min. Finally, the slides were neutralized in a 400 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 15 min and stained with ethidium bromide (5 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Images of 50 randomly selected nuclei per experimental group were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 800, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with image analysis software (Comet Assay IV, Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, UK). Scored parameters included tail length, DNA percentage in tail and Olive tail moment (OTM). Tail length is the maximum distance that the damaged DNA migrates from the centre of the cell nucleus. DNA Percentage in tail is the DNA content that migrates from the nucleus into the comet tail. OTM is the product of the tail length and percentage DNA, which gives a more integrated measurement of overall DNA damage in the cell.
