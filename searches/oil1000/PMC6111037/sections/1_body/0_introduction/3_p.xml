 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. BPA causes hepatotoxic, mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic effects [

 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In addition, growing evidence indicates that the oxidative stress could be BPA mechanism to cause genotoxicity [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Moreover, Moustafa and Ahmed [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] data speculated that BPA long-term exposure depicted genomic damage, alterations in liver enzymes, lipid panel, antioxidant enzymes and reproductive hormones.
