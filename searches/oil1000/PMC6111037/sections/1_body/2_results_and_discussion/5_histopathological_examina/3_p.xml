<p id="par0150" class="p">As for the examined testicular tissue of BPA treated mice, it showed an obvious defective spermatogenesis that characterized by severe necrosis and loss of the spermatogonial layers with multiple spermatid giant cells formation in most of the seminiferous tubules. Congestion of the interstitial blood vessel, destructed and abnormal spermatid formation with spermatid giant cells and loss of most of the spermatogonial cell layers were observed as well. Some seminiferous tubules showed destructed materials in the lumen with multiple spermatid giant cells formation were also observed (
