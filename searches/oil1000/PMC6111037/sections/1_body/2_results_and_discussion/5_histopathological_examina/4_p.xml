<p id="par0155" class="p">The evaluation of histopathological alterations in liver and testes of treated male mice are comparable to the genetic findings. These findings are in agreement with Korkmaz et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] who noticed hepatic necrosis and congestion in the liver of BPA (25 mg/kg/day) treated male rats three times a week for 50 day. Moreover, Kalb et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] showed that male mice exposure to BPA (3000 μg/kg b.w.) through breast milk in the breastfeeding period caused testicular degeneration and aplasia in a number of seminiferous tubules of their testes.
