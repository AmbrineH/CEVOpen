 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The results revealed that the main fatty acids content in PSO are palmitic (17.53 ± 2.20), stearic (7.13 ± 0.40), oleic (14.80 ± 0.87) and linoleic (58.23 ± 2.31). Besides, some traces of linolenic acid (0.87 ± 0.30) and myristic (0.43 ± 0.15) were found. Furthermore, PSO phenolic and vitamin E content was (24 ± 1.5) and (70.69 ± 1.39) respectively. In addition, PSO at 200 μL exhibited an antioxidant activity of 82.13 ± 0.57.
