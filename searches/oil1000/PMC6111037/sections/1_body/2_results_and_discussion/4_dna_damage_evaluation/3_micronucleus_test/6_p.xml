<p id="par0135" class="p">Concerning PSO treatments that alleviated the BPA induction of DNA damage in tested cells, our results are in agreement with those reported by Elfiky et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. They found that oral administration of PSO for ten consecutive days either before or after treatment of azathioprine was effective in the reduction of DNA fragmentation and MNPCEs frequencies, meanwhile, improved the PCEs/NCEs ratio. Therefore, it might suggest that the protecting effects of PSO against BPA genotoxicity could be due to their content of varied bioactive compounds, which were mentioned early.
