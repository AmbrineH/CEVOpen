 <p class="p">Urinary tract infections (UTIs), caused by 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> 80% to 85% of the time, are one of the most important causes of morbidity and health care spending affecting persons of all ages. These infections lead to many difficult problems, especially increasing resistance to antibiotic drugs. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs, responsible for persistent infections leading to recurrences and relapses. In this study, we have investigated the antibacterial activity of five medicinal plant essential oils against UTIs caused by 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> using disc diffusion and minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) methods. In addition, biofilm inhibitory action of oils was realized by crystal violet. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis showed a variability between oils in terms of compound numbers as well as their percentages. Antibacterial activity was observed only in cases of 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum majorana</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus zygis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, while 
  <italic class="italic">Juniperus communis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic> did not showed any effect towards 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates. 
  <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> essential oil demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates, followed by 
  <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>. Further, oils showed high biofilm inhibitory action with a percentage of inhibition that ranged from 14.94% to 94.75%. 
  <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> oil had the highest antibiofilm activity followed by 
  <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic>. Accordingly, tested oils showed very effective antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> UTIs and can be considered as good alternative for antibiotics substitution.
