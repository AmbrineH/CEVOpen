<p class="p">Recently, treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> infection has become more difficult. This is due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. This finding demonstrated the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of medicinal plant EOs, especially 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic>. Therefore, we propose these oils as alternatives to antibiotics and potential sources of new chemotherapeutic drugs because of their diverse and non- toxic effect.
