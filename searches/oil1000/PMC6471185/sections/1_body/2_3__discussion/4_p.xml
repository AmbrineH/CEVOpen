<p class="p">Biofilm formation has been associated with medical devices including catheters, ventilators, contact lenses and their treatment becomes increasingly difficult. Thereby, the use of a new natural compound in order to inhibit or eradicate biofilm is of great importance. In this investigation, antibiofilm activity of EOs demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> had an effect on 50% of the isolates with a percentage of inhibition ranging from 14.94% to 88.21%, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> presented activity on 63.63% of the isolates with a percentage of inhibition varying from 17.81% to 85.81%, and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> showed an antibiofilm effect on 86.36% of the isolates with a percentage of inhibition ranging from 28.84% to 94.75%. Thereby, 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> EO has the highest biofilm inhibition activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> followed by 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic>. Despite the high antibacterial effect observed in the cases of 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, it appears that the oil with the highest antibiofilm activity has the lowest antibacterial effect and this result has been confirmed by statistical analysis. Indeed, a non-significant correlation was found between the MIC of oils and antibiofilm activities. Based on biochemical composition, 1.8-cineole present in 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> does more to inhibit the biofilm formation compared to the linalool and terpinen-4-ol present in 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> Eos, which are the compounds with the highest content. The inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> biofilm found in this study suggests that the addition of EOs prior to biofilm formation may contribute to eliminate planktonic cells, and additionally convert the abiotic surface to be less susceptible to cell adhesion. Pretreatment of the surface with plant extracts produces an unfavourable film that promotes detachment, thereby reducing the surface adherence [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], eucalyptus [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and tea tree oil [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Moreover, in this study, we found for the first time that 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> EOs play a role in the inhibition of biofilm formed by 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> UTIs. According to Ceylan et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], the amount of biofilm formed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was reduced to 60.76% after treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> EO. EOs could diffuse through the polysaccharide matrix of the mature biofilm and destabilize it due to strong intrinsic antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Additionally, the anti-adherent activity is explained by the alteration of bacterial surface proteins due to their interactions with oils. This will inhibit the initial attachment phase to the abiotic surface [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. These results support the medical application of these oils for the prevention and/or treatment of certain infections and diseases.
