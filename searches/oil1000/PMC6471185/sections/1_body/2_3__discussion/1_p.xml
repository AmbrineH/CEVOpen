 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> accounts for approximately 85% of community acquired UTIs and 50% of hospital acquired UTIs [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. According to Iqbal et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], factors like age, gender, immuno-suppression and urological instruments may affect the prevalence of UTIs. This study was carried out on 50 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates, among them four strains isolated from female children and three strains isolated from male children. Based on gender we noted the predominance of females, and based on age we noted the predominance of adults with UTI. The adult females have the highest prevalence in UTI than males, as well as in case of the child. This is in accordance with results developed by Daoud and Afif in Lebanon [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and Kumar et al. in India [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. According to these authors, the prevalence of UTIs in females is principally owing to anatomic and physical factors.
