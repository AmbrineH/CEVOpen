<p class="p">Results of the biofilm formation on polystyrene showed that 44% of the isolates (22 isolates) were able to form biofilm with OD570 values ranging from 0.102 to 0.543 and were considered as low-grade positive. Biofilm development is estimated to be responsible for over 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of all microbial infections [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], biofilm markedly impedes the treatment of UTIs by protecting encased bacteria from both the host immune response and antimicrobial therapy. This can explain the prevalence and the persistence of
