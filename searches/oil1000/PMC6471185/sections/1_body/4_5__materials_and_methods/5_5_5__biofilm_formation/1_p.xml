<p class="p">Biofilm formation by 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates was determined using 96-well microtiter plates, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Strains were grown in Trypticase Soy broth (TSB, Pronadisa, Spain). Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the optical density (OD600) of bacterial culture was measured. An overnight culture, grown in TSB at 37 °C, was diluted to 1:100 in TSB supplement with 2% (

Wells with sterile TSB alone served as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cultures were removed and the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (7 mM Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, 3 mM NaH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and 130 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) to remove non-adherent cells and dried in an inverted position. Adherent cells were fixed with 95% ethanol and stained with 100 μL of 1% crystal violet (Merck, France) for 5 min. The excess stain was rinsed and poured off and the wells were washed three times with 300 μL of sterile distilled water. The water was then cleared and the microplates were air-dried. The optical density of each well was measured at 570 nm (OD570) using an automated Multiskan reader (GIO. DE VITA E C, Rome, Italy). Biofilm formation was interpreted as highly positive (OD570 ≥ 1), low-grade positive (0.1 ≤ OD570 &lt; 1), or negative (OD570 &lt; 0.1).
