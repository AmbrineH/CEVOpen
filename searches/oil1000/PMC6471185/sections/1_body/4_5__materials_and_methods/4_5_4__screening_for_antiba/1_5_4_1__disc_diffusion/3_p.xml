<p class="p">Inhibitory action was categorized according to the zone of inhibition (ZI) as described by El-Deeb et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. These categories were: Strong inhibitory action (++++), ZI &gt;/=22 mm; complete inhibitory action (+++), ZI = 18–21 mm; partial inhibitory action (++), ZI = 14–17 mm, slight inhibitory action (+), ZI ≤ 13 mm or no inhibitory action (–), ZI = 0. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean diameter of the inhibition zone was recorded.
