<p class="p">Bacterial inoculums were streaked onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA) agar plates using a sterile swab. A sterile filter disc (diameter 6 mm, Whatman paper N° 3) was used. The disc was impregnated by the tested EOs (10 μL /disc). The Petri dishes were placed at 4 °C for 1–2 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of growth inhibition around the discs after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Standard discs (6 mm diameter) of the antibiotic Gentamycin (10 μg) served as positive antibacterial control. Inhibition zone diameters around each disc were taken as a measure of antibacterial activity. </p>
