<p class="p">The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for all isolates as described by Gulluce et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Bacterial strain inoculums were prepared from 12 h broth cultures and suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity. EOs were first diluted to the highest concentration (50 mg/mL) to be tested, and then serial two-fold dilutions were made in 5 mL of nutrient broth with concentrations ranging from 0.012–50 mg/mL. The 96-well plates were prepared by dispensing 95 μL of nutrient broth and 5 μL of the inoculum into each well. A 100 μL aliquot from the stock solutions of each EO was added into the first well. Then, 100 μL from the serial dilutions were transferred into 11 consecutive wells. The last well was used as the negative control containing 195 μL of nutrient broth without EO and 5 μL of the inoculum. The final volume in each well was 200 μL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The experiment was carried out in duplicate. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the compounds to inhibit the growth of the microorganisms. The MBC values were determined by subculturing 20 μL from clear wells of the MICs test on MHA. MBC values were defined as the lowest concentration of sample, which resulted in ≥99.9% kill of the initial inoculum [
