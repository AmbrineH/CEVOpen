<p class="p">One hundred microliters of the EOs emulsified in TSB supplement with 2% glucose were added to the U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate containing 100 μL of bacterial suspensions (10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ mL) in each well. The final concentrations of the EOs were equivalent to MIC and the final volume was 200 μL per well. The assays were conducted in triplicate. After incubation of microplates at 37 °C for 24 h, the formed biofilm was quantified by crystal violet as described previously. Controls were prepared by replacing the inoculums volume by TSB, and EOs by sterile water. Inhibition of biofilm was determined from the formula described by Jadhav et al. [
