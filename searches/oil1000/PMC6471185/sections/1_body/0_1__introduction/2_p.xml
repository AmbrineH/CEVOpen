 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> contains many virulence factors that allow bacteria a resistance to various host defense mechanisms. Among them, type 1 fimbriae and pili are involved in adherence to host cells and invasion [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], while toxins and flagella play an important role in pathogen dissemination. Biofilm formation can be considered as the urovirulence determinant responsible for the long-lasting persistence of bacteria in the genitourinary tract [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Urinary catheters destroy natural barriers and provide a nidus for infection by serving as a substrate for biofilm formation. Several studies have demonstrated that biofilm cells are more resistant to antimicrobial agents than planktonic bacterial cells [
