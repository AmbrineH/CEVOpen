<p class="p">Antibacterial effect of EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> studied by the disc diffusion method is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01161-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Antibacterial activity was observed only in cases of 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, while 
 <italic class="italic">J. communis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic> did not show any effect on the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates. Of the three oils, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> EO showed strong inhibitory action (90% of the isolates), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> which have a strong inhibitory action on 26% and 14% of the isolates, respectively. Furthermore, based on the high percentage of antibacterial effect, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> EO had a strong inhibitory action on 90% of the isolates, 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> had a complete inhibitory action on 60% of the isolates and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> had a slight inhibitory action on 42% of the isolates. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> EO appeared as the best antibacterial compound, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> ranked third. Based on the gender and age of the specimens, globally, we have observed the same results in cases of total isolates. 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> was considered as an EO with strong inhibitory action followed by 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>.
