<p class="p">Antibacterial activity of EOs was evaluated by determining minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) in relation to the 50 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates and reference strain (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01161-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The MIC values of 
 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> EO ranged from 0.19 mg/mL to 0.78 mg/mL, while the MBC values ranged from 1.56 mg/mL to 12.5 mg/mL. These results indicated that bacteria isolated from female children (MIC from 0.19 to 0.39 mg/mL and MBC at 1.56 mg/mL) were more sensitive to this oil compared to other isolates. Further, strains isolated from male adults were the most resistant with MBC values going up 12.5 mg/mL.
