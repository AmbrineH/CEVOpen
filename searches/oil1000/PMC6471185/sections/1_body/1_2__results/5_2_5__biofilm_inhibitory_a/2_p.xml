 <italic class="italic">O. majorana</italic> EO showed an antibiofilm effect on 50% of the isolates (11 strains). Among them, 8 isolates (36.36%) became biofilm negative but no effect was reported on the reference strain with percentage of inhibition ranging from 14.94% to 88.21%. For 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic>, we observed antibiofilm activity on 63.63% of the isolates (14 strains) with a percentage of inhibition varying from 17.81% to 85.81%. Further, 9 isolates (40.9%) changed from low-grade positive to biofilm negative in addition to the reference strain. 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> EO demonstrated an antibiofilm effect on 86.36% of the isolates (19 strains). Among them, 17 isolates (77.27%) became biofilm negative in addition to the reference strain. The percentage of inhibition ranged from 28.84% to 94.75%.
