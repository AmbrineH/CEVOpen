<p class="p">Fifty 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> UTI isolates were screened for their abilities to form a biofilm on polystyrene surface (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01161-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The results showed that 44% of the isolates were able to form biofilm with optical density 570 (OD570) values ranging from 0.102 to 0.543 and were considered as low-grade positive, whereas the other strains did not show any biofilm formation. The majority of biofilm-forming bacteria were isolated from adult female samples (17 isolates), while only one strain was isolated from a child. Five strains isolated from males were considered as low-grade positive. Reference 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 appeared as a low-grade positive biofilm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was a non-significant effect of age (F = 0.758, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) or gender (F = 0.489, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) of the specimen on biofilm formation.
