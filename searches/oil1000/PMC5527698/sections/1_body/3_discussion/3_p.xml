<p class="p">Hence, it is clear that menthol is the principal major component of the studied EO, which is in agreement with several other works.[

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] Regarding other components, our results diverge from those published by other authors; in fact, the team research of Laghouiter

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] has found that 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> from South Algeria is composed by trans-carveol (58.98%), D-limonene (19.94%), carvone (2.07%), and 4-terpineol (3.01%); hence, Yadegarinia

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] showed that EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> from Iran presented a significantly different chemical composition, consisting of a-terpinene (19.7%), isomenthone (10.3%), trans-carveol (14.5%), piperitenone oxide (19.3%) and Î²-caryophyllene (7.6%).
