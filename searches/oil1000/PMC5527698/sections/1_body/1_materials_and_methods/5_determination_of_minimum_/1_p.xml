<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in 96-well microplate using the microdilution assay according to Balouiri 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] with slight modifications. Bacteriological agar at 0.15% (w/v) was used as an emulsifier of the EO in the culture medium. For bacteria, the EO was serially diluted in Muller-Hinton broth supplemented with agar to obtain final concentrations ranging between 8% and 0.007% (v/v). The 12
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well was considered as growth control (free-EO control). Then, 50 μl of bacterial inoculum, previously prepared and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland, were added to each well to reach the final concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ml. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, 10 μl of resazurin was added to each well as bacterial growth indicator. After a further incubation at 37°C for 2 h, the bacterial growth was revealed by coloration change from purple to pink.
