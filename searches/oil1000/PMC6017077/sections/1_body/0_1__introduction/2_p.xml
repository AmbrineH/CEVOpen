<p class="p">Along with the therapeutic properties, an important role is represented by the possibility of using SEO and TEO as viable alternatives to synthetic products with herbicidal or antifungal activity. The antifungal properties of the analysed EOs and their constituents against

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In this regard, the main compound of TEO - thymol, is responsible for inhibiting the fungal growth and mycotoxins synthesis. Various mechanisms of action for volatile oils on microbial cells have been proposed over time. Thus, the volatile oils can affect both the outer coating of the cell and the cytoplasm. Their hydrophobic character appears to be responsible for disturbing the bacterial structures that lead to the increasing of the cytoplasmic membrane permeability [
