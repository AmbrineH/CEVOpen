<p class="p">Allelopathy is defined as the ability of a plant to produce biomolecules, especially secondary metabolites that may affect another plant beneficially, or vice versa [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The biochemical interactions between plants can have many practical applications in agriculture. Certain allelochimic compounds have been shown to be effective as herbicides. EOs of aromatic plants are explored to find out possible herbicides, since they do not persist in soil or contaminate the ground water and cause little or no mammalian toxicity [

 <italic class="italic">Amarantus retroflexus</italic> L.,
