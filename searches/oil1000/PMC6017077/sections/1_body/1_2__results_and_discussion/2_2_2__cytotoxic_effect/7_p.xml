<p class="p">The essential oils of two thymus species, namely 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus linearis</italic> Benths., and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus serpyllum</italic> L. from the Pakistan flora, have been screened for antiproliferative effects against two human cancer (MCF-7-breast and LNCaP-prostate carcinoma) and one fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cell lines. Both volatile oils showed antiproliferative potential on the above mentioned cell lines, but the effectiveness of the volatile oil obtained from
