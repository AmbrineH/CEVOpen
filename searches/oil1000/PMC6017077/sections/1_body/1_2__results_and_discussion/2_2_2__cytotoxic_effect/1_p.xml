<p class="p">Among the two volatile oils, SEO was more active in terms of inhibition of proliferation for the two tested melanoma cell lines. The inhibitory activity was linear with the concentration and quite similar for A375 human melanoma and B164A5 mouse melanoma cell lines. The lowest tested concentration of SEO (50 μg/mL) caused an inhibition ratio of 34% for the murine melanoma cell line and 39% for the human melanoma cell line, while a tested concentration of 100 µg/mL SEO lead to an inhibition ratio of 50.5% for the murine melanoma cell line and 47.5% for the human melanoma cell line. TEO at a tested concentration of 50 µg/mL induced an inhibition ratio of 19.5% for B164A5 cell line and 17.5% for A375 cell line, while a concentration of 100 µg/mL resulted in an inhibition ratio of 30% for B164A5 cell line and 27% for A375 cell line, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00185-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Regarding the essential oils mixture (EOsM), the use of a concentration of 50 µg/mL conducted to a percentage of inhibition of 30% for B164A5 cell and 26.5% for A375 cells. The antiproliferative effect increases with the concentration of EOs.
