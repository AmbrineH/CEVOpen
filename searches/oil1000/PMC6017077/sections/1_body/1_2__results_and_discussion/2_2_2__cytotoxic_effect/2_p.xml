 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In a comprehensive study, Russo et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] have analyzed the chemical composition, and the growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic properties against A375, M14, and A2058 human melanoma cell lines of the SEO grown in eighteen different environmental conditions. The species showed in a different manner antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties on the selected melanoma cell lines, thus, demonstrating that the environmental and pedoclimatic conditions have a vital role on the chemical composition of volatile oil, and also, on the biological activity.
