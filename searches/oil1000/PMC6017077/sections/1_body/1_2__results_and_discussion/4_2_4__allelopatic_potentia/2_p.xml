<p class="p">Our results have proven that SEO showed herbicidal effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> L. (ARET), even when it was used at low concentrations. Thus, when SEO was applied at a level of 0.3%, the inhibition of germination was 92.1%, while by increasing the level of SEO to 0.6% or 1.0%, total inhibition of germination of ARET seeds occurred. Controlling the germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium album</italic> L. (CALB) weeds by using Dual Gold is 100% effective at recommended dose of 1 L per hectare. The same value of germination inhibition rate (GI) of CALB weed is also achieved by spraying the seeds with SEO at a level of 1.0%. The herbicidal capacity of SEO decreases with the dose. Thus, by applying SEO at a level of 0.6% resulted of 55.5% value of GI, while a dose of 0.3% SEO led to 22.2% value GI.
