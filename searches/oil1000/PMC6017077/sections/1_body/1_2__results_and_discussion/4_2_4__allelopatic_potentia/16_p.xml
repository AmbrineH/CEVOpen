<p class="p">Our results revealed significant differences in the inhibitory effect of the investigated EOs on germination capacity of wheat and tomato versus weed species. These findings could be assigned to the different rates to metabolize certain monoterpenes [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Wheat and tomato seeds were less affected than the weed seeds species, which highlights that the EOs, applied in a proper dose could be recommended as a bio herbicide for weed control.
