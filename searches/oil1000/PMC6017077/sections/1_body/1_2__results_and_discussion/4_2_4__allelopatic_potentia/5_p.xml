<p class="p">Using SEO al a level of 0.3% it was noted a decrease in the germination inhibition of tomato seeds up to 14.8%, respectively up to 8.3% in wheat seeds, as compared to the synthetic herbicide that showed a better ability to inhibit the seeds germination (76.8% for tomatoes and 47.2% for wheat). Thus, there are no significant differences versus DG as positive control by using SEO as an herbicidal agent for ARET, CALB seeds (except 0.6% SEO when the statistical differences were significant, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and EGAL (except 1.0% SEO when the statistical differences were significant, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). SEO applied at a level of 1.0% induced significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) versus positive control in GI of tomato seeds, while no significant differences versus positive control were recorded in the GI of wheat seeds.
