<p class="p">The previous studies have highlighted the bio-herbicidal effects of EOs belonging to Lamiaceae family (oregano and rosemary) on weeds control and germination growth of bread wheat cultivars [

 <italic class="italic">Sinapis arvensis</italic> L., but not against 
 <italic class="italic">Avena sterilis</italic> L. seeds. Moreover, these seeds have survived at all doses of oregano and rosemary EOs. Other studies [

When compared with the control, peppermint oil has been the more effective in inhibiting ryegrass seed germination.
