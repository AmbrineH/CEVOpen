<p class="p">The antifungal potential of TEO has been demonstrated also on other types of fungi. Thus, the study performed by Tantaoui-Elaraki et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] investigated the effect of TEO on 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus parasiticus</italic> in vitro conditions and reported that the minimum inhibitory concentration for this type of fungi was 0.1%. Also, it has been proved that TEO has shown a strong antifungal activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Verticillium dahliae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> sp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillius</italic> sp. [

 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic>, essential oils it has been found that TEO showed the lowest inhibitory concentration against the fungal growth [
