<p class="p">In TEO, the 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene and thymol were identified as the major compound in proportion of 68.415% and 24.721% respectively. These results are in agreement with those previously published by other authors, who reported that the major component of thyme essential oil is thymol, a monoterpene phenol derivative of cymene [
