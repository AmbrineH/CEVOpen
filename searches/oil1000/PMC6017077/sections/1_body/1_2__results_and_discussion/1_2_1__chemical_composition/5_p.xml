<p class="p">The content of volatile compounds and the dominant chemotype varies with botanical specie, geographical origin, and the harvest time. Therefore, the study carried out by Imelouane et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] have revealed camphor as the major compound (39.390%) of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil cultivated in Morocco, while Hudaib et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] have identified carvacrol, as the main chemotype of this essential oil. In another study conducted by Schmidt et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], linalool has been found as the major compound of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil (72.5%).
