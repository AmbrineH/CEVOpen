<p class="p">Our previous study has identified the presence of camphor (20.4%), eucalyptol (11.7%), camphene (11.5%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (9.5%) as major compounds of the SEO that has been isolated from sage originating from western Romania [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Camphor has been reported as the main compound in different other studies [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], while other authors have identified 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone as main chemical compound [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The major similarity between the studies around the world regarding the SEO composition is represented by the fact that α-thujone was identified as the major compound, followed by camphor in a percentage of 20–25% of the total amount of chemical compounds.
