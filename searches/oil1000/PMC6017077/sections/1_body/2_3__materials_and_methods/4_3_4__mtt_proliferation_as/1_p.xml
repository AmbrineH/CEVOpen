<p class="p">The inhibition of proliferation for the screened extracts was assessed for A375 human melanoma and B164A5 mouse melanoma cell lines. The above-mentioned cell lines where acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Company, Ayrshire, UK. Cells were cultured in complete growth medium containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany), 1.0% Penicillin/Streptomycin mixture (Pen/Strep, 10,000 IU∙mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, FCS; PromoCell), and 2% HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; Gibco BRL). Antiproliferative activity was assessed by MTT assay. On this purpose, the two melanoma cell lines were seeded onto a 96-well culture plate at a cellular density of 6000 cells per well and were attached to the bottom of the well overnight. After 24 h, 100 μL of new medium containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 50 µg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respective 100 µg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of the tested samples (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide—DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich Company) were added and incubated for 72 h. The melanoma cells were then assayed by the addition of 10 μL of 5 mg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution from the MTT-based in vitro toxicology assay kit (Tox-1; Sigma-Aldrich Company). The intact mitochondrial reductase converted and precipitated MTT as blue crystals during a 4 h contact period. The precipitated crystals were dissolved in 100 μL of lysis solution provided by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich Company). Finally, the reduced MTT was spectrophotometrically analyzed at 570 nm, using a microplate reader Bio-Rad Mark Microplate Spectrophotometer).
