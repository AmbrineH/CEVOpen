<p class="p">The in vitro antifungal potential of SEO and TEO has been evaluated on CYGA medium (cloraphenicol-yeast-glucose–agar) (Sigma Aldrich Chemie, Madrid, Spain) for mycelium radial growth (RG) of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> (Fg 06_17). The fungus was acquired from Microbial Collection of Microbiology Department, Faculty of Horticulture, and Forestry. The method used was “poisoned food technique” which involves the introduction into the culture media of different amounts of essential oil [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Thus, in our study, SEO and TEO were individually applied at three concentrations of 0.06%, 0.12% and 0.2%. To investigate the synergistic effect of the two investigated oils, the essential oils mixture (EOsM) in equal proportion (

 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> mycelium as inoculums was get from a four days young mycelium obtained from single spore technique, [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-23-00185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Plugs, with 8 mm diameter were harvested from edge of mycelium and transferred on CYGA media added with EOs. Three plugs for each variant were used as replicates. The Petri dishes at 24 ± 30 °C in reverse position and a photoperiod of 12 h/day were incubated. In the 5th day, was recorded the mycelium radial grow value (RG) expressed in mm, calculated as arithmetic mean of the two perpendicular diameters, using a ruler. The mycelium growth area (MGA) was estimated using the formula:
