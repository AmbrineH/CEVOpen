<p class="p">For EO concentrations where no fungal growth was recorded, the confirmation test was performed. This involved the transfer of fungal plugs on fresh CYGA without EOs addition. In the case that after four days there was not recorded any fungal growth, the EO concentration from which the transfer has been performed is considered to have a fungistatic effect. Contrary, if it was noticed any fungus revival, the EO concentration from the medium on which the transfer was made is considered to be fungicidal.</p>
