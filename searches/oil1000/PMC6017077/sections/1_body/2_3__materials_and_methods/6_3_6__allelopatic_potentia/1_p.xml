<p class="p">Seeds were sterilized by using sodium hypochlorite solution (1:9), and washed two times with distilled water. A total of 10 seeds from each plant were placed in a Petri dish. Then, the seeds were treated with each essential oil at a level of 0.3%, 0.6% and 1.0%. The dilutions of EOs were done with distillated water. To point out the synergism of the investigated oils, the EOsM in equal proportion (

Two control samples have been carried out, as follows: a negative control with water and a positive control with 0.003% Dual Gold 960 EC (s-metolachlor) by SYNGENTA (GD). The Petri dishes were transferred to a growth chamber and kept at 25 °C into the dark. The number of germinated seeds in each Petri dish was recorded after seven days. A seed was considered germinated when the radicles was elongated up to 3 mm. The germination percentage was determinate using the Equation (3) [
