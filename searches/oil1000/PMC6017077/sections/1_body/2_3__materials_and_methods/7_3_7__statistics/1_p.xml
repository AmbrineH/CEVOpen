<p class="p">The results of this study were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All of the in vitro experiments for assessing the anti-proliferative potential of EOs and their mixtures have been performed on two micro plates in quadruplicates for each tested substance. Student’s T-Test (Microsoft Excel 2007) was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of differences recorded within the data regarding the allelopatic potential EOs and their mixtures. Each group was individually compared with the positive control and the statistical differences were shown, as follows: *: significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05); **: highly significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01); ***: extremely significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001); and, ns: non-significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Also, the statistical analysis of the results concerning the antifungal activity has been performed on the base of Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>-Test.
