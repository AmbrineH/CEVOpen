 <p class="p">The xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity and thermostability of 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microencapsulated with β-cyclodextrin were evaluated in this study. The yield of leaf oil microcapsules was 86.3% using the optimal reaction conditions at the leaf oil to β-cyclodextrin ratio of 15:85 and ethanol to water ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:5. Based on the FTIR analysis, the characteristic absorption bands of major constituent, 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde, were confirmed in the spectra of leaf oil microcapsules. According to the dry-heat aging test, β-cyclodextrin was thermostable under the high temperature conditions, and it was beneficial to reduce the emission of 
  <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil. Leaf oil microcapsules exhibited high xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 83.3 µg/mL. It is concluded that the lifetime of 
  <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil can be effectively improved by microencapsulation, and leaf oil microcapsules possess superior xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity.
