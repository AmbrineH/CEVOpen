<p class="p">The composition of the leaf oil was analyzed by using a Thermo Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph and a Polaris Q MSD mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (Crossbond 5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane, 30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was initially held at 60 °C for 1 min, then increased to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and held for 2 min, and finally increased to 250 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held for 3 min. Carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the split ratio was 1:10. Components were identified by comparing their mass spectra (
