 <sub class="sub">35</sub>, 5 g) was dissolved in ethanol/water solution (300 mL) at 50 °C for 5 min, then the solution was cooled down to 25 °C. Next leaf oil (0.88 g) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) and added to the β-cyclodextrin solution with stirring at 600 rpm for 1 h. The solution was refrigerated for 12 h at 4 °C; the precipitated microcapsules (complex crystals) were vacuum-filtered and washed with 50 mL of distilled water. Microcapsule powders were dried at 50 °C in an oven for 24 h until the powder weight remained constant. The yield of microcapsules was calculated using Equation (1). The leaf oil content in microcapsules was determined by the liquid-liquid partition method; the leaf oil was extracted by the ethyl acetate and isolated from the microcapsules.
