<p class="p">A dry-heat treatment was used to evaluate the thermostability of specimens. Leaf oil microcapsules were subjected to accelerated aged using the standard dry-heat aging test (ISO 5630-1; CNS 12887-1) at 105 Â°C in a ventilated oven. Weights of specimens were measured during the dry-heat aging test for 1, 2, 4, and 8 days. After the aging test, chemical compositions of the leaf oil microcapsules were examined by FTIR analysis.</p>
