<p class="p">Xanthine is specifically oxidized by xanthine oxidase to form uric acid. The xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity was evaluated the ability of specimens, including β-cyclodextrin, leaf oil, and leaf oil microcapsules, to inhibit the formation of uric acid. The reaction mixture contained 117 µL of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8), 3 µL of sample (dissolved in DMSO) and 60 µL of xanthine oxidase solution (25 mU/mL). The reaction was initiated by adding 100 µL of 0.15 mM xanthine solution, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and stopped by adding 20 µL of 1 N HCl. The absorbance of uric acid was measured at 290 nm by an ELISA reader [
