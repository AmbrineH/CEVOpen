 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Essential oils are rich in highly volatile simple aromatics, monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids. The highly volatile character of essential oils results in the quick release to the environment of their components. Thermal-induced oxidation and degradation of the essential oil also occur easily. These restrictions limit the lifetime and utilization of essential oil products. Microencapsulation of highly volatile leaf oils with proper shell materials can help improve their durability.
