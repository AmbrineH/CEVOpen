<p class="p">The purposes of this study were to microencapsulate cinnamaldehyde-type leaf oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> with Î²-cyclodextrin and examine the properties of the resulting leaf oil microcapsules. It was expected that the preservation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil would improve. Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity and thermostability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microcapsules were investigated to confirm the properties of the leaf oil microcapsules.
