 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oils from different sources are classified into several chemotypes, mainly including cinnamyl acetate-type, linalool-type, cinnamaldehyde-type, and the others types. Among these chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oils, the cinnamaldehyde type leaf oil showed xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity and anti-hyperuricemia effects [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Xanthine oxidase is the key enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine/xanthine to produce uric acid; excess accumulation of uric acid leads to diseases such as gout and hyperuricemia. Cinnamaldehyde is a common antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic drug in traditional medicine. Cinnamaldehyde is approved as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) natural food additive by the United States Food and Drug Administration.
