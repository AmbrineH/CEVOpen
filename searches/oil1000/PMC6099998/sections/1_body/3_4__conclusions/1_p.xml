<p class="p">Constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil were identified by GC-MS and GC-FID. 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-Cinnamaldehyde (84.13%), benzaldehyde (7.16%), 3-phenylpropionaldehyde (3.62%), and α-pinene (1.09%) were the main constituents of the selected leaf oil. The optimal reaction conditions for microencapsulation were found at a 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde to β-cyclodextrin ratio of 15:85 and ethanol to water ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:5. The yield of leaf oil microcapsules was 86.3%. The characteristic absorption bands of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde were confirmed in the FTIR spectra of leaf oil microcapsules. The thermostability of leaf oil microcapsules were evaluated by the dry-heat aging test, and β-cyclodextrin was thermostable at 105 °C and had efficacy to retard the emission of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil. The xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of cinnamaldehyde-type 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil was not affected after microencapsulation with β-cyclodextrin and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of leaf oil microcapsules in the xanthine oxidase inhibitory assay was in good agreement with the content of leaf oil in the microcapsules. These results revealed that cinnamaldehyde-type 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microencapsulated with β-cyclodextrin possessed superior thermostability and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Cinnamaldehyde-type 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microencapsules have great potential to be used as a natural xanthine oxidase inhibitor for dietary supplements and treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.
