 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that antioxidant activity of carvacrol, the major constituent of oregano and thyme plants oils, microencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was lower than that of free carvacrol. Bioactivities of essential oil/constituents after microencapsulation might vary with the different core materials and coating materials [

 <xref rid="molecules-23-01107-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). According to the leaf oil content in microcapsules (14.9%), the calculated IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of active leaf oil in microcapsules was 12.4 µg/mL, which was comparable to leaf oil alone. Results indicated that the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil wasn't affected by microencapsulation with β-cyclodextrin. This is the first study to report the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of plant essential oil microcapsules. Cinnamaldehyde-type 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microcapsules can be used as alternative natural inhibitor for hyperuricemia and gout.
