<p class="p">Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] evaluated the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities of ethanolic extract, hot water extract, and essential oil of cinnamaldehyde-type 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf; leaf oil, which contained 75.1% of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde, possessed the best activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) value of 16.3 µg/mL. In this study, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde content in examined leaf oil was 84.1% (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01107-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of leaf oil was 11.2 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01107-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil increased with the content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde in leaf oil.
