<p class="p">Another important factor in the microencapsulation was the ratio of ethanol to water in the reaction solution. For the 1:7 and 1:2 ratios of ethanol to water (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), yields of microcapsules were lower than that of the other ratios and below 80%. The 1:3 ratio of ethanol to water showed the maximum microcapsule yield (87.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant (
