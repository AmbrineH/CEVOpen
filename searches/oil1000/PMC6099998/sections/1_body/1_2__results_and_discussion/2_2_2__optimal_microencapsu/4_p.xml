 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] investigated the stability constants (Kc) of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde/β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes at three different temperatures (25, 35, and 45 °C), the KCs of inclusion complexes were 28.47, 19.06, and 18.41 L/mol, respectively; the thermodynamic results revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde/β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex formation was a typical lower energy reaction.
