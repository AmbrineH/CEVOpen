<p class="p">The composition of the leaf oil was analyzed using GC-MS. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01107-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows a gas chromatogram of the leaf oil. The main constituents of the examined 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (84.13%), benzaldehyde (7.16%), 3-phenylpropionaldehyde (3.62%), Î±-pinene (1.09%), 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-bornyl acetate (0.92%), and camphene (0.79%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01107-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde was much higher than that of the other constituents, so the leaf oil was classified as belonging to the cinnamaldehyde chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic>. Based on the variation of major constituents, 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oils can be classified into several chemotypes with individual bioactivity. Eugenol is a common compound found in the 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> plants. In this study, eugenol was a minor constituent (0.03%) of the selected leaf oil. The main constituents of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil were volatile aromatics and terpenoids.
