<p class="p">Changes of the characteristic peaks occurred in the FTIR spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil microcapsules (β-CD/Cin oil) after the dry-heat aging test, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01107-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The relative intensities of the absorption peaks at 1630 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1681 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> decreased during the aging period. Peaks at 1630 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for C=C stretching vibrations) and 1681 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for C=O stretching vibrations) are the characteristic absorptions of the extended conjugation structure of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], the major constituent of leaf oil. The decrease of these absorption bands with the aging period resulted from the emission of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde in the environment at 105 °C. The characteristic absorption bands of β-cyclodextrin are 3386 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for O-H stretching vibrations), 2926 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for -CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> asymmetrical stretching vibrations) and 1165 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for C-O stretching vibrations) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These characteristic peaks of β-cyclodextrin didn’t show any differences in the FTIR spectrum after the dry-heat aging test; revealing that the molecules of β-cyclodextrin were thermostable during 8 days of aging. The results from the FTIR spectroscopic analysis ensured the consistency of the thermostability of β-cyclodextrin observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01107-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Most constituents of the leaf oil were control released from the microcapsules during the dry-heat aging test.
