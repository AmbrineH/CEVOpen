<p class="p">The weights of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil (Cin oil), and leaf oil microcapsules (β-CD/Cin oil) were measured during a dry-heat aging test, performed at 105 °C in a ventilated oven, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01107-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The weight percentage of β-cyclodextrin was kept constant during the accelerated aging test; β-cyclodextrin was thermostable at 105 °C. Trotta et al. reported that the decomposition temperature of β-cyclodextrin was ca. 250 °C according to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The weight percentages of leaf oil were 11.7% and 0% after 30 min and 1 h of aging test, respectively (data not shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01107-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Emission of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil was quick in the high temperature external environment; high volatility of leaf oil was a problem for its utility. The weight loss of leaf oil microcapsules was 4.92% after 1 day of aging test. Comparing the weight loss between leaf oil and leaf oil microcapsules, it is clear that microencapsulation reduced the emission of leaf oil in the early stages of the dry-heat aging test. Weight percentages of leaf oil microcapsules were 88.4% and 88.1% after 4 and 8 days of the aging test. The weight percentages of leaf oil microcapsules after 4 days and 8 days were significantly lower than those before 2 days. This corresponded with the leaf oil content in microcapsules. Microencapsulation of leaf oil with β-cyclodextrin thus slowed down the volatility of the leaf oil, revealing that the thermostability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil was effectively improved by encapsulation with β-cyclodextrin.
