 <p class="p">The aim of the study was to characterize the chemical composition and biological properties of the essential oil from the plant 
  <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> grown in Greece. The essential oil volatiles were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry GC-MS indicating citral as the major component. Τhe antimicrobial properties were assayed using the disk diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory and non-inhibitory concentration values were determined.

  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> were sensitive to 
  <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> oil, but not

  <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis, 
  <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas fragi</italic>. Adversely, all microbes tested were sensitive to citral. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays were used to assess direct antioxidant activity, which proved to be weak for both agents, while comet assay was utilized to study the cytoprotective effects against H

  <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced oxidative damage in Jurkat cells. Interestingly, the oil showed a more profound cytoprotective effect compared to citral. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated in a panel of cancer cell lines using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) and 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-
  <italic class="italic">S</italic>-(phenylamino) carbonyl-2-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assays and both agents demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity with citral being more cytotoxic than the oil. Taken together, the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> and its major component, citral, exert diverse biological properties worthy of further investigation.
