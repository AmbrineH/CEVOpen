 <p> Detection of the protective effect of Lippia citriodora oil and citral on H 2O 2-treated Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells (2 × 10 4) were preincubated with Lippia citriodora oil ( A) or citral ( B) for 20 min before treatment with H 2O 2 (6.66 μg/mL) for 20 min at room temperature. Results are shown as mean ± S.D. # p = 0.013 H 2O 2 vs. H 2O 2 and 640 μg/mL essential oil, # p &lt; 0.05 relative to H 2O 2, *** p &lt; 0.001 relative to control. </p>
