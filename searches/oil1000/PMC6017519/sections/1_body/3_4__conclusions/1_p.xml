<p class="p">Citral is the major component of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> (obtained from Greek plants) and exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all microbes tested in contrast to the oil fraction which was inactive against the gram negative bacteria. Our results also suggest that both the oil fraction and citral exhibit potent antiproliferative activities in vitro. More specifically, citral was more cytotoxic against all cancer cell lines utilized in the scope of this study while the oil fraction exhibited lower genotoxicity. Although both the oil and citral proved weak direct antioxidants as assessed by biochemical in vitro assays, they, nevertheless, exhibited antioxidant capacity in a cellular system demonstrated as a significant reduction of the H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced oxidative damage. Many of these properties are reported here for the first time, thus setting the basis for further investigations regarding the active components of the oil and the molecular mechanisms(s) underlying their mode of action. This is of utmost importance as the demand in identifying natural products with well-described biological properties for potential neutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications is constantly increasing.
