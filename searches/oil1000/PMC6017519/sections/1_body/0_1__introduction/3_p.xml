<p class="p">Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> isolated from Greek plants and characterize its biological activities. We report here the (i) antimicrobial; (ii) antioxidant; (iii) cytoprotective (against H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced oxidative damage), and (iv) antiproliferative properties associated with the essential oil fraction derived from the leaves and stems of the plant. Finally, its major component, citral, was also evaluated for its biological properties in vitro and compared to the essential oil. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study on distinct biological properties of the essential oil fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic>.
