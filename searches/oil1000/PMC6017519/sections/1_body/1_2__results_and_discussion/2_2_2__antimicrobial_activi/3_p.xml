<p class="p">In accordance with the results of the disc diffusion method, MIC and NIC determination documented the effective growth inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and citral against all bacteria tested (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00123-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), although MIC and NIC values were significantly (

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Noticeably, the oil was more effective compared to citral, as significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower MIC and NIC values were recorded. Similar results reporting high antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> essential oil and extracts were previously reported [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, they were only limited to disc or well diffusion assays and no MIC and NIC values were determined. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil could be attributed to the action of its main constituent, although possible antagonistic effects should not be excluded [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Such effects must be further studied using model systems.
