<p class="p">Initially, the disk diffusion method was applied and subsequently the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and non-inhibitory concentration (NIC) values were assessed using an established optical density method, which combines the absorbance measurements with the common dilution method. Non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the data using a previously-published model [
