<p class="p">In the present study, the DPPH and ABTS assays were used for the evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of the oil and citral. More particularly, increasing concentrations of the essential oil (0.0046–46 mg/mL) and citral (0.0045–45 mg/mL) were incubated with DPPH and ABTS for 30 and 15 min, respectively. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for the essential oil were 6.3 ± 0.25 mg/mL for the DPPH assay and 3.08 ± 0.3 mg/mL using the ABTS method. Citral did not show any significant antioxidant activity (maximum DPPH inhibition 3.9% and ABTS inhibition 22.45%;
