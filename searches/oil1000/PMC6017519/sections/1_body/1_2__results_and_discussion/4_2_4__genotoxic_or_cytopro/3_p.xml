<p class="p">The oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> together with citral have been previously evaluated for their antigenotoxic effect against ultraviolet radiation-induced DNA damage using the SOS chromosome test, where they both showed antigenotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Citral has shown diverse toxicity using different test systems. For instance, it not did exhibit direct pro-oxidant effect when testing oxygen uptake in erythrocytes exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], nor did it reduce the viability of rat small intestine epithelial cells after 24 h of incubation [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. When using the 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> mutagenicity testing, Gomes-Carneiro et al., demonstrated that citral was toxic at concentrations higher than 600 μg/mL, whereas it did not demonstrate any such genotoxicity when utilizing the SOS chromotest [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Moreover, in a similar study, citral was shown to reduce the viability of human lymphocytes over 100 μg/mL using the MTT assay and cause statistically significant DNA damage at even lower concentrations (&gt;25 μg/mL), in accordance with our results [
