<p class="p">The genotoxic effects of the oil fraction or citral were investigated using the comet assay. We observed that the oil fraction demonstrated a genotoxic effect only at the highest concentration used (920 μg/mL) in Jurkat cells after 20 min of incubation, which was approximately one and a half times the levels of DNA damage of the control sample (
