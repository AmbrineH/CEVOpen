<p class="p">Increasing concentrations of the essential oil fraction (0.64–920 μg/mL) or citral (0.63–900 μg/mL) were incubated with different human cancer cell lines (for 72 h) and SRB or XTT assays were employed to determine cell viability. Overall, it was observed that the oil fraction was most cytotoxic against the A375 (melanoma) cells (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 9.1 ± 0.6 μg/mL), an activity eight to ten times higher compared to the other cell lines tested. In addition, it showed similar viability levels against HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and Caco2 (colon adenocarcinoma) cells (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 74 ± 2.8 μg/mL, 89 ± 1.4 μg/mL and 71 ± 2.6 mg/mL, respectively), while it was slightly less cytotoxic against THP-1 (leukemic monocytes) cells (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 111 ± 3.6 μg/mL) (

 <xref rid="molecules-23-00123-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Finally, the oil fraction demonstrated modest cytotoxicity to the lines tested compared with etoposide, a known chemotherapeutic agent. To our knowledge, there are no published data on the cytotoxicity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> against HepG2 and Caco2 cell lines. In a study in 2010, Escobar et al. showed the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic> oil (from Colombian plants) against Vero and THP-1 cells where the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for THP-1 was &gt;100 μg/mL, in accordance with our results [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. There is also one study describing the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Aloysia citriodora</italic> oils from different regions of Morocco against MCF-7 cells after a 48 h incubation, where the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values ranged between 35 and 70 μg/mL, whereas there was no cytotoxicity observed against PBMCs [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In this case, the oils demonstrated higher activity compared to our oil, which may be attributed to the differences in their composition, as the Moroccan oils had 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-spathulenol, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene oxide and ar-curcumene as major components.
