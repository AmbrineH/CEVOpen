<p class="p">On the other hand, citral was significantly more potent against all cell lines tested, an observation which could owe to an antagonistic effect between the components of the essential oil. In general, MCF-7 cells were the most sensitive ones when subjected to citral (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.3 ± 0.19 μg/mL), followed by Caco2 and HepG2 cells (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.7 ± 0.21 μg/mL and 7 ± 0.35 μg/mL, respectively) (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 30.129 and 14.67 μg/mL, respectively), in accordance with our results, where after 72 h the EC
