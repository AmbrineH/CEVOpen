<p class="p">The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation at VIORYL S.A. facilities (Afidnes, Athens, Greece) directly after the harvesting period, taking into account the seasonality of the plant. All plants were harvested during May and June, and no further drying process was used. Chopped leaves and stems were collected by hand, followed by hydrodistillation with a Dean Stark apparatus. Plant material was covered with 6 L of distilled water, while the extraction process took place for 8 h at a temperature of 90–120 °C. Isolated essential oil was dried with Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and sealed in vials for further use. Analysis was carried out with a GC-MS (GC: 6890A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA; MSD: 5973, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a Factor Four VF 1 ms column (25 m, 0.2 mm i.d., 0.33 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A volume of 0.1 μL of essential oil was directly injected and a 1:100 split ratio was applied. Oven temperature was set at 50 °C for 1 min, followed by a temperature gradient of 2.5 °C/min to 160 °C (for 20 min), then raised to 250 °C at 50 °C/min with a final isothermal period of 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas (flow rate 1 mL/min). Injector and transfer line temperatures were set to 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The mass spectrometer operated in the electron impact mode with the electron energy set to 70 eV. Identification of the compounds was carried out according to the standard method of Kováts Indices and comparison of volatiles mass spectra to Willey/NIST 0.5 and in-house created libraries (VIORYL S.A.).
