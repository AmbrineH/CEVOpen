<p class="p">The radical scavenging activity of the essential oil and citral was estimated using the free radical DPPH, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Increasing concentrations of the essential oil (0.0046–46 mg/mL) and citral (0.0045–45 mg/mL) were prepared using DMSO as the solvent. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm using an ELISA plate reader (EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). All determinations were performed in triplicates. The % inhibition of the DPPH radical for each concentration was determined by making use of the following formula: % DPPH radical scavenging activity = [(OD
 <sub class="sub">control</sub> − OD
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/OD
 <sub class="sub">control</sub>)] × 100.
