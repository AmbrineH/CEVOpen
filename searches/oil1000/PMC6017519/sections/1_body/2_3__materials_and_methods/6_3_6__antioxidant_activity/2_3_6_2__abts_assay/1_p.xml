<p class="p">The ABTS de-coloration assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The % inhibition of the ABTS radical for each concentration is expressed in two ways; First, by making use of the following formula: % ABTS radical scavenging activity = [(OD
 <sub class="sub">control</sub> − OD
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/OD
 <sub class="sub">control</sub>)] × 100. Next, a standard curve based on the percentage of ABTS radical scavenging activity of known concentrations of ascorbic acid expressed in μM was prepared and the concentrations of the samples were calculated using linear regression analysis and the results were also expressed as micromoles ascorbic acid equivalent per gram of essential oil (μmolesEA/g), by making use of the following formula: C = (cxD)/Ci. C, concentration of antioxidant compounds in μmolesEΑ/g; c, concentration of sample read (in micromoles per liter); D, dilution factor; Ci, concentration of stock solution (in grams per liter).
