<p class="p">The human cancer cell lines Caco2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), ΤΗP-1 (leukemic monocytes), Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia), and A375 (malignant melanoma) were obtained from the American type culture collection (Rockville, MD, USA). HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were grown and maintained in DMEM, A375 cells in DMEM high glucose (4500 mg/L), whereas the medium RMPI was used for the Caco2, Jurkat, and THP-1 cell lines. All media were supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O
