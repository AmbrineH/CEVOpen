<p class="p">In the next experiment, 30 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> salt (NaCl) was solved into 300 
 <italic class="italic">ml</italic> water and added to rosemary. NaCl salt increases the boiling point of water. So salt was added to the mixture to check that it will extract higher amounts of essential oil or not. Addition of salt led to a faster extraction operation but the extraction efficiency didnâ€™t improve as expected. Salt accelerates transfer phenomenon but may cause thermal and hydrolysis reactions and can degrade thermolabile components of essential oil. So this option was left out.
