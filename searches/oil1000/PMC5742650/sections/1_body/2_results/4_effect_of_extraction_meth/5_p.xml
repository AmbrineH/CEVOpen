Therefore, the possible reason for this contradictory fact is that the content of oxygenated compounds of the oil was dependent on the species instead of the extraction method. During the procedure of MD, microwave irradiation highly accelerated the extraction process without causing considerable changes in the essential oil composition, although the percentages of some components depended on the technique applied.
