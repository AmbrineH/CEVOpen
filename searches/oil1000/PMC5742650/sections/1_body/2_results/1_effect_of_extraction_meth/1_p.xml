<p class="p">All essential oils extracted from the aerial parts of rosemary by both extraction methods produced a clear, yellow liquid essential oil. Efficiency was expressed in terms of the volume of the oil collected in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>. Extraction with MAHD started at much earlier time than that with HD (10 
 <italic class="italic">min vs</italic>. 30
