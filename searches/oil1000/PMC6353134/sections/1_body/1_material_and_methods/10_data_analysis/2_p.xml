 <italic class="italic">vannamei</italic> postlarvae, respectively). The null hypothesis (no treatment effect) was rejected with a P-value ≤ 0.05. Variance homogeneity of all treatments was examined using the Bartlett test. Assumption of normality was examined through the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test was used to compare treatment means. The effect of differences between treatments was considered significant at P-value ≤ 0.05. The same statistical analysis was performed to evaluate differences of percent of cell viability (cell toxicity) for each one of selected products. All statistical tests were carried out with the R statistical software [
