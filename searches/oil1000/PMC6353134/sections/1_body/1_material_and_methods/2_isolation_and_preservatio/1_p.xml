<p class="p">Aliquots (100 μL) of serial 10-fold dilutions (10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>) of larvae were macerated in duplicate in 2% sterile NaCl solution and plated on marine agar 2216 (MA, Difco). The same procedure was performed with serial 10-fold dilutions (10
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) on thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose agar (TCBS, Difco). All plates were incubated at 30°C. After one to two days of growth, bacterial counts were performed from plates containing 30 to 300 colonies. Bacterial counts were expressed as colony-forming units (CFU) per gram. Presumptive pathogenic strains were selected from colonies of samples with high bacterial counts on MA (&gt;10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) or TCBS (&gt;10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) agars. The criteria of selection were: (1) all different bacterial strains by morphological criterion and (2) luminescent strains. All selected strains were coded and frozen at -80°C after addition of trypticase soy broth (TSB, Difco) supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl and 20% (v/v) glycerol.
