<p class="p">Bacterial strains causing higher mortalities in the 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia</italic> challenge test were selected and their pathogenicity was again verified by a challenge test using healthy 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus vannamei</italic> postlarvae, following the procedures described by [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Bacteria were activated following the procedure described in the 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia</italic> challenge test. Thirty shrimp postlarvae (PL2) per replicate were distributed in sterile petri dishes and exposed to the corresponding bacterial treatment, at a concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> bacteria mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for 6 min. Larvae were then transferred to 500 mL plastic containers containing 300 mL of sterile seawater and 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> bacteria mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Larvae were fed during the challenge with a pure culture of 
 <italic class="italic">Thalassiosira weissflogii</italic> (913 cell mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) every 2 h after exposure to the bacteria. Survival was determined by counting the larvae every 4 h until 38 hours after infection. A negative control was also included in the challenge test (shrimp postlarvae PL2 without bacterial treatment). All treatments including the control had four replicates. The whole challenge was performed in a Class II Biological Security Cabinet (CSB-180 A), with constant aeration. To verify the asepsis condition of the negative control, water samples were collected at the end of the challenge, verifying the absence of
