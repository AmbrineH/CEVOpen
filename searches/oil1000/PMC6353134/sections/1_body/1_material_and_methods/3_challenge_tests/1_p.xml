<p class="p">The pathogenicity of the presumptive pathogenic strains was first evaluated in brine shrimp

 <italic class="italic">franciscana</italic> (Batch 02143, INVE Aquaculture, Belgium) were hydrated under continuous aeration in 100 mL of filtered and autoclaved distilled water for 1 h, and then transferred to a mixture of 10 mL of sodium hypochlorite (10%) and 15 mL of sodium hydroxide (40%), until the cysts changed color from brown to orange. The decapsulated cysts were washed with filtered and autoclaved sea water and transferred to an imhoff funnel with 500 mL of filtered and autoclaved sea water, providing continuous aeration and illumination with a white lamp, remaining at 28°C in a sterile environment for 24 h. Nauplii were harvested under sterile conditions with an autoclaved mesh of 100 μm. Eighty-four groups, each composed of 30 
 <italic class="italic">Artemi</italic>a nauplii, were transferred to 50 mL sterile tubes containing 30 mL of filtered and autoclaved sea water. Eighty tubes were used to test the pathogenicity of the 20 bacterial isolates (four replicates per strain) and four tubes were used for the negative control (without bacteria, four replicates). Bacteria were activated on trypticase soy agar (TSA, Difco) and a colony from each strain was transferred to 150 mL of TSB and incubated for seven hours at 30°C. Bacterial cells, at a density of 10

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, were added to the corresponding sterile tubes immediately after the transfer of the 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia</italic> nauplii. Nauplii from all treatments and control were fed once with an inactivated

For this, the probiotic was cultured in liquid medium for six hours, inactivated by heat (autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min), centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended with autoclaved seawater. Water exchange (50%) was performed 24 hours after infection and the mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia</italic> was quantified 48 h post-infection. The whole challenge was performed in a Class II Biological Security Cabinet (CSB-180 A). To verify the asepsis condition of the negative control, water samples were collected at the end of the challenge, thus verifying the absence of
