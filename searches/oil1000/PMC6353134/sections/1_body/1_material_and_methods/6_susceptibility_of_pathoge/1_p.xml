 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] using antimicrobial susceptibility test discs (diameter 6 mm, Bioanalyse and Oxoid). For this study, eleven different antimicrobial discs were used per duplicate [chloramphenicol (C, 30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 μg), fosfomycin (FF, 10 μg), furazolidone (FUR, 100 μg), norfloxacin (NOR, 10 μg), oxytetracycline (T, 30 μg), penicillin (P, 10 U), tetracycline (TE, 30 μg), nalidixic acid (NAL, 30 μg), enrofloxacin (E, 5 μg) and florfenicol (F, 30 μg)]. Isolates were activated on TSA and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Afterwards, a colony from each isolate was transferred to TSB liquid medium (2% NaCl) and incubated again at 30°C for 4 h. The bacterial suspensions were standardized with McFarland´s 0.5 Barium Sulfate Standard Solution (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and diluted to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>. Standardized bacterial suspensions (100 μL) were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton plates using sterile cotton buds. Plates were incubated agar down between 24 and 48 h at 30°C. Diameters of inhibition halos surrounding the discs were measured and expressed in millimeters. Results were interpreted as sensitive, intermediate or resistant, following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
