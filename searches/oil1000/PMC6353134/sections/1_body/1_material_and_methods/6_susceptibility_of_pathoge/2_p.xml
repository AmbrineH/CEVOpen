<p class="p">The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the antibiotics approved for use in aquaculture (oxytetracycline and florfenicol, 99% purity, Zhejiang Medicines and Health Company, China) on the growth of the bacterial strains was also determined. The bacterial isolates were activated in TSB liquid medium and incubated at 30°C for 4 h. The bacterial suspensions were diluted with TSB liquid medium to an approximate density of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> by using McFarland´s 0.5 Barium Sulfate Standard Solution. Ten grams of each antibiotic were diluted in culture broth TSB with 2% NaCl solution. Sixteen concentrations of oxytetracycline, ranging from 1 to 3500 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> were distributed into wells of round-bottom 96-well microplates. Each well was inoculated with 20 μl of bacterial suspension, including the positive control (bacterial growth at TSB culture, without any antibiotic). The microplates were incubated at 30°C between 24 and 48 h. All measurements were performed in triplicate, including those of the controls. Bacterial growth was detected by optical density at 620 nm (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA reader, Varioskan Lux). MIC values were obtained as the lowest concentrations of each antibiotic that completely inhibited the bacterial growth. Absence of bacterial growth during the MIC process was confirmed on TSA agar. The same methodology was performed with the MIC tests for florfenicol, testing 15 concentrations of this antibiotic, ranging from 0.1 to 1000 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Finally, the patterns of multiple antibiotic resistance were analyzed to determine common patterns of resistance between the bacterial strains.
