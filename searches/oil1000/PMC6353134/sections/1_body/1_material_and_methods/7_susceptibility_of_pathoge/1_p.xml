<p class="p">The susceptibility of the pathogenic circulating strains to five commercial shrimp probiotics (
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was determined by the agar plug diffusion method [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Briefly, the probiotics were cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar at 30°C for 24 h (≈ 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). In parallel, the pathogenic bacteria were cultured under the same conditions as the probiotics. After incubation, an agar-plot from the probiotic culture was aseptically cut and deposited on the agar surface of the plate inoculated with the pathogenic bacteria. Diameters of inhibition halos surrounding the agar-plots were measured and expressed in millimeters 24 and 48 h after the agar-plots were transferred. The strains were considered as: sensitive, intermediate and resistant when the diameters of the inhibition halos were ≥ 10 mm, between 4 and 9 mm and ≤ 3 mm, respectively.
