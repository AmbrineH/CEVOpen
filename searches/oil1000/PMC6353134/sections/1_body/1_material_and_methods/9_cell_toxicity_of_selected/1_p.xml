<p class="p">The toxicity of the most efficient natural products, as well as the antibiotics authorized for use in aquaculture, was evaluated through the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assay of cell viability of shrimp haemocytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Briefly, the assay was based on the ability of the mitochondria to convert yellow colored 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2-5-diphenyltetrazole bromide (MTT) in purple colored formazan through the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. The primary culture of shrimp haemocytes was activated in Hank’s salts for 75 min and exposed to each product for 2 h at different concentrations and then incubated for 2 h with 5 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> of MTT in Hank’cs salts. The supernatant and the formazan crystals were diluted with isopropanol mixed with 0.04 N hydrochloric acid. The colorimetric reaction was read at 620 nm. The results were transformed to percent of cell viability, considering the primary culture of haemocytes without chemical exposure as the positive response of optimal cellular respiration (maximum cell viability). The concentrations evaluated of antibiotics were 100, 200, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000 and 7000 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The concentrations evaluated for the natural products were below the corresponding minimum inhibitory concentrations.
