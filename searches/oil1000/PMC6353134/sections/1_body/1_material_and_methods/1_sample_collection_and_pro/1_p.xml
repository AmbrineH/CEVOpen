<p class="p">In 2015, 31 samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei</italic> larvae [from Nauplii 5 (N5) to 13 days postlarvae (PL13)] were collected from tanks of 10 shrimp hatcheries (Santa Elena, Ecuador) during mortality events. Samples were sent by farmers to the Centro Nacional de Acuicultura e Investigaciones Marinas (CENAIM, Santa Elena, Ecuador) for the quantification of shrimp bacterial load (microbiologic analysis services performed by CENAIM). Bacterial strains isolated from these samples were used for this study. Larvae presented clinical signs of abnormal swimming behavior, empty digestive tract, low activity and retardation of larval development. Samples were transported to the research facilities of CENAIM taking a maximum time of two hours from sampling at the hatcheries to processing at the laboratory. At the laboratory, they were rinsed with 2% sterile NaCl solution and each sample (1 g of larvae) was macerated to homogenize the bacterial load associated with the animals.
