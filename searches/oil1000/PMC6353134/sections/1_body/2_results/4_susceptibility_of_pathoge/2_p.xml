<p class="p">All strains presented resistance to at least two antibiotics at the same time, being 50%, 45% and 5% of the strains resistant to 2, 3 and 4 antibiotics, respectively (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The MAR index on average was 0.23 (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The most prevalent pattern of multiple resistance was P-T (10/20 strains = prevalence of 50%, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The other most prevalent pattern was P-T-TE (7/20 strains = prevalence of 35%, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The other two MAR patterns were: P-T-Te (2/20 strains = prevalence of 10%, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) and P-T-TE-FF (1/20 strains = prevalence of 5%, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). All strains were resistant at the same time to penicillin and oxytetracycline (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Forty percent (8/20) of the strains were resistant to both antibiotics of the tetracycline group (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).
