<p class="p">The most efficient products in terms of bacterial sensitivity were organic acids OA6 and OA9, but OA9 was cytotoxic at all assayed concentrations, not showing significant differences of cell viability between the evaluated concentrations of OA9 (P = 0.802, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). However, OA6 was not toxic for shrimp haemocytes between 100 and 400 μg mL
