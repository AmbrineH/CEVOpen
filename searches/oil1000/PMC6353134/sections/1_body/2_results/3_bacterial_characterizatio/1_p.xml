<p class="p">An initial screening of phylogenetic analysis was performed with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the pathogenic circulating strains and 362 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> sequences reported in GenBank as pathogens and non-pathogens. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories, +G, parameter = 0.1000). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 9.76% sites). The pathogenic circulating strains of this study showed a greater similarity to the sequences of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> reported as pathogens. To identify the isolates, a last analysis was performed using exclusively the 16S rRNA sequences obtained from GenBank that were more related to our sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Two groups of strains with high values of bootstrap support were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The first group contained eight sequences that presented similarity levels with sequences identified as 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">campbellii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harveyi</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). All strains characterized in this study as luminescent belong to this group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). A ninth luminescent strain was not included in the phylogenetic analysis, as the molecular identification was not possible with the obtained sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The second group included seven sequences of bacterial isolates with a high similarity level with identified sequences of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alginolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio natriegens</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). In addition, three different groups with low bootstrap values were also identified, which contained four sequences with similarities to 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio inhibens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio owensii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> sp. Strain PaH1.25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210478.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). In total, ninety-five percent of the isolated strains (19/20) belong to the 
 <italic class="italic">Harveyi</italic> clade. Most of the strains were identified as 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harveyi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alginolyticus</italic> (12/19 strains). The least frequent strains were 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">campbelli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">owensii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">inhibens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>.
