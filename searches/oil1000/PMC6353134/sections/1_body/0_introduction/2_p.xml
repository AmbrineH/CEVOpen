 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. For these reasons, the regulation of antibiotics is rigorously controlled, resulting in few antibiotics authorized for use in aquaculture. In this context, alternative strategies of disease control are necessary to replace antibiotics for use in animal production, which has led to consider the use of natural products to control the growth of pathogens in shrimp hatcheries. The administration of probiotics is one of the alternative strategies that may be used in aquaculture [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]; their benefits include the potential for colonization in the gastrointestinal tract, selective antagonism against bacterial pathogens, improvement of the shrimp immune system, enhanced shrimp growth and survival, degradation of detritus and maintenance of water quality [

 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The use of organic acids, produced by organisms and used as preservatives and bacterial control in food, agriculture, and animal production, is another potential strategy to control bacterial diseases in animal production [

Although the use of organic acids and essential oils in Ecuadorian hatcheries is relatively new, there is an increasing demand for their application as control strategies of bacterial diseases in shrimp hatcheries. In general, there are a huge number of products marketed as therapeutic products for shrimp hatcheries worldwide, therefore producers should take suitable decisions as to which products are effective based on technical information and further tests in their own facilities.
