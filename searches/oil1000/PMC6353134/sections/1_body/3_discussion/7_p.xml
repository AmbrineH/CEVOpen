<p class="p">Essential oils are effective for inhibiting bacterial growth; in our study the essential oil EO1, whose declared composition includes extract of oregano oil, efficiently inhibited the growth of all evaluated bacterial strains, with MIC values equal to or lower than 3 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Similar results were observed by Teixeira et al. 2013 for other bacterial genera, where the 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> essential oil was effective at MIC values lower than 5 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Possibly, the efficacy for the bacterial inhibition of EO1 might be related to the presence of thymol and carvacrol, two of the compounds of oregano essential oil [
