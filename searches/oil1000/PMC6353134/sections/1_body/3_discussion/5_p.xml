<p class="p">Given these conditions, it is therefore necessary for producers to consider alternative strategies for the control of pathogenic bacteria. In our study, only one commercial probiotic (P5) exhibited a high antagonistic capacity against the bacterial strains (85% of the strains). P5, whose declared composition is

 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] and it has been observed that it enhances postlarvae survival and immune response when shrimp get to the juvenile stages [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The rest of the probiotics could inhibit the growth of 15â€“30% of the strains, which showed intermediate effects, and therefore could be considered as functional for the growth control of some pathogenic bacterial strains. Of the two strains that were not completely inhibited by probiotic P5, neither inhibited the other probiotics. The administration of either multiple or single probiotics remains controversial [

 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], and, as regards this, although we did not test many probiotics, P5, a single strain, was the most efficient probiotic, whereas, P1, P2, P3 and P4 declared as mixture strains were not particularly effective.
