<p class="p">In our screening, in addition to penicillin and tetracycline, oxytetracycline was a less efficient antibiotic, which is one of the two authorized antibiotics for use in aquaculture, and the antimicrobial most commonly used in Ecuador for shrimp larval stages, although now it is in decline. The MIC values found in our study are high and similar to those reported by the shrimp culture. For instance, an average MIC of 304 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> has been reported for 
 <italic class="italic">Vibri</italic>o isolated in Mexico [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], values up to 400 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> isolated from water in hatcheries and farms in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and up to 512 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus monodon</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">vannamei</italic> shrimp in Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, oxytetracycline is toxic for 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus stylirostris</italic> larvae at concentrations from 135.5 to 238 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Fifty-five percent of our screened strains (11/20) presented MIC values for oxytetracycline in this toxic range or above, indicating that the application of this antibiotic is not suitable for most of the pathogenic circulating strains. Considering this observation, it cannot be discounted that the prolonged use of oxytetracycline may explain the observed resistance.
