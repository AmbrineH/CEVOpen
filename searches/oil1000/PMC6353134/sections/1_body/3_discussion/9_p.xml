Periodic surveys at regional level and further challenge tests could be performed to identify the pathogenic circulating bacterial strains and to focus on the bacteria of concern. At the same time, shrimp producers can apply relatively simple 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> analyses, such as those employed in this study and take adequate management decisions based on these results, which in turn could reduce the impact of bacterial diseases and increase profits.
