<p class="p">Florfenicol is the other authorized antibiotic for use in aquaculture and was highly efficient in controlling bacterial growth at low concentrations, with a MIC of 8 μg mL

Florfenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, with the same mechanism of action to that of chloramphenicol (inhibition of protein synthesis), and commonly used for the treatment of bacterial diseases in shrimp, such as necrotizing hepatopancreatitis [

 <xref rid="pone.0210478.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], we found that haemocytes could thrive up to 2000 ug mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> without any problem of cell unviability. Possibly, these seemingly contradictory results could be explained by the fact that MTT analyses were performed using haemocytes of juvenile shrimp, and at this stage, shrimp could handle a high concentration of this antibiotic. Sixteen of our screened strains (80%) showed MIC values equal to or higher than 5 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, indicating a loss of bacterial sensitivity and a development of resistance to this antibiotic, and therefore not recommended as a control strategy at production level.
