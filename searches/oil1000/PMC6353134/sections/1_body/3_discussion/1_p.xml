<p class="p">The efficiency of therapeutic products is of vital importance for the control of aquaculture diseases. In the present study, we investigate through some 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> analyses the antimicrobial effectiveness of antibiotics and commercially available therapeutic products used in Ecuador to control pathogenic bacterial strains of shrimp larvae. To perform these analyses, we isolated the strains that were circulating in the shrimp hatcheries, verified their virulence through challenge tests and identified their molecular similarity with previously reported pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>. By doing this, we confirmed that we were working with the circulating strains that cause real problems at the production level. The results were dependent on the product, concentration of the product and bacterial strain.
