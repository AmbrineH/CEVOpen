 <p> Phylogenetic tree of complete 16S rRNA sequences of the pathogenic circulating strains. The analysis included 11 related Vibrio pathogen sequences reported in GenBank. Listonella anguillarum was used as outgroup (GenBank accession no. AM235737). The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories, +G, parameter = 0.1000). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 9.76% sites). Bootstrap values (percentage of 1000 replicates) appear next to each corresponding branch. The tree was built with the Maximum Likelihood inference method, which was supported by the trees built with Maximum Parsimony, Neighbor Joining and Bayesian inference methods. * indicates luminescent strain. </p>
