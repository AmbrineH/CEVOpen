 <p class="p">Bacterial diseases cause high mortality in 
  <italic class="italic">Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei</italic> postlarvae. Therefore, appropriate application of efficient therapeutic products is of vital importance for disease control. This study evaluated through 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> analyses the antimicrobial effectiveness of commercial therapeutic products used for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">vannamei</italic> bacterial diseases and antibiotics against pathogenic 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> strains circulating in Ecuadorian hatcheries. Twenty strains were isolated from 31 larvae samples with high bacterial counts from 10 hatcheries collected during mortality events. The strains virulence was verified through challenge tests with 
  <italic class="italic">Artemia franciscana</italic> nauplii and 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">vannamei</italic> postlarvae. Through 16S rRNA sequence analysis, strains showed a great similarity to the 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> sequences reported as pathogens, with 95% belonging to the 
  <italic class="italic">Harveyi</italic> clade. Through antibiograms and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> tests we found that furazolidone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, florfenicol, fosfomycin and enrofloxacin inhibited the growth of all or most of the strains. Less efficient antibiotics were penicillin, oxytetracycline and tetracycline. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.23 showed some level of resistance to antibiotics, with two MAR prevalent patterns (Penicillin-Oxytetracycline and Penicillin-Oxytetracycline-Tetracycline). From a total of 16 natural products (five probiotics, nine organic acids and two essential oils), only three (one probiotic, one organic acid and one essential oil) were effective to control most of the strains. Shrimp producers can apply relatively simple 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> analyses, such as those employed in this study, to help take adequate management decisions to reduce the impact of bacterial diseases and increase profit.
