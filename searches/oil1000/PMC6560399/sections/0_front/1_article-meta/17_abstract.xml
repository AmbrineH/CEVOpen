 <p class="p">Chickpea flour is known to have good nutritional values. Nevertheless, it is commonly made from ground grains, and characterized by an “off-flavor”. Processing of chickpea grains before flour formation reduces the intensity of the off-flavor. Therefore, two experiments were conducted: first to examine the effect of conventional processing (soaking, boiling, and drying) on the nutritional composition of the chickpea flour; and second, to investigate the impact of processed chickpea flour incorporation with different ratios on the sensory properties of 
  <italic class="italic">mankoushe zaatar</italic>, a popular Lebanese pastry, usually made up of refined wheat flour. Chickpea flour was found to be nutritionally superior compared to refined wheat flour, and conventional processing of the flour was found not to affect its content of protein, fats, carbohydrates, and phosphorus, while total dietary and crude fibers were significantly increased. The fatty acid profile was minimally affected, while magnesium and potassium were reduced. The sensory test conducted among panelists (
  <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 60) showed that the incorporation of processed chickpea flour into the dough of 
  <italic class="italic">mankoushe zaatar</italic> with ratios of 30% and 50% provided an end-product with better taste and overall acceptability compared to the regular 
  <italic class="italic">mankoushe</italic>. Hence, conventionally processed chickpea flour can be used as a fortifier to improve the nutritional quality of bakery products without negatively affecting their sensory properties.
