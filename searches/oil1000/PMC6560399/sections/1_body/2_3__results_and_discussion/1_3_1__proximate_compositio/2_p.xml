<p class="p">Between the two types of chickpea flour, proteins, fat, and total carbohydrates appeared to be similar. However, ash content was significantly lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in processed (1.85%) compared to the raw (2.9%) chickpea flour. Total dietary fibers (15.75%), and crude fibers (3.7%) were modestly, but significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased in processed chickpea flour compared to raw chickpea flour, in which total dietary fibers and crude fibers were 14.70% and 1.63%, respectively. It appears that conventional processing of chickpea grains ultimately increased the fiber content of the flour. Fibers are the edible parts of pulses that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine, with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine. Fibers are of high importance since they have beneficial physiological effects, including laxation, blood glucose, and cholesterol attenuation [

The ash content appears to be significantly lower in our processed chickpea flour (1.85%) compared to previous findings (3.11%) [
