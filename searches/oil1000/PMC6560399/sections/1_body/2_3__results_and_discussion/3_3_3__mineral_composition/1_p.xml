 <xref rid="foods-08-00151-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) was higher than that of refined wheat. In the current study, processing of chickpea flour was found to reduce the Mg (~17%) and K (55%) content significantly (

Mineral losses are likely to be attributed to their leakage into the cooking water or to the conventional processing steps. Soaking, cooking, drying, and milling are critical processes in flour production. Nonetheless, these steps are known to affect the concentrations of inorganic elements in grains [
