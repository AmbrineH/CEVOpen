 <xref rid="foods-08-00151-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) shows a significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023) in palmitic acid between refined wheat (21.96%) and both chickpea flours (about 12%). While the amount of saturated FA stearic acid (2.72%) was lower in wheat compared to raw and processed chickpea flours (about 4%), the linolenic, linoleic, oleic, and palmitoleic acid contents were similar between flours (refined wheat flour, raw, and processed chickpea flour).
