<p class="p">Pulses are important crops cultivated around the world because of their nutritional value. They play an essential role in human nutrition, particularly in the dietary pattern of low-income individuals in developing and underdeveloped countries. Pulses are good sources of protein, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. These grain legumes are characterized by high dietary fiber content, oligosaccharides, slowly digestible starch, and resistant starch [

Hence, the United Nations in its 68th general assembly declared the year 2016 as the “International Year of Pulses”, with goals to improve public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses as part of food production [
