<p class="p">Worldwide, chickpeas received attention because of their physiological benefits. Extensive efforts have been conducted to increase the intake of these grain legumes by integrating them as flours into food products: bread [

 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], spaghetti [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], cakes [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and even biscuits [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Interestingly, chickpea flour has also been used as a coating in potato chip slices to limit the acrylamide formation, a substance considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Moreover, chickpea flour has been extensively studied for its nutritional value. It is a plentiful source of protein. Its content (24.4%–25.4%) is twice the amount found in wheat flour (9.3%–14.3%) [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Chickpea flour is known to be rich in lysine but limited in sulfur-containing amino acids—mainly methionine, tryptophan, and cysteine. This property makes chickpea flour an excellent enhancer of protein quality when mixed with other cereal flours [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In the semi-arid tropics, chickpea is an essential dietary component for individuals who cannot afford animal proteins [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Chickpea flour is characterized by its relatively high fiber content (3.9%–11.2%) compared to wheat flour (0.9%–1.8%). It is considered to be a good source of fat (3.7%–5.1%)—primarily linoleic acid as an essential PUFA [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Chickpea flour has been found to contain vitamins, mainly B-complex. In addition, the flour is reported to be an important source of minerals compared to wheat flour, namely phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Adequate intake of these essential macrominerals is reported to be potentially protective against obesity and metabolic disorders [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Chickpea flour use is of increasing importance. Nonetheless, the “off-flavor” of the grain is considered one of the crucial factors that may influence the acceptability of food products fortified with chickpea flour. Soaking and boiling as heat treatment are well-known for enhancing the flavor of chickpea grains [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], increasing fibers and protein availability [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and removing the flatulence-producing compounds [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, these methods might affect other nutrients [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. There is still a need to improve the quality of chickpea flour regarding its flavor profile. In Lebanon, chickpea is used in several traditional dishes, as whole or mashed, boiled, or roasted grains, but not as flour. To our knowledge, the potential application of processed chickpea flour as an ingredient in Lebanese food products has not been previously examined, even though chickpea is an available and cheap pulse in the country.
