<p class="p">Chickpea grains (
 <italic class="italic">Cicer arietinum</italic> L.), Kabuli type, were purchased from the local Lebanese market. Chickpea grains were hand-sorted to remove foreign materials. Some of the grain was kept raw, and some was soaked in distilled water in the ratio of 1:10 (
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>) for 17 hours, after which the water was discarded and fresh tap water was added to the chickpeas in the ratio of 1:10 (
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>). Grains were boiled at 100 °C for 1 hour in a double-jacketed kettle, drained, then dried in an industrial air drier (Tecmon srl, Cassina De’ Pecchi MI, Italy) for 8 hours at 38–40 °C. The two types of chickpea, raw and treated grains, were ground into powder form with an electrical, multifunction swing type portable grinder (TIMEMORE, Shenzhen, China), sifted through a 60-mesh stainless steel sieve (250 µm particle size) to obtain a fine flour. Each kind of flour was packed in a vacuum form into nylon bags for later use. Refined wheat flour (as control) was obtained from Crown Flour Mills, Beirut, Lebanon.
