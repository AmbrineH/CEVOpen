<p class="p">The proximate composition analysis was carried out on the control flour, the raw chickpea flour, and the processed chickpea flour, according to the standard methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 2005) [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Moisture, proteins, fat, ash, total dietary fibers, and crude fibers were determined. The moisture of the flours was determined by the air oven method. Samples were dried in an oven at 130 °C for 3 hours until a constant weight was obtained (Method No. 925.10) [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Protein content was determined by the Kjeldahl method with nitrogen to a protein conversion factor of 5.70 [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Lipids were determined by the gravimetric method after extraction with petroleum ether on a Soxhlet system (Method No. 920.85). Ash was determined according to the official method (Method No. 923.03) [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Carbohydrate content was calculated by difference (Carbohydrate% = 100 – (ash% + lipid% + protein% + moisture %)) [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Determination of total dietary fibers was based on the official method (Method No. 985.29), and that of crude fibers as well (Method No. 962.09) [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. All the above analyses were done in triplicate.
