<p class="p">The GC–MS investigation was performed utilizing a gas chromatograph connected with a VG Analytical 70-250S mass spectrometer (VG Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK). A fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 5 CB, 25 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.4 μm, from Chromback, Varian) was the used stationary phase. As a carrier gas, helium was utilized at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature of the injector was 200 °C. The oven temperature was raised from 80 °C to 270 °C at 10 °C/min, and finally held isothermally for 20 min. An electron impact mode of 70 eV was utilized for the detection with a mass scan range from 35 to 600 amu.</p>
