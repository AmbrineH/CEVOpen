<p class="p">The antioxidant activity was assessed using the DPPH free radical scavenging test as described previously by Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This method measures the anti-radical activity of the free radical DPPH of the investigated oil. DPPH is a violet stable free radical molecule, which can be reduced by the presence of an antioxidative sample to yellow DPPH. Various concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) of the volatile oil were tested. The test mixture contained, in a total volume of 1 mL, 500 μL of the oil, 125 μL prepared DPPH (1 mM in methanol) and 375 μL methanol. Then, the mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark, at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was recorded at λ = 517 nm and the anti-radical activity was calculated from the following equation: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">% of anti-radical activity = Abscontrol − Abssample/Abscontrol × 100</disp-formula>
