<p class="p">To investigate the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic>, the β-carotene bleaching assay was used according to Mohd-Esa et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. β-carotene solution (0.2 mg/mL) was dissolved in chloroform and then 1 mL of this solution was added to a solution of 0.2 mL of Tween-20 and 0.02 mL of linoleic acid. After removing the chloroform, the mixture was diluted with 100 mL of distilled water and mixed for 2 min. A volume of 0.2 mL of the oil (1 mg/mL) was added to 5 mL of the mixture and incubated at 40 °C for 2 h. The optical density was measured at 470 nm at 15 min intervals using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV mini-1240, Shimadzu, Japan). Rutin was utilized as a positive control (1 mg/mL). The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Antioxidant activity (%) = (Abs0 − Abst)/(Abs°0 − Abs°t) × 100</disp-formula> where, Abs0 and Abs°0 are the optical density values determined at zero time of incubation for the oil and the control, respectively. Abst and Abs°t are the optical density values for the oil and the control, respectively, at 120 min.
