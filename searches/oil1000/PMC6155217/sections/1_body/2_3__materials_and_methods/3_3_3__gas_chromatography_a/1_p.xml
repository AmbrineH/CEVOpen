<p class="p">The gas chromatographic investigation was carried out using a Hewlett Packard GC (5890 Series II, Hewlett-Packard Company, Wilmington, DE, USA) with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). A fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 5 CB column, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.26 μm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used as a stationary phase. As a carrier gas, nitrogen was utilized at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The temperatures of the injector and the detector were set at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was kept at 45 °C, and then slowly increased to 280 °C at 3 °C/min, and finally held isothermally for 22 min. A volume of 1.0 μL of the essential oil (1/100 diluted in pentane,
