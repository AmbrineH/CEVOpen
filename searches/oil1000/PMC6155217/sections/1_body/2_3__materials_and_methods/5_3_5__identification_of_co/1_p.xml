<p class="p">Identification of individual constituents was done by comparing the RI-values and mass spectra with data generated under similar conditions using a special two-dimensional search algorithm software with an integrated library, considering the RI and MS similarities [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Furthermore, available authentic reference compounds were used in the comparison. The determination of RI was attained based on a homologous
