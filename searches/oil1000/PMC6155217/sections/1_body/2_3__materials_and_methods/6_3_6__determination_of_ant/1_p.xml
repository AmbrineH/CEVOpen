<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the volatile oil was evaluated using the broth microdilution protocol to determine MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The microorganisms were acquired from the Bernhard-Nocht Institute (BNI) for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany. Test microorganisms included four bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> BNI 18, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> BNI 28, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> BNI 2, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> BNI 20) and one yeast (
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> BNI 33). For the test, 96-well microdilution plates were utilized. In this protocol, duplicate two-fold serial dilutions of the essential oil (100 μL/well) were prepared in nutrient broth containing 5% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) dimethyl sulphoxide. Wells in columns 1–8 were adequate to test eight dilutions of the oil, which was indispensable for an endpoint minimal inhibition concentration (MIC). One hundred microliters of microbial cell suspensions (10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL) were prepared in the appropriate broth (nutrient broth for bacteria or tryptone soya yeast extract broth for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>) and was added to all cells of the 96-well plates except for columns 9, 10, 11, and 12, which were used for saline, essential oil, media sterility, and growth controls, respectively. Standard antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, gentamicin, and nystatin, were utilized as positive controls in duplicate. The 96-well plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 19 h; then, microbial growth was observed. To show the growth of bacteria more clearly, the plates were treated with a solution of a p-iodonitro-tetrazolium violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (40 µL of 0.2 mg/mL in each well) and the plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 30 min. The pink color indicates microbial growth and the lowest concentration at which no growth occurs is the MIC.
