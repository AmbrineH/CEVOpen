<p class="p">In this study, the possible antioxidant effects of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> volatile oil were evaluated using two methods, namely 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl- (DPPH) and β-Carotene-linoleic acid assays. The volatile oil showed only moderate anti-radical activity of the stable free radical DPPH (
