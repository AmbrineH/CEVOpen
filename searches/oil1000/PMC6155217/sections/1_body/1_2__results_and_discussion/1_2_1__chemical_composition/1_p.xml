<p class="p">The volatile oil obtained via hydrodistillation of the flowering aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> was colorless and aromatic in a yield of 0.3% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> dry plant material). The chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> essential oil is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00367-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, where the compounds are listed in the order of their elution on the CP-Sil 5 CB column. Moreover, retention index, percentage, and identification tool of each compound are demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00367-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. A total of 43 components, representing 89.2% of the total essential oil, were identified. It is significant to note that no reports have been found relating to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> volatile oil. Moreover, this work presents the first study on the antibacterial and antiradical qualities of the sable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the antioxidant activities of the tested essential oil. 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> volatile oil was identified by a high content of aliphatic acids (51.1%). Among the aliphatic acids, hexadecanoic acid (32.8%) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-dodecanoic acid (7.8%) were found to be the main constituents (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00367-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Oxygenated monoterpenes were identified as the second major group of compounds (16.0%). Camphor (6.1%) and linalool (3.2%) were detected as the main compounds among oxygenated monoterpenes (
