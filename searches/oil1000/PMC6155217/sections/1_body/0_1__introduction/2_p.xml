<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Leucas</italic> is represented in Yemen by five species, including 
 <italic class="italic">Leucas inflata</italic> Benth., which grows as a perennial undershrub, and is widespread and frequent on open rocky plains and stony hills on the high plateau extending through the plains around the Sanaâ€™a governorate [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The plant is used for the treatment of kidney diseases and toothaches by native people in Yemen. Previous works on 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> roots have demonstrated that the extracts have anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-00367" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Evaluating the accessible current literature, no report was found relating to chemical or pharmacological investigations of the volatile oil of the aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic>. In a continuation of our studies on natural volatile oils of species from our region, and their conceivable pharmacological activities, we report here, for the first time, the chemical composition and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Leucas inflata</italic>.
