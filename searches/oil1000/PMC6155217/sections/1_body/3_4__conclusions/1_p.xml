<p class="p">In the present work, we reported, for the first time, the chemical composition of the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> and its antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. GC and GC/MS investigations indicated that the chemical composition was identified by a high content of aliphatic acids (51.1%), where hexadecanoic acid (32.8%) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-dodecanoic acid (7.8%) were the fundamental components. Camphor (6.1%) and linalool (3.2%) were detected as essential compounds among the oxygenated monoterpenoids. The GC investigation of the oil disclosed that the chemical content basically varied from that of other investigated African and Indian 
 <italic class="italic">Leucas</italic> members. The results obviously indicated that the volatile oil has an interesting antibacterial, but a moderate antioxidant, activity. Consequently, our results bolster the suggestion that 
 <italic class="italic">L. inflata</italic> can be a promising source of antibacterial agents. Further work is required to isolate the unidentified components from the oil, as well as to ensure antimicrobial activity on other bacterial strains.
