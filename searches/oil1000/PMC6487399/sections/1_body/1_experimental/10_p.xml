 <sup class="sup">8 </sup>CFU/mL). The surface of Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates were covered by bacterial suspension. Different concentrations of the essential oil were prepared in methanol. Sterile blank discs (6.4 mm diameter) containing different concentrations of the essential oil (15 μL) were placed on the agar plates. The mean inhibition zone diameter for each concentration of the essential oil was computed after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The lowest concentration of the essential oil that produced a zone of inhibition was considered as showing “antibacterial activity”, meaning the bacterial species was susceptible. A disc containing methanol alone served as the negative control. Standard discs containing ciprofloxacin (5 μg/disc) and penicillin (10 μg/disc) were applied as positive controls. Each concentration was tested in triplicate (
