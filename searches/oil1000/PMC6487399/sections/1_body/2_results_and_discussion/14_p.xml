 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens </italic>essential oil has significant insecticidal activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoplusi ni</italic> via topical and fumigation application. Among its main constituents, myristicin, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene have the most potent inhibitory effects against cabbage looper in topical and fumigation applications, respectively. Thymol and carvacrol as major constituents of the essential oil showed more potent toxicity on 
 <italic class="italic">T. ni</italic> when topically applied than via fumigation. According to other studies, thymol and carvacrol have strong toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera litura</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoplusi ni</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Similar to our results, there are reports that myristicin has an insecticidal effect against 
 <italic class="italic">T. ni</italic> when applied topically (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Additionally, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Helosciadium nodiflorum</italic> showed strong toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">T. ni</italic> due to the presence of myristicin (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>).
