<p class="p">Consistent with other studies, the essential oil examined in our study exhibited considerable antibacterial effect on most of the bacterial strains (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). This activity is likely due to the presence of the phenolic compounds, thymol and carvacrol, or possibly their synergistic action (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). According to our data and other studies, thymol and carvacrol lack antimicrobial activity against

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). It is also noticeable that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and Î³-terpinene, other important constituents of the essential oil, did not exhibit any antibacterial effect when tested individually on the bacterial strains (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>).
