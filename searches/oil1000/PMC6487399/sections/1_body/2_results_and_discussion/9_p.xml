 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori </italic>activity was assessed by an agar dilution method. The anti-
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori </italic>activity of the essential oil and thymol as its major constituent is summarized in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The essential oil showed significant inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori </italic>(MIC = 20.4 µg/mL) whereas thymol inhibited growth of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pylori </italic>only at substantially higher concentration (MIC = 150 µg/mL).
