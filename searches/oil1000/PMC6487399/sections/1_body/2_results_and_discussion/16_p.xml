<p class="p">This study highlighted that the 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens</italic> essential oil could exert a significant inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, the essential oil inhibited AChE activity at a low concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>= 0.117 ± 0.049 µg/mL), whereas the BuChE inhibitory activity was not observed even at higher concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>&gt; 0.5
 <sup class="sup">*</sup> µg/m). Our results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens </italic>essential oil containing high proportions of thymol and carvacrol, possessed potent anti-AChE activity. According to previous studies, thymol and carvacrol individually have shown significant inhibitory activity against AChE (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Moreover, there are several reports of significant anti-AChE activity of essential oils with high content of thymol and carvacrol (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). A number of investigations have considered the inhibition of AChE as an important mode-of-action of essential oils in insects, but to date there is no compelling evidence linking AChE inhibition 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> to insecticidal action
