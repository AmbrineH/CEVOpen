<p class="p">Previous studies of 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens</italic> essential oil reported thymol and carvacrol as the main constituents (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). Moreover, the considerable antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the essential oil have been ascribed to the presence of phenolic compounds (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Thymol and carvacrol exhibit a wide spectrum of biological effects such as antibacterial (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>), and cytotoxic activities (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). These compounds also showed considerable anticholinesterase activity although the relationship to their insecticidal effect is controversial (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Traditional background and pharmacological effects of major essential oil compounds of
 <italic class="italic"> O. decumbens</italic> encouraged us to investigate its various biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic>, insecticidal, anti-cholinesterase and cytotoxic activities. Moreover, our sample of 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens </italic>essential oil, from plants collected at Kohgiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province, Iran was analyzed by GC/MS.
