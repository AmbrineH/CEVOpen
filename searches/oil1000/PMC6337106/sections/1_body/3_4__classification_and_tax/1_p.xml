<p class="p">The taxonomic classification and nomenclature of perilla seems to be controversial and different systems have been published [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Based on the decoration pattern and size of pollen grains, in China, cultivated taxa of perilla could be divided into five varieties: var. 
 <italic class="italic">frutescens</italic>, var. 
 <italic class="italic">arguta</italic>, var. 
 <italic class="italic">crispa</italic>, var. 
 <italic class="italic">auriculato</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">dentata</italic>, and var. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic>. From those varieties, the leaves of var. 
 <italic class="italic">frutescens</italic> and var. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> are usually used as fresh vegetables and to process pickles, var. 
 <italic class="italic">crispa</italic> is used for its medicinal properties, and seeds of var. 
 <italic class="italic">arguta</italic> are used for oil extraction because of its high seed yield [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. It is believed that, based on morphological characters and uses, the genus of 
 <italic class="italic">Perilla</italic> L. consists of only one species and two diverse cultivars, such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> (L.) Britton var. 
 <italic class="italic">frutescens</italic> as an oil seed crop and 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> (L.) Britton var. 
 <italic class="italic">crispa</italic> (Thunb.) W. Deane as a spicy vegetable and medicine, which are cross-fertile (in both varieties, phenotypes with green and purple shoots can be found) [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. According to 
 <italic class="italic">The Plant List</italic> (
 <uri xlink:href="www.theplantlist.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.theplantlist.org</uri>), three varieties—var. 
 <italic class="italic">frutescens</italic>, var. 
 <italic class="italic">crispa</italic> (Thunb.) H.Deane, and var. 
 <italic class="italic">hirtella</italic> (Nakai) Makino—are the accepted species. The anthocyanin-rich purple colored types are frequently used as food colorants in Japan and China [
