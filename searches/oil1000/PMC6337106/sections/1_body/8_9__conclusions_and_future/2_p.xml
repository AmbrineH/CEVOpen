<p class="p">Most of the pharmacological studies outlined in this review are in vitro and in vivo assays that can provide a basis for further studies. The traditional medicinal uses are well-correlated in terms of anti-allergy and anti-depressant activity in which they are claimed for. However, one of the active components of perilla essential oil is perilla ketone, which was found in varied quantities in several perilla species and other herbs. This compound has been shown by Kerr et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] to possess pulmonary toxicity in some animals, e.g., horses, sheep, and cows, but there is no evidence for the toxicity of perilla ketone in humans [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. Toxicological profiles of the active constitutes of perilla, especially aromatic compounds (essential oils), are significantly lacking and need to be addressed. Besides that, the clinical study is not much studied such that further research in this context is necessary to fully ascertain and understand the pharmacological activities and their mechanisms. Although its bioactivity in vitro and in vivo has been revealed to present potential health benefits, such as anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-allergic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective effects, the clinical trials are insufficient to declare a well-established efficacy and safety, therefore human studies are recommended.
