 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> L. varieties have a long traditional usage in many Asian countries and now across the world. The plant has been cultivated for multiple usages, traditionally for curing depression-related disease, asthma, anxiety, tumors, coughs, allergies, intoxication, cold, fever, chills, headache, stuffy nose, and some intestinal disorders, and acts as an antioxidant. Due to genetic variations, it has been exploited as an ornamental plant in gardens. Taxonomical aspects of perilla species must be recognized to avoid misleading identification of the plant species via a proper molecular study. The traditional and local uses of the plant are not well documented in the English literature since the plant originally belongs to the Asian countries, and might be the main reason why the ethnobotanical uses of perilla species are not widespread. In addition, it was also used as an edible aromatic vegetable plant to flavor foods. The leaves and seeds have high nutritional value since the leaf is rich in carotenoids and the seed is rich in fatty acid oils, and both have a potential use as functional dietary supplements in food industries. There are 271 active compounds have been reported including phenolic acids, flavonoids, triterpenes, volatile compounds, policosanols, carotenoids, fatty acids, tocopherols, and phytosterols. In addition to the crude solvent extracts, these phytochemicals (rosmarinic acid, perillaldehyde, luteolin, apigenin, tormentic acid, isoegomaketone) are the most studied natural compounds derived from perilla species.
