 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], the best diagnostic characteristics of perilla are the net-patterned testa and the distinctive smell of the crushed foliage. Perilla is reproduced via seeds. The cultivated varieties are generally grown using direct sowing or raised in nursery beds for transplanting in mid-spring. The optimal germination temperature is 20 Â°C, while it can be grown at slightly lower temperatures. The germination rate is fast and seed viability is lost relatively quickly over time; hence, in practice, fresh seeds are suggested to be used [
