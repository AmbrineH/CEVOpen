 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It is widely cultivated throughout Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and India; however, China is probably considered to be a primary gene center for this species [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Perilla is historically an important herb that has been recorded in Chinese medical classics since around 500 A.D., especially in records named “Ming Yi Bie Lu” (Renown Physicians’ Extra Records), and others where the herb is registered as a drug named “su” which means comforting the body and promoting the blood circulation. From the ancient times in the Song dynasty (960–1279 A.D.), it can be seen that the stem, leaf, and seed of the herb was equally commonly used. The drug items of the herb in traditional Chinese medicine are dried “Perilla leaf”, “Perilla stalk” and “Perilla seed” corresponding to Folium Perillae, Caulis Perillae, and Fructus Perillae in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (1990), while in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (1991), Herba Perillae is listed as a drug derived from the leaves and twigs of perilla [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It has been used as a natural herbal medicine to recover from different symptoms, such as depression-related disease, asthma, anxiety, tumors, coughs, allergies, intoxication, cold, fever, chills, headache, stuffy nose, and some intestinal disorders [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. It is also used as a kitchen herb in salads, sushi, soups, and as a spice, garnish, or food colorant as well. The seed oil is traditionally used to flavor foods [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Perilla also gains market importance in cosmetics, being processed in skin creams, soaps, and dermatological medicinal preparations, because of its biological activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The historical popularity and ethnopharmacological uses of this plant had attracted the interest of scientists to examine their pharmacological properties and resulted in a growing popularity among European countries as well. Interestingly, there are not many comprehensive scientific reviews to cover all aspects of information about perilla. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an up-to-date summary in relation to the botanical, biological, phytochemical properties, and traditional uses in parallel with new perspectives of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic>, and to provide an overview for future research on this plant.
