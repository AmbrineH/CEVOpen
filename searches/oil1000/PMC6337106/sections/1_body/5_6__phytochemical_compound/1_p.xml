<p class="p">There are currently 271 various phytochemical compounds that have been isolated and reported in perilla seeds, stems, and leaves. Based on the chemical properties, these active compounds in perilla could be classified either as hydrophilic (phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins) or hydrophobic (lipophilic) ones (volatile compounds, triterpenes, phytosterols, fatty acids, tocopherols, and policosanols). The identified phytochemicals are listed in
