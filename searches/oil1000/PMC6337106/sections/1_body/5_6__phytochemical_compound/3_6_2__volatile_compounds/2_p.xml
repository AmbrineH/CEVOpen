 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00102-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The method of extraction may have a significant effect on the composition of the extracts too. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] compared hydrodistillation, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE-CO2), and headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of volatile compounds and they found 64 compounds, mainly perillaldehyde and perilla ketone. Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] identified 119 compounds from the essential oil of perilla from eleven different areas, of which the predominant compounds were 2-acetylfuran (max. 82.17%), perillaldehyde (max. 53.41%), caryophyllene (max. 38.34%), laurolene (max. 40.6%), 2-hexanoylfuran (max. 33.03%), 2-butylamine (max. 22.22%), α-asarone (max. 11.85%), farnesene (max. 9.25%), α-caryophyllene (max. 9.16%), and (Z,E)-farnesene (max. 7.14%). Sixty-five aromatic compounds were identified from ten perilla accessions with the predominance of perillaldehyde, perilla ketone, β-dehydro-elsholtzia ketone, limonene, shisofuran, farnesene (Z, E, α), β-caryophyllene, and trans-shisool [
