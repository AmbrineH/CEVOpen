<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are a type of secondary metabolites that can be extracted from different aromatic plant organs such as flowers, buds, stems, bark, leaves, fruits, etc. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Their most frequent components are terpenoids, and aromatic and aliphatic compounds. A number of varieties are distinguished by the various chemical compositions of the essential oils extracted from their plant organs as a primary component of the oil known as chemotypes. According to Ito, Zhang, and Ghimire et al. [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], based on the main components of the EOs, different chemotypes have been described in perilla such as perillaketone (PK) (isoegomaketone), perillaldehyde (PA), elsholtziaketone (EK), citral (C), phenylpropanoids (PP) (myristicin, dillapiole, elemicin), perillene (PL), beta-caryophyllene, myristicine (MT), limonene, and piperitenone (PT). EOs are known to possess various bioactivities including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antiprotozoal, and antioxidant [
