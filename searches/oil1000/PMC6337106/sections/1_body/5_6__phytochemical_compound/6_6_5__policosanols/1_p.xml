<p class="p">Policosanols are very long chain aliphatic alcohols derived from the wax constituent of plants. Contents and compositions of the waxy materials and policosanols (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00102-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) were identified and quantified using thin layer chromatography (TLC), HPLC, and GC. Waxy materials, moisture, and crude lipids from perilla seeds comprised about 72 mg/100 g, 5.6–8.2%, and 51.2–48.4%, respectively, and major components of waxy materials were policosanols (25.5–34.8%), wax esters, steryl esters, and aldehydes (53.0–49.8%), hydrocarbons (18.8–10.5%), acids (1.7–2.1%), and triacylglycerols (1.0–2.9%), analyzed using HPLC. Policosanols extracted in the waxy materials of the PF seeds were also determined based on gas chromatography to be 67–68% octacosanol, 16–17% hexacosanol, and 6–9% triacontanol of the total policosanols composition [
