<p class="p">Perilla oil constitutes roughly 40% of the seed weight, and seeds of perilla are a good source of fatty acid composition such as palmitic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and linolenic acid (C18:3). In addition, the content of unsaturated fatty acids in perilla seed oils is typically over 90%, contains considerably high levels of α-linolenic acid (ω-3 fatty acid) (α–LNA) ranges from 52.58% to 61.98%. Furthermore, the ω-6 (linoleic acid) around 14% and ω-9 (oleic acid) is also present in perilla oil. These polyunsaturated fatty acids are expected to possess various health benefits for humans such as reducing the cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum, lowering the risk of colon cancer, and preventing the excessive growth of visceral adipose tissue [
