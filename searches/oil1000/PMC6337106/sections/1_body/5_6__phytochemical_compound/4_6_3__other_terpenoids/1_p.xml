<p class="p">Carotenoids are organic pigments, which belong to the category of tetraterpenoids and are widely distributed in nature, accumulating in chloroplasts. Perilla showed higher carotenoid content, even compared to β-carotene-rich (carrots, spinach) or lutein-rich (spinach, broccoli, lettuce) crops, where the content of carotenoids in perilla is up to five-fold higher [

The content of β-sitosterol was demonstrated to definitely correlate to the content of linolenic acid [
