 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] described in vitro and in vivo anti-asthmatic effects of perilla seed oil in the guinea pig and concluded that the oil may ameliorate lung function in asthma by regulating eicosanoid production and suppressing leukotriene (LT) generation. Zhao et al. [
