<p class="p">Recently, the demand for natural compounds from plant extracts as effective antibacterial agents against a wide range of bacteria is definitely growing to control human infection and for the preservation of food [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Perilla seed extract rich in polyphenols was examined for its antibacterial activity against oral cariogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococci</italic> and periodontopathic 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>. The ethyl acetate extracts exhibit strong antibacterial activity against oral 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococci</italic> and various strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. gingivalis</italic>. On the other hand, the ethanolic extract of defatted perilla seed weakly inhibited the growth of oral pathogenic bacterial strains. Among the polyphenols, luteolin showed marked antibacterial activity against the oral bacteria tested [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil from perilla leaves on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was studied, and the results showed the effectiveness of this essential oil to inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> were 500 μg/mL and 1250 μg/mL. respectively [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The most abundant terpene-type compound, perillaldehyde, moderately inhibits a broad range of both bacteria in the range of 125–1000 pg/mL. This compound was also particularly active against filament fungi, with MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">M. mucedo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. chrysogenum</italic> already at a 62.5 pg/mL concentration [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Kim and Choi [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] determined the antibacterial activity of the leaf ethanol extracts of PF var. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and detected that the population of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> decreased from 6.660 to 4.060 log CFU/mL, and that of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> from 7.535 to 4.865 log CFU/mL, as well as to 2.600 log CFU/mL via extraction with ethyl acetate.
