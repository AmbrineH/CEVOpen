<p class="p">Epidemiological, clinical, and nutritional studies show that consumption of so-called functional foods and nutraceuticals may be associated with a lowered risk of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. These benefits are often attributed to the high antioxidant capacity of the drug, and especially to the content of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and carotenoids. It has been reported that extracts from perilla seeds and leaves exhibit concentration-dependent antioxidant activity, based on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radical assay, and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6 sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation assay [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Isolated rosmarinic acid (RA) and luteolin from the fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> showed significant DPPH scavenging capacity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) values of 8.61 and 7.50 µM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Similarly, among five phenolic compounds, RA and rosmarinic acid-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside were the dominant phenolic antioxidants with strong activity from cold-pressed perilla var. 
 <italic class="italic">arguta</italic> seed flour studied by Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. RA isolated by these authors from perilla leaf exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity of 88.3 ± 0.7% at a concentration of 10 μg/mL with a drug concentration eliciting 50% of the maximum stimulation (SC50) value of 5.5 ± 0.2 μg/mL. Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] proved that the antioxidant activity of perilla essential oil may depend on the location of cultivation. Extracts of drugs harvested from different regions exhibited varying degrees of scavenging ability at 10 mg/mL concentrations with an inhibition percentage of 94.80 ± 0.03%. The 80% methanol extract of perilla seeds exhibited a strong antioxidant property [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In vivo, the protective activity of RA from 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> leaf (PFL) was demonstrated on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury of d-GalN-sensitized mice owing to the scavenging or reducing activities of superoxide or peroxynitrite rather than to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production [
