<p class="p">Studies show that water extracts of PF may inhibit allergic reactions in vivo and in vitro. PF extracts (0.05 to 1 g/kg) greatly inhibited systemic allergic reactions activated by anti-DNP IgE in rats in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Similarly, the water extract of PFL has been shown to have a positive result against atopic dermatitis in an animal model. The anti-allergic effects of PFL on 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced atopic dermatitis in C57BL/6 mice was evaluated by Heo et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] and the results revealed that an aqueous extract (100 Î¼g/mL) of PFL could significantly inhibit DNFB-induced atopic inflammation by alleviating the expression of MMP-9 and IL-31, as well as augmenting T-bet activity. In another experiment, water extract from PFL significantly suppressed the PCA-reaction, using mice ear-passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA)-reaction, and the authors concluded the role of rosmarinic acid [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Application of an ethanol extract from PF, rather than the aqueous extract, suppressed the allergen-specific Th2 responses. Furthermore, airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in an ovoalbumin-sensitized murine model of asthma were alleviated. Based on this, Chen et al. [
