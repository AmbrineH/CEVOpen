<p class="p">Besides using crude extracts, individual compounds as a potential biologically active agent against allergies have also been studied. A novel glycoprotein fraction from the hot water extract of perilla was used and it was found that it moderately inhibited mast cell degranulation and the activities of hyaluronidase (IC

Furthermore, daily oral supplementation with RA (1.5 mg/mouse, orally) from perilla significantly prevented the increase in the numbers of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and in those around murine airways. Likewise, the expression of IL-4 and IL-5, and eotaxin in the lungs of sensitized mice, together with allergen-specific IgG1, were also inhibited. Due to these findings, the authors revealed RA as an effective intervention against allergic asthma [
