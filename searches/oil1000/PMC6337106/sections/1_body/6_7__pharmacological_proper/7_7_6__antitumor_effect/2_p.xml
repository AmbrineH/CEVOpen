 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] evaluated the inhibitory effects of PFL and they found that it effectively induces apoptosis-related genes and could inhibit cell proliferation in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. They also observed that the inhibitory effect of PFL was much higher than the same dose of commercially available RA and luteolin compounds.
