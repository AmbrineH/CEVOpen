<p class="p">A number of in vivo and in vitro studies have reported the potential anticancer activity of PF. Tormentic acid, a lipophilic triterpene acid from ethanol extracts of red and green PFL, remarkably blocked carcinogenenesis in an in vivo, two-stage mouse skin model [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-00102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Similarly, in an in vivo carcinogenesis model, topical application of perilla-derived fraction (2.0 mg/mouse) led to a significant reduction of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and TPA-promoted tumorgenesis. This is probably based on two independent effects: inhibition of oxidative DNA injury and inhibition of adhesion molecule, chemokine, and eicosanoid synthesis [
