<p class="p">In another study, the application of ethanol extract of PFL resulted in induced apoptosis through the combinations of death receptor-mediated, mitochondrial, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pathways, and substantially suppressed the cell proliferation via p21-mediated G1 phase arrest in human leukemia HL-60 cells [

Isoegomaketone (IK), an essential oil component of PF, was found to be another potential agent possessing anti-cancer activity. IK induces apoptosis through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways in human colon adenocarcinoma DLD-1 cells [
