In another study, daily consumption of perillaldehyde (20 mg/kg, oral) demonstrated significant antidepressant-like effects in mice with LPS-induced depression and the authors concluded a potential benefit in inflammation-related depression [

Inhaling the same compound (perillaldehyde 0.0965 and 0.965 mg/mouse/day, 9 days) had antidepressant-like properties on a stress-induced, depression-like model in mice during the forced swim test (FST) through the olfactory nervous function [
