 <p class="p">Toxic and repellent effects of the essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">Asarum heterotropoides</italic> Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum (Maxim.) Kitag. were evaluated against 
  <italic class="italic">Lasioderma serricorne</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Liposcelis bostrychophila</italic>. The essential oils (EOs) from roots (ER) and leaves (EL) of 
  <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> were obtained separately by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Major components of ER and EL included methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene. Both ER and EL of 
  <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> showed certain toxicity and repellency against 
  <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>. 3,5-Dimethoxytoluene, methyleugenol, and safrole were strongly toxic via fumigation to 
  <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 4.99, 10.82, and 18.93 mg/L air, respectively). Safrole and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene possessed significant fumigant toxicity against 
  <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> (LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.83 and 0.91 mg/L air, respectively). The three compounds all exhibited potent contact toxicity against the two insect species. Here, the EL of 
  <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> was confirmed to have certain toxicity and repellency against stored product insects, providing a novel idea for the comprehensive use of plant resources.
