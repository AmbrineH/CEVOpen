<p class="p">ER and EL from 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> showed toxicity and repellency against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila.</italic> EL of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> was verified to have certain toxicity and repellency against stored product insects, providing some scientific basis for comprehensive development and utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> plant resources. Methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene all exerted good insecticidal effects on 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic>, as a medicinal plant, has the potential to be applied in bio-insecticides. However, safety issues in terms of mammalian health, non-targets, and the environment remains to be ascertained in future work.
