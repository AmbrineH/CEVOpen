<p class="p">Methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene were the most abundant compounds in ER in this work. The main components were consistent with those reported in some previous investigations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. According to GC-MS analysis, 
 <italic class="italic">the</italic> major components of ER and EL were methyleugenol and safrole, but minor components had some differences between the two organs. Content and distribution of individual constituents in EOs were affected by physiological diversities in tissue, organs, and metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Methyleugenol and safrole were major volatile phenylpropenes in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic>. Dan et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] reported that methyleugenol largely contributes to the antimicrobial bioactivity of the EO. Otherwise, it was previously reported that methyleugenol had acaricidal activity toward a stored-food mite, 
 <italic class="italic">Tyrophagus putrescentiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and safrole was highly toxic to some mosquito larvae [
