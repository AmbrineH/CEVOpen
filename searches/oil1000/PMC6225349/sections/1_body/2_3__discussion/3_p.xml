<p class="p">3,5-dimethoxytoluene is one of characteristic scent compounds emitted from flowers of most rose varieties [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Here, for the first time, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene was found to have significant toxicity and certain repellency against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>. 3,5-Dimethoxytoluene, methyleugenol, and safrole are all oxygen-containing aromatic compounds. Among them, methyleugenol and safrole are phenylpropenes. The three testing compounds were potent toxicants against the two stored product insects. The EL of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> was confirmed to have insecticidal activity and repellency against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>. This provides some scientific basis for comprehensive development and utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> plant resources.
