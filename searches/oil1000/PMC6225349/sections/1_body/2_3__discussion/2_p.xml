<p class="p">The phenylpropenes derivatives, safrole and methyleugenol, are good toxicants or repellents to a variety of pests, including

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O-) could greatly enhance the insecticidal activity of phenylpropenes. The distance between the side chain double bond and the benzene ring, along with the methoxy groups attached to either the aromatic ring or the alkyl side chain of C
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>â€“C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> systems, appeared to be determining factors of their insecticidal efficacy and repellency [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Methyleugenol is a male attractant for certain 
 <italic class="italic">Bactrocera</italic> species (Diptera), especially of the oriental fruit fly 
 <italic class="italic">Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> (Hendel). Methyleugenol has been used as a part of the eco-friendly lure-and-kill approach in the control of fruit fly populations [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Here, methyleugenol showed repellency at high concentrations but attraction at lower concentrations against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne.</italic> However, 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> was repelled by methyleugenol at all testing concentrations. Diptera and Coleoptera insects might be more likely to be attracted by low-concentration methyleugenol. This distinct phenomenon was largely related to insect species and sample concentrations. Further work is needed to clarify this finding. As is known, safrole is a hepatic carcinogen and methyleugenol is considered genotoxic. Thus, besides effectiveness evaluation, safety issues on mammalian health, non-targets, and the environment should be emphasized for promoting the practical application of natural products as novel pesticides [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Additionally, in this work, both adults of 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> exposed to safrole were observed to be inactive and torpid at the highest concentration, which could be related to mechanisms of neurotoxic actions [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Many studies showed neurotoxic actions of some EO components. In insects, they can cause paralysis followed by death. There are different mechanisms of action in EOs, such as the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the positive allosteric modulation of GABA, and competition with octopamine in binding to its receptor [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The exploration of mechanisms remains the focus of future work.
