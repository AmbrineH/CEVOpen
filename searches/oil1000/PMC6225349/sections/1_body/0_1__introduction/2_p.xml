Essential oils (EOs) extracted from natural plants are mixtures of low molecular weight with highly volatile secondary metabolites. Diversity of chemical compositions imbue EOs with diverse pharmaceutical and biological activities. Contact, fumigant insecticidal effects, and behavior-modifier influence of a range of EOs have been demonstrated on stored product pests [
