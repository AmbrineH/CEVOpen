<p class="p">The fumigant toxicity of EOs and individual compounds against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> were tested as described by Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine appropriate ranges of testing concentrations. Serial dilution of all samples were prepared in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (five concentrations). Filter paper (diameter 2 cm) was impregnated with 10 μL of testing solution and each paper was placed on the underside of the screw cap of a glass vial (diameter 2.5 cm, height 5.5 cm, volume 27.5 mL). Ten adults were introduced into each vial and the cover was tightened immediately after processing. Fluon was properly coated inside each glass vial to prevent insect contact with the treated filter paper. As for booklice, the experimental method was described by Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A filter paper strip (3.5 × 1.5 cm) was treated with 10 μL of an appropriate concentration of Eos or compounds. The impregnated filter paper was placed in the bottom of a glass jar (250 mL). Ten booklice in a glass bottle (8 mL) were placed into the larger glass jar and exposed for 24 h. For the two insect species, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was used as the negative control. Five replicates were performed for each treatment and control. The number of dead insects was counted after 24 h.
