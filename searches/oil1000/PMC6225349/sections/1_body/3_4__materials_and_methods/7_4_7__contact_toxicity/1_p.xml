<p class="p">For the evaluation of contact toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic>, the method from Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] was employed. Pre-experiments were carried out to define the appropriate testing concentrations. A serial dilution of Eos and compounds with five concentrations were dissolved in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane to prepare. Aliquots (0.5 µL) of the dilutions were applied topically to the dorsal thorax of each insect. Ten insects were used for each concentration. The 10 treated insects were then transferred to each glass vial and kept in incubators. For the bioassays of contact toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>, refer to the method reported by Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A filter paper (diameter 5.5 cm) was soaked with 300 μL of each testing solution. After the solvent was evaporated, the filter paper was fixed on the bottom of a Petri dish (diameter 5.5 cm). Ten booklice were placed into each Petri dish. Then, the dishes were covered and kept in incubators. For the two insect species, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was used as the negative control. All treatments and controls were replicated five times. The number of dead insects was counted after 24 h.
