<p class="p">Components of two samples were determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and GC-MS on a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ instrument (Thermo Finnigan, Lutz, FL, USA) with a capillary column of HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm stationary phase thickness). Similar testing conditions were used for both GC-FID and GC-MS. The column temperature was held at 50 °C for 2 min, then ramped up from 50 to 150 °C at 2 °C/min and held 2 min, and finally reached 250 °C at 10 °C/min, followed by a final hold at 250 °C for 5 min. The injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The volume injected was 1 μL of 1% solution (

Most constituents were identified by comparison of their retention indices with those taken from Adams (2001) and NIST 05 (Standard Reference Data, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Retention indices (RI) were determined by comparison to a homologous series of
