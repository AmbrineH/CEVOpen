<p class="p">The repellent activity of EOs and individual compounds was investigated according to the reference [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Petri dishes were used to confine insects here. For 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic>, the testing solutions of EOs/compounds with three concentrations (78.63, 15.73, and 3.15 nL/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were prepared in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was used as the negative control and DEET was the positive control. The filter paper (9 cm in diameter) was cut in half. Each concentration with 500 μL was applied separately to a half-filter paper with a micropipette, as uniformly as possible. The other half was treated with an equal volume of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. The two halves were air-dried to evaporate the solvent and stuck together in a Petri dish. As for booklice, the Petri dishes and filter papers were 5.5 cm in diameter and the concentrations of EOs/compounds were set at 63.17, 12.63, and 2.53 nL/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Two halves of a filter paper were treated with 150 μL of the solution. In all bioassays, 20 insects were released in the center of each disc and a cover was placed over the dish. Five replicates were carried out for each concentration. The number of insects present on the treated and control portions of each filter paper were recorded at 2 and 4 h post-exposure.
