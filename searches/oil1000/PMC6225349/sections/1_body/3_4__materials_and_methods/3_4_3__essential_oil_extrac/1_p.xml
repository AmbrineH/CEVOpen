<p class="p">The fresh roots and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> were air-dried at room temperature and weighed separately. The two separated organs were subjected to hydrodistillation for 6 h to produce essential oils. The distilled oils were dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate after extraction and their volumes were recorded for yield calculation. The two oil samples were stored in airtight containers in a refrigerator at 4 Â°C until use for bioassays.
