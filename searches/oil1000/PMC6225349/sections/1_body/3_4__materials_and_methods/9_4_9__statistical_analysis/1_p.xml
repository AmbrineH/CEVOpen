<p class="p">All data were analyzed using SPSS V20.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA). In the fumigant and contact assays, LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were calculated with Probit analysis [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]; 95% CI (Confidence interval), related parameters and chi-square values were estimated. In the repellent assays, the percent repellency (PR) was determined by the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">PR (%) = [(
  <italic class="italic">Nc</italic> − 
  <italic class="italic">Nt</italic>)/(
  <italic class="italic">Nc</italic> + 
  <italic class="italic">Nt</italic>)] × 100
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic class="italic">Nc</italic> is the number of insects on the control half and 
 <italic class="italic">Nt</italic> is the number of insects on the treated half. Percentage repellency values were transformed into arcsine and square root values for one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, respectively. Differences between means were considered significant when 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
