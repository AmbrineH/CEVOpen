 <italic class="italic">w</italic>), with densities of 1.05 and 0.97 g/mL respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02131-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The main components of ER included methyleugenol (28.67%), safrole (19.61%), 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (12.63%), and 3-carene (6.13%), whereas methyleugenol (27.05%), safrole (15.73%), Î±-pinene (6.84%) and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (6.37%) were the main constituents of EL. EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">A. heterotropoides</italic> were rich in phenylpropenes (&gt;50%) and bicyclic monoterpenes.
