<p class="p">Results of fumigant and contact toxicity are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02131-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02131-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, respectively. ER and EL exhibited different levels of fumigant toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.78 and 10.47 mg/L air, respectively). Safrole and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene were strongly toxic to 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> by fumigation (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 18.93 and 4.99 mg/L air; 0.83 and 0.91 mg/L air). Methyleugenol (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 10.82 mg/L air) showed similar fumigant activity with EL against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne.</italic> According to LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> was more susceptible to EL (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 8.24 µg/adult) than ER (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 15.22 µg/adult), whereas 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> displayed the opposite response. Methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene were all observed to have potent contact toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>. Notably, LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and safrole against 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> were close to that of phosphine (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 18.72 µg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). In previous papers, the contact toxicities of methyleugenol and safrole (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 12.8 and 14.6 µg/adult, respectively) against 
 <italic class="italic">L. serricorne</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] were reported, as well as the fumigant and contact toxicity of methyleugenol (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 92.21 µg/L air and LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 103.22 µg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) against 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-02131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Here, the two compounds were retested. The effects were similar but LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> or LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values differed quantitatively.
