 <p> Separation of total lipid extracted from R. toruloides grown on 40 g/L glucose with C/N 20 (lane 2) and 500 (lane 3), 20 g/L xylose with C/N 20 (lane 4) and 500 (lane 5), mixture of glucose (40 g/L) and xylose (20 g/L) with C/N 20 (lane 6) and C/N 500 (lane 7), and BSG hydrolysate with C/N 20 (lane 8) and C/N 500 (lane 9). Glyceryl trioleate was used as standard for TAG (triacylglycerides) (lane 1). Corresponding fatty acid methyl esters after transesterification are spotted in lane 10 to lane 17. </p>
