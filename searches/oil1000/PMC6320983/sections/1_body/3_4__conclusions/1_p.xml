<p class="p">The aim of this work was to establish a process for lipid production by oleaginous yeast using BSG hydrolysate. To improve the release of sugars during enzymatic saccharification, BSG was pretreated with two different methods, namely microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment and organosolv pretreatment. Organosolv pretreatment resulted in hydrolysate with higher sugar concentration and for this reason was used for the yeast cultivation. The growth and lipid production of 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> were initially assessed using synthetic media consisting of glucose and xylose as carbon source, where the effect of carbon-to-nitrogen ratio was optimized. Finally, the optimized conditions were used for the culture of oleaginous yeast on BSG hydrolysates at C/N 500, resulting in accumulation of lipids at 10.41 ± 0.34 g/L (lipid content of 56.45 ± 0.76%) and 18.44 ± 0.96 g/L of cell dry weight after 168 h of culture. The fatty acids obtained from this yeast grown on BSG hydrolysate show a similar profile to vegetable oils, which can be used as feedstock for biodiesel production. Moreover, the FAME profile of biodiesel obtained after growth on BSG hydrolysate satisfy the criteria set up by ASTM 6751-3 and EN 14214 for the use as transportation fuel.
