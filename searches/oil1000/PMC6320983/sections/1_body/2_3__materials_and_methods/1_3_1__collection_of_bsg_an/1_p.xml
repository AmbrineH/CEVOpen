<p class="p">All chemicals used in the present study were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). BSG was provided by a local microbrewery. The composition of BSG in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin was determined according to a two stage acid hydrolysis method described in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) protocol [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The ash content of BSG was determined as the percentage of residue remaining after dry oxidation of biomass at 550 to 600 °C for 4 h [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The moisture content was determined gravimetrically after drying the samples in an oven at 105 °C until constant weight was reached. To reduce the moisture content of the wet BSG, it was dried in an oven at 60 °C for two days, followed by grinding it to a particle size of &lt;3 mm by a commercial kitchen blender to improve the pretreatment efficiency. The grinded BSG was stored at room temperature until further use.
