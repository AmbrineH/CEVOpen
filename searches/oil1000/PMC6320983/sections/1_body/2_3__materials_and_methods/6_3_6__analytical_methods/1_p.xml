<p class="p">To analyze the morphological variations during lipid accumulation in the living cells of 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> grown in glucose based medium and BSG, 10 µL cultures were drawn at different time intervals and the cells were visualized in a compound light microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). The growth of yeast cells was monitored by measuring the cell optical density (O.D.) at 600 nm with a Genesys 10 S, UV/visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In order to estimate the cell dry weight, 50 mL culture was harvested by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 10 min) and the obtained pellets were kept on preweighed filter paper. The filter paper along with biomass was oven dried overnight at 60 °C and weighed using an analytical balance. The cell dry weight of 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> was expressed as g/L. The concentration of the sugars was determined by an HPLC equipped with a refractive index detector and a Biorad Aminex HPX-87N column (BioRad, Hercules, CA, US). The column was maintained at 85 °C and 0.01 M Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The sugar consumption (%) was calculated with the following equation:
