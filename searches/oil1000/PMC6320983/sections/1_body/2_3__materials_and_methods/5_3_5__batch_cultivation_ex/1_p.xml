<p class="p">To study the effect of BSG hydrolysate on the growth and lipid accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic>, the hydrolysate was diluted with distilled water to obtain a hydrolysate containing 40 g/L glucose with the amount of xylose being 21.5 g/L under these conditions. Thereafter, BSG hydrolysate was supplemented with a basal medium including YNB without ammonium sulphate and amino acids (0.76 g/L), and yeast extract (0.1 g/L). The C/N ratio was adjusted to 20 and 500 g/g by adding the appropriate amount of (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> as nitrogen source. The amount of protein present in BSG (90 mg/L) was also taken into account for the calculation of C/N ratio. Finally, the pH was adjusted to 5.5 prior to sterilization.
