<p class="p">The oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> NCYC 1576, procured from the National Collection of Yeast Culture (Norwich, UK) was used in the present work. The yeast culture was maintained on YPD (glucose, 20 g/L; peptone, 20 g/L; and yeast extract, 10 g/L) agar plates, which were sub-cultured at least twice per month to maintain the strain fresh. For the seed culture, yeast was initially cultivated in YPD broth at 28 °C for 24 h and the cells were harvested followed by washing with sterile distilled water to remove the media components. A cell density of 6.5–7.8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells/mL was obtained by adding the appropriate amount of sterile distilled water which was then used as the seed culture.
