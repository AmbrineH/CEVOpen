<p class="p">For the optimization of the lipid accumulation, a fixed amount of glucose (40 g/L) and xylose (20 g/L) were mixed with yeast nitrogen base (YNB) without ammonium sulphate and amino acids (0.76 g/L) and yeast extract (0.1 g/L). The amount of glucose and xylose (2:1) were chosen on the basis of the amount present in the BSG hydrolysate. The different C/N ratios (20 to 200, 300, 400 and 500) were then adjusted by varying the concentration of (NH
