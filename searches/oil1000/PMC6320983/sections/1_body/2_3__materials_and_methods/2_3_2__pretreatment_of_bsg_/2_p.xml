<p class="p">Enzymatic saccharification of the pretreated BSG was carried out using the commercial enzyme solution Cellic CTec2 (Novozymes A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) at a concentration equal to 20 FPU/g of solids. To enable better hydrolysis of the hemicellulose, Cellic CTec2 was supplemented with Accellerase XY (DuPont, Wilmington, Delaware, USA) at a ratio of 1:5 (

Sampling was done in 3 h intervals until the maximum saccharification was achieved and then the slurry was centrifuged to separate the solids from the liquid. The liquid part was used for sugar quantification by HPLC (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and then used as the cultivation medium for the growth of the yeast. Bradford protein assay was used to measure the concentration of total protein in the hydrolysate.
