<p class="p">In the present study, BSG was pretreated with two different methods to facilitate the increment of cellulose content in the pretreated solids and to maximize the release of sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. The first method involved a microwave assisted alkali pretreatment as described previously in the protocol of Ravindran et al. (2018) [

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> dried BSG in 0.5% NaOH was prepared in a capped flask and subjected to microwave radiation in a domestic microwave at 400 W for 60 s. At the end of the treatment, the biomass was filtrated in a vacuum filtration unit and washed with distilled water until pH 6.0 was reached. Finally, the pretreated solids were air-dried on filter paper at room temperature. The dried solid residue was used for compositional analysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. In the second method, BSG was treated with organosolv pretreatment as previously described by our group [

Organosolv pretreatment took place at 175 Â°C for 60 min in metallic cylinders, which were placed in an air-heated multi-digester apparatus. At the end of the procedure, the pretreated solids were separated from the liquor by vacuum filtration, washed with ethanol and then air dried at room temperature.
