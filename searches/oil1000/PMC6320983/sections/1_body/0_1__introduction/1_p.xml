<p class="p">Nowadays, the most significant challenge for researchers, environmentalists, and stakeholders is to clean our environment as it is rapidly deteriorating as a consequence of increasing demand of land, water, food, and energy [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Increasing public concerns about global warming and green-house gas emissions attributed to the use of fossil fuels have attracted the attention to these issues which are considered as a grand challenge in the 21st century [

Apart from the environmental concerns raised by using fossil resources for energy production, import of fossil fuels is also negatively impacting domestic economies due to supply insecurity. For any developed and developing nation it is crucial to uphold economical and sustainable growth with the utilization of domestic and renewable sources of energy so that the import of oils can be reduced [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In recent years, fuels produced from biomass-based resources have received a growing interest as they are among the most promising replacements for non-renewable fossil fuel energy [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, utilization of edible sources as raw materials for biofuels production can directly compete with human foods and has therefore been criticized [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Hence, it is essential to explore novel, alternative, sustainable, and renewable feedstocks for energy production to satisfy the current and future energy requirement of our society.
