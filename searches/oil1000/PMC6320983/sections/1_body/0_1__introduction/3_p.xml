<p class="p">Brewers’ spent grain (BSG) is the main by-product of the beer brewing industries, accounting for 85% of the total by-products generated [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The brewing process involves several stages, namely malting, milling, mashing, brewing, cooling and fermentation [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. After the enzymatic conversion (mashing) of barley starch, the insoluble materials of grains are generally filtered from the sweet wort containing the fermentable sugars, generating the BSG [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For each 100 L of brewed beer produced, almost 20 kg of wet BSG is generated as a by-product [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In Europe alone, the generation of BSG reaches approximately 3.4 million tons per year [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], which is expected to further increase as a result of the blooming micro-brewery market. BSG is a lignocellulosic biomass that consists mainly of fibers such as cellulose and hemicellulose and other compounds such as protein, lipids, starch, and lignin [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The chemical composition of BSG is dependent on the type of barley grains, its harvesting time, the addition of other adjuncts, the composition of the hops, and of course the brewing technology [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Due to high moisture content together with high content in polysaccharides and proteins, BSG is prone to microbial contamination making its storage stability limited to up to 7–10 days [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This also has an impact on the transportation of BSG, which becomes expensive due to high-water content, resulting in the discharge of BSG in landfills being a common practice which can lead to environmental problems [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These characteristics reduce the commercial value of BSG with the use as livestock feed to be the most common practice aside landfilling for the treatment of BSG [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. To improve the commercial value of BSG and reduce the environmental issues of the uncontrolled emission in landfills, there is a strong research interest in both, establishing techniques that will improve its storage stability and evaluating new valorization schemes that will yield high-added value. To this extent, various techniques have been applied for its storage and preservation [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], whereas applications such as human nutrition, energy production, charcoal production, adsorbents, and incorporation in biotechnological applications have been studied [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. As for the biotechnological application, BSG has been studied as a substrate for enzyme production, biogas, ethanol fermentation, cultivation of mushrooms, and production of lactic acid [
