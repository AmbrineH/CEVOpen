<p class="p">The objective of the current work is to study the potential of incorporating BSG in the production of renewable energy in the form of biodiesel. For this purpose, we studied the growth and the lipid accumulation of the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodosporidium toruloides</italic>, a yeast capable of co-utilizing xylose and glucose, when using BSG as medium. As BSG is a lignocellulosic rich substrate, it presents a natural recalcitrance towards enzymatic depolymerization of the insoluble carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose). To improve the release of soluble sugars from BSG, we incorporated a pretreatment step with organosolv and microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment prior to enzymatic saccharification.
