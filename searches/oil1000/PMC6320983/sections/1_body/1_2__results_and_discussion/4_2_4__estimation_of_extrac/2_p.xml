<p class="p">Oil feedstocks with a high amount of FFAs are not suitable for conversion into biodiesel using an alkaline catalyst [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Such oils require an esterification first with an acid catalyst to reduce the content of FFA in the feedstock prior to transesterification with a basic catalyst to complete the transesterification reaction [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Feedstocks with a high amount of TAGs are always a better choice for biodiesel production through transesterification, as in a complete reaction every mole of TAG produces three moles of biodiesel and one mole of glycerol [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Almost all TAGs and FFAs were converted into FAMEs by the transesterification reactions as shown in lane 10 to lane 17.
