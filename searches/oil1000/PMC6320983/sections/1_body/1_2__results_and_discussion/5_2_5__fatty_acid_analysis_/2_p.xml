<p class="p">The biodiesel properties were theoretically estimated by using fatty acid profiles of oleaginous yeast grown on various substrates as listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and the data was compared to international standards such as ASTM 6751-3 (USA) and EN 14214 (Europe) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Biodiesel is defined as a mixture of alkyl esters of the corresponding fatty acid profile of the parent oil, mainly containing carbon chains of C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub> to C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>. However, significant amounts of chain lengths other than C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub>-C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> have also been reported in some feedstocks such as tropical oils (e.g. coconut oil) enriched in shorter-chain acids such as lauric acid [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The LCSF (long chain saturation factor) is one of the most important criterion that is interconnected with the estimation of significant parameters of biodiesel such as oxidative stability, cetane number, viscosity and cold flow behavior [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The LCSF is affected by the chain length of the fatty acid, the number and position of the double bonds present in the fatty acids. A high value for LCSF gives a negative impact on the cold flow behavior of biodiesel. Cold flow behavior is measured by the CFPP (cold filter plugging point), which is a measurement of the lowest temperature where a fuel can easily pass through a standardized filtration unit in a specific time [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In cold environment, especially in Northern European countries, the low-temperature operability of biodiesel is a major problem due to crystallization of fuel in the pipeline of the engine [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Based on the data listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the values for LCSF were 7.978, 8.562, 8.456, 8.772, 5.517, 6.736, 3.405, and 8.060 for the biodiesel obtained from oleaginous yeast grown on 40 g/L glucose with C/N 20 and 500, 20 g/L xylose with C/N 20 and 500, mixture of glucose (40 g/L) and xylose (20 g/L) with C/N 20 and C/N 500, and BSG hydrolysate with C/N 20 and C/N 500, respectively, and the corresponding CFPP values were 8.6, 10.4, 10.1, 11.1, 0.9, 4.7, 0.6, and 8.8 °C. It is clear from the data that the biodiesel obtained from oleaginous yeast cultivated on BSG hydrolysate with C/N 20 has the lowest value of CFPP (0.6 °C) compared to the rest of the oils, which could be suitable for operation in cold environment.
