<p class="p">Oxidative stability, which is dependent on the degree of unsaturation of a fatty acid, is another important parameter that determines the shelf-life of a fuel [

 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> fulfills the criteria established by both standards, ASTM 6751-3 (minimum 3 h) and EN 14214 (minimum 6 h). The highest degree of oxidative stability (12.1 h) was observed when the oleaginous yeast was grown on BSG hydrolysate with C/N 500 (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Cetane numbers (CN) of all the biodiesels listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> also meet the criteria stipulated by ASTM 6751-3 (minimum 47 min) and EN 14214 (minimum 51 min). CN has two limits, a lower and an upper one. Values above the upper limit reduce the engine efficiency due to improper mixing of air when starting the engine, while values below the low limit cause problems in low-temperature operation and result in high emissions of hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The highest value of CN (61.8) was obtained with the biodiesel from the oleaginous yeast grown in 20 g/L xylose with C/N 20 while the lowest value (52.1) was obtained with BSG hydrolysate with C/N 20 (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). It is clear from the above discussion, that high MUFA content is advantageous as it enhances the cold flow plugging properties (CFPP) while high SFA content gives a high value of oxidative stability. Therefore, it is important to control all biodiesel properties with the optimum ratio of SFA to MUFA in FAME [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Finally, the biodiesel produced from the lipids derived from the yeast growing on BSG hydrolysate presents a higher high heating value (38.7 MJ/Kg) compared to other biodiesels. The high heating value of some vegetable oils such as cotton seeds oil, coconut oil, and palm kernel oil were reported as 38.93, 37.54, and 37.68, respectively [
