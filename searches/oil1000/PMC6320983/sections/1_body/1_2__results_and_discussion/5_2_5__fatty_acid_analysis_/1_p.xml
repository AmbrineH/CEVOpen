 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> was grown on 40 g/L glucose at C/N 20, the fatty acid content was C

 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The oleaginous yeast grown on 20 g/L of xylose at C/N 20 synthesized 26.87% of SFAs (saturated fatty acids), 43.45% of MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids) and 27.19% of PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) while the corresponding values at C/N 500 were 30.46%, 42.37% and 15.3%, respectively. When a mixture of glucose 40 g/L and xylose 20 g/L at C/N 20 was provided to 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides,</italic> the SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs were 26.87%, 43.45%, and 27.19%, respectively, while at C/N 500 the corresponding values were 31.4%, 52.3%, and 14.31%, respectively. A similar trend was also observed when this yeast was grown on BSG hydrolysate, as 20.07% of SFAs were observed with C/N 20, while an increased value of SFAs (33.10%) was observed at C/N 500 (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03052-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Decreasing content of MUFAs from 54.84% to 50.85% and PUFAs from 24.84% to 13.97% were observed when 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> was shifted from C/N 20 to C/N 500.
