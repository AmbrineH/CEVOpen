<p class="p">The lipid accumulation by oleaginous microorganisms is not only dependent on the initial concentration of the provided carbon source but also differs depending on other media components and can be enhanced by keeping a key nutrient limited [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Key nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur and their ratios with the carbon source (C/N, C/P, C/S) have been argued to have an important effect on the lipid accumulation [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For this purpose, prior to the cultivation of the yeast on the BSG hydrolysates, the C/N ratio was optimized with the aim to achieve high lipid accumulation in the yeast cells. The optimization experiment for the lipid accumulation in 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> on synthetic media mimicking the composition of BSG hydrolysates was carried out with a mixture of 40 g/L of glucose and 20 g/L of xylose, as similar concentrations of glucose and xylose were observed in the organosolv pretreated BSG after enzymatic hydrolysis. The nitrogen concertation was adjusted by varying the amount of ammonium sulphate aiming to obtain different C/N (g/g) ratios ranging from 20 to 500. The cell dry weight (g/L), total lipid concentration (g/L) and lipid content (%,

 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> grown on different C/N ratios are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. An increase in cell dry weight from 10.38 ± 0.83 g/L to 14.39 ± 0.32 g/L along with a significant increase in lipid accumulation from 0.66 ± 0.12 g/L to 8.0 ± 0.54 g/L was observed when the C/N ratio was increased from 20 to 500 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Initially, the cultivation was studied in a range from C/N 20 to C/N 180 (g/g), however, the increasing lipid accumulation in the cellular compartment prompted us to check even higher C/N ratios ranging from 180 to 500. The cell dry weight presented only a minor increase from 13.88 ± 0.13 g/L to 14.39 ± 0.32 g/L when the C/N ratio increased from 200 to 500, however, a steep increase in lipid concentration from 4.97 ± 0.62 g/L to 8.00 ± 0.54 g/L was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The increase in cell dry weight was observed mainly due to the increased amount of lipids accumulated in the cellular compartment of the oleaginous yeast as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Large lipid droplets in the cellular compartment of the oleaginous yeast were observed with increasing C/N ratios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Lipid-free dry biomass decreased with increasing C/N ratio, which is also reported by other researchers [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>].This is a result of a rapid decrease in intracellular AMP concentration as a consequence of nitrogen exhaustion from the medium, which affects the Krebs cycle function. The carbon flow is directed towards the synthesis of intra-mitochondrial citric acid due to the deactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenase as a result of low intracellular AMP [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. High amounts of citric acid in the mitochondria are exchanged with malic acid, which is present in the cytoplasm, via the citrate/malate translocase present in the mitochondrial membrane. Citric acid is then cleaved into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by the action of the ATP-citrate lyase. Finally, acetyl-Co-A and malonyl-Co-A react together to form fatty acid chains between C

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This mechanism is the reason why the excess of glucose in low nitrogen conditions is converted into fatty acids in oleaginous yeast [
