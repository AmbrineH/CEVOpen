<p class="p">Lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates contain mainly two sugars, namely glucose and xylose, whereas other sugars such as mannose and arabinose might be present, depending on the source of biomass [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Glucose is the most preferred carbon source among such monomeric carbon sources by the majority of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The microorganisms do not shift to the consumption of other sugars until glucose is fully consumed. Co-utilization of glucose with other sugar sources is rarely observed, however, this strategy has potential to improve the economics of biofuel and value-added chemical production by microbial fermentation [
