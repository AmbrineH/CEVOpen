<p class="p">Co-utilization of C6- and C5-sugar sources by oleaginous yeasts is a rare event and the consumption of various carbon sources is strain dependent as the same oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> CCT 0783 has the ability to co-utilize glucose and fructose almost at the same consumption rate [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. On the other hand, other strains of 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> are reported to utilize sugars sequentially. For example 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> ATCC 24196 consumes glucose at a faster rate than xylose, xylulose and xylitol [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> DSM4444 was explored for the utilization of lignocellulosic-based sugars for lipid production [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. This strain also showed sequential sugar utilization and consumption of xylose was observed when glucose levels were below 20 g/L [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Not only 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodosporodium</italic> sp. but also other oleaginous yeast strains have the capability to consume glucose and xylose simultaneously, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lipomyces starkeyi</italic> AS 2.1560 cultivated on glucose and xylose (2:1, 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) for lipid production [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">Trichosporon fermentans</italic> was grown on sulphuric acid treated rice straw hydrolysatecontaining glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and cellobiose and synthesized 10.4 g/L lipid in its cellular compartment [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">R. toruloides</italic> Y2 was studied for lipid production by using waste nutrients from bioethanol waste water and synthesized 34.9% lipid content on the basis of cell dry weight while the lipid content was increased up to 53.8% on addition of glucose (1.2 g/L) [
