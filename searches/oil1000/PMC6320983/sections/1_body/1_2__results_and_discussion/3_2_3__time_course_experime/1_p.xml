<p class="p">After the optimization of the C/N ratio to yield high lipid accumulation, the use of BSG hydrolysates was tested at an initial sugar concentration of 40 g/L glucose and 21.5 g/L xylose. The time course experiments of the cell dry weight (g/L), total lipid concentration (g/L), lipid content (%,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The highest cell dry weight (18.44 ± 0.96 g/L) and lipid concentration (10.41 ± 0.15 g/L) were observed when cells were grown in BSG hydrolysate for 168 h. Almost all glucose (96.42%) had been consumed after120 h of cultivation, while only 77.34% of xylose had been utilized in the same period. The maximum utilization of xylose was observed when glucose levels were below 25 g/L. The lipid synthesis was minimal at the initial phase of cultivation as the increment of lipid accumulation from 16.32 ± 0.67%

The enhancement in biomass compared to the synthetic media can be attributed to the presence of other nutrients in BSG hydrolysates (data not reported here).
