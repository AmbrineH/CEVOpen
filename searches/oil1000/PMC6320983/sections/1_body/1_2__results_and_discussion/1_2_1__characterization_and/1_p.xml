<p class="p">BSG is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin along with considerable amounts of proteins and lipids and its composition varies depending on the applied brewing techniques [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The chemical composition of BSG along with its high fiber content enables it to serve as a potential feedstock for several commercial processes, including applications in biotechnology, thermochemical and biochemical engineering such as renewable energy, enzyme production and bread making, as well as production of ethanol, butanol, xylitol, activated carbon, charcoal and oligo saccharides production [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. A comparative study of BSG composition from various sources including the BSG used in the present work is presented in
