<p class="p">To effectively incorporate BSG in a biotechnological application, a pretreatment step is often required, aiming to disrupt the natural recalcitrance of lignocellulose. As a result of the pretreatment, the polysaccharides are exposed and become easier saccharified by the action of cellulolytic enzymes. In this study, two different pretreatment strategies (microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment and organosolv) were evaluated on the ability to enhance the subsequent saccharification yields. The pretreated BSG was enzymatically hydrolyzed by using a mixture of the commercial enzyme solution Cellic CTec2 and Accellerase XY in a 5:1 ratio (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03052-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A, the amount of glucose and xylose production from the organosolv treated BSG increased up to 27 h of saccharification. The total amount of glucose reached 46.45 ± 1.43 g/L after 27 h of enzymatic saccharification. At the same time, the total amount of xylose was 25.15 ± 1.36 g/L. In the case of microwave assisted alkaline pretreated BSG, the values for glucose and xylose were lower compared to the organosolv pretreated BSG, reaching 34.86 ± 1.27 g/L and 16.54 ± 2.1 g/L, respectively, after 27 h of saccharification (
