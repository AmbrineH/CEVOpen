 <p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are often encapsulated in various and complex matrices to protect them against potential degradation or to control their release. To achieve an optimum use in food products, their rapid and precise quantification after encapsulation and storage is required. Hence, a rapid ATR-FTIR method was developed and tested with two encapsulated essential oils (EOs): clove (
  <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic>) and spearmint (
  <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic>);. Despite, the complexity of the matrix, this method coupled with univariate or multivariate regression models exhibited high potential for global quantification of the two encapsulated EOs. For clove EO, in relation to the major presence of eugenol and eugenol acetate, an analysis based on a unique band (1514 cm
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) was sufficient to obtain a good prediction with RMSEP value of 0.0173 g of EO per g of matrix. For spearmint oil which is characterized by numerous terpenoid compound, three bands (799, 885, and 1680â€“1676 cm
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) were suitable for a good prediction with RMSEP value of 0.0133. ATR-FTIR method was compared with a reference gas chromatography FID quantitative method in an EO release experiment and its efficiency was evaluated through modeling by the Avrami equation. Beside time saving, the ATR-FTIR method was also capable of monitoring the EO profile. This method could be easily adapted as a routine analysis in the EOs industry as quality control.
