<p class="p">This study investigated the use of ATR-FTIR technique for determining the global content of clove and spearmint EOs trapped in a starch and proteins based matrix. The developed ATR-FTIR prediction models were based on univariate or multivariate regression analysis after selection of spectral bands. Only identified characteristic spectral bands of major compounds were included in the models because they strongly govern the variability between the matrices with different EO loads. For clove essential oil a univariate analysis regression is successfully applied while for spearmint oil multivariate analysis regression based on 3 bands is needed for good prediction. Although the plurality of aroma compounds of the EO composition and the presence of compounds at low concentration, this approach based on specific bands proved to be reliable, robust and appropriated for a global quantification of encapsulated EOs. For both EOs, the models were found of comparable quality than the GC-FID analysis reference method. In addition, the method shows the possibility to follow the global release of encapsulated EO without valuable loss of information and to monitor changes in the EOs profile,

The ATR-FTIR method can be adapted for a global quantification of EOs encapsulated in a complex matrix. By developing a specific calibration of each EO, this method can be used as routine analysis to follow the evolution of the aroma profile during storage. This technique allows a reduced time of analysis (minimal sample preparation) and has the advantage to be more chemical sustainable since there is no need of organic solvents for extraction.
