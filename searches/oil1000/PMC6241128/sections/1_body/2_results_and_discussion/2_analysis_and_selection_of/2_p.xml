<p class="p">When developing chemometrics quantification methods for EOs, most of them include the selection of a C = O stretching absorption band as it is broad and strong because of a large change in the dipole taking place in that mode.[

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] This C = O bond is present in the functional groups of some terpenoids or phenylpropanoids as eugenol. Given the fact that in the current study the C = O spectral range (1705â€“1650 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) overlapped the matrices fingerprint (interference problem); the spectra zones selected in the chemometrics analysis were chosen in function of the most prominent spectral bands corresponding to the EOs major compounds. It is important to notice that biological and functional activities of the EOs are mainly attributed to these compounds. Therefore, to identify and include these specific bands is primordial to assure the performance of the model. The spectra ranges highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> indicate the wavenumbers zones selected to perform the CLS multivariate analysis. The selected zones had a minimal superposition with the reference matrix spectral ranges which makes easier the identification and quantification of the EO.
