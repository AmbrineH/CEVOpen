<p class="p">First, a preliminary analysis was performed for clove EO by including the region range between 1000–1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> to take into account specific vibration modes of its compounds. In this range, the stretching vibration modes of the aromatic C = C bond[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] (1514 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) present in eugenol, eugenol acetate, and methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate and the asymmetric stretch C-O-C linkage of the ether functional group (1100–1210 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>)[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] present in eugenol were considered. However, due to poor quality results (data not shown) in the calibration/quantification model the zone range was reduced to a specific spectral band as highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>.The chosen C = C aromatic bond is present in the spectra of 4-allylphenol too. However, regarding its structure, the specific stretching vibration absorption bands of the allyl group are located at 1637 and 995 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. For this reason, this compound has not been included in the quantification method. Stretching vibrations of C = C bond is known to be miscellaneous[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] since it is present in acyclic terpenes such as linalool and ocimene, and cyclic compounds with an allyl group in their structure like 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">τ−</italic>cadinol, and cadinene. However, it is obvious that the band intensity is low or missing in the spectra of limonene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>) an acyclic terpene. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze reference standards for all the compounds desired to identify or quantify to avoid miscalculations. In the same way the spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene did not showed this specific band as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>. This implied that 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide could not be identified and quantified by considering only this specific band. Then, by selecting this band, the two major components eugenol, eugenol acetate of clove EO but also methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate were represented covering ~86.5 percentage of the total EO composition. The rest of compounds present in clove EO involved sesquiterpenes (12.3%), alcohols (0.24%), esters (0.97%), ketones (0.09%), aldehydes (0.06%) and a monoterpene (0.02%). One way to increase the sensitivity of the method would be to integrate the sesquiterpenes (12.3%) proportion into the model; however, this class lacks of a characteristic spectral band that could represent the global amount of this group. Concerning the spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene and its sesquiterpene nature, potential spectral regions (from 1446 to 800 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) could be selected, but that implies spectra superposition with the unloaded matrix decreasing the confidence of specific compound identification. The addition of specific spectral regions characterizing the functional groups of the other EO compounds would include ketones (1750–1705 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) alcohols (3600–3500 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), and aldehydes (1740–1720 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). However, as these compounds were in minority and their spectra overlapped with the unloaded matrix spectrum, we considered negligible the addition of these zones into a multivariate model.
