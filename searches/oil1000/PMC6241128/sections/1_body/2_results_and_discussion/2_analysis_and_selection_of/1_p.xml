<p class="p">The study of the matrices without added EOs revealed their high complexity. The matrices were composed of polysaccharides (starch and cellulose), lipids, and proteins. The matrix showed a main band corresponding to starch[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] which was centered at 1017 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> with shoulders at 930 and 1078, and 1151 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Glucoside groups (C-OH) that correspond to starch fingerprint showed intensity at 1100â€“1000 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, the increase of the band at 1000 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is also linked to water content in the starch matrix.[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] The rest of the signals corresponding to the matrix is mainly caused by C-H stretching vibrations modes between 2920 and 2851 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (symmetric CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and asymmetric CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) related to different compounds of biological material such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins.[

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] Stretching and bending modes at 1648 and 1542 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> associated to protein content were also attributed to the matrix composition.[
