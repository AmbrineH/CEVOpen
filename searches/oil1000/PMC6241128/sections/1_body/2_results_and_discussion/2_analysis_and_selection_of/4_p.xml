<p class="p">For spearmint EO, monoterpenes represented the major proportion of the EO (91.1%) and among them, (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-carvone is the major compound (49.4%). In consequence, the selection of a spectral band that corresponds to carvone is primordial. (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-carvone exhibits a strong peak at the range of 1680–1676 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> that corresponds to the stretching of its unsaturated carbonyl group[

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The selection of this band involved the overlapping of peaks of other compounds present in spearmint EO. As an example 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref> shows the overlapping of a peak corresponding to limonene at 1643 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Spectra superposition can decrease the sensitivity of the chemometrics method if based on one compound. However, this was compensated by the addition of two strong appearing bands at 885 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 799 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> that correspond to the = C-H vibration of the disubstituted and trisubstituded double bonds respectively of (

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The addition of these two spectral regions enabled a quantitative analysis of IR spectra despite the overlap of

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarizes the main IR absorption bands corresponding to the specific compounds of both essential oils used to the development of the proposed ATR-FTIR method. In short, for clove EO, only one band could be used to build a model while three bands will be needed for Spearmint EO.
