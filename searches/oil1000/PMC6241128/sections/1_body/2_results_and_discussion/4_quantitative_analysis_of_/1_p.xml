 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows the results for GC-FID quantification of EOs as well as the resulting ATR-FTIR based calibration and validation models using the pre-selected bands for each EO. For clove EO, spectroscopic data was composed of nine concentrations and each one of them was performed by triplicate. For each sample, four collected spectra were acquired by deposing around 13 mg of sample (grinded matrix enriched with EO) over the ATR crystal. From the total of 108 scans obtained, 71 were selected to construct the prediction model and 37 spectra acquisition were taken out to build the validation model. For spearmint EO calibration data consisted in three collected spectra per sample corresponding to one concentration. Triplicates were performed for each one of them, resulting in a curve of six concentrations. From the total of 54 acquisition obtained, 36 were selected to construct the prediction model and 18 scans were taken out to build the validation model. In these conditions, for both EOs, accurate predictions were obtained as indicated by the high values of

RMSEC expressed the average calibration error of the models, RMSECV represents the errors calculated on the method giving an estimate of how the model is built on the data set to predict values for unknown samples and last, RMSEP is an indicator of the performance of the model by stating the prediction error. These values are also reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Lower values of RMSEP were observed in the spearmint EO quantification model than the ones found in the clove EO quantification model. This demonstrated that spearmint EO quantification model is more reliable than the one used for clove EO. Moreover, bias is negligible (

RPD calculated value from all the data set of clove EO is higher than 6, indicating a good ability for quantification. In the other hand, the RPD calculated value for spearmint EO was higher, which means that the application for this method could go from screening to quality control[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This illustrates that the selection of spectral regions which represent the major aroma compounds of EO and having the minimum superposition with the matrices spectra provided a good global quantification. As suggested by Gudi

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,(2013)[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] the increase of samples and repetitions allows to improve performance and robustness of the calibration. It is the reason why in this study more repetitions were done for clove EO compared to spearmint EO.
