<p class="p">Regarding the sensitivity of the ATR-FTIR method, acceptable LODs were obtained with values inferior to 0.004 g EO/g matrix (
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). These values were obtained by multiplying by 3 the standard deviation measured on 15 blank samples and dividing the resulting value by the slope of the ATR-FTIR standard curve. To calculate the LOQs values, same procedure was followed, but standard deviation values were multiplied by 10 instead of 3. These values are relatively high but are adapted to the quantification of matrices enriched in EOs. Last statements are supported by the results obtained with the standard extraction followed by quantification GC procedure. Indeed, the lowest concentration point of the calibration curve analyzed by ATR-FTIR reached 0.0139±0.0002 g of spearmint EO corresponding to 0.0142±0.0012 g of EO deposed for 1g of matrix. In the same way, matrices loaded with 0.0128±0.001 g of clove EO showed 0.011±0.002 g of EO by the GC-FID analysis. The comparison of the ATR-FTIR calibration curves with those obtained by GC-FID showed a good correlation. Bias between the determination coefficients of validation from both ATR-FTIR and GC-FID methods were 0.0057 for spearmint EO and 0.0222 for clove EO, considering as reference values, the GC-FID results. Results obtained between the ATR-FTIR and GC-FID calibration curves proved that it is possible to detect and quantify low amounts of clove and spearmint EOs by the ATR-FTIR method without time consuming for extraction.
