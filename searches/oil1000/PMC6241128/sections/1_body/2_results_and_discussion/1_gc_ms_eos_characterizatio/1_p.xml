<p class="p">The identification and characterization by GC-MS of clove and spearmint essential oils showed 21 and 25 different chemical compounds respectively (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). For clove EO, the two major compounds were two phenylpropanoids: eugenol and eugenol acetate, which constituted around 86% of the identified components. Clove EO exhibited also sesquiterpenes, which represented the second major class of components with 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene (9.77%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-caryophyllene or 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-humulene (1.39%) and caryophyllene oxide. The other identified compounds including esters, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and one monoterpene compound were present at a very weak percentage &lt;1%. Madagascar is the origin of the clove EO used in this study, but it showed a similar chemical composition as a Turkish clove bud EO where eugenol (87%) and eugenol acetate (8%) represented 95% of the whole EO at the detriment of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene (3.56%).[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] In contrast, the clove EO differed in composition and proportion of those identified by Hossain 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, (2014) and obtained from varieties of clove collected in different countries of the gulf regions. Indeed, the second major compound was 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene (between 23 and 31% of the total EO) and the third eugenol acetate (~ 4 to 6%). Certainly, EOs composition can vary due to environmental and geographic conditions, agricultural practices, age and part of the plant used for extraction (
