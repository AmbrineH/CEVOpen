<p class="p">Terpenoids were the predominant organic family for spearmint EO, including linear and cyclic components, oxygenated derived and esters. The two major compounds representing 75% of total oil were (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-carvone (a terpene ketone) and (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-limonene (a cyclic terpene). They are followed in less proportion by a terpene ether 1,8-cineole and a terpene alcohol, menthol, other monoterpenes such as 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene, 1-(
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>) and 1-(
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-pinene, but also by sesquiterpenes such as 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bourbonene and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene. One derived compound of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>-carvone, 
 <italic class="italic">(Z)-</italic>dihydrocarvone was also found at a level &gt;1%. On the basis of the biosynthetic pathway of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species triggered by geographical conditions, they could be divided into carvone rich, menthol rich and pulegone/piperitone rich EOs[

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The second reported major compound in the 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">spicata</italic> EO is usually 1,8-cineole[

 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In this study, the spearmint EO used comes from India and is an EO rich in carvone with limonene as second major compound and not 1,8-cineole. The two major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">spicata</italic> EO were comparable with those reported for two 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Spicata</italic> species originated from India and Asian regions. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] Comparing the composition of the two EOs, the only major compound found in both EOs was a bicyclic sesquiterpene (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene) with a difference of around 8% between the two EOs.
