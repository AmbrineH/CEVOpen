<p class="p">Relying on the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> value, the transfer nature can be defined. The obtained 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> values (
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>) suggested that the transfer of the EO was an anomalous transport phenomenon and was not a Fickian type[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Anomalous transfer mechanism could be due to a relaxation of the matrix[
 <xref rid="pone.0207401.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The similar values of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> found for GC-FID and ATR-FTIR considering the same compounds proved that the characterization of the release phenomena could be obtained by the adapted ATR-FTIR model. However the slight difference of 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> values between the two methods could be explained by the aromatic profile evolution. Indeed, during the release of the clove EO, it was observed by the GC-FID method that the relative proportion of eugenol and eugenol acetate changed with a higher content of the first compared to low the second. This change could be explained by the slow release of eugenol and the fast release of eugenol acetate. However, the two compounds have similar levels of vapor pressure at 25Â°C and the ester is characterized by higher molecular size suggesting more slow release than eugenol. Nevertheless, the initial content of eugenol did not match the initial proportions of the EO referenced by the GC-MS analysis suggesting changes in aromatic profile after encapsulation process. Hence, it is possible that hydrolysis of the ester function of eugenol acetate occurs due to high moisture content and temperature during the encapsulation process. Then, the ester is turning into eugenol. This explains why a higher proportion of eugenol was quantified by the GC-FID method. In contrast, the change of the aromatic profile did not affect the quantification by ATR-FTIR method. Besides, a strong spectral band at 1760 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> region is found the eugenol acetate and clove EO reference spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). This peak could correspond to the ester stretching carbonyl group of eugenol acetate. During the release experiment, the peak at 1760 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was observed in the spectra in agreement with eugenol acetate presence. However, because the intensity of the band was low and eugenol acetate was already taken into account in the specific 1514 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> spectral region, the spectrum zone at 1760 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was not included in the regression analysis. Nevertheless, if specific quantification is required, the method could be rebuilt by adding the corresponding spectral region of eugenol acetate and quantified it separately. Thus, the ATR-FTIR method could additionally be used to monitor profile change due to degradation reactions of the EOs during processing or storage.
