<p class="p">As the amount of clove EO in the organic matrix was well quantified by the ATR-FTIR method, this method was used to follow the release of EO in controlled conditions. The results of clove EO release at controlled relative humidity (72%) and temperature (25°C) are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207401.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. The released fraction was expressed by calculating the clove EO mass at a given time over the initial EO loaded mass and multiplied by 100. In parallel, the release was quantified by GC-FID method taking into account: (i) all the compounds present in the clove EO and (ii) only the three compounds characterized by the same spectral band (1514 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and quantified by the ATR-FTIR method. Averaged spectra for each matrix at given time submitted to the ATR-FTIR method gave values of remaining clove EO well correlated with the GC-FID method, regardless the compounds taken into account. This was expected because the targeted spectral band corresponded to the 86% of the total compounds present in the clove EO. At some points, relatively large variation (12.2–16.7%) could be observed possibly due to the different amounts of sample used in the two methods. Spectroscopic data were composed of five measurements of approximately 13 mg of grinded matrix. In comparison, for GC-FID the whole matrix extraction (approximately 0.3 g) was analyzed.
