<p class="p">The investigation of EO release kinetics from the organic matrix required to preliminary ensures that the spectral fingerprint of the matrix is invariant over time. This all the more important because the quantitative analysis of EOs is performed on specific bands that are measured on standard spectra normalized using a specific band of the matrix. In this way and considering the specific vibration frequency of the material, the normalization was performed on the C-H stretching band of aliphatic methylene group between 2920 and 2851 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The evolution of this band which was considered as an indicator of the material aging was investigated through the spectral subtraction established on the mean spectra acquired on initial material and after three months of storage at room temperature (

The linear response issued from this treatment demonstrated the stability of the signal in this range of frequencies and provided evidence of the use of this band for the normalization procedure of the spectra for the quantitative analysis of EO.
