<p class="p">To our knowledge, there are no previous studies that described the use of an ATR-FTIR method for the global quantification and monitoring the release of EOs trapped in a complex organic matrix. The aim of this study was to develop an ATR-FTIR spectroscopic quantitative methods of two specific EOs (clove and spearmint) encapsulated in the same complex organic matrix. The prediction models of the EOs quantification were developed using a univariate and a multivariate analysis regression. The obtained values were compared with a common GC-FID approach as external validation. The prediction model for the quantification of clove EO was applied in a release experiment where the amount of EO inside a complex matrix was monitored through time to study its robustness.</p>
