<p class="p">EOs exhibit a complex infrared spectral signature due to the high number of compounds including a wide variety of chemical groups. Given the fact that EOs share some same functional groups with biopolymers, the comparison of their spectra with encapsulation matrix could increase interference due to overlapping bands. This makes challenging the developing of a high quality prediction model to encapsulated EO.</p>
