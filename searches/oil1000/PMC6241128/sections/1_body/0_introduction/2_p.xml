<p class="p">Consequently, there is a need to search alternative analytical methods that could include specific characteristics such as time efficiency, robustness, and sensitivity. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy technique is rapid and requires minimal or no sample preparation; it provides a global fingerprint of a sample and can be considered as an alternative way for EOs quantification since signal intensity is proportional to concentration, but still a challenging procedure due to spectra superposition.</p>
