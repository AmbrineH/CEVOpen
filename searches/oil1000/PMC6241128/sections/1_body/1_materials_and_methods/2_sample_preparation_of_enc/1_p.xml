<p class="p">For encapsulation of essential oils, organic matrices used as carriers were formulated with a repeatable process that consisted in three formulation phases: 1) elaboration, 2) shaping and 3) drying. For confidentiality purposes the process cannot be detailed any further. The final matrices contained mainly starch, proteins, and a few amount of lipids. Raw matrices and matrices loaded with EOs were designed and stored at room temperature and controlled relative humidity (32%) until analysis.</p>
