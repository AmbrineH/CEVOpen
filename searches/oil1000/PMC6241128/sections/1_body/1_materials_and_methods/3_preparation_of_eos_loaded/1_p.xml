<p class="p">For the ATR-FTIR standard calibrations, defined amounts of clove EO were carefully deposed inside a raw matrix using a precision micropipette, giving as a result a curve including 9 points corresponding to 0 mg and around 10.2 mg, 32.7 mg, 49.6 mg, 73.8 mg, 91.8 mg, 95.7 mg, 146.0 mg, and 192.7 mg of added EO per gram of matrix. In the same way, five amounts of spearmint EO were deposited inside of uncharged matrices; in this case the amounts of spearmint EO per g of matrix were around 8.7 mg, 50.1 mg, 98.9 mg, 148.6 mg, and 197.5 mg. For the GC-FID external validation, standard curves were elaborated using the same process of deposing EO inside of the raw matrix as described before. The amounts of clove EO added per gram of matrix were around 12.2 mg, 54.1 mg, 120.0 mg, 175.3 mg, and 251.5 mg and 14.2 mg, 49.3 mg, 94.2 mg, 152.9 mg, and 201.2 mg for spearmint EO. For both calibrations, each sample corresponding to one concentration (mg/g) was done in triplicate reporting the exact value of essential oil deposited by g of matrix, meaning that 27 concentrations were used for clove EO and 18 for spearmint EO taking into account the zero value.</p>
