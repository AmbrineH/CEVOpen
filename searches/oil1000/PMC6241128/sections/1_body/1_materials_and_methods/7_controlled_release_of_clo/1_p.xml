<p class="p">The clove EO controlled release experiment was carried out by introducing matrices loaded with a defined amount of clove EO inside a Memmert oven HPP IPP plus (Buchenbach, Germany) at controlled temperature of 25Â°C and relative humidity of 72% during a period of 34 days. At determined interval times, samples were taken out and the remaining quantities of clove EO were analyzed by the ATR-FTIR quantitative method and GC-FID conventional method for comparison purposes.</p>
