<p class="p">Clove and spearmint EOs were characterized by a GC-MS (ISQ ThermoScientific, Austin, Texas, USA) equipped with a DB-WAX polar capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm of thickness) and a quadrupole detector. Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The GC-MS oven temperature was kept at 40°C for 5 min and programed to 260°C at a rate of 2°C/min. One μL of diluted EO (1/100, v/v, in hexane) was injected at constant temperature of 250°C via an injector in split mode with a ratio of 1:20. Spectra were obtained in the electron impact mode with 70 eV of ionization energy, in full scan mode with a scan range between 40–500 amu. Linear retention indices (LRI) were obtained by simultaneous injection of samples and a series of alkanes (C7-C40, Sigma-Aldrich). The identification of components was based on the comparison of the determined LRI and those reported in the literature and mass spectra of libraries (NIST 2.0/Wiley/INRA). The quantification (expressed as a percentage) of each identified compound was done by comparing their peak area to the total area of the identified peaks.</p>
