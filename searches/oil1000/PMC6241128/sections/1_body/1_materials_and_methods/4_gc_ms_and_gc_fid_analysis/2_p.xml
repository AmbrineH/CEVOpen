<p class="p">EOs were extracted from the loaded or encapsulated matrices using hexane as solvent in the presence of 2-heptanol as internal standard (100 μL at 3g/L): ~0.3 g of matrix were stirred at constant rate (500 rpm) in a room temperature environment for 18h. The organic extracts were analyzed and quantified by a Varian 3800 GC (Les Ulis, France) equipped with a DB-WAX polar capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm of thickness) and a flame ionization detector (FID; H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 30 ml/min, Air 300 ml/min, Nitrogen 30 ml/min). Hydrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was kept at 40°C for 5 min and increased to 150°C at 2°C/min rate, then up to 250°C at 10°C/min rate with a detector temperature of 300°C. For quantification of major compounds, calibration curves were carried out by triplicate using 5 concentrations of each aroma compound in the presence of internal standard. The response coefficients were determined and used to achieve a precise quantification of major compounds.
