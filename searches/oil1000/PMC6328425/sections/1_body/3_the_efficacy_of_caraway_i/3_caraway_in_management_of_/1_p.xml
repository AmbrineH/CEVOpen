<p id="Par32" class="p">The most important application of caraway is its use as remedy for digestive problems. In one clinical trial, the efficacy and tolerability of enteric-coated capsule containing caraway oil and menthol was compared to placebo in Functional Dyspepsia patients (Rome III criteria) taking their usual medications (PPIs, H2RAs, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, antihistamines, antidepressants/TCAs, pain modulators, and antiacids). Each capsule was containing 25 mg of caraway oil and 20.75 mg 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-menthol. The patients took two capsules of intervention or placebo, twice daily, 30–60 min before a meal in the morning and at dinner time for 28 days. Changes in Global Overall Symptom and Clinical Global Impressions, safety and tolerability were examined. The results of study showed that the reduction of symptoms was numerically superior in intervention group than that of placebo. 61% and 49% of patients found intervention and placebo treatments “good” or “very good” in improvement of Clinical Global Impressions (p = 0.23). No serious adverse events were reported in intervention group [
