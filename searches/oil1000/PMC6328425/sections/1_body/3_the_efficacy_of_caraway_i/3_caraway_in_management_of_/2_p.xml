<p id="Par33" class="p">In a prospective, double-blind, multicenter trial, 114 outpatients with chronic or recurrent functional dyspepsia, the efficacy of peppermint-caraway-oil preparation (n = 58) or placebo (n = 56) was evaluated on improvement of abdominal pain and discomfort. The patients took capsules, twice daily, in the morning and dinner. 8.6% and 5.4% in intervention and placebo groups left the study, before the end of treatments. A significant improvement in symptoms was observed in intervention group compared to placebo group (p = 0.0004). The average symptom scores reductions were 7.6 ± 4.8 (62.3%) and 3.4 ± 4.3 (26%) in intervention and placebo groups (p &lt; 0.0001). The corresponding at least 10% improvements were 86.2 and 57.1%, respectively.
