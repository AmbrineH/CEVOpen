<p id="Par31" class="p">In randomized, triple blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the efficacy of caraway water on weigh loss of women with BMI 25–39.9 kg/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was evaluated in comparison with placebo. Caraway water was prepared by hydro-distillation of 1 kg caraway fruits and producing 10 L caraway water. Placebo was containing 1% g/L caraway essential oil. The patients in each group are recommended to use 30 mL intervention or placebo, 20 min before lunch for 3 months. The patients were visited every week from the beginning until the end of treatment. The regimen program and any probable side effects were recorded during the study. Clinical assessments on vital parameters along with blood and urine tests and biochemical parameters were evaluated. The mean weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and body fat percent significantly reduced in caraway water compared to placebo group. The body muscle percent increased in caraway water group. Vital clinical symptoms including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, urine specific gravity and lipid profile had no significant difference with placebo group [

Caraway extract had no significant effect on fat and protein intake of the overweight subject, compared to control group. All of the anthropometric indices (waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, thigh circumference, and mid-upper arm circumference) exhibited a significant reduction in caraway oil, compared with placebo group. The average appetite level significantly reduced in caraway extract group [
