<p id="Par44" class="p">In a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study, the safety of caraway aqueous extract was evaluated on 35 overweight and obese healthy women compared with placebo. The patients received 30 mL of caraway water or placebo (diluted caraway essential oil) for 12 weeks, and the general health status, urine test, blood pressure, heart rate and blood chemistry were evaluated. No adverse events were reported after 12 weeks of treatment. Heart rate, liver, kidney functions were not affected from interventions. A significant difference in red blood cell and platelet distribution width levels were observed among two groups. A significant increase in red blood cell and significant reduction in platelet distribution width were observed in caraway water, which imply that the possible beneficial effect of caraway seed aqueous extract for the treatment of anemia. Hyperthyroidism is associated with an reduction of platelet distribution width [
