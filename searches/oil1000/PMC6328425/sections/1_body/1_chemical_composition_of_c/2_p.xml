<p id="Par4" class="p">Fatty acids such as petroselinic, linoleic and oleic acids contain 10–18% of caraway fruits. A comparative study on fatty acid contents of caraway fruits among Tunisian, German and Egyptian ecotypes exhibited that the Tunisian chemotype had the higher total fatty acid composition (7.3%), followed by German (5.7%) and Egyptian (2.9%) ecotypes. Petroselinic acid was the major fatty acid in three ecotypes with percent of 31.1%, 30.9% and 29.5% in Tunisian, German and Egyptian caraway fruits. The corresponding linoleic acid contents were 28.7%, 30.0% and 29.2% in these oils. Oleic acid was present about 27.5%, 21.6%, 21.2% in Tunisian, German and Egyptian caraway fruit fixed oil. Myristic acid, palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids were present at low levels in fatty oils. The unsaturated fatty acids were higher in Tunisian ecotype (87.8%), followed by German (82.9%) and Egyptian (80.8%) samples. Saturated fatty acids (12.1–19.2%), monounsaturated (50.5–56.2%), polyunsaturated (30.2–31.6%) acids were the chemical profile of fatty acids [

Saturated (myristic, palmitic and stearic acids), monounsaturated (petroselinic acid), polyunsaturated (linoleic acid) fatty acids were present in three ecotypes [

 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-fenchone (55.0%), p-methoxy benzaldehyde (19.2%) and p-methoxy allyl benzene (9.4%) were identified in caraway fixed oil (yield 4.5%), which is extracted by soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether [
