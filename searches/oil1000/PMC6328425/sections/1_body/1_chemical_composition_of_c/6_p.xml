<p id="Par8" class="p">Limonene (48.1%), carvone (32.9%), and myrcene (7.9%) were the main components of caraway fruit essential oil, extracted by hydro-distillation assisted by microwave, while limonene (41.7%), carvone (55.8%), and myrcene were present in accelerated steam distillation assisted by microwave method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Hydro-distillation by direct induction heating assisted by magnetic field (DIHMF) and by water and 6% food salt as electrolyte solutions resulted in 2.11% (w/w) essential oil, where limonene (7.4%) and carvone (85.2%) were its main components. The essential oil yield for hydro-distillation in presence of 6% food salt were 2.58%, with limonene (18.7%), and carvone (74.9%) as the main components [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Therefore, the isolation of essential oil by DIHMF is as efficient as hydro-distillation method, because of shorter time and higher quality of limonene and carvone. Carvone (57.7%) and limonene (35.5%) were two major components from ten identified compounds from Iranian caraway essential oil by using ultrasonic assisted with headspace solid phase micro-extraction (UA-HS-SPME) method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. The yields of essential oils obtained by hydro-distillation and microwave-assisted hydro distillation methods from Chinese caraway fruits were 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Limonene (43.5%), carvone (32.6%), and apiole (15.1%) were the main components of caraway fruits essential oil extracted by hydro distillation method, while limonene (48.4%), carvone (31.1%) and apiole (12.3%) were the main components of oil extracted by microwave-assisted hydro-distillation method [
