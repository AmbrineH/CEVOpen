<p id="Par11" class="p">A comparative study on essential oil yields and their chemical compositions of different ecotypes exhibited that the yields for essential oil extractions were 1.41%, 1.21% and 0.48% for Tunisian and German and Egyptian ecotypes. Carvone (61.6–77.4%) and limonene (16.2–29.1%) were the main components of caraway oils. Carvone (77.3%), and limonene (16.2%) were the main components of German caraway essential oil, while the corresponding values were 76.3% and 19.5% for Tunisian chemotype. Carvone (61.6%), limonene (29.1%), β-myrcene (3.9%) and α-selinene (10.9%) were the main components of Egyptian chemotype [
