<p id="Par6" class="p">Many different factors have essential effects on yield and chemical compositions of caraway essential oil. Harsh conditions (heat and pH) have little effect on carvone and limonene content of essential oil, while the changes in minor components are very major [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Harvest time before maturation lead to lower essential oil content than that of full ripeness of caraway fruits. Also, the amount of carvone enhances during and after maturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. The higher limonene to carvone ratio is proposed to be responsible for better quality of caraway. Increasing the storage time decreases the essential oilâ€™s content and limonene to carvone ratio [
