<p id="Par7" class="p">The limonene and carvone content increase under water deficit. The yield of fruit essential oil increases under water deficit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Drying the seeds and reduction in fruit grinded powder size increase the essential oil yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Method of essential oil extraction, grinding methods, harvest time change the essential oil yields and their chemical composition. Extraction of oil from whole seed results in high content of carvone, while grinded fruits and their full ripeness result in high essential oil yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. The use of ultrasound method for extraction of caraway oil results in higher content of carvone than limonene. Carvone and limonene yields were 1.3–2 times higher in ultrasound assisted extraction method, depending on temperature, than hydro-distillation method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The reason is destructive mechanical effects of ultrasound method on fruits cell walls, which increases the leakage of cell content, while in hydro-distillation method, the plant extracts diffuses across glandular walls and causes cell rupture over a long time. Ultrasound treatment of caraway fruit result in release of essential oil after 30 min of extraction with the same yield for untreated fruit (1.72% vs. 1.68%) [
