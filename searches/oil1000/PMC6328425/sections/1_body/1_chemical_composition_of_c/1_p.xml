<p id="Par3" class="p">Caraway fruits contain essential oil (3–7%), fatty acids (10–18%) (petroselinic, linoleic and oleic acids), protein (20%), carbohydrate (15%) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Caraway oil is present in all parts of plant, but its concentration is highest in its fruits and is extracted by hydro-distillation method. Caraway chaff oil is produced by hydro-distillation of husks and stalks and contains less carvone and more terpenes. Caraway oleoresin is prepared from crushed dried caraway fruits by solvents (hexane ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethylene dichloride), which has greenish shade of yellow color, normally contain essential oil (20–25%), and fixed oil (60–75%). Environmental conditions have essential effects on seed quality, in other word, hot and dry weather is associated with significant low quality fruits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Changes in quality of fruits mean the variation in main and major components of plant.
