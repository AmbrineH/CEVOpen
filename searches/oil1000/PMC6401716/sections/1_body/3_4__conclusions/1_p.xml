<p class="p">The tensile test of biofilm demonstrated good enhancement upon the incorporation of 5% CEO. The biofilm achieved tensile strength at 4.8 MPa and elongation of 15%. Based on the SEM morphology, higher amounts of CEO in the presence of acidic acid leads to a reduction in the degradation rate of the biofilm. The biofilm demonstrated a continuous phase and exhibited a characteristic band at 1716 cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> in the FTIR analysis. Hence, in conclusion, 5% CEO and 3% acetic acid are the suitable blend that could tremendously affect the tensile behavior and the biodegradation rate of the biofilm.
