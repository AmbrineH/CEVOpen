<p class="p">The compostability of the biofilms and CEO additions were performed according to soil bury test ISO/DIS 17088. The biofilm dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm were cut and weighed and five replicates were made for each formulation. The bury test area was plotted at a cool and shaded corner of the garden. The soil temperature was based on the normal climate change, which is from 33 to 35 °C, while soil type was black garden soil. Each sample was buried in a convenient depth of 50 mm to allow for aerobic soil bury composting, as the compost has to be turned at regular intervals in this process. The area was plotted with granite or brick to prevent interruption or error during the investigation. Each time the specimen was retrieved from the ground, the plotted area was covered with layers of dried leaves or thin layers of soil to allow air to permeate the hole and accelerate the growth and expansion of fungi or bacteria.</p>
