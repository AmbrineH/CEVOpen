<p class="p">The surface morphology of the films was studied using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) JSM 5600 (Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia) with magnifications up to 1000Ã—. Prior to carrying out the observation, the samples were subjected to sputter coating with a layer of carbon using a Polaron SC515 (Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia). This procedure was performed to ensure the sample morphology could be clearly observed under SEM and to prevent any electrostatic charging during observation.</p>
