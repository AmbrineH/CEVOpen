<p class="p">Raw algae and cinnamon were purchased from a local store, located in Gombak, Malaysia, while glycerol and acetic acid were then purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Selangor, Malaysia). For the preparation of raw materials of the biofilm, algae were processed though cleaning, drying, and shredding into powder form (ranging from 50 µ–100 µ). The cinnamon oil was collected using the microwave essential oil extraction method. Temperature was set at 60 °C for 6 min as the cinnamon started to steam up and condensation took place for the production of the extraction oil. Next, we let the extraction oil cool down for another 20 min before collecting it. Using a separator, we collected the oil and applied low heat (33–35 °C) to separate the oil and water. After 20 min of heating process, the oil particle moved on top of the water surface. The oil was collected using the pipet and placed in the vial. </p>
