<p class="p">The Instron tensile test ASTM D882-02 machine (Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia) was used for this test. The load of the machine was set at 5 kN with the speed at 10 mm/min. Seven replicates of strips for each composition were cut at dimensions of 70 mm Ã— 10 mm. The result of the tensile strength and elongation at break were assessed through the graph of the stress-strain curve. </p>
