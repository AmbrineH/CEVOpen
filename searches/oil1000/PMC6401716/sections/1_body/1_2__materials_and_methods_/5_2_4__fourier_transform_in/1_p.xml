<p class="p">An FTIR Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer System spectrum 100; PerkinElmer, Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia) is an analytical technique used to identify organic, polymeric, and, in some cases, inorganic materials. The FTIR analysis method uses infrared light to scan test samples and observe chemical properties. The resolution was set up at 4cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in a spectral range of 4000 to 600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 32 scans per sample. Different peaks (various functional groups of chemical elements) of the IR spectrum were observed along the selected initial angle to the final angle.
