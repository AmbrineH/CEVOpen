<p class="p">The algae biofilm was prepared using the solution casting method. The ingredients to prepare biofilm with CEO is as follows: 2% algae powder, three different percentages of CEO at 1%, 3%, and 5%; 1.5 mL glycerol solution; 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9% acetic acid with 0.2% molarity and distilled water were weighed individually using an electronic mass balance. Acetic acid was obtained in liquid form. It was diluted to 0.2% (

The algae, glycerol, acetic acid, and distilled water were mixed in a beaker, which was then heated up to 90 °C on a hot plate and held at that temperature for 25 min. The stirring speed of the magnetic stirrer was set at a constant speed of 250 rpm, to avoid the formation of bubbles and maintain the homogeneity of the solution. Then, the mixed solution was cooled down to 65 °C for 35 min. During cooling, stirring was continued to prevent the formation of bubbles and solidification of the solution. The second batch of the biofilm was repeated with the addition of the CEO. Pure biofilms (0% CEO) were set up as a control sample. The solution was cast into a square form (18 × 27 cm) of the acrylic plate. Upon casting, the drying process took place in an oven at a temperature of 50 °C for 24 h. The biofilm thickness was measured using an electronic gauge (Digitronic Caliper, Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia), with accuracy ranging between 0.1% and 1% as a function of thickness value (0–100 µm or 0–1000 µm). Seven replicates were made for each type of biofilm formulation.
