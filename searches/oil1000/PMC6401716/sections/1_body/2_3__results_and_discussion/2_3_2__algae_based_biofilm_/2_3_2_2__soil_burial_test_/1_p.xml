<p class="p">The algae used in this research to form a biofilm is a green algae species known as Neochloris Oleoabundans or Ettlia Oleoabundans [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. These unicellular green algae are freshwater based and rich in starch content [

 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Starch is hydrophilic in nature and easy to degrade due to microbial and moisture contact. The degradation of algae-based bioplastic film via starch by micro-organisms in the soil produced carbon dioxide, biomass formed by extraction of algae carbon, and soluble CEO compound. From the soil bury test analysis, gradual biodegradation was observed in the biofilm surface degradation as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates the physical appearance of the algae biofilm after soil burial test for 28 weeks. The samples for soil bury test were exposed to the actual weather. Under rainy conditions, excess water permeated through the soil and diffused into the biofilm samples causing swelling and softening of the biofilm. Based on the physical observation, the biofilm started to deteriorate after 14 weeks and onwards, most likely due to hydrophilic nature of the algae. At the end of the 28 week period, the sample could barely retain the shape and began to wrinkle and tear apart. From the pictures, the sample showed high number of pores, and the number of pores continues to spread and increase in size as the length of soil bury test was prolonged. This confirmed that the biofilm sample had undergone biodegradation phases.
