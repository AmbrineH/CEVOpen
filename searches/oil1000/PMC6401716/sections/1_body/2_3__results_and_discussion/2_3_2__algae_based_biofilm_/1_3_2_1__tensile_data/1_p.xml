<p class="p">(A) Tensile strength, (B) modulus elasticity and (C) elongation at break of algae-based biofilms were affected by the different percentages of acetic acid, as demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The first attempt to produce algae-based biofilm failed because the sample was too fragile, as the algae is rich with starch content and becomes hydrophilic in nature. The glycerol was chosen to alter the delicateness of the biofilm. Once again, the biofilm produced was low in strength, as the particles of glycerol may have leaked during processing and the biofilm produced was found to tear easily. Next, the flexibility of the biofilm was improved with the help of the acetic acid content, to aid the glycerol to be fully efficient in the algae-based biofilm. Acetic acid is a weak acid that has one carboxylic acid group and is usually use in food additive [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Although there has been no specific research on the usage of acetic acid as crosslinking agents, it has reported that the presence of acetic acid increased the interfacial interaction in the properties of coconut shells filled with low a polyethylene composite [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Researchers [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] also indicated that the combination of acetic acid with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> packaging can extend the shelf life from 12 to 20 days for chicken retail cuts without negatively affecting the quality and sensory properties of the broiler meat. The addition of acetic acid into the blend may help the infusion of glycerol into the algae molecular structure by accelerating the disintegration and suspension of algae sediment. Previous researchers also stated similar strength results in a PVA and chitosan blend with glycerol and acetic acid [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, from the analysis done, the addition of 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% acetic acid in the biofilm decreases the (A) tensile strength to half compared to the control biofilm, probably due to the different molecular structures of the acetic acid, even though it comes from the same carboxylic acid family [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> also illustrated a reduction in (B) modulus of algae-based biofilms, similar to the tensile strength, with an increase in the concentration of acetic acid. Based on the figure, the lowest elastic property was recorded for 7% acetic acid, further than this percentage will continuously drop the modulus strength of the biofilm. This finding was similar to previous attempts using glycerol to increase the percentage of citric acid by up to 15% [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. On the other hand, the (C) elongation at break (Eb) results were vice versa to the tensile and modulus strength results. Based on the Eb graph, it was found that the biofilms were capable of resisting changes in shape without crack formation with the addition of the acetic acid. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> demonstrated that the (C) elongation at break gradually increased with the increasing percentage of acetic acid by up to 7%. The highest elongation at break was measured with 5% acetic acid at 27.34% of Eb, while the lowest Eb was shown by 0% acetic acid at 20.14%. Physically, the biofilm with the addition of acetic acid was better in flexibility, less fragile, and good in modulus. The biofilm obtained was transparent and could not easily tear off when folded. However, the addition of acetic acid neither improves the tensile strength nor the elongation at break of the biofilm.
