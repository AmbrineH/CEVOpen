<p class="p">In a polymer film packaging application, thickness is a crucial aspect, which requires specific attention from the material design. The thickness of the biofilm will highly influence other important properties, such as the strength, elasticity, and moisture content. Researchers [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] found that the main purpose of effective biofilm for food packaging is to secure the food from food pathogens, thus extending the shelf-life of the food, and will ensure the quality of the food and its nutrients to be intact. The general thickness of biofilms for packaging is Â±0.3 mm [
