<p class="p">The second batch formulation was focused on biofilm with the addition of several percentages of CEO. Based on this observation, it could be highlighted the importance of using CEO compared to the cinnamon powder. By using CEO, it was easier to control the thickness of the biofilm, as the resulting film thickness was not significantly different compared to the thickness of the control biofilm (0%, as depicted in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00004-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This is because the CEO used in the solution form mixed well within the blends. In comparison, using the cinnamon powder, the course cinnamon particle will not dissolve in the biofilm solution during processing, hence affecting the thickness of the bioplastic. In industry, this parameter is important for food packaging. This trend was similar to the previous study [
