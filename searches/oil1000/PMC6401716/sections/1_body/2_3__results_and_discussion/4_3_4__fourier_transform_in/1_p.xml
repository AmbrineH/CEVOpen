 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>A illustrated the FTIR spectra of biofilm with 5% CEO content and B biofilm with 3% of acetic acid, respectively, both displaying individual peaks within the range of 4000–500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Peak A presented a broad absorption band at about 3310 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which represents the hydroxyl (OH) group. The peak at 2924 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was recognized due to the C–H stretching of methane. Besides this, the peak at 1606 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was formed due to the stretching vibration of the conjugated peptide bond formation by amine (NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and acetone groups in the algae. The peak at 1441 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was due to an ester sulfate group. The characteristic peaks at 1013 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 931 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicated C–O stretching groups of 3,6-anhydrogalactose [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition, based on the FT-IR spectrum of CEO in A, the absorption band or frequency ranged from 3500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 3200 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> broad, exhibiting the presence of O–H stretch. The specific absorbance band at 1635 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> revealed the stretching vibration of the C=O bond for cinnamaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Due to the influence of conjugation and an aromatic ring, the peak is wider than usual for aldehyde compounds. A strong absorption band between 900 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 690 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicated the presence of aromatic C=C bonds [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde is the main active component in cinnamon, which can be used as a natural antimicrobial in food preservation to retard or inhibit the bacterial growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, which in turn extends the shelf life of the food products [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>B, which shows that there was no crosslinking between acetic acid and the algae-based blends due to the absence of chemical reaction. The sighting of a peak at wavenumber ranges between 1700–1720 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicates the presence of cellulose-fatty acids ν(C=O), a stretching vibration of the esters. The slope was transmitted obviously in (A), however, slowly lowering down with the addition of acetic acid as showed in sample (B). The combination of CEO and acetic acid was significantly reduced the cellulose fatty acid presence in the algae as shown in sample (C) which is possibly occurs due to the formation of a physical reaction between CEO, acetic acid and algae [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>C represents the FT-IR spectrum of 3% acetic acid blends with 5% CEO biofilms. A peak at 1716 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was observed, indicating an association with C=O, which is attributed to the carboxyl and ester carbonyl bands. This confirmed the existence of acetic acid in the specimen. However, the peak at 3328 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> became less intense when cinnamon was added into the formulation.
