 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Changes in the appearance of the biofilms are explainable through the high-moisture absorption property and low intensity of cinnamaldehyde in the CEO percentages [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Based on the physical appearance of the biofilm in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the sample in this research would have behaved similarly to the findings by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], where the alginate films incorporated with cinnamon bark oil showed less biodegradation potential compared to the alginate film without cinnamon bark oil. Therefore, it can be postulated that the addition of 3% acetic acid into the recipe assists in reducing the decomposition rate of the biofilm with CEO, compared to the sample of 5% CEO without acetic acid content. From the SEM analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the agglomeration of biofilm became more obvious as the biofilm began to swell, which in turn caused slow degradation. The addition of 5% of CEO into the biofilm exhibited physical changes. Besides which, different volumes of CEO used in this study resulted in varying biodegradation rates and behaviors. The antimicrobial (cinnamaldehyde functional group) and repellent properties of cinnamon may also decelerate the degradation rate of the film. These findings are in accordance with the previous research [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], where the higher the cinnamon percentage, the slower the composability rate. The film with 5% CEO demonstrated lesser pore percentages. A higher amount of CEO tends to reduce the degradation rate because of the hydrophobicity of the acetic acid, and the strong aroma of the cinnamon itself may repel insects and micro-organisms from attacking the biofilm [
