<p class="p">Algae-based biofilm with 3% acetic acid was found to yield good (A) tensile strength and (B) modulus properties, and, therefore, was selected to be used with CEO. This percentage was selected to be used for further investigation alongside the addition of different ranges of CEO (phase two). The percentages of CEO tested were 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9%. The control sample is label as 0 in the tabulated figures. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates the (A) tensile strength of algae film, which increases with increasing percentages of CEO. The control sample without acetic acid possessed the least tensile strength. Meanwhile, the maximum tensile strength was achieved with 5% CEO due to the good intermolecular interaction between algae and starch and cinnamon molecules. This finding was also supported by a previous study [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the (B) modulus elasticity of the algae-based biofilm was found to display the same trend as the tensile strength results. The addition of 5% CEO was found to increase the stiffness of the algae-based biofilm up to 0.323 GPa, compared to algae-based biofilm with 1%, 3%, 7%, and 9% of CEO, which recorded lower modulus strength. However, in this study, the 5% CEO loading did affect the (C) elongation at break compared to the other percentages. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00004-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> indicated that the 5% CEO loading has low elongation at break compared to the 3% and 7% of CEO loading. Based on the current findings, 5% CEO with 3% acetic acid yielded a good and accepted elongation at break of the algae-based biofilm. This was made possible with the right amount of acetic acid in strengthening and adhering to the intermolecular bonds between the algae and cinnamon molecules. Hence, the addition of acetic acid into algae-based biofilm clearly indicated that the acetic acid molecules affect the adjacent molecules by increasing the distance and reducing the internal force, resulting in a more flexible film. The interference with adjacent molecules affects the intermolecular and intramolecular linkage of the polymer, thus strengthening the structure of the algae-based biofilm [
