<p class="p">The cell membrane of 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic>, apart from other functions, is responsible for stress sensing and adaptive functions. The main mycobacterial envelope and stress signaling system is based on the proteins set composed of MprAB complex cooperating with the accessory sigma factor E (σ
 <sup class="sup">E</sup>). Stress dependent MprAB protein misfolding on the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane conduct stress signal by σ
 <sup class="sup">E</sup> to the envelope-preserving ClgR-PspA-Rv2743c-Rv2742c system. The transcription factor encoded by clgR gene regulates downstream genes responsible for the cell membrane integrity protection and energy generation under stress. Except that, the ClgR controlled genes complex is necessary for MprAB-σE stress-signalling activity. This positive feedback between preserving and envelope-stress-sensing functions helps to respond to a number of cell membrane-perturbing signals during tuberculosis pathogenesis. The clgR-pspA-rv2743c-rv2742c genes set is conserved only within the
