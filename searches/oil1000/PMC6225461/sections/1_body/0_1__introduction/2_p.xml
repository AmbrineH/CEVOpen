<p class="p">The chemical diversity of natural sources such as essential oils (EO) is one of the areas of search for new promising mycobactericidal substances. Cinnamon essential oil has exhibited antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, bactericidal, antiparasitics, and larvicidal activities [

For antimycobacterial agents searching, the whole-cell screening approach has yielded significant success because it allows screening of all targets at once. The target-based compounds often do not inhibit bacterial growth because of efflux effect or poor penetration. The most challenging of whole-cell screening, however, is an identification of the target and/or action mode of the tested compound [
