<p class="p">Antibiotics used in MIC evaluation belong to the most important and effective medicines we have in the fight against mycobacteria. Because of this most of them have low or very low MIC values against fragile 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosiss</italic> trains like the H37Ra strain. Antimycobacterial activity of cinnamon EO and cinnamaldehyde was found to be one serial dilution higher than MIC for ethambutol. The same MIC for both substances and high MIC values for the next two most abundant compouds: eugenol and linalool indicate that the main constituent of cinnamon essential oil is responsible for anti-TB properties. Other authors have reported the following MIC values for cinnamaldehyde: 3.12 µg/mL (
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv), 12.5 µg/mL (
 <italic class="italic">M. bovis</italic> AN5), 24 µg/mL (
