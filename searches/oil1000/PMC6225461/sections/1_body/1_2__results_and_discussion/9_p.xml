 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomumverum</italic> bark essential oil has high inhibitoryand the killing potential for 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra. High SI index for this compound confirms its biomedical potential as the antimycobacterial agent. The 
 <italic class="italic">clgR</italic> gene expression profile proves that cinnamaldehyde threatens the membrane integrity and activates stress response system. The antibiotics used in the experiment were extremely different in their mode of action but neither synergism nor antagonism was detected between tested natural agents and primary anti-TB drugs. Although cinnamaldehyde probably changes cell membrane stability/permeability it did not facilitate the action even of intracellular antibiotics like streptomycin or rifampicin. Because of its antimycobacterial properties cinnamaldehyde can be used as a starting point for the new drugs design [
