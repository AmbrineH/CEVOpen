<p class="p">To evaluate the possible cytotoxicity of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamon EO safety index (SI) was determined. Within these studies, it was demonstrated that tested natural agents only slightly reduced the viability of eukaryotic epithelial cells (GMK, also known as Vero line) after 24 h exposure. It was found that cinnamon EO and cinnamaldehyde exerted low cytotoxic effect against GMK cells and revealed significant antimycobacterial activity. Cinnamaldehyde showed significantly less cytotoxic effect than cinnamon EO and thus was characterized by higher SI value. Since promising antibacterial agents should have SI &gt; 10, it may be inferred that cinnamaldehyde has a high biomedical potential to be used as the antimycobacterial agent (
