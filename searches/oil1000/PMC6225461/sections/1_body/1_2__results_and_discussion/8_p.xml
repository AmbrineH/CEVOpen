<p class="p">The clgR gene expression was used as the marker of stress sensing/envelope preserving system status. 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> exposed to the cell membrane stress agent activates two positive-feedback loops: MprAB-σE and σE-ClgR. The clgR gene encodes transcriptional factor integrating MprAB stress sensing with the envelope preserving ClgR-PspA-Rv2743c-Rv2742c system through the sigma factor σE [
