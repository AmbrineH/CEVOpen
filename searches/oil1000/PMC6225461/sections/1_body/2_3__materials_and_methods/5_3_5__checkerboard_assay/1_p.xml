<p class="p">Synergistic interactions between 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> EO/cinnamaldehyde and antibiotics: ethambutol (EMB), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), rifampicin (RMP), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were examined by the checkerboard test based on resazurin assay similarly as MIC determination. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC
 <sub class="sub">I</sub>) was calculated for each combination of two agents concentrations according to the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">FIC
  <sub class="sub">I</sub> = (MIC
  <sub class="sub">A/B</sub>/MIC
  <sub class="sub">A</sub>) + (MIC
  <sub class="sub">B/A</sub>/MIC
  <sub class="sub">B</sub>)
 </disp-formula> where MIC
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> = MIC of the compound A alone, MIC
 <sub class="sub">A/B</sub> is the MIC of compound A in combination with compound B and MIC
 <sub class="sub">B</sub>, MIC
 <sub class="sub">B/A</sub> is defined analogously as compound A.
