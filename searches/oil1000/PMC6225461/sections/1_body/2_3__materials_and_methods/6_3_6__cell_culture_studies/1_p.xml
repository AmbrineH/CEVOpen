<p class="p">An experiment was carried out using African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (GMK) obtained from BIOMED-Lublin S.A. (Lublin, Poland). To assess the cytotoxicity of the tested agents, the GMK cells were seeded in 96-multiwell plates at a concentration of 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well (in 100 μL of the complete culture medium) and the plates were maintained at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was discarded and replaced with 100 µL of culture medium containing different concentrations of cinnamon EO, cinnamaldehyde, and a reference antimycobacterial drug-rifampicin. The compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations (in the range 500–1.95 µg/mL). After 24 h exposure to the tested compounds and reference drug, viability of GMK cells was assessed using MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich) as described earlier [
