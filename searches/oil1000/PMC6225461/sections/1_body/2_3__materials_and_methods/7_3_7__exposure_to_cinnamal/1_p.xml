<p class="p">Freshly prepared 50 mL of 7H9-S were inoculated with 1 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra of 1 McFarland standard. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C with gentle aeration (100 RPM) for three weeks. Then, 8 mL of culture were moved to a fresh tube and exposed for 1 h to 512 µg/mL cinnamaldehyde (value determined by resazurin assay for the short 1-h exposure for late log-phase of mycobacterial culture). Culture without tested compound supplementation (8 mL) was used as expression level control. As the positive control, additional 8 mL of culture supplemented with SDS (final concentration 0.03% (300 µg/mL)) were added and samples were incubated for 1 h accordingly to the elegant experiment described by Datta at all.
