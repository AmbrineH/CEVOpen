 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomumverum</italic> bark essential oil was obtained from Unimark Remedies Ltd. (Mumbai, India). GC-MS was performed with a GC-2010 Plus gas chromatography instrument (Shimadzu Kioto, Japan) coupled to a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass spectrometer. Compounds were separated on a fused silica capillary column ZB-5 MS (30 m, 0.25 mmi.d.) with a film thickness of 0.25 Î¼m (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Compounds were identified using a computer-supported spectral library [
