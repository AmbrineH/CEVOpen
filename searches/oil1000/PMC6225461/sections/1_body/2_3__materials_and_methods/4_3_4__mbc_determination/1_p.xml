 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02381" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] considering longer time of 
 <italic class="italic">mycobacterium</italic> incubation. After 8 days of incubation (inoculum and plates were prepared analogically to MIC assay), mycobacterium cultures were spread on agar plates (Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 10% OADC-oleic albumin dextrose catalase and 0.5% glycerol) and incubated for 4 weeks at 37 Â°C. MBC was defined as a compound concentration with at least a 3 log reduction of CFU compared to the initial CFU.
