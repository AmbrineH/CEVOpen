<p class="p">The round bottom microwell plates were prepared as follows: 50 μL of inoculum and 50 μL of tested substances were added to each well. The sterility, growth and 1% DMSO controls were included. The plates were closed with sealing foil to prevent liquid evaporation and incubated for 8 days at 37 °C. After incubation, 10 µL of resazurin (AlamarBlue, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) solution were added to each well, incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and assessed for color development. The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that prevented blue to pink color change [
