<p class="p">The aim of this study is to develop an oral Res SMEDDS with excellent performance. The solubility test and pseudoternary phase diagram were used to select the composition of the SMEDDS. The water solubility, stability, release performance and antioxidant activity of the Res SMEDDS were assessed. Additionally, the particle size and morphology of the Res SMEDDS were investigated by laser particle size analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>
