<p class="p">There are many studies on the use of SMEDDS as carrier of poorly soluble drugs. Compared with the total flavones of 
 <italic class="italic">HippophaÃ« rhamnoides</italic> L. (TFH), the TFH SMEDDS significantly enhances the solubility of the TFH up to 530 times in water, and its relative bioavailability is dramatically improved 3.09 times[
