<p class="p">The change of the percentage of emulsifier (Cremophor RH40) and co-emulsifier (PEG400) will affect the efficiency of self-emulsification. With the increase of the percentage of co-emulsifier (PEG400), the emulsification time was significantly reduced

However, when the content of PEG400 increased from 20 to 35%, the droplet size increased from 27.69 nm to 812 nm. Excessive amount of co-emulsifier will cause the system to become unstable due to its high hydrophilicity, moreover, the droplet size will increase due to the expansion of the interfacial film[
