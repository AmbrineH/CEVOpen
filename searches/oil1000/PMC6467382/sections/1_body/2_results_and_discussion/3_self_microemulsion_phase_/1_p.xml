<p class="p">Self-microemulsification efficiency refers to the capacity of the SMEDDS to spontaneously form or disperse into a homogeneous microemulsion when the SMEDDS were added to water under mild agitation. The self-emulsifying equilibrium time and droplet size were used to assess self-microemulsification efficiency [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214544.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, the highest content of oil phase in the SMEEDS is up to 40%, but the content of oil can not be too close to the critical point of the SMEEDS, because the change of the external environment may cause the SMEEDS critical point to shrink, which may lead to instability of the SMEEDS. In addition, when the content of oil was more than 15%, the emulsifying equilibrium time exceeded 2 min, which indicated that the self-emulsifying efficiency had decreased (
