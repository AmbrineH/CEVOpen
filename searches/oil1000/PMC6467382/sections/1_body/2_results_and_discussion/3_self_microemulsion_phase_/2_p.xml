<p class="p">The ratio of emulsifier to co-emulsifier was very effective for a stable and efficient SMEDDS formation. There was no significant difference for the solubility of Res in PEG400 and Cremophor RH40

Therefore, the change of the content of emulsifier and co-emulsifier had no obvious effect on the drug loading of Res SMEDDS under the condition of fixed oil phase content, and the drug loading was approximately 9% (w/w). In order to prevent the precipitation of drugs in the storage process, the drug loading of Res SMEDDS was 5% (w/w) according to previous studies[
