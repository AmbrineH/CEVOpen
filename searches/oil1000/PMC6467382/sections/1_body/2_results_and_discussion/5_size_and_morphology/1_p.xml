<p class="p">Droplet size is one of the most important parameters of microemulsion diluted from SMEDDS that affects the release rate of drug and drug stability. Smaller droplets have a greater interfacial area that significantly enhances the release rate of drug. After the Res SMEDDS was diluted 100 times with deionized water, the droplet size, zeta potential and TEM image were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214544.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>. Compared with the particle size of the blank nano-emulsion of 26.23±1.56nm, the particle size of the Res microemulsion was 28.00±1.67 nm, there was no significant difference (

The PDI of the blank nano-emulsion and the Res nano-emulsion were 0.169 and 0.213, respectively, which indicated that Res SMEDDS exhibited good dispersion properties. The zeta potentials of the blank microemulsion and Res microemulsion were -2.18 mv and -3.25mv, and higher than that reported by Chen Y[
