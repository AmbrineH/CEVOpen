<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that the droplet size of the Res microemulsion is generally in the range of 50–200 nm[

 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], while the Res microemulsion prepared in this work had a smaller droplet size with an average droplet size of 28.00±1.67 nm, which was smaller that those that have been reported by Chen Y [
 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The smaller the particle size of the microemulsion is, the easier it is to be absorbed [
 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], therefore, Res SMEDDS prepared in this work may be exhibit better bioavailability. In addition, the TEM image revealed that the morphology of the Res emulsion was a regular circle with good dispersibility, which is consistent with the results of Chen Y[
 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Statistical analysis of the droplet size of the droplets in the TEM image with the NanoMeasure software also revealed that the average droplet size of the Res SMEDDS was about 28.81 nm, which was consistent with the droplet size measurement results.
