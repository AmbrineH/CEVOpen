<p class="p">The release profiles of Res powder drug and Res SMEDDS at different pH values were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214544.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. The release percentage of Res from Res SMEDDS was more than 80% within 10 minutes, whereas the highest release percentage of Res powder drug was less than 55% within 60 minutes at the three different pH values. Statistically significant differences were observed between the two formulations at the same pH
