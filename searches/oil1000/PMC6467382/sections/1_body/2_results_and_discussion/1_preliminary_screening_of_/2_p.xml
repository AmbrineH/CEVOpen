 <xref rid="pone.0214544.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Accordingly, IPM was selected as the oil phase. Compared with Tween 20 and Tween 60, Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH40 have a stronger emulsifying capacity due to their larger number of ethylene oxide (EO), thus they are more compatible with the three oil phases[
 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Besides, Res has high solubility in Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH40, therefore, Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH40 were chosen as the alternative emulsifiers for subsequent comparisons. Among the co-emulsifiers, Res has relatively high solubility in anhydrous ethanol, PEG400 and propylene glycol, therefore, they were selected as preliminary co-emulsifiers.
