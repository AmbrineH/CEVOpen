<p class="p">The MTT assay showed that the RGR of the cells decreased with the increase of drug concentration. When the drug concentration exceeded 20μM, compared with Res powder, the RGR of Res SMEDDS was smaller and statistically significant

However, according to the RGR classification of ISO 10993-5-2009 standard, the cytotoxicity of each concentration group of Res SMEDDS belongs to "1" grade(
