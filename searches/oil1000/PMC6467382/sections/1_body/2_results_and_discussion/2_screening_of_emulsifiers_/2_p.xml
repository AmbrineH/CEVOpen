<p class="p">Although both Cremophor RH40 (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) = 14–16) and Cremophor EL (HLB = 12–14) could form O/W microemulsions with the same co-emulsifier (PEG400), there was quite a difference in their emulsification ability. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214544.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A and 2D</xref>, the O/W microemulsion region with Cremophor RH40 (HLB = 14–16) is larger than that with Cremophor EL (HLB = 12–14), because the larger the HLB value of the emulsifier is, the stronger the emulsifying capacity is. Moreover, the toxicity of Cremophor RH40 is smaller[
 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, Cremophor RH40 was selected as the emulsifier. Based on the above data, the oil phase, emulsifier and co-emulsifier of SMEDDS formulation were IPM, Cremopher RH40 and PEG400, respectively.
