<p class="p">At room temperature, the Res SMEDDS (50 mg/g) was a viscous, transparent yellowish liquid. When the Res SMEDDS was serially tenfold diluted (10, 100 and 1000 times) with deionized water, the diluted solution becomes clear or slightly bluish. In contrast, under the same conditions, the same concentration of Res was suspended in water, even at a minimum concentration of 50 Î¼g/g (
