<p class="p">A fat-soluble drug Res is insufficiently absorbed by the human body due to its poor solubility. Accordingly, formulation strategies for enhancing solubility and dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drugs are developed to improve the oral bioavailability. In this work, the developed Res SMEDDS system, composed of IPM (15%), PEG400 (20%), and Cremophor RH40 (65%), was found to significantly enhance the solubility of Res. Res SMEDDS needed to keep under 40°C and avoid light exposure. The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> release of Res from Res SMEDDS was significantly faster that of Res powder and unaffected by pH value of media. There was no significant change for antioxidant activities of Res in presence of Res SMEDDS compared to Res powder. Res SMEDDS at the concentration of less than 100 μM was safe. These results demonstrated the potential use of Res SMEDDS for oral administration of Res.
