<p class="p">The solubility of Res was measured in various oils, emulsifiers, and co-emulsifiers. An excessive amount of Res powder was added to 10.0 g of various oils (isopropyl myristate, corn germ oil, ethyl oleate), emulsifier (Tween 20, Tween 60, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH), and co-emulsifier (glycerol, propylene glycol, PEG400, anhydrous ethanol). After stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 minutes, the mixture was shaken for 48 h at 37°C. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 10 min, and the supernatant was filtered with 0.45-μm filter. The concentration of Res was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 305nm.</p>
