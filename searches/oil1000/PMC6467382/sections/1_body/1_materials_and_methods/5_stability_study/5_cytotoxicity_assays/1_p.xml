<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of Res SMEDDS and Res was determined by a MTT kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5×10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cell/mL of PC12 cells suspended in DMEM SH30022.01 medium (100μL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% FBS were seeded into 96-well plates. 100μL containing 10% MTT solution was added to each well, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Carefully remove the culture solution in the well and add 100 μL of DMSO to each well to dissolve the crystals. The absorbance was then measured at 570 nm. The cytotoxicity of the Res SMEDDS and Res and was proceed through indirect contact testing according to MTT assay of ISO 10993-5-2009, Calculate the relative growth rate (RGR) of the sample according to
