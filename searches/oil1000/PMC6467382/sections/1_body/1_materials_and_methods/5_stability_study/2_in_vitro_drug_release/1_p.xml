 <xref rid="pone.0214544.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, a 900-mL solution composed of hydrochloric acid solution (pH = 1.2), phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8) and phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) was used as dissolution medium with stirring at 50 r/min for 37°C. An aliquot (5 mL) of the sample was collected at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. At the same time, an equivalent volume (5 mL) of fresh dissolution medium was added to compensate for the removed volume. The sample was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and the concentration of Res was measured by UV spectrophotometry. The release of the Res SMEEDS and Res at different pH values was examined with the same quantity of drug.
