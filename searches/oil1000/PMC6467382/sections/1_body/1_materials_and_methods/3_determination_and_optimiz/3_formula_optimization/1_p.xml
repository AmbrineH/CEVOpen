<p class="p">The ternary phase diagrams of the mixtures of oil, emulsifier, and co-emulsifier were prepared. Briefly, according to the pseudoternary phase diagram results, the optimal oil, emulsifier, and co-emulsifier at a certain ratio were mixed in tubes and kept for 4 h. Then, 0.2 mL of the unstratified mixture was added to 20 mL of water (37Â°C) with stirring at 100 r.min
