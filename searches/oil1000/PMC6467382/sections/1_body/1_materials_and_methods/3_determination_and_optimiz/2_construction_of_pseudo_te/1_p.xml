<p class="p">The ability of different emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers to form oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsions was investigated. Briefly, the emulsifier and the co-emulsifier with a mass ratio of 1:1 were uniformly mixed, then, the oil phase and the emulsifier/co-emulsifier mixture were mixed at various ratios (

The pseudoternary phase diagram was plotted according to the mass percentage of each component at the critical point of the O/W microemulsion. Ultimately, the components with larger O/W microemulsion were selected for the optimum formulation.
