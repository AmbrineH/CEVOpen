<p id="Par52" class="p">Spiroketals are described in the listed patents as products extracted from plants of the family Lauraceae (
 <italic class="italic">Litsea leefeana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum laubatii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptocarya lividula</italic>) from the Australian tropical forest. No public record was found in our searches indicating that they are being actively pursued as anthelmintics, and the original IP owner (Ecobiotics Ltd) was merged back into the Qbiotics group in 2017. This latter company, although listed as the inventor of the newest anthelmintic family granted patent protection (the tigliane phorbol esters) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>), seems focused on developing this series for the potentially more lucrative anti-cancer indication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>]. These compounds would be an example of an “old” structure (originally described from traditional medicinal plants from Africa; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">125</xref>]) that was rediscovered later in a different source (Australian species of 
 <italic class="italic">Hylandia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fontainea</italic>) and can still generate actionable IP. The development of modern synthetic methods for the chemical class (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>]), and a thorough characterisation of their activity, generated enough novelty to enable patenting. Going forward, the metabolic stability of the ester groups in the structure will need to be investigated, as they could either be a metabolic liability or pro-drug elements that contribute bioavailability to the active moiety.
