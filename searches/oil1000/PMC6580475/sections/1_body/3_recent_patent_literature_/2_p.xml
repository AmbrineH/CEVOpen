<p id="Par51" class="p">Of note, all natural nematocides patented since 2000 and already in the market are derivatives of microbial products. They include the macrocyclic lactones, avermectins and milbemycins (e.g. generic abamectin, ivermectin and moxidectin,and proprietary brands such as Ivomec, Mectizan or Acarexx). There are also commercially available semi-synthetic versions of the 
 <italic class="italic">spiro</italic>-oxindole paraherquamide (derquantel) and of the PF1022 cyclodepsipeptide (emodepside). Compounds disclosed in the most recent granted patents do not yet have commercially developed versions. The ascarosides are scientifically interesting starting points, as they could become the first commercial anthelmintics based on the structure of a nematode pheromone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>], although it is unclear, at this time, whether that particular mode of action will provide a potent enough deworming effect. Additional development issues of ascarosides may be the metabolic liabilities of their numerous hydroxyl groups and the fact that each nematode species seems to recognise a unique blend of different compounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>], raising the question as to how complex a mixture may need to be developed to reach an acceptabl activity spectrum.
