<p id="Par5" class="p">Pyrantel and levamisole act by binding to nematode-specific acetylcholine receptor ion channels in nerves and muscles of nematodes, resulting in a paralysis or spastic muscle contraction in worms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]; thus, the worms are unable to move normally and are removed from the gastrointestinal tract by peristalsis. Benzimidazoles work against a range of nematode species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] by binding to tubulin (cytoskeletal protein) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] and thus block the formation of the microtubules essential for critical processes in cell physiology, such as intracytoplasmic transport and cell division. Macrocyclic lactones act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels, increasing the flow of chloride ions and leading to defects in neurotransmission and flaccid paralysis (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]). Novel classes of anthelmintics, including an aminoacetonitrile (monepantel), a cyclooctadepsipeptide (emodepside) and a spiroindole (derquantel), have become available relatively recently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Their mode of action involves binding to neural acetylcholine receptors (monepantel) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], to voltage-/calcium-dependent potassium channels and to G-protein-coupled latrophilin-like receptors (emodepside) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] or B-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in muscle cells (derquantel) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>], resulting in spastic (monepantel) or flaccid (emodepside and derquantel) paralysis of sensitive nematodes, leading to death or elimination from the host animal.
