<p id="Par4" class="p">Different species of parasitic nematodes vary markedly in their pathogenicity, geographical distribution and susceptibility to anthelmintic drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Mixed infections, involving multiple genera and species are common, and often have a greater impact on the host than monospecific infections. Moreover, the species composition of the parasites infecting an animal can have an important bearing on the severity of infection or disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], and the varied pathological effects on their host contribute to a decreased production performance. Control of animal-parasitic nematodes relies heavily on the treatment with anthelmintics (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Such drugs include aminoacetonitrile derivatives (e.g. monepantel), aminophenylamidines (tribendimidine), benzimidazoles (albendazole), imidazothiazoles (levamisole), macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin and moxidectin), spiroindoles (derquantel) and tetrahydropyrimidines (morantel, oxantel and pyrantel) [
