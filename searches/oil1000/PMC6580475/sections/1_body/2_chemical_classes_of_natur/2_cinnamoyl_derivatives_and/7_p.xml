<p id="Par25" class="p">The isoflavonoids deguelin and rotenone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) were discovered from a screen of a small natural product library against exsheathed third-stage (xL3) larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. The two compounds are commonly isolated from plants of the family Leguminosae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>] and have been reported previously to display a range of activities, such as anti-inflammatory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>], apoptotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>] and insecticidal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. However, rotenone exhibits potent mammalian cytotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>] and, therefore, its nematocidal activity was not further investigated. Deguelin was relatively benign to mammalian cells in the screening study (neonatal foreskin fibroblast cells; IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 50 µM), while showing an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 14 µM against xL3 and an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.004 µM against L4 in a 72-h motility assay. Deguelin also blocked development of xL3s to the L4 stage after 7 days, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.2 µM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Transcriptomic responses of xL3 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> to deguelin treatment identified differential gene transcription associated with energy metabolism, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and mito-ribosomal protein production, supporting an inhibition of the respiratory complex I as the mode of anthelmintic action, as also proposed for the compound’s effects on mammalian cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. In mammals, complex I inhibition by deguelin seems to act in parallel to the disruption of the PI3K-Akt kinase signalling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>], which has been linked to neurotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Further analyses are needed to determine whether deguelin targets the same pathways in mammals and nematodes, which would enable a better understanding as to whether it is possible to refine the selectivity of this potent natural nematocide.
