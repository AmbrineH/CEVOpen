<p id="Par23" class="p">Other gallic acid analogues were isolated from the fruits of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate, and four related proanthocyanidins: (+)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, (+)-gallocatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate were all isolated and evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. ochengi</italic>. All derivatives displayed IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1–11 µM against adult and microfilariae of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ochengi</italic>, a reasonable potency, even though they were all less active against wildtype 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 34–350 µM). Importantly, 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> strains resistant to albendazole, levamisole or ivermectin were equally susceptible to these compounds, implying that the gallic acid analogues tested were not susceptible to resistance mechanisms affecting these commercial anthelmintics. However, all derivatives also displayed toxicity against a human cell line (Caco-2) at concentrations comparable with their potency against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]). This raises questions about the pharmacological developability of this set of proanthocyanins.
