<p id="Par22" class="p">Gallic acid analogues, the ellagic and gentisic acids, were isolated from the axlewood tree,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Ellagic acid exhibited the greatest activity against the free-living nematode

 <italic class="italic">Onchocerca ochengi</italic>, with an IC

 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 85 µM) was unchanged in strains resistant to levamisole and ivermectin. However, this compound displayed 10-fold less activity against the CB3474 strain, resistant to albendazole, suggesting that ellagic acid activity is affected by some albendazole resistance mechanisms. On the positive side, ellagic acid showed a good safety profile in rats and, therefore, may represent a reasonable starting point for development as an anthelmintic agent. The multiple hydroxyl groups are, however, frequent sites of metabolism and would probably need to be chemically protected.
