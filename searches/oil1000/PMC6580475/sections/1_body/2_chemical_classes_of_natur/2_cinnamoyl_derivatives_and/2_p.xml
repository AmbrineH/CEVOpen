<p id="Par20" class="p">As introduced in the subsection on phenolic compounds, polyphenols (also named hydrolysable or condensed tannins) are able to bind non-specifically to macromolecules and aggregate them when the compounds are present at near millimolar concentrations, a process central to the leather tanning process (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]). Condensed tannins, such as procyanidins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), were the primary constituents isolated from fractions of 
 <italic class="italic">Tilia</italic> flowers and goat willow leaves, while prodelphinidins (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] and compared with the activities of the flavonoids naringenin, quercetin and luteolin (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 140–176 µg/ml; ~ 250–300 µM). Luteolin was also found to possess anthelmintic activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Trichuris muris</italic> (IC
