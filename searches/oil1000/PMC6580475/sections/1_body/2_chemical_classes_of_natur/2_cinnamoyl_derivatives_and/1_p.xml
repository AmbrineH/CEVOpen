<p id="Par19" class="p">Cinnamic acid is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of other natural phenolic compounds, such as coumarates, flavonoids and tannins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Several cinnamic acid derivatives were isolated from fractions of natural extracts with anthelmintic activity. One such study found that leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia cochliacantha</italic> collected in Mexico contained a high percentage of caffeic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, and their respective esters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Fractions containing these cinnamic acid-like derivatives were tested in a 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> egg-hatching inhibition assay. At a concentration of 1 mg/ml (~ 5 mM), all compounds tested displayed an egg hatch inhibition of 71–98%, in agreement with a previous field study that found that goats fed 
 <italic class="italic">A. cochliacantha</italic> foliage excreted less 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> eggs than those on a different feed (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]), suggesting that the reduction in egg counts was due to the presence of cinnamic acid derivatives in this plant.
