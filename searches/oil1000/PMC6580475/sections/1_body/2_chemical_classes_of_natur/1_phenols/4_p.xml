<p id="Par18" class="p">Carvacrol and thymol are more toxic to human cells than their acetate derivatives. It was hypothesised that the difference was due to acetylation suppressing hydroxy radical formation, and both carvacrol acetate and thymol acetate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) were compared with their non-acetylated parent compounds in a nematocidal study using 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic>. In the carvacrol study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], it was found that the acetate had a somewhat weaker anthelmintic activity than free carvacrol against 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus in vitro</italic> (egg hatching EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 11.3 mM and 1.1 mM; larval development EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.0 mM and 1.3 mM, respectively). Both carvacrol- and carvacrol acetate-treated adult 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> displayed morphological alterations in the cuticle and the vulvar flap, suggesting that both have the same mechanism of action. Dosed at 250 mg/kg (once), presumably p.o., carvacrol acetate reduced gastrointestinal nematode faecal egg counts in infected sheep by 66%, while its LD
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> in mice by the same route were 567 mg/kg and 1545 mg/kg, respectively. A metabolite study was not undertaken, so it was not known whether carvacrol acetate was possibly metabolised to carvacrol under the study conditions and, therefore, the real active constituent is unknown. The thymol acetate study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>] produced very similar results. Acetylation of thymol reduced its acute toxicity to mice, but it also caused a 10-fold reduction of potency in an egg-hatch assay and a slightly decreased potency in a larval development assay when compared with the parent thymol. These results suggest that the modest nematocidal activity of these phenolic molecules is likely derived from their intrinsic antioxidant character.
