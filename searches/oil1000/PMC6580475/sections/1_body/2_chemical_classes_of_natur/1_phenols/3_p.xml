<p id="Par17" class="p">Carvacrol and thymol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) are commonly found in plant extracts and have displayed activity against the model nematode 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. When treating worms 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> at a concentration of 670 µM for 24 h, the two compounds caused 100% mortality, unlike p-cymene, which displayed little efficacy in this assay. Microscopy showed that thymol-treated 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> displayed burst or bent morphologies. Carvacrol and thymol were also shown to be effective against the pig roundworm, 
 <italic class="italic">Ascaris suum, in vitro</italic>. Both compounds killed 80% of 
 <italic class="italic">A. suum</italic> worms after treatment for 24 h at a concentration of 330 µM, while p-cymene at 370 µM killed only 20% after 24 h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Thymol has also been described as an inhibitor of

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.4 mM), L1 to L3 larval development (IC
