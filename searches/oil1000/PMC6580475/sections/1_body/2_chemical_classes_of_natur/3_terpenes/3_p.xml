<p id="Par28" class="p">A prickly shrub found in China and Taiwan and used in traditional medicine, 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum simulans</italic>, produces an essential oil containing a variety of alkaloids, coumarins and flavonoids, including a significant amount of the terpenes borneol and β-elemene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The two terpenes were evaluated against larval stages of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. Borneol inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> egg hatching (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 9.7 mM) and larval development (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 12.9 mM), and at 130 mM it suppressed larval migration by 98%, while β-elemene was poorly active or completely inactive in all assays, despite the high millimolar concentrations used; these results essentially led to the elimination of these terpenoids as anthelmintic starting points.
