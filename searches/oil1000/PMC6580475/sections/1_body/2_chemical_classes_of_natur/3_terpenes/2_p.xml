<p id="Par27" class="p">In recent literature, several terpenoid natural products were found to possess nematocidal activity. Terpinen-4-ol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), commonly isolated from conifers and 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, the source of tea tree oil, is well known for its modest antimicrobial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. A recent study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>] also demonstrated some activity of terpinen-4-ol against 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic>. In this study, in which a “nanostructured” formulation of the oil was also tested, terpinen-4-ol was the most active test article, with an IC

 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> potencies were too low to consider 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> testing in animals.
