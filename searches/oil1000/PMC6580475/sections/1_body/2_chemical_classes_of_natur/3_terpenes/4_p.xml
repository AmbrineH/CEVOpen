<p id="Par29" class="p">Warburganal and polygodial are structurally related sesquiterpenes containing two aldehyde moieties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The two compounds were isolated from the medicinal plant 
 <italic class="italic">Warburgia ugandensis</italic>, native to eastern and southern Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. An ethanolic plant extract was fractionated, guided by the detection of anthelmintics activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic>, and warburganal and polygodial were recovered among the most active natural constituents, with respective IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 28.2 µM and 13.1 µM. The two sesquiterpenes were equally active against several drug resistant strains of 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that the compounds were not susceptible to drug resistance mechanisms affecting commonly used anthelmintics. Several analogues of the two sesquiterpenes were obtained and evaluated for preliminary structure-activity relationship studies. It was found that at least one of the two aldehyde groups present in these structures was required for activity, suggesting that these chemically-reactive motifs contribute to the observed anthelmintic effect. Mechanism of action studies were also undertaken, based on similar studies of polygodial using the yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and mammalian cells, where this compound was found to act as an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans,</italic> polygodial was found to inhibit mitochondrial ATP synthesis with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.8 µM and a phenotype consistent with inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Collectively, these data suggest that polygodial is a worthwhile compound to be considered for further investigation as a nematocide. However, selectivity will need to be addressed, since polygodial inhibits mammalian ATP synthesis to a similar degree as in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]).
