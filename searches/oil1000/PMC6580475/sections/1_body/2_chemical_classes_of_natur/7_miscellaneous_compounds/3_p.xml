<p id="Par48" class="p">Another promiscuous molecule, a non-protein 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-α-amino acid from 
 <italic class="italic">Mimosa pudica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Leucaena glauca</italic> (mimosine) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>), has been described previously to possess anti-cancer, anti-viral and even herbicidal properties, perhaps related to its ability to chelate metal ions (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>]), a mechanism that is hard to optimise for selectivity. A complex inference was made that since phosphoramidothionates of some 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-amino alcohols have insecticidal activity, and acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase can be taken to be good insecticidal targets, phosphoramidothionates of mimosinol should be prepared and tested as inhibitors of both enzymes and as insecticides or nematocides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">116</xref>]. The results were disappointing, in that activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> was higher in the parent compound, mimosine (reported IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 17 µM), than in any of its derivatives, including bis-deuterated analogues that displayed potency differences in several assays, an unexpected result which was not discussed in the report [
