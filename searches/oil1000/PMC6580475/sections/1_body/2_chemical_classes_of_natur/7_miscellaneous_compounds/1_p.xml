<p id="Par46" class="p">The vesicant agent cantharidin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) from beetles of the family Meloidea has been chemically synthesised and used as an anti-cancer chemotherapy for many years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">107</xref>]. Its highest affinity molecular target in humans was identified as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>]. In nematodes, some protein phosphatases are among the gene products with sex-specific expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" class="xref">111</xref>]. This may be in apparent agreement with the purported aphrodisiac properties of cantharidin in the folk remedy “Spanish fly”, but more importantly, it has brought attention to protein phosphatases as tractable nematocidal drug targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" class="xref">112</xref>]. Fifty-four analogues of the less chemically reactive norcantharidin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>), belonging to three different chemical families, were made and tested for inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> larval development, expecting to see a correlation between anthelmintic potency and biochemical inhibition of PP2A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" class="xref">112</xref>]. Unfortunately, no such correlation was observed, suggesting that chemical modification had optimised whole-animal activity by acquiring a new and unknown target. This is a relatively common occurrence in anti-infective research that confounds structure–activity relationships (SARs).
