<p id="Par47" class="p">In the same study that proposed linalool as a nematocidal drug starting point (see subsection on prenyl derivatives) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>], the alkaloids piperine (from 
 <italic class="italic">Piper nigrum</italic> and other 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) and strychnine (from 
 <italic class="italic">Strychnos nux-vomica</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) were also put forward. As described for linalool, these alkaloids were also chemoinformatically selected as possible GST inhibitors and inferred to have anthelmintic activity. Piperine and strychnine were found to inhibit a crude preparation of DiGST by 80% and 87% at 1 µg/ml (3.5 µM and 3 µM, respectively). Piperine, responsible for the pungency of pepper seeds, is a known low-potency inhibitor of multiple targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" class="xref">113</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" class="xref">114</xref>], possibly because of its chemically reactive α,β-unsaturated group. Strychnine is a known potent non-selective poison and one of the time-honoured challenges in synthetic chemistry. The known properties of the two compounds indicate that it will be difficult to develop potent and selective analogues devoid of activity against non-target organisms. Additionally, there is the problem of the multiple GST isoforms in metazoans, assuming that the enzyme is indeed their lethal anthelmintic target.
