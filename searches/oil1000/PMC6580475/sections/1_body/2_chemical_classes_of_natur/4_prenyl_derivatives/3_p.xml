<p id="Par32" class="p">The activity of these and other chemically related prenyl alcohols has been confirmed in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>]), albeit with the same low potencies (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 50–100 μM). Activity against this free-living nematode facilitates, in principle, the use of genetic and biochemical techniques to identify the mode of anthelmintic action. However, low potencies may make these expectations difficult to achieve in practice, because high compound concentrations will be needed to observe unambiguous results, and this creates problems of compound solubility and non-specific effects.
