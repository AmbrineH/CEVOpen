<p id="Par31" class="p">Three prenyl alcohols present in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla</italic> and multiple other plants were described as active 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> against L3 larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis simplex</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. Compounds were tested 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> at three different concentrations and scored as active down to 15.6 µg/ml (70 µM) for farnesol and nerolidol (presumably a racemate in the case of nerolidol) and down to 32.5 µg/ml (146 µM) for α-bisabolol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). At those concentrations, these compounds arrested motility, abolished infectivity of treated 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> larvae in rats and caused extensive tissue damage to the worms. 
 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic>, they protected rats from 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic>-induced gastric lesions when dosed at ~ 300 mg/kg simultaneously with infection, although larval mortality 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> was lower with the pure compounds than that achieved when using complete plant essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>], suggesting the existence of beneficial synergistic interactions within the unfractionated extract. To a similar or even greater extent than linalool, these prenyl alcohols are all very hydrophobic compounds, with chemical structures prone to being extensively metabolised and with numerous known biological activities, although always with relatively low potency [
