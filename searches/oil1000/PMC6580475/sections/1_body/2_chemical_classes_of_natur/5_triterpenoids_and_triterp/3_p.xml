<p id="Par36" class="p">The saponin fraction extracted from the bark of 
 <italic class="italic">Zizyphus joazeiro</italic>, a shrub or small tree native to Brazil, was shown to have activity against caprine gastrointestinal nematodes (&gt; 90% 
 <italic class="italic">Haemonchus</italic>, with 
 <italic class="italic">Oesophagostomum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichostrongylus</italic> species making up the rest) [

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.3 mg/ml), but no activity against L3 larvae. This could be mainly due to permeability differences between egg-shell and larval cuticle, as the extract seemed to possess clear cytotoxic activity, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.2–0.3 mg/ml against Vero cells in culture. Joazeiroside B and lotoside A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) were identified among the saponins in the preparation, an identification supported by an earlier report of their presence in this plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>]. The authors proposed that joazeiroside B and lotoside A are responsible for most of the observed activity.
