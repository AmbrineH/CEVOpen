<p id="Par35" class="p">Recent reports on triterpenoids active against parasitic nematodes described compounds extracted from four different tropical plants, a common crop (oats) and an edible mushroom. An ethyl acetate extract from the latex of the shrub

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>]. Three major components were identified upon fractionation of the crude extract: urs-19(29)-en-3-yl acetate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), (3β)-Urs-19(29)-en-3-ol and 1-(2′,5′-dimethoxyphenyl)-glycerol. Surprisingly, even though they were obtained in pure form, no individual activities were reported, and it is thus unknown at this stage whether the anthelmintic properties of the extract can be attributed to either of the three compounds, to their combination or, less probably, to a minor component of
