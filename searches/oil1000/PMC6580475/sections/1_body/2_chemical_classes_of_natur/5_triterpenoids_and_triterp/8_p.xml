<p id="Par41" class="p">In summary, no new nematocidal triterpenoids were reported in the reviewed literature, and the reported ones were previously known and displayed relatively low potencies and narrow selectivity windows in anthelmintic assays, making their development as nematocidal compounds challenging. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop triterpenoids into anti-infective drugs (e.g. fusidic acid), and nematodes are known to use steroid-hormone signalling (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>]), which could potentially be disrupted to obtain an anthelmintic effect if developable analogues can be identified.
