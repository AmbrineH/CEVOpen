<p id="Par38" class="p">Different terpenoids were detected in organic solvent extracts from roots of the West African plant 
 <italic class="italic">Dichapetalum filicaule</italic>, which had ovicidal activity against the human hookworm 
 <italic class="italic">Necator americanus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>]. Silica gel column-fractionation and analysis by NMR and MS revealed the presence of numerous triterpenoids, and the nematocidal activity of two of them, dichapetalins A and X (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), was investigated. Hatching of hookworm eggs was inhibited by both compounds, with an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 162 µg/ml and 523 µg/ml for the A and X forms, equivalent to 277 µM and 745 µM, respectively. Other triterpenoids detected in the extract, such as pomolic acid, have been described previously to have multiple biological activities, but they were not tested in the assay.
