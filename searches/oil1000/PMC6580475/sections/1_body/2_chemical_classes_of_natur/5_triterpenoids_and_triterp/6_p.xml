<p id="Par39" class="p">A more sustainable plant source than those referred to above is oats (
 <italic class="italic">Avena sativa</italic>); the saponins avenacosides A and B (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) were extracted from seedlings using methanol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. The authors also sought to emulate the plant response to fungal infection by treating the saponins with avenacosidase, a β-glucosidase that produces the 26-desglucosyl form of the compounds. The products of the enzymatic treatment still retain their glycolipid character due to a tetrasaccharide at position 3 of the triterpenoid core, but the removal of glucose at position 26 reportedly makes them effective disruptors of fungal membranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>]. Given the use of oats as a traditional remedy for humans and cattle, avenacoside B and its 26-desglucosyl form were each tested against fungi, as well as against eggs and larvae of the parasitic nematode 
 <italic class="italic">Heligmosomoides bakeri</italic>. Although growth of the fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma harzianum</italic> was inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, anthelmintic activity was apparently confounded by the presence of 2% ethanol in the preparations, which claimed much of the effect observed relative to medium-only controls in most tests, perhaps with the exception of Rho-123 dye accumulation, which would indicate an interference with a P-glycoprotein-type efflux pump [
