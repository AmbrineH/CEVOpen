<p id="Par37" class="p">Saponin cytotoxicity was also encountered when analysing active methanolic extracts from seeds, bark and leaves from the Sri Lankan tree 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus zeylanicus</italic>. All extracts displayed activity against the adult and microfilarial stages of the bovine filarial nematode 
 <italic class="italic">Setaria digitata</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. Considering toxicity to human cells, the extract from seeds seemed to have better selectivity (although no more than 2-fold) than extracts from other plant parts, and it was fractionated to identify its active components. Four pure compounds, representing ~ 0.4% by weight of the total methanolic extract, were identified and studied. The two most abundant and potent, although also cytotoxic, were the 3-glucosyl and 3-arabinosyl saponins of oleanolic acid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Two minor components also identified were free triterpenoids: a 
 <italic class="italic">regio</italic>-isomer of oleanolate and betulinic acid, both found to be inactive in this study. Given the multiple biological activities attributed to oleanolic acid (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>]), it was considered interesting to hydrolyse the saponins and test the released oleanolate. Senathilake et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>] measured an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of ~ 40 µM for inhibition of motility by oleanolic acid, both in microfilariae and adult worms, with selectivity indices &gt; 10-fold relative to cytotoxicity. At concentrations of more than twice the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, signs of tissue damage in worms were observed, with apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation and increased levels of oxidative stress markers, concordant with previously described effects of oleanolate in rapidly growing cells. Interestingly, a search for the free terpenoid in 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus</italic> seeds failed, and, thus, the basis for the higher selectivity of the seed extract relative to those from other plant parts remained unexplained.
