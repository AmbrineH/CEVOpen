<p id="Par40" class="p">The only non-plant source of an anthelmintic triterpenoid reported since 2010 was the edible fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Pleurotus djamor</italic>. A hydro-ethanolic extract of fruiting bodies (mushrooms) was fractionated by direct phase silica gel chromatography, and one fraction with ovicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). It was found to contain mostly free fatty acids plus ≤ 1% of the triterpenoid β-sitosterol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), as determined by ion counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. It is, however, to be expected that the abundant free fatty acids present in the most active fraction were responsible for the largest share of the extract’s ovicidal activity, given that their concentrations greatly exceeded the 241 µM of β-sitosterol present.
