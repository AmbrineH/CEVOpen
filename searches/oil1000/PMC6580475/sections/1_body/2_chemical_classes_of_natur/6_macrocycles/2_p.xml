<p id="Par43" class="p">More recently, Xiang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>] extracted mycelium from 
 <italic class="italic">Streptomyces microflavus</italic> with methanol and fractionated the resultant product by chromatography on silica gel, thus purifying a compound active against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> and adult two-spotted spider mites (
 <italic class="italic">Tetranychus urticae</italic>). 
 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> potency was surprisingly high (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 15.4 µg/ml or 26 µM against 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic>), taking into account that, although the compound shares structural motifs with the macrocyclic lactone nemadectin (a milbemycin), it lacks the lactone ring itself (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). Activity was confirmed with four similarly open structures obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Streptomyces bingchenggensis</italic>, showing that these much more flexible compounds possess biological activity found previously only on the cyclic milbemycins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>]. It is not known at this early stage whether the new compounds share the mode of action of the closed macrocycles and whether they possess pharmacological advantages or disadvantages. It would be especially interesting to learn whether they also utilise the unexpected route of entry into nematodes recently described for ivermectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>].
