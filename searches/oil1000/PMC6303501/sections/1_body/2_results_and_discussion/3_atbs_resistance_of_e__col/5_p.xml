<p class="p">Our results are completely contradictory with those highlighted in France by the RESAPATH network which is a report of a decline in antimicrobial resistance and an increase in the sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains from turkey meat to ATB; indeed, a significant increase in the proportion of susceptible isolates to CS was observed in all animal species what suggest that the spread of CS-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> that is pathogenic for animals is under control; for TE, the sensitivity increased from 17% in 2010 to 58% in 2016, and the same thing for FLM which went from 66% in 2010 to 78% in 2016; this network also has a sensitivity state estimated at 99% for the NEO, 97% for the CF, 95% for the ENR, and 85% for the AMC [
 <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. These results contradictory to ours could be explained by the rational use of the ATB, the respect of the rules of breeding allowing to minimize the diseases and, at the same time, the use of ATB and an awareness of all the actors of the poultry sector (breeder, veterinarians, and state institutions) as to the need to preserve the existing ATB capital.
