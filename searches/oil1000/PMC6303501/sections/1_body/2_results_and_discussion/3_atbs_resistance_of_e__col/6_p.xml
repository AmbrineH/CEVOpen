<p class="p">The results of antimicrobial resistance we got and which are quite disturbing can be explained by several factors; the increased and uncontrolled use of ATB, sometimes by the breeder himself, who is not, under any circumstances, entitled to perform correct antibiotic therapy. Indeed, nowadays, the large availability of avian ATB on the Algerian market with affordable prices (generic drugs) facilitates the access of these molecules to breeders [

The use of ATB as a preventive measure as growth promoters can also be incriminating, the non-respect of the rules of breeding such as increased density, bad hygiene, bad aeration, and the non-installation of footbath leads the appearance of pathologies involving repeated ATB therapies, in which antibiotherapy is carried out without using antibiograms in most of the time [

 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], may also influence the occurrence of resistance in poultry farms such as the decrease in the availability of ATB (poor dilution, degradation by biocides, and plugging pipettes), the decrease in consumption ATB (poor ATB taste, low number of water points, and lameness), and decreased absorption of ATB (enteritis). This phenomenon of antibioresistance can, also, be explained by the diversity of the mechanisms of resistance of bacteria [
