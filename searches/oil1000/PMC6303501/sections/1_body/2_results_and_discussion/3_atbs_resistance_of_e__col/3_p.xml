<p class="p">In the case of strains isolated from turkeys, the finding is a significant antimicrobial resistance but less than that of broilers; in fact, a state of resistance (I + R) evaluated at 100%, has been demonstrated for a single molecule (CS) which, according to a study by Messai [
 <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], is the first molecule to be used in Algeria in the Poultry farming during digestive infections. These bacteria also showed an estimated resistance of 87.5% against 4 molecules (AMC, NA, DAN and ENR) followed closely by a resistance rate evaluated at 81.25% recorded against four other molecules (NEO, AMP, CAZ and TE). The CIP, SXT, CF, and the cefoxitin came after with, respectively, posted rates at 75, 68.75, 56.25, and 50%. For the three ATB (IMI, ceftriaxone, and aztreonam), no antimicrobial resistance was reported (0%). We would like to point out that for these strains of turkey, the state of non-sensitivity to an ATB of the Carbapenem family, namely, ETP (6.25%) as well as the presence of resistance against a fourth-generation Cephalosporin, the FEP (6.25%), the only ATB, as previously mentioned, for which no resistance has been recorded in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> from broiler chicken, is a real public health problem, especially considering that turkey farming in Algeria is a very recent sector compared to broiler farming.
