<p class="p">The results of ATB resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains are presented in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table-5</xref>; for the broiler chicken strains, antibiograms showed a very high and very disturbing antimicrobial resistance profile. Indeed, of the 21 ATBs tested, a total resistance (100%), combining the intermediate and resistant antibiogram results (I+R), has been reported to 8 molecules; amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), ampicillin (AMP), ceftazidime (CAZ), which is a cephalosporin third generation, nalidixic acid (NA), danofloxacin (DAN), enrofloxacin (ENR), tetracycline (TE), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), these strains showed also a significant resistance (I+R) to colistin (CS) (95.83%), ciprofloxacin (CIP) (87.5%) and neomycin (NEO) (75%); note that the cefepime (FEP), cephalosporin fourth generation, is the only ATB for which no antimicrobial resistance has been reported (0%), but what also attracted our attention is the presence of a resistance to two molecules belonging to the carbapenem family, namely ertapenem (ETP) and imipenem (IMI), evaluated respectively at 8.33 and 4.16%. although this resistance is minimal, it is very worrying as this class of ATB ranked as critically important by World Health, is used in hospitals as a treatment of last intention [
 <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Unfortunately, the result we obtained is corroborated by several other studies conducted in Algeria; this is the case of Halfaoui 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] who worked on different organs of broilers with colibacillosis lesions in central Algeria. This study isolated 156 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with a high level of resistance to TE (94.12%), flumequine (FLM): 91.5%, SXT (88.89%), ENR (86.27%), NA (85.62%), AMP (83.01%) and doxycycline (DO): 75.81%. Another study, conducted on ATB resistance of avian Enterobacteriaceae in Western Algeria by Ahmed 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], found that 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains presented a high levels of resistance to FLM (94%), TE, and amoxicillin with the same rate estimated at 92%, SXT (91%), ENR (86%), NA (84%), and cephalothin (CF) with 80% of resistance; a second study, conducted in another region of the West region of Algeria, also revealed high antimicrobial resistance levels for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> from broilers with up to 90.35%, 79.82%, 70.17%, 92.10%, and 62.28%, respectively, for TE, ENR, SXT, AMC, and ceftiofur (XNL) [
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Other similar results were recorded on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains from broiler in other countries; Abd El Tawab 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] showed 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains with total resistance (100%) to AMC and significant resistance to 2 other ATB which are DO and erythromycin (ERY) with, respectively, rates estimated at 90% and 60% in Egypt; Manishimwe 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] reported a prevalence of ATB resistance (I+R) from 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates to ERY, rifampicin, and DO estimated, respectively, at 100, 98.8, and 98.3% in Rwanda, while Wasyl 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] estimated at 54.5% the resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> to cephalosporin in Poland; these genes were also noted in strains from broilers originated from Belgium and Germany.
