<p class="p">However, our results differ completely from those obtained in France and expressed in the annual report of the year 2016 of the network RESAPATH (French surveillance network for antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria of animal origin) in collaboration with ANSES (French agency for food, environmental, and occupational health safety), in fact, this network reported that the resistance to TE in clinical 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> broiler strains has been continuously decreasing from 81% in 2010 to 44% in 2016. The same thing was found for XNL, where its resistance decreased from 22% in 2010 to 2.4% in 2016, and this network also reported a sensitivity of these 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains with regard to ENR (92%), DAN (87%), AMC (85%), SXT (69%), and NA (53%) [
