<p class="p">Extraction by several hydrodistillations of the two plants allowed to obtain different yields. Indeed, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L., characterized by a liquid appearance, a light brown color, a strong and a spicy aromatic odor, expressed a yield estimated at 1.22±0.26%, while the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> L., which was characterized by its mobile liquid appearance, pale yellow, and its camphorous odor, displayed, as for her, a much lower yield evaluated at 0.23±0.15%.
