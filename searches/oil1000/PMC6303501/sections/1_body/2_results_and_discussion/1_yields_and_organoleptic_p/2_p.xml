<p class="p">The results illustrated in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table-2</xref> demonstrate a certain variability in the yields obtained in the various studies conducted [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]; indeed, these differences could be explained by several factors such as environmental factors as demonstrated by Krol and Kieltyka-Dadasiewicz [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] who emphasized that the weather conditions and harvested time have a significant effect on the herb yield, in the same context, Jordan 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] gave a relationship between the production of volatile oils and the climate by stating that EO production is favored in areas with a low thermicity index. Other studies examining the influence of plant maturity on their EO yield have shown that higher yields have been recorded on advanced mature plants [

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], when to them, have highlighted a negative correlation between the water content in plant leaves and their EO yields, while other authors have attributed the difference of these yields to the plant drying time [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] and to the means of EO extraction, Indeed, it has been proven, especially by Akram 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], where EO extraction was done by two different methods, a supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) and hydrodistillation, that the yield of the EO differs according to the extraction technique. The comparison between these two methods revealed the superiority of the yields obtained by SCFE compared to the hydrodistillation process. While Zheljazkov 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] emphasized the duration of hydrodistillation by demonstrating that the low EO yield obtained in the short distillation time (DT) has been increased with increasing of this DT, the extraction temperature and the flow rate can also be incriminate [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Other parameters such as growing region [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], geographical variations, and origin of cultivars also appear to be behind the variations in these yields [
