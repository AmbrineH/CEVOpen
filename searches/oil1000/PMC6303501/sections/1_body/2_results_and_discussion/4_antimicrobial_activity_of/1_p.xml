<p class="p">As can be seen in Tables-
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, the two EOs tested showed antibacterial activity against the strains tested; however, it was found that the essence of Thyme (
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L.) had a much greater antibacterial activity than EO of Coriander (
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> L.). The average of the IZ recorded for the pure EO of Thyme on all the avian strains studied was estimated at 26.75±0.426 mm (ranging from 18.66±0.152 mm for the smallest IZ to 39.33±0.585 mm for the largest one) with CMIs ranging from 0.07 to 0.93 mg/ml; for this EO, it is noted that there is no variation between the average of the IZ of pure and diluted EO, and the same thing was observed by comparing the average of the IZ of broiler strains and those of turkeys.
