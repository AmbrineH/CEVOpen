<p class="p">After the Thyme EO, we found, with an average of IZ estimated at 17.05±0.383 mm (ranging from 9.63±0.550 mm for the smallest zone of inhibition to 36.00±0.458 mm for the largest one) and MICs evaluated between 0.6 and 10 mg/ml, the EO of Coriander. The aromatograms of this EO, on all avian strains studied, expressed different results between pure and diluted EO, with an estimated difference of 2.4 mm in favor of pure EO, a difference was also noticed between the broiler and turkey strains; in fact, turkey strains displayed, for both pure and diluted EO, an average of IZ larger, with a difference of almost 1mm, compared to the broiler chicken strains. Regarding the ATCC 25922, it expressed the same result regarding the sensitivity to the EOs used; Thyme EO in the first position with a MIC estimate at 0.16 mg/ml, followed by Coriander EO which the MIC had posted at 2.5 mg/ml. The IZ was greater in pure EO for the two EOs studied; in fact, for Thyme EO, a significant difference was highlighted between an IZ of 30.60±0.200 mm for pure EO versus 21.36±0.208 mm for diluted EO, for Coriander EO, a smaller gap has been registered between an IZ of 17.33±0.513 mm for pure EO against 16.10±0.173 mm for diluted EO, this result could be explained by an antagonism between the dispersant (DMSO) and these EO [
