<p class="p">As for Coriander EO, its antibacterial activity was reported by several authors [
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>], this antibacterial activity can be explained by its chemical composition whose major component proved to be Linalool (60.91%) and its complex interactions with different individual components [
 <xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], the antibacterial activity in question would be due to disrupting bacterial cell walls, inhibiting bacterial enzyme activity and suppressing translation of certain regulatory gene products [
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. More recently, a new antimicrobial peptide, namely “plantaricin CS” with broad antibacterial activity was isolated from the coriander leaf extract [
 <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>].
