<p class="p">In the literature, several other studies have expressed results comparable to those we obtained regarding the antibacterial activity of Thyme EO [
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] and Coriander EO [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] to 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and or multidrug-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains. That said, in Egypt, a study by El-Shenawy 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], rather revealed an antibacterial activity of Coriander EO (IZ=20 mm) greater than that we have found, and this contradictory result can be explained by the use of different bacterial strains of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, different methods for MIC determination [
 <xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], the composition of EO, functional groups present in active component and their synergistic interactions, varietal differences, the test method used as well as culture conditions (type and volume of broth, temperature, time of incubation, concentration, and age of inoculums) [
 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>].
