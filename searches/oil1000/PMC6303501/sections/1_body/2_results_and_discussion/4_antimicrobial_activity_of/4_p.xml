<p class="p">In sum, it can be concluded that the antimicrobial properties of EO are essentially connected to their chemical composition; the highest antibacterial activity is demonstrated by phenolic compounds such as Carvacrol, Thymol, and Eugenol [
 <xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. This would strongly explain the results we obtained; indeed, the most significant antibacterial activity reported was the one with the highest phenol levels, namely Thyme EO and its 74.40% phenolic compounds mainly represented by Carvacrol (73.03%). The mechanism of action of Carvacrol and Thymol, each on their side or in synergy, involves the disruption of the cell membrane and escape of cytoplasmic contents [
 <xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, Carvacrol and Thymol provoke the depolarization and disintegration of the external membrane, liberating lipopolysaccharides and increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane [
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Other studies, explaining even more the results we have obtained, rapported that, in addition to the ratio in which the main active constituents are present, the interactions between these and the minor constituents can also affect the antibacterial activity of EO; this is the case of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen (whose level in Thyme were 9.99 %) which is not an efficient antimicrobial agent when used alone, but with Carvacrol and Thymol, it can potentiate the action of the EO to promoting the cytoplasmic membrane expansion and facilitating the antimicrobial action of these monoterpene phenols [
