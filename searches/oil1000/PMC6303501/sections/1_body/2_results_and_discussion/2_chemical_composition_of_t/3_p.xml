<p class="p">As for the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> L., the result that we obtained is corroborated by several other studies carried out in Algeria (Northwest) [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], Egypt (North and Center) [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], Italy [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and Syria [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], thus affirming the belonging to the Linalool CT. The variations reported in the compositions of the EO studied can be explained by intrinsic plant factors and extrinsic one [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]; these factors can be divided into three groups; genotype, ecological, and technological factors [
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. instead of [
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], in fact, Pirbalouti [
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], during his work, indicated that the components of EOs varied with the plant genotype, El-Zaeddi 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], when to them, have rather questioned the stage of maturity of the plant, while Lu√≠s 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] have instead focused on the geographical origin of the plant; however, the environmental factor is also important. Indeed, Atti-Santos 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], working on the effect of the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> from South Brazil, found that the main component, namely Thymol, over the 9 months of harvesting period, was found to vary from 35.5% to 52.4%, concluding that as regard to the harvest time, EO was richer in oxygenated compounds in spring season. Other authors have attributed the difference in the chemical composition of EO to the conditions in which the plants will grow, thus calling into question the temperature, photoperiod, rainfall, and hygrometry [
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], abiotic stress such as salinity and water stress [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], agronomical practices [
 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], and even spatial distribution of the plants. Indeed, De Falco 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], in addition to incriminating the state of the plant before extraction (fresh or dried), demonstrated an EO rich in Sabinene from plants grown in single rows, while plants grown in double rows were richer in Ocimene. Finally, other factors, influencing the composition of EO, can be mentioned such as the period and conditions of storage [
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], the duration of drying of the plant, as well as the extraction duration [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
