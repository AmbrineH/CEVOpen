<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of the essences studied gave the following results (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table-3</xref>), for Thyme EO (
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L.), 14 compounds, representing 95.58% of all the constituents detected, were identified. This EO was characterized by its high content of phenols (74.40%). Indeed, among the 7 main constituents of this aroma, the main compound was Carvacrol (73.03%) which is a powerful phenol sought in EOs for its antibacterial action, which molecule was followed by p-cymen (9.99%), β-caryophyllene (3.63%) and γ-terpinene (3.02%), which together with p-cymen represent the two precursors of Carvacol [
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], note that Thymol, another potent phenol is present but in small quantities (1.14%). For Coriander EO (
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic>), GC-MS analysis revealed 19 molecules representing 93.51% of the total components; the main molecule was Linalool (60.91%), followed by Eugenol (8.95%) and Aceteugenol (6.70%). The chemical analysis of these essences allowed, therefore, highlighting 2 different chemotypes (CT), the CT Carvacrol for the EO of Thyme and Linalool CT for EO of Coriander.
