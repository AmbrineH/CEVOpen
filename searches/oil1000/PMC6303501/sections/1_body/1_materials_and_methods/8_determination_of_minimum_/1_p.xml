<p class="p">In this step, we drew on the work of Dr. Guinoiseau using the method of liquid macrodilution for the determination of MICs, and this method consists of inoculating, by a standardized inoculum and a decreasing concentration range in EO. After incubation, observation of the range gives access to the MIC [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], which corresponds to the lowest concentration of active ingredient capable of inhibiting any bacterial growth at 24 h [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>].
