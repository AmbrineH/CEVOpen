<p class="p">This method, also called aromatogram, is based on a technique used in medical bacteriology which is the antibiogram, the only difference is the replacement of ATBs with aromatic extracts, the EO will diffuse from the soaked disc within the agar and determine a concentration gradient [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. For this, a bacterial suspension of density equivalent to 0.5 MacFarland is prepared and diluted 1/100, in the meantime, 20 ml of Mueller-Hinton agar medium are prepared and poured into a Petri dish where 2 ml of inoculum are poured, after impregnation of 5 min, the excess inoculum is removed by suction. On the surface of each box, three sterile 6 mm diameter filter paper disks (bioMérieux) are deposited. Two tests are carried out: A disc soaked with 15 μl of EO and the second one with 15 μl of EO supplemented with 15% of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO). A negative control is carried out with 15 μl of sterile distilled water in the presence of 15% of DMSO. The dishes are left for 1 h at room temperature, then inverted and incubated at 37°C for 18-24 h [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The bacteria will grow on the entire surface of the agar except where they meet a concentration of EO sufficient to inhibit their growth. At the outlet of the stove, the absence of bacterial growth results in a translucent halo around the disc and the diameter of the inhibition zone (IZ) is measured and expressed in millimeters (mm). The larger the diameter, the more the strain is sensitive to EO [
