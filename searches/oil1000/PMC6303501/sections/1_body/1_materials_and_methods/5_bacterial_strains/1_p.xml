<p class="p">In our study, the bacteria we worked on were represented by 40 multidrug-resistant strains of avian 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (24 strains from broiler chicken and 16 from turkey) isolated from animals reared in the Eastern region of Algeria and this from feces, livers, and intestines of birds with diarrhea. These samples were restored in buffered peptone water for 18-24 h at 37°C, then, using a sterile platinum loop, a drop from the previously inoculated broth was seeded onto Hektoen agar plates for 24 h at 37°C. Identification of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> isolates was performed according to morphological characters of colonies and results of their biochemical tests obtained using commercial biochemical test kits (bioMérieux API, France). We also worked on a reference strain of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) provided by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory of El-Tarf.
