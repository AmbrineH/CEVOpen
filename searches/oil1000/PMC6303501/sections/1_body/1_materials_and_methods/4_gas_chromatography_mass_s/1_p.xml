<p class="p">The chemical composition analysis of EOs of Thyme (
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic>) and that of Coriander (
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> L.) was performed in Algiers in the Center for Scientific and Technical Research in Physical and Chemical Analysis (CRAPC EXPERTISE SPA) using g a Hewlett Packard Agilent 6890 GC equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m * 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The steady state temperature was started at 60 °C for 8 min and then gradually increased (2 °C/min) to 250 ° C for 10 min. This device was coupled to a Hewlett Packard Agilent 5973 MS detector recorded in 70 eV electron ionization with 30 to 550 sweep with a solvent delay of 3.5 min, ion source at 230 °C and interface temperature at 280 °C. The temperature of the injector was fixed to 250°C with a split ratio of 50:1 and 0.2 µl of injected volume. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/. The percentage of each constituent of the oil was determined by area peaks, the EOs components were identified by comparison with literature data and the profiles from the Wiley 7.
