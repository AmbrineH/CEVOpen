<p id="Par2" class="p">Ticks belong to a group of exclusively blood-feeding ectoparasites (Elmhalli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2009</xref>). From the medical point of view, ticks are the second most important group of disease vectors after mosquitoes. The pathogenic agents transmitted by ticks affect the public health and cause economic losses in livestock sector (Svehlova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2014</xref>). The Mediterranean region offers suitable environment for a wide range of tick species (Maia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2014</xref>). The geographical distribution of ticks has continued to increase over the past three decades (Tabanca et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2013</xref>; Svehlova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2014</xref>). This distribution might be modified by future climate and environmental changes (Jore et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>).
