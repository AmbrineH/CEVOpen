<p id="Par12" class="p">In order to test the tick repelling activity under natural conditions, a field trial was conducted using the similar white flannel cloths that used for tick collection mentioned above. The field trail was employed using method described by Garboui et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2007</xref>). Briefly, two persons dragged two white flannel clothes (1 × 1 m) on vegetation in parallel manner. One cloth was sprayed with 65 mg of the test substance dissolved in 100 ml hexane to cover the whole surface of the cloth whereas the other cloth was sprayed with 100 ml hexane control. The final concentration of essential oil was 6.5 µg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the cloth. During the trial the clothes were dragged against the vegetation in such a way that the treated side was towards the ground vegetation to maximize the effect of the treatment. The cloths were slowly dragged over an area of 10 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> before they were inspected and attached ticks were counted, removed and put into separate labeled vials. This procedure was repeated 20 times per day for the test substance and the control thus overall a tested cloth was dragged over a vegetation of 200 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The treated clothes were tested for two consecutive days and were stored separately in airtight plastic bags until the next day of testing. Temperature and humidity were recorded the day before, during testing days and one day after the test. The repellency of essential oil was calculated (Jaenson et al.
