<p class="p">In general, the overall mechanism of enzymatic lipid degradation is identical in terrestrial plants [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The enzyme cascade is initiated by activated phospholipase, followed by lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase. However, the particular enzymes are highly species- and sometimes even strain-specific [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], and this can explain the large biodiversity of lipid degradation VOCs (e.g., carbonyl compounds, alcohols, and hydrocarbons). Marine algae contain unsaturated fatty acids, and they can produce C
