<p class="p">Selinane and cadinane are two main types of sesquiterpenes reported in brown algae [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. According to the currently accepted hypotheses, in addition to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), neryl pyrophosphate (NPP) may be a precursor in sesquiterpenes formation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00495-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). It can be assumed [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] that in the cyclisation process (after pyrophosphate (PP) loss) germacrenyl cations A and B are formed, and after hydride migration, cations C and D are formed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00495-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). For the biosynthesis of cadinene-type sesquiterpenes, two alternative pathways were suggested [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The primarily formed cation A may be transformed to cation C and after deprotonated to germacrene D (1b). The subsequent change from 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>- structure to 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>- 1b is crucial for the formation of cadinane type sesquiterpenes (with 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> double bond in the ring) followed by protonation and rearrangement to cation D. As an alternative, NPP may serve as a substrate for cadinene-type sesquiterpene biosynthesis. In this case, the cyclization to the cadinanes would proceed via cations B and D. Moreover, it can be assumed that germacrene D and germacrenyl cation D are the biosynthetic precursors of the major isolated sesquiterpenes from 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic>. Major sesquiterpenes of this alga with cadinane skeleton that could be derived from germacrene D were (
