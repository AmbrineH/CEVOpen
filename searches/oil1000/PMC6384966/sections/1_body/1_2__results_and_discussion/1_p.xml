<p class="p">In order to investigate the chemical diversity of the headspace and volatile oil composition from two brown algae of the family Dictyotaceae, order Dictyotales collected from the Adriatic Sea from the same area (island Vis, Croatia), two complementary methods were used: headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD) followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-FID; GC-MS) analysis. In order to avoid the changes that could occur in VOCs from the native samples after a long time of collection or drying, both algae were investigated as fresh samples. Two fibres of different polarity were used for HS-SPME (Polydimethylsiloxane/Divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) and Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS)) to obtain more complete chemical profiles. The results pointed out striking differences between the chemical profiles for the headspace and volatile oil of the same algae (depending on the compounds molecular mass and volatility). It should be taken into consideration that the headspace composition does not reflect the composition percentage of the sample (only of the headspace) and hydrodistillation is not an adequate method for the isolation of water-soluble, high-molecular compounds and less volatile compounds such as diterpenes.</p>
