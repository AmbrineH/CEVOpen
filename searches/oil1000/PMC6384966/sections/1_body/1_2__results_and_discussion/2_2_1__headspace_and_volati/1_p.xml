<p class="p">The headspace of 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> is dominated with germacrene D (32.06% (PDMS/DVB fibre); 27.89% (DVB/CAR/PDMS fibre)) and sesquiterpene bicyclic hydrocarbons of cadinane type skeleton epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene (27.49%; 25.13%) followed by cadina-3,5-diene (2.45%; 3.60%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cadina-1(6),4-diene (1.21%; 2.39%) and zonarene (2.25%; 2.53%). An array of other cadinane type structures with minor percentages were identified (

Another abundant compound with tricyclic sesquiterpene skeleton of cubebane type was β-cubebene (12.80%; 10.74%) with a minor percentage of its isomer α-cubebene (2.53%; 2.48%). In addition, axane type (bicyclic spiro[4,5]decane) sesquiterpene alcohol gleenol was found among major constituents (9.68%; 11.02%). Several compounds were found as minor constituents exclusively in the headspace (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00495-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) such as: dimethyl sulfide, 2-ethylhex-1-yl acetate, bornyl acetate, γ-elemene, cyclosativene, α-ylangene, and β-patchoulene. The headspace composition of this algae is reported for the first time.
