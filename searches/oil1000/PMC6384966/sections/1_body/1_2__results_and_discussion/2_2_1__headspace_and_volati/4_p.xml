<p class="p">In comparison with previous research of 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic>, it is only possible to partially compare the results, since different extracts were investigated previously (not obtained by HS-SPME or HD, but with other methods targeting non-volatile compounds). The extracts mostly contained high-molecular compounds and researches were directed toward the isolation of individual components, not toward obtaining full chemical profiles. The compounds 4-cadinene, cadinane-4(14),5-diene, (−)-germacrene D, axenol, (−)-cubebol, and 4-epi-cubebol were previously identified in petroleum extract (after chromatographic purification) of dried
