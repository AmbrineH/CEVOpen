<p class="p">The major VOCs found in the headspace and oil are known to exhibit different biological activities. Germacrene D is involved in plantâ€“insect interaction, acting as a pheromone on receptor neurones [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and is also an important deterrent and insecticidal agent against different parasites such as mosquitos, aphids and ticks [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] where germacrene D resulted active against human breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7), human ductal carcinoma (Hs 578T) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2). Epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene could be connected with antidermatophytic activity [
