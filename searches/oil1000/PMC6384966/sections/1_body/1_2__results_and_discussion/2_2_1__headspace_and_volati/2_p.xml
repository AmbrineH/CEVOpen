<p class="p">Germacrene D (22.24%), epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene (20.83%) and gleenol (15.35%) were dominant compounds in the hydrodistillate as well. Smaller percentages of other cadinane types as well as selinane type sesquiterpenes were found (

However, in the distillate, several higher molecular compounds were found (that were not present in the headspace) such as diterpenes (pachydictyol A, cembra-4,7,11,15-tetraen-3-ol and isocembrol), higher aliphatic compounds (e.g., tridecanal or pentadecanal), sesquiterpenes (
