<p class="p">The chemical profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> hydrodistillate and headspace are significantly different containing only three common compounds ((
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene, pentadecane and diisobutyl phthalate), but with different abundance (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00495-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The major oil compounds were higher aliphatic alcohols: (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-octadec-9-en-1-ol (25.68%), hexadecan-1-ol (17.29%), and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-octadeca-3,13-dien-1-ol (7.55%) along with minor percentages of tetradecan-1-ol, pentadecanal, hexadecan-2-one, pentadecan-1-ol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-hexadec-11-en-1-ol, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-hexadec-11-en-1-ol, octadecanal, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-ol. Higher aliphatic esters were found as minor constituents such as: methyl 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoate, methyl 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoate and methyl 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoate. Diterpene alcohols 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-phytol (6.45%) and pachydictol A (6.03%) were among the relevant compounds in the oil with a minor abundance of isopachydictol A. Several sesquiterpenes were present: 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-α-bergamotene, epi-β-santalene, α-humulene, β-santalene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-guaiene, β-bisabolene, and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bisabolene. These sesquiterpenes as well as pachydictol A and isopachydictyol A were for the first time found in 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic>. In comparison with previous papers on VOCs, from this alga, only partial similarity is observed. Namely, the major compound of SDE isolate [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] was bis-2-ethylhexyl phtalate (40.22%), while in the current research, diisobutyl phthalate was found as a minor constituent. Fatty esters such as methyl eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoate, methyl eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-tetraenoate and diterpene phytol were found previously in this alga [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] as well in the current research. The presence of free fatty acids was also reported [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Sesquiterpene compounds β-cubebene, germacrene D and santalol were previously detected in 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> SDE isolate [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], but not in the present research where several other sesquiterpenes were found (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00495-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> toluene extract subjected to 4-h SDE [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] provided esters benzyl acetate and benzyl formate as the major compounds. Besides the esters of benzoic acid, significant concentrations of their biogenetic precursors benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol were found, but they were not identified in the isolated oil. Therefore, the assumption that these compounds can serve as biomarkers for these algae [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] is questionable. In addition, low concentrations of the common marine algal terpene dihydroactinidiolide and C
 <sub class="sub">13</sub>-norisoprenoid β-ionone were found previously, and in the obtained oil, diterpenes isopachydictyol A and pachydictol A as well as C
 <sub class="sub">13</sub>-norisoprenoid 3-oxo-α-ionol were present.
