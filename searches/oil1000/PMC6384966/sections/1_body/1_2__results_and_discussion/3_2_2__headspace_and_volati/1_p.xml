<p class="p">A total of 17 compounds were found in the headspace of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic>. Aliphatic fatty alcohol octan-1-ol was a dominant constituent (37.73%; 38.60%) along with its oxygenated derivative octanal (9.63%; 7.98%). Another major constituent was dimethyl sulfide (DMS; 18.27%; 26.37%). All three compounds were reported for the first time in this alga (only in the headspace). However, C
