 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], there are no reports on the headspace composition of these algae. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) is the appropriate method for the research of low-molecular and highly-volatile headspace compounds, while hydrodistillation (HD) is an adequate method for isolating volatile and less-volatile compounds. It is well known that the headspace composition is different form the hydrodistillate/extract composition, and certain lower molecular compounds can be found only in the headspace. Among them, chemotaxonomic markers, allelochemicals, defensive compounds, attractants, or alarming pheromones can be found that are participating in chemical communications in marine ecosystems or playing ecological roles. In addition, there is no data on 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> direct hydrodistillate (HD) composition, there are only reports on EtOAc and petroleum extract composition containing several sesquiterpenes among other constituents. Therefore, the goals of the present study on two selected brown algae growing in the same area (island Vis, Adriatic Sea) and collected at the same time were to: (a) determine the phytochemical percentage (%) composition of the headspace VOCs (first time report) by HS-SPME followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-FID; GC-MS) analysis; (b) determine by GC-FID and GC-MS the chemical composition of their volatile oils isolated by hydrodistillation (first report on 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> volatile oil); (c) compare the results of the corresponding headspace and volatile oil chemical composition; (d) discuss the obtained results in comparison to the literature data, particularly regarding the extracts composition or the algal volatile oils from different geographic areas; and (e) indicate possible biosynthetic formation pathways of the major identified compounds according to the literature data.
