<p class="p">Marine secondary metabolites possess outstanding structural and functional diversity related to their different metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. While the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of terrestrial plants have attracted attention since antiquity, the VOCs of marine algae have been much less investigated. Therefore, the target of the present research are VOCs of two brown seaweeds from family Dictyotaceae, order Dictyotales:
