 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The chemical composition of this seaweed from the southern Adriatic Sea was investigated [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and 12 sterols were identified in CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/MeOH extract, the main ones being cholesterol and fucosterol. The most abundant fatty acid was palmitic acid, followed by oleic acid and myristic acid. The toluene extract was subjected to 4-h simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE; [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]); and in the volatile fraction, aromatic esters, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and free fatty acids dominated with low concentrations of terpenoids, phenols and sulfur containing compounds. 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> collected from Red sea coast, Egypt was subjected to direct SDE and bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate was the major compound. 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> extracts exhibited: (a) antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] that may be due to phenolic compounds; (d) cytotoxicity against KB cells [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]; oxysterol and hydroperoxy-24 vinyl-24 cholesterol were identified as being responsible for this activity; and (e) antitumor activity against lung (H460) and liver (HepG2) human carcinoma cell lines [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] due to xenicane diterpenes 18,19-epoxyxenic-19-methoxy-18-hydroxy-4-acetoxy-6,9,13-triene and 18,19-epoxyxenic-18,19-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-6,9,13-triene.
