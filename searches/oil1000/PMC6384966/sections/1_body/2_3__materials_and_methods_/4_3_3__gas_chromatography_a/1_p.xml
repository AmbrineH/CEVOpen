<p class="p">Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7890A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, Agilent J and W). The GC conditions were the same as described previously [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In brief, the oven temperature was set up isothermally at 70 °C for 2 min, then increased from 70–200 °C at 3 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and held isothermally at 200 °C for 15 min; the carrier gas was helium (He 1.0 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The GC-MS analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7820A equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD) model 5977E (Agilent Technologies) and HP-5MS capillary column, under the same conditions as for the GC-FID analysis. The MSD (EI mode) was operated at 70 eV, and the mass range was 30–300 amu.
