<p class="p">Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was performed with a manual SPME holder using two fibres covered with PDMS/DVB (Polydimethylsiloxane/Divinylbenzene) or DVB/CAR/PDMS (Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane) obtained from Supelco Co. (Bellefonte, PA, USA). The fibres were conditioned prior to the extraction according to the instructions by Supelco Co. For HS-SPME, prepared samples (1 g) were placed separately in 5 mL glass vials and hermetically sealed with PTFE/silicone septa. The vials were maintained in a water bath at 60 °C during equilibration (15 min) and HS-SPME (45 min). After the sampling, the SPME fibre was withdrawn into the needle, removed from the vial, and inserted into the injector (250 °C) of GC-FID and GC-MS for 6 min where the extracted volatiles were thermally desorbed directly to the GC column. The procedure was similar as in previous paper [
