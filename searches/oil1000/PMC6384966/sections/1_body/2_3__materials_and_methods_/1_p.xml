 <italic class="italic">Taonia atomaria</italic> (Woodward) J. Agardh, 1848 and 
 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> (Linnaeus) Thivy, 1960) were collected in the middle of the Adriatic Sea, in island Vis bay near Prirovo peninsula in May 2018. The geographical coordinates of the sampling were: 43°3′47″ N, 16°11′15″ E (
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic>) and 43°3′44″ N, 16°11′16″ E (
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic>). Single point sample collection provided representative samples. The algae were collected from depths of 1 m with the sea temperature at 17 °C. The samples were separately collected and placed in air-tight plastic bags containing surrounding seawater and were immediately transported to the laboratory. The samples were kept in the dark at 4 °C, and the extractions were performed within 48 h of the collection. Before headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), each sample was separately cut into small pieces and the excess seawater was removed by placing it between the filter paper layers for 2 min (the seawater was not removed completely) as was done in previous research [
