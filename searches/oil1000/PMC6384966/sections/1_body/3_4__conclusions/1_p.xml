<p class="p">HS-SPME and hydrodistillation were adequate and complementary methods for the research of headspace and volatile oil composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic>. Although these two seaweed species belong to the same botanical family and order, and were collected from the same area at the same time, significant diversity in their VOCs composition was found. The headspace and oil composition of 
 <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> were quite similar (containing germacrene D, epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene, Î²-cubebene and gleenol as the major compounds). However, the headspace and oil composition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> differed significantly (dimethyl sulfide, octan-1-ol and octanal dominated in the headspace, while the oil contained mainly higher aliphatic alcohols, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-phytol and pachdityol A). The current research contributed to the knowledge of algae chemical biodiversity since the obtained chemical profiles reveal an array of different compounds (mainly sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and aliphatic compounds); many of them were identified in both algae for the first time. Identified VOCs with distinctive chemical structures (among them biologically active compounds can be found) could be useful for algae taxonomic studies.
