 <p class="p">Two selected brown algae (
  <italic class="italic">Taonia atomaria</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Padina</italic>
  <italic class="italic">pavonica</italic> from the family Dictyotaceae, order Dictyotales) growing in the same area (island Vis, central Adriatic Sea) were collected at the same time. Their phytochemical composition of the headspace volatile organic compounds (HS-VOCs; first time report) was determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Hydrodistillation was applied for the isolation of their volatile oils (first report on 
  <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> volatile oil). The isolates were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The headspace and oil composition of 
  <italic class="italic">T. atomaria</italic> were quite similar (containing germacrene D, epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene, Î²-cubebene and gleenol as the major compounds). However, 
  <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic> headspace and oil composition differed significantly (dimethyl sulfide, octan-1-ol and octanal dominated in the headspace, while the oil contained mainly higher aliphatic alcohols, 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-phytol and pachydictol A). Performed research contributes to the knowledge of the algae chemical biodiversity and reports an array of different compounds (mainly sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and aliphatic compounds); many of them were identified in both algae for the first time. Identified VOCs with distinctive chemical structures could be useful for taxonomic studies of related algae.
