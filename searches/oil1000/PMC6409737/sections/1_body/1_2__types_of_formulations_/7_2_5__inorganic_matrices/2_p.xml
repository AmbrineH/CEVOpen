 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mesoporous particles (MSPs) (i.e., hollow silica shells, MCM-41, SBA-15 and UVM-7) showed that they were able to hinder the delivery of FA at low pH (to stomach) and deliver large amounts of the vitamin at neutral pH (to intestine); nevertheless, the usage of supports with large pore entrance ensured an initial fast release, while the mesoporous material MCM-41 demonstrated a sustained release over the time [

Similarly, the in vitro digestion procedure showed that mesoporous silica support loaded with FA and functionalized with amines inhibited the release of FA in acidic solution at pH 2 (stomach) and enabled its controlled release in neutral pH (intestine), thereby modulating the bioaccessibility [

 <xref rid="B125-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] investigated controlled FA delivery and stability in fruit juices to reduce potential for over-fortification risks by using dated MSPs and observed that the encapsulation of FA into MSPs resulted in considerably improved vitamin stability and contributed to controlled release after consumption by modifying FA bioaccessibility.
