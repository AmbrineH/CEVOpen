<p class="p">Inorganic porous materials, such as various silica- or aluminosilicate-based materials/composites, clays, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), etc., have become good candidates for the delivery of a range of drugs, providing some advantages in formulation and engineering. They have suitable architecture, large surface area, and stability in biological fluids; thus, they are used for high loading capacity, controllable release, and improved targeting [
