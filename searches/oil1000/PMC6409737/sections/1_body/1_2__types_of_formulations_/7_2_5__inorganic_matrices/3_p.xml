<p class="p">RES encapsulated in mesoporous silica (MCM-48) NPs with the particle size of 90 nm did not alter its bioactivity and, at lower concentration, i.e., 5 Âµg/mL, exhibited higher anti-inflammatory activity compared to RES suspension or its solution [
 <xref rid="B126-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. Similar findings concerning the enhancement of the biological activity of RES by colloidal mesoporous silica NPs were reported also by Summerlin et al. [
 <xref rid="B127-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>] reviewed causes and consequences of micronutrient deficiencies and the bioavailability of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and silica for food and outlined that the release of nutrients from silica in simulated intestinal fluid is better than in simulated gastric fluid.
