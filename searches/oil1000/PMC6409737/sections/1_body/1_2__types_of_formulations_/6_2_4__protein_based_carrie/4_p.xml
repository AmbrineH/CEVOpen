<p class="p">The degree of FA binding to β-lactoglobulin (β-Lglb) and type A gelatin carriers was affected by their pH-dependent zeta-potential, which indicated the occurrence of ionic bonds, and the binding of FA reached 100% at pH 3. At pH 3, particle size considerably increased at increasing the molar FA/protein ratio; however, shifting back the pH to 7 totally reversed it, which means that these formulations could protect FA at pH 3 prevailing in the stomach, but they are strongly favorable for its delivery to the duodenum (pH 7) [

At food simulant conditions (yoghurt simulant, 3% acetic acid), β-Lglb nanostructures were stable for more than 14 days and had protective impact on riboflavin activity, releasing it in a 7-day period [
