<p class="p">Significant aggregation and sedimentation of zein NPs encapsulating lutein (ZLNPs) with hydrodynamic radius approx. 75 nm were observed at gastric digestion conditions, and the ZLNPs that were not fully digested by gastric enzymes adhered to lipid droplets; however, the aggregation was reduced and digestion was stimulated when salt (i.e., high ion concentration) was left out. On the other hand, thanks to the encapsulation of lutein into NPs, its digestive stability was increased [
