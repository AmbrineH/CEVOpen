 <sc class="sc">d</sc>–potato protein co-assemblies, the nanocomplexation provided pronounced protection and reduced vitamin D losses during pasteurization and also under several different sets of storage conditions, suggesting that potato protein could be used as a protective carrier for hydrophobic nutraceuticals suitable for enrichment of clear beverages and other food or drink products with beneficial impact on human health [
