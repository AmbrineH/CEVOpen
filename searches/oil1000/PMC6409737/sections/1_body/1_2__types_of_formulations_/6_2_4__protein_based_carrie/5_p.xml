<p class="p">Isolated 7S and 11S globulins (Glbs) obtained from defeated soy flour, which were complexed with FA and included in culture media, showed higher bacterial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus casei</italic> BL23. Therefore, Glbs-FA based nanocomplexes have potential to be used in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and food industries [

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus casei</italic> BL23 produces microvesicles carrying proteins that have been connected with its probiotic effect, and, using a proteomic approach, Rubio et al. [
 <xref rid="B109-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] identified proteins described as mediators of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>â€™ probiotic effects, namely p40, p75, and the product of LCABL_31160, which was annotated as an adhesion protein. The expression and subsequent encapsulation of proteins into microvesicles of bacteria generally considered as safe could be also used in applications of foods and nutraceuticals.
