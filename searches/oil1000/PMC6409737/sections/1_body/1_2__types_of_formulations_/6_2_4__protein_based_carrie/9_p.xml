<p class="p">After drying and reconstitution, vitamin D-loaded re-assembled casein micelles (r-CMs) were found to improve the in vitro bioavailability of vitamin D in a Caco-2 cell model and showed strong protective effect against its gastric degradation, providing 4-fold higher bioavailability compared to free vitamin D [

An incorporated phenolic compound showed notably improved chemical stability during an accelerated shelf-life test. The aqueous solubility of CUR and Q after loading in r-CMs was higher than that of free polyphenol molecules, and the viability of treated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells decreased as follows: free polyphenol molecules &gt;&gt; non-digested polyphenol-loaded carriers &gt; digested polyphenol-loaded r-CMs. Based on the investigation of the stability and bioavailability of CUR in mixed SCas and pea protein isolate NEs, Yerramilli et al.
