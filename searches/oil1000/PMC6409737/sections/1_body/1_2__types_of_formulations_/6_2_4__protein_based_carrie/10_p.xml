<p class="p">FAâ€“loaded casein NPs of 150 nm fabricated with the use of a coacervation process, stabilized with lysine or arginine, and finally dried by spray-drying were administered to laboratory animals p.o. at dose 1 mg FA/kg and ensured considerably higher serum levels of the vitamin than an aqueous solution of FA administered to animals, and the release profile and oral bioavailability of FA were not affected by the treatment of casein NPs by high hydrostatic pressure [
