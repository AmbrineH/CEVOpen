<p class="p">CS/tripolyphosphate-nanoliposomes core-shell nanocomplexes as vitamin E carriers showed vitamin E retention rate &gt;80% during the 30-day storage and 92% and 97% after heating at 65 °C for 30 min and at 80 °C for 16 s, respectively, and based on the enhanced stability of liposomes against temperature stress reflected in reduced particle aggregation, zeta potential inversion, and membrane fluidity, this formulation could be considered as appropriate for commercial use in the food industry [
