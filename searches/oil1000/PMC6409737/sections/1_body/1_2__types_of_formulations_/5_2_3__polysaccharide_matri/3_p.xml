 <xref rid="B92-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. The addition of cellulose nanocrystals and lecithin into alginate microbeads improved the viability of encapsulated probiotic (
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> ATCC 9595) during gastric passage and storage, and at 25 and 4 °C storage conditions, a decrease in the viability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. rhamnosus</italic> by 1.23 and 1.08 log, respectively, was estimated, while at encapsulation of the probiotic with alginate microbeads, a 3.17 and 1.93 log reduction, respectively, was observed [

The oligo-hyalurosomes nanoscale DES based on oligo-hyaluronic acid-CUR polymer co-loaded with both CUR and resveratrol (RES) showing the average particle size of 134.5 ± 5.1 nm, spherical shape, and zeta potential of −29.4 ± 1.2 mV at pH 7.4 phosphate buffer conditions exhibited excellent stability and sustained release character and higher radical scavenging activity compared to the single formulations and liposomes suggesting that this system could be considered as a promising nanofood DES applicable in juice, yoghourt and nutritional supplements [
