<p class="p">In food-grade alginate/CS nanolaminates obtained by the layer-by-layer technique, in which folic acid (FA) was incorporated by post-diffusion, a higher stability of FA under ultraviolet light exposure compared to free FA was estimated, and the higher rate and concentration of FA released from nanolaminates at pH 7 in comparison with that at pH 3 suggested that nanolaminates containing hydrophilic active compounds can be used for food applications [
