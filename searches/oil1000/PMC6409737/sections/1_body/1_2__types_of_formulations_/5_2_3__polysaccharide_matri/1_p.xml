<p class="p">Polysaccharides that have various enzymatic susceptibilities to ensure specific degradation in the small or large intestine when used as a NP coating can efficiently retard the nonspecific release of encapsulated bioactive compounds until the coating is exposed to its intended environment of release, and such coated NPs can be potentially targeted to different GI tract organs and taken up by the enterocytes, providing improved oral bioavailability [
