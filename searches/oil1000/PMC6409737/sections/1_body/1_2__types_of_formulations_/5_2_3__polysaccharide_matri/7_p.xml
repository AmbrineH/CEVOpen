 <xref rid="B99-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] reported preparation of multi-functional stimuli-responsive NPs for food and biomedical applications by combining electrostatic complexation between proteins and polysaccharides with following thermal protein denaturation for the production of chondroitin sulfate/bovine serum albumin NPs. The irreversible proteinâ€“protein contacts upon temperature treatment provide the complexes with properties of nanogels, and the surface charge of the prepared NPs reversed at pH 5.3, while their size depended on the solution ionic strength and pH. Protein-polysaccharide-surfactant ternary complex particles prepared by anti-solvent co-precipitation using zein, propylene glycol alginate, and either rhamnolipid or lecithin pronouncedly improved the photostability and bioaccessibility of CUR suggesting that they could be used to deliver hydrophobic nutraceuticals for applications in foods, supplements, and pharmaceuticals [
