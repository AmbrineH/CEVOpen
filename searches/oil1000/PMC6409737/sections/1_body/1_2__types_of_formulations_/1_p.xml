<p class="p">Nutraceuticals’ functionality in food products can be stabilized and enhanced using bio-based nanoscaled DESs that help to improve their bioavailability and protect valuable nutraceuticals at food processing or digestion, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00296-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, where individual most frequently applied nanoformulations are mentioned. Selected nanoformulations are discussed below in the following subchapters. Advances in nutraceutical DESs with focus on the formulation design for the enhancement of nutraceuticals’ bioavailability with the purpose to ensure effective preservation or maximization of their bioactivity and safety inside the human body were summarized by Goncalves et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A review of recent research developments related to nanocarrier-based delivery of nutraceuticals for cancer prevention and treatment was presented by Arora and Jaglan [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Recent findings related to advances made in the nanoencapsulation of lipophilic and hydrophilic vitamins, safety issues, and health risks regarding the consumption of these products, which would result in widespread utilization of nanoencapsulated vitamins in the food and beverage products in the future, were summarized by Katouzian and Jafari [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The intelligent DESs for bioactive compounds in foods designed to improve their low solubility, poor stability, and low permeability in the GI tract and improving their oral bioavailability were discussed by Chai et al. [
