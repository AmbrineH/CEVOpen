<p class="p">The short-chain triglyceride-based NE encapsulating vitamin E did not physically withstand temperatures exceeding 25 °C, while with long-chain triglyceride-based NEs, good vitamin E retention even at 40 °C was observed, and the retention was increased when the NEs were stored in the dark [

 <italic class="italic">d</italic> &lt; 200 nm) fabricated by spontaneous emulsification using medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and Tween 80 at surfactant-to-oil ratio ≥1 at high stirring speeds (800 rpm) were found to be relatively stable at ambient temperatures and unstable at heating (T &gt; 80 °C), but the application of a cosurfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) could improve their thermal stability [
 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The investigation of the effect of excipient NEs formulated from long or medium chain triglycerides (LCT or MCT) on β-carotene (β-Car) bioaccessibility from commercial DISs (tablets or soft gels) studied using an in vitro GI tract model showed that the application of LCT NEs enhanced β-Car bioaccessibility from tablets and soft gels by 20% and 5%, respectively, while the effect of MCTs was minor. This could be connected with the fact that large carotenoid molecules could be incorporated only into large mixed micelles formed by LCT digestion, and thus, excipient NEs could be applied to improve nutraceutical bioavailability from DISs [
 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. NEs prepared using three LCT oils (flaxseed, olive and corn oil) increased the bioaccessibility of astaxanthin (AST) compared to the control due to the formation of mixed micelles that solubilized the hydrophobic carotenoids. The final amount of free fatty acids released affected lipid digestion and AST bioaccessibility, which decreased in the following order: olive oil &gt; flaxseed oil &gt; corn oil, and free fatty acids unsaturation and chain length affected lipid digestion and micelle formation [

 <xref rid="B73-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] increased the bioavailability of the model bioactive compound α-tocopherol as a food supplement using edible (coconut) oil NEs. The prepared NEs were found stable and biocompatible, and the contribution of kinetic-controlled release was found to be approx. 70%, while that of diffusion-controlled release was approx. 30%, suggesting the potential of the use of edible oil NEs in food and beverages.
