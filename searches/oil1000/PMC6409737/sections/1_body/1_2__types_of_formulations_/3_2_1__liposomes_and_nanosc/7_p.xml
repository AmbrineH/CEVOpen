<p class="p">A saponin coated NE with mean droplet diameter 277 nm encapsulating vitamin E was found to be more stable to droplet coalescence at thermal processing (30–90 °C), long-term storage, and mechanical stress than a conventional emulsion with mean droplet diameter 1.285 μm. At application of both emulsion formulations to male Wistar rats, droplet flocculation and coalescence during in vivo digestion was observed, however, the higher in vivo oral bioavailability of vitamin E encapsulated in the NE was reflected in a 3-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) compared to the conventional emulsion [

At pH 7, both systems were stable in the temperature range 3–90 °C but unstable at pH 2 or in the presence of NaCl (&gt;100 mM NaCl for lecithin and ≥400 mM NaCl for quillaja saponin) [

The encapsulation of CUR in saponin-coated CUR NEs fabricated using a simple pH-driven loading method improved CUR solubility and bioavailability, and its in vitro bioaccessibility was approx. 3.3-fold higher compared to free CUR. In an in vivo study, oral administration of these NPs to Sprague Dawley rats resulted in approx. 8.9-fold higher in vivo bioavailability than that estimated with free CUR [
