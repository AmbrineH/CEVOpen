<p class="p">Nanoliposomes, or nanometric bilayer phospholipid vesicles, have a very promising potential for the nutraceutical industry, because they can encapsulate simultaneously lipophilic and hydrophilic materials, ensuring a synergistic effect, and can protect sensitive bioactive compounds, enhance their bioavailability, ensure sustained-release, and improve storage stability. The unique properties of nanoliposomes predestine them to be used in DISs for effective disease prevention and health promotion [
