<p class="p">Cholecalciferol (vitamin D
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) minitablets and an optimized bile salt/lipase alginate-glycerin film provided unique oral components for inclusion in a bioactive association platform (BAP) capsule designed to deliver the active nutraceutical ingredient from the formulation framework resulting in the enhanced in vitro and in vivo performance of cholecalciferol. The in vivo experiment showed that cholecalciferol bioavailability from the BAP was 3.2-fold greater than that of the conventional product, and improved and maintained serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were observed as well, suggesting that BAP could be considered as an ideal oral vehicle for enhanced delivery of cholecalciferol [
