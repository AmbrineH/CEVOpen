<p class="p">Stimuli-sensitive (smart) nano DESs for nutraceuticals of both a nutritional and pharmaceutical value are of great importance for the formulation of novel functional foods. Because the best effect on the human health was observed when the weight ratio of ω-6/ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is in the range between 1:1 and 5:1, Semenova et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] focused their attention on the molecular design of DESs on the basis of nanoscale complexes formed between a covalent conjugate (sodium caseinate (SCas) + maltodextrin; dextrose equivalent = 2) and combinations of polyunsaturated lipids that are mutually complementary in the content of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs: α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) + α-linoleic acid (α-LLA); liposomes of soy PC + α-LNA, and micelles of soy lyso-PC + α-LNA. The researchers concluded that thanks to the EE of all these lipid combinations by the conjugate, lipids were highly protected against oxidation, and their high solubility in an aqueous medium was reached.
