<p class="p">β-Car enriched O/W emulsions, in which chlorogenic acid-lactoferrin-polydextrose conjugate was used as an emulsifier to stabilize lipid droplets, showed improved stability to droplet aggregation under simulated GI tract conditions, resulting in increased β-Car bioaccessibility, suggesting that the ternary conjugate-stabilized emulsions could be used as protectors and carriers of hydrophobic drugs, supplements, and nutraceuticals [

On the other hand, excipient NEs had much less effect on the bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds, probably due to their smaller and more polar molecules, which could be more easily solubilized in aqueous intestinal fluids [
