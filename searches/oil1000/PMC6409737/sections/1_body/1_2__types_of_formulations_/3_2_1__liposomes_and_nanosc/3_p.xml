<p class="p">At the preparation of liposomes starting from multilamellar large vesicles with a diameter range 2.9–5.7 μm using an ultrasound-assisted approach based on the thin-film hydration method, unilamellar vesicles with diameter sizes ranging from 40 nm to 51 nm were achieved, showing the EE of 56% for cobalamin, 76% for α-tocopherol, and 57% for ergocalciferol. The nanovesicles and their content were kept intact for &gt;10 days when incubated at simulated conditions of extracellular environment thanks to the used lipid composition [

The investigation of the encapsulation and preservation of quercetin (Q) with cyclodextrins (CDs), conventional liposomes composed of three different types of phospholipids (unsaturated egg Lipoid E80, unsaturated soybean Lipoid S100, and saturated soybean Phospholipon 90H), and drug-in-CD-in-liposomes showed that the application of Lipoid E80-liposomes resulted in a better protection of Q against UV irradiation, and its photostability was additionally improved when encapsulated in drug-in-CD-in-liposomes (sulfobutylether β-CD/Q inclusion complex in Lipoid E80 liposomes) [
