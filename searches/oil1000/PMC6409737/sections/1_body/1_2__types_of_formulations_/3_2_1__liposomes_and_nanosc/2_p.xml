<p class="p">Nanophytosome is one of the newest lipid-based nanocarriers enabling the delivery of botanical based nutraceuticals, which could be potentially used in food products for designing novel functional foods and beverages [

Phytosomes-phosphatidylcholine (PC)â€”rutin complexes prepared by the encapsulation of rutin with PC using rutin:PC molar ratio 1:3 were found to provide the highest physical and chemical stability (during 30 days of storage) with fine particle sizes (&lt;100 nm) and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 99%, and due to the ability of masking undesirable features of rutin, they may be applied in fortification of food products with water insoluble nutraceuticals [
