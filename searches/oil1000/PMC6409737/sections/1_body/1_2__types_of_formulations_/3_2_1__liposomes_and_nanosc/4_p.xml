 <sup class="sup">®</sup> modified CUR liposomes showed a slower release rate and lower cumulative release percentage for CUR, enhanced pH stability and thermal stability, and pronouncedly improved absorption in simulated GI tract in vitro, suggesting that both types of liposomes could be used as carriers of CUR in nutraceuticals and functional foods. The best bioaccessibility was observed for CUR liposomes modified with Pluronic
