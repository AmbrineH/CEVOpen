For example, microfluidization could be considered as an efficient emulsification technique resulting in fish oil encapsulated powder producing emulsions at the nanoscale range (

This caused faster mixed micelle formation and, consequently, enhanced solubilization of carotenoids in intestinal fluids. Moreover, when tomatoes were boiled with emulsions, the bioaccessibility of carotenoids was higher than when they were boiled alone and subsequently added to emulsions [

Electrospinning and electrospraying technologies constitute useful and modern techniques used for the encapsulation and controlled release of bioactive compounds, including drugs and health-promoting agents. Both electrospinning, mostly used for fibres, and electrospraying, mostly used for particles, are voltage-driven fabrication technologies enabling tight control of fibres and particles in the micro-, submicro- and nanoscale dimensions suitable for a wide range (polymers, proteins, inorganic) of materials. Both processes are able to replace traditional techniques, e.g., spray-drying or lyophilisation, as they propose several benefits such as (i) production of dry products in a single step, (ii) room temperature operation (suitable for labile components, e.g., antioxidants, omega-3 oils, living cells, etc.), (iii) enabling to produce single-phase or multi-component fibres and particles, and (iv) high effectivity of encapsulation [
