<p class="p">Nanocapsules based on lipid formulations having larger surface area than microsized carriers can more effectively enhance solubility, bioavailability, and controlled release of nanoencapsulated phenolic compounds and could be successfully applied in functional foods [
 <xref rid="B82-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. For example, the physical stability of Î²-Car nanocapsules (&gt;300 nm) showed only minor changes during storage, suggesting that they could be used in functional beverages and foods as well as nutraceutical products [
 <xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. At the investigation of the impact of solid domain properties on the rate of compound release from NLCs using Monte Carlo simulations, it was found that the release of encapsulated bioactive compounds by solid impenetrable domains at the particle/solution interface is hindered only when the domain size is much smaller than the size of NPs, even if a considerable proportion of the interface is covered by these domains, with the rate of release depending also on the geometry of the solid domains [
 <xref rid="B84-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. The preparation and characterization of vitamin A palmitate-loaded NLCs as DESs for food products was reported by Kong et al. [
