In biomedical branches, NPs can be used for nanodiagnostics, as nanomaterials for tissue engineering, as drug carriers for specific delivery/targeted biodistribution or controlled release, and as agents/drugs for prevention/treatment of diseases. Therefore, application of nanotechnology can be considered as an excellent tool for modification of parameters of bioactive agents. Modification of properties using nanosystems/nanoformulations helps to enhance the bioavailability of active substances and change the route of administration when needed. Therefore, smaller amounts of substances can be used, which allows decreasing dose-dependent toxicity and various side effects. In addition, many formulations also protect bioactive molecules from degradation [

The enhancement of bioavailability could be achieved by the improved solubility of bioactive compounds under gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, their protection from the chemical conditions in the GI tract, and controlled release within the GI tract, or by an improved transfer through the intestinal wall, and the particle size, surface properties, and physical state of the nanomaterials used in food supplements are crucial characteristics affecting their final nutritional value [
