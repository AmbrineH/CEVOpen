<p class="p">Basic types of preparations/materials influencing human health or condition can be classified as follows: (i) drug products, (ii) homeopathics, (iii) dietary supplements (DISs), (iv) medical devices, (v) cosmetics, and (vi) biocidal products. Dietary (food) supplements are products that look similar to medicines (can be sold in pharmacies) but are a special category of foods. They contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, natural products, probiotics, etc., as active ingredients. The purpose of a DIS is to keep the human body functioning properly by delivering compounds that are needed by the human body but could not be received sufficiently from a regular diet. According to the manufacturers, DISs have beneficial effects on health conditions. They are manufactured in the form of pills, capsules, tablets, or liquids [

 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. DISs are regulated by many guidelines, regulations and directives, for example, by the European Commission directives 2002/46/EC and 2006/37/EC, European regulations 1924/2006, 1137/2008, 1170/2009, 1161/2011, 119/2014, 2015/414, 2017/1203 [

 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], to ensure the quality and safety of these products, to protect consumers against potential health risks from such products, and to ensure that they are not provided with misleading information. In addition, DISs are regulated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), national legislation (e.g., on food) and regulations (e.g., requirements for food supplements and food enrichment), etc. For example, in the EU market, approx. 30 approved nutrition claims (meaning that specific requirements are to be met) can be found, and a product can be marketed as a DIS only if it meets the so-called health claims, which is any statement about a relationship between food and health. The European Commission approves various health claims, which have to be easily understood by consumers, based on scientific evidence. The EFSA is responsible for evaluating the scientific evidence supporting health claims, the types of which are as follows: (i) ‘Function Health Claims’ (relating to the growth, development and functions of the body, or referring to psychological and behavioral functions, or on slimming or weight-control), (ii) ‘Risk Reduction Claims’ (on reducing a risk factor in the development of a disease), and (iii) Health ‘Claims referring to children’s development’ [
