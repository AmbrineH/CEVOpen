<p class="p">Foods for special medical purposes (FSMPs), based on the definition of the EFSA, “are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder, or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. Specifically, according to EU legislation, they are intended for patients with a limited, impaired, or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolize, or excrete ordinary foods, or certain nutrients or metabolites; or with other medically nutrient requirements whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone” [

It means that FSMPs are foods that are intended for nourishment at: (i) certain groups of people whose digestive process or metabolism is impaired, (ii) certain groups of persons in a particular physiological state, which therefore, may have specific benefits from controlled consumption of certain substances in food, or (iii) healthy infants and young children. Therefore, the following categories of FSMPs can be distinguished: (i) food for infant and follow-on nourishment and nutrition of small children, (ii) food for cereal and other non-cereal food for infant and young children, (iii) low-energy foods designed to reduce body weight, (iv) food without phenylalanine, (v) gluten-free foods, (vi) foods for people with disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (diabetics), (vii) low lactose or lactose-free foods, (viii) foods with low protein content, (ix) foods intended for athletes and for persons with increased physical performance. FSMPs are advised to be used only under medical supervision and have to be provided with labels with information about their intended use. The European Commission also issued several documents for the regulation of FSMPs, e.g., Commission Directive 1999/21/EC, Commission Regulations No. 953/2009, 609/2013, 2016/128 [
