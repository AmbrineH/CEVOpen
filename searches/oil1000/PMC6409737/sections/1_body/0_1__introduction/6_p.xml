<p class="p">Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing field that ensures the development of materials with new dimensions, novel properties, and a wider range of applications. U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative defines nanoparticles (NPs) in the range of 1–100 nm [
 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. According to the Recommendation on the definition of a nanomaterial adopted by the European Commission, the term “nanomaterial” means “a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1–100 nm. In specific cases and where warranted by concerns for the environment, health, safety or competitiveness the number size distribution threshold of 50% may be replaced by a threshold between 1 and 50%” [

From the aspect of passage through vessels, the inside diameter of which is in the range from 25 mm (aorta) to 5 μm (capillaries), the ideal size of NPs should be &lt;300 nm to ensure efficient transport for targeted distribution of drugs [
