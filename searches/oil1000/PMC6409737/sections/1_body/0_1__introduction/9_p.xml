<p class="p">The above-mentioned nanoformulations can be found in many drug classes, and so it is not surprising that supplements and FSMPs have also started being formulated in the nanoscale, especially with the aim to improve bioavailability, protect active ingredients against degradation, or reduce side effects. Therefore, this contribution summarizes the current state of the research focused on nanoformulated human and veterinary DISs and FSMPs.</p>
