<p class="p">A significant property of nanoformulations is the possibility to co-encapsulate antioxidants together with an active ingredient and thus increase the stability and extend expiration. As antioxidant excipients, PUFAs, carotenoids, antioxidant plant extracts, CUR, and catechins can be used, and as formulations, nano/micro emulsions, NLCs, NPs/MPs, and liposomes can be applied.</p>
