<p class="p">The antioxidant capacity of α-LNA loaded microemulsion was strongly enhanced after the introduction of carbon dots, which were distributed mainly at the oil-water interface, suggesting a “turn off” effect of the interface [

Benzylisothiocyanate nutraceutical encapsulated in a stable α-tocopherol-based O/W NE stabilized with a nontoxic, biodegradable surfactant, sodium stearoyl lactate, showed better antioxidant activity than pure and CUR encapsulated NEs, however CUR entrapped in the NE was effectively protected from UV light-induced degradation [
