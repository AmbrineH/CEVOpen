<p class="p">Ethyl cellulose MPs with encapsulated hydroxytyrosol, a constituent of olive oil showing antioxidant properties, produced by double emulsion solvent evaporation (average particle size ranging from 156.6 ± 6.9 µm to 304.0 ± 16.0 µm) demonstrated the effectiveness of their gastro-resistance and the antioxidant capacity preservation of &gt;50%, indicating possible applications of this formulation in foods, drugs, and nutraceuticals [

 <italic class="italic">Citrus reticulata</italic> Blanco cv. unshiu peel extract (CPE) flavonoids encapsulated by pectin NPs with particle size 271.5 ± 5.3 nm released only 28.78% of flavonoids in simulated gastric fluid within 2 h compared to naked CPE and showed higher antioxidant activity than blank pectin NPs and free CPE [
 <xref rid="B140-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. The replacement of 30% of pectin (low charge density) with alginate (high charge density) forming shell around zein NPs significantly improved the aggregation stability at pH 5–7 and high ionic strengths (2.0 µM NaCl), and CUR encapsulated in these core-shell NPs was characterized by higher antioxidant and radical scavenging activities than CUR dissolved in ethanol solutions [
