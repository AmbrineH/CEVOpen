<p class="p">The comparison of liposomes and CS coated liposomes co-loaded with vitamin C and FA with the mean particle size of 138 nm and 249 nm, respectively, showed the higher EEs of both drugs as well as the higher antioxidant activity of CS coated liposome nanoformulation, suggesting that it could be applied as a promising DES in the food industry [

The deposition of CS and alginate layers on CUR NEs improved CUR antioxidant capacity during in vitro digestion and showed a better control of the rate and extent of lipid digestibility by decreasing free fatty acids release compared to uncoated NEs [
