<p class="p">Anionic sphere-shaped core-shell NPs with zein-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) conjugates as the hydrophobic core and a biosurfactant (rhamnolipid) as a shell with average diameters &lt;200 nm co-loaded with CUR and RES protected these nutraceuticals from degradation, simultaneously preserving their antioxidant activity, and by mixing these NPs with lipid droplets, the bioaccessibility of both encapsulated compounds pronouncedly increased [
