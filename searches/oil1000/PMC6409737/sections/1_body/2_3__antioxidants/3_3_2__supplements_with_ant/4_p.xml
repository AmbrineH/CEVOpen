<p class="p">β-Car, the most important dietary source of provitamin A, is necessary for optimum human health. To increase its solubility and bioaccessibility, 0.1% β-Car was dispersed in corn oil (5 or 10%) and homogenized with 2% SCas solution at 100 MPa, and the prepared NEs had particle sizes &lt;200 nm. β-Car stability towards oxidation decreased with the decreasing droplet diameter, and the extent of lipolysis in an in vitro system was higher and linearly related to the inverse of the droplet diameter [

 <xref rid="B152-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>] who focused their attention also on emulsion design enabling the delivery of β-Car in complex food systems and fulfilling its benefits in functional foods. Lipid droplets in β-Car enriched O/W emulsions stabilized with surface-active chlorogenic acid-lactoferrin-polydextrose conjugate used as an emulsifier with the mean particle diameter of &lt;400 nm across the pH range 2–9 (except pH value around 6.0) exhibited better stability against droplet aggregation under simulated GI tract conditions (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) than other systems, which resulted in improved β-Car bioaccessibility, and such formulations could be potentially applied as protectors and carriers of hydrophobic drugs, supplements, and nutraceuticals [

Encapsulation of β-Car into solid lipid MPs of palm stearin stabilized with hydrolyzed soy protein isolate and containing α-tocopherol with the mean diameter of about 1.2 μm preserved approx. 75% of the encapsulated β-Car after 45 d of storage, and the formulation withstand treatments with higher temperatures (&gt;60 °C), while showing low stability after different ionic strength stresses [
