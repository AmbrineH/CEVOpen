<p class="p">DESs of Q, one of the most well-known flavonoids that was included in human diet long ago due to health benefits associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer activities as well as Q biological activities themselves, its chemical stability, metabolism, and positive impact on some cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (i.e., heart disease, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol) were overviewed by Wang et al. [

An extract of tartary buckwheat rich in flavonoids (TBFs) incorporated in spherical biocompatible lipid–polymer hybrid NPs of 61.25 ± 1.83 nm showed higher antioxidant activity and significant suppression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in RAW 264.7 macrophage compared to free TBFs and exhibited immune-enhancing efficacy in immunosuppressed mice, suggesting that such nanosystem loaded with TBFs is suitable for nutraceutical applications [

Nanoliposomes incorporating olive leaf extract containing high levels of phenolic compounds and oleuropein, showing antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, with average particle size 25–158 nm, negative charge, and EE 70.7–88.2%, which were supplemented to yogurt, improved its antioxidant activity, and no significant changes in color and sensorial attributes were observed, suggesting that olive leaf phenolics can be entrapped in nanoliposomes and could increase the nutritional value of products like yogurt [
