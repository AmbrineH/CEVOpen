<p class="p">Oxidative stress is able to generate an imbalance between the production and accumulation of ROS in cells and tissues and thus modify the ability of a biological system to detoxify these reactive products. ROS have several physiological roles (i.e., cell signaling), and they are normally generated as by-products of oxygen metabolism; despite this, environmental stressors (i.e., UV, ionizing radiations, pollutants, and heavy metals) and xenobiotics (i.e., antiblastic drugs) contribute significantly to ROS production, thus causing an imbalance that leads to cell and tissue damage (oxidative stress) [

However, these supplements should be used in accordance with recommendations of a conscious physician or health care professional to avoid their adverse effectâ€”pro-oxidant activity depending on the specific set of conditions (their dosage, redox conditions, the presence of free transition metals in cellular milieu) [
