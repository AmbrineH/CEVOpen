 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), depending on their reactivity and oxidizing ability. ROS participate in diverse chemical reactions (oxidative stress) resulting in the decomposition of biologically active compounds or biomolecules. Antioxidants that are able to protect other molecules from the damaging effects of such ROS can be used as excipients in formulations or as biologically active compounds preventing oxidative stress [

Bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, and vitamins showing antioxidant properties are suitable to be used for the fortification of food products to enhance their functionality, and therefore, encapsulation systems for the delivery of such nutraceuticals are necessary to overcome their low stability and bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B132-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. The choice of the appropriate encapsulation method is essential, because the modification of bioactivity (increase, preservation, or decrease) is affected by interactions established between the functional groups of the encapsulated compound and the encapsulating nanomaterial [
