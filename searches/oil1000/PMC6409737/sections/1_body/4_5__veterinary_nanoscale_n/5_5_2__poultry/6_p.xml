<p class="p">Investigation of the effects of SeNPs on performance, meat quality, immune function, oxidation resistance, and tissue Se content in broilers performed with 1-day old male Arbor Acres broilers showed that the supplementation of corn-soybean meal-based diets with 0.3–0.5 mg SeNPs/kg was found to be the best, and the maximum supplementation of SeNPs could not exceed 1.0 mg SeNPs/kg [
 <xref rid="B279-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>]. The adverse effects of oxidative stress in broiler chickens induced by 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide were attenuated when the animals received a diet supplemented with 0.3 mg SeNPs/kg. In stressed chicks fed with SeNPs, the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio was lower than in the groups, the diet of which was supplemented with bulk inorganic or organic Se, suggesting a higher effectiveness of SeNPs in the mitigation of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B280-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">280</xref>]. Supplementation of SeNPs (0.1–0.5 mg/kg) in broiler diets could improve growth performance, carcass components, and immune function of the animals, and no adverse effects on internal organs, other carcass parameters, and GI parts were observed. SeNPs dietary supplementation resulted in significantly improved weight gain and feed conversion ratio during the whole period of experiment (42 days) and more efficient energy and protein utilization compared to the control group [
