<p class="p">Cr utilization in 32 three-week-old broilers fed with a diet supplemented with Cr at the 1200g/kg level using CrCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, chromium picolinate (CrPic), and CrPic NPs decreased as follows: CrPic NPs &gt; CrPic &gt; CrCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> &gt; control groups, and significant differences between individual groups were estimated. When one-day-old broilers were fed with diet supplemented with the above-mentioned Cr compounds, the feed intake of 4â€“5 weeks showed better results in the CrCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> group compared to the CrPic group, while the LDL-cholesterol in the CrPic NPs groups was lower than in the CrPic group, and CrPic NPs and CrPic groups showed considerably enhanced serum Cr concentration compared to the control and CrCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups. Based on the above results, it could be concluded that the CrPic NPs supplementation has advantages compared to the bulk CrPic supplementation, because it not only increases Cr utilization but also results in a lower serum LDL-cholesterol level in broilers [
