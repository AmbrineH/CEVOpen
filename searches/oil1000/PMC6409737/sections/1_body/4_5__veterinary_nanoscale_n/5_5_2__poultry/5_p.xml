<p class="p">In white Leghorn laying hens (68-week old) receiving a diet supplemented with Zn-Met, bulk ZnO, and ZnO NPs reaching the level of 60 mg Zn/kg in the diet, pronouncedly higher Zn retention, serum GH concentration, and carbonic anhydrase activity were observed at the application of the ZnO NPs and Zn-Met compared to the control, and the ZnO NPs enhanced eggshell thickness as well [
 <xref rid="B241-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>]. Laying hens at 64 weeks of age fed with a basal diet supplemented with 80 mg/kg of bulk ZnO, ZnO NPs, and Zn-Met showed considerably higher egg production and egg mass as well as SOD activity in the liver, pancreas, and plasma when Zn-Met and the ZnO NPs were applied, while the greatest increase in eggshell thickness and shell strength was observed at the ZnO NPs application. The Zn supplementation resulted in reduced egg loss and lower MDA content and had a beneficial effect on serum total protein, Alb, glucose, alkaline phosphatase activity, carbonic anhydrase activity, and Zn level, which was reflected in an improved performance of laying hens. Due to the enhanced Zn absorption in the intestine of aged layers at the application of ZnO NPs, they could be considered as a more suitable source of Zn in diets than bulk ZnO [
 <xref rid="B277-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">277</xref>]. At the dietary supplementation of Zn-Met, ZnO, ZnO NPs or polyglutamic acid (PGA)â€“ZnO NPs reaching the level of 80 mg Zn/kg in the diet, increased Zn content in eggshells, serum Zn concentration, ghrelin and IgG levels of 64-week old brown layers were observed at the application of the ZnO NPs and the PGA-ZnO NPs, exceeding that observed at the application of bulk ZnO, and serum carbonic anhydrase activity and ghrelin levels were also increased compared to Zn-Met, suggesting that the ZnO NPs alone or in combination with PGA show beneficial impact on the Zn status of aged layers [
