<p class="p">AgNPs received in drinking water containing 1000 mg AgNPs/kg significantly reduced the body weights of the broilers after 42 days of administration, and this adverse effect could not be mitigated with a basal diet supplemented with Zn (60 and 120 mg/kg) and vitamin E (Î±-tocopherol acetate; 100 and 200 mg/kg). On the other hand, the increased activity of CuZn-SOD observed in AgNPs-treated broilers was not recorded in birds fed with the basal diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg vitamin E, suggesting its antioxidant effect. Moreover, Zn supplementing enhanced catalase and GPx activities in the jejunal mucosa resulting in increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the animals. Therefore, it could be concluded that the dietary Zn and vitamin E supplementation was able to attenuate intestinal oxidative stress in AgNPs-treated broiler chickens, although it did not mitigate the growth reduction caused by AgNPs [

They injected AgNPs, ATP, or a complex of AgNPs + ATP (AgNPs/ATP) in broiler eggs, and on day 20 of incubation, the embryos were evaluated. An increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and Na

Moreover, AgNPs also upregulated the expression of myogenic differentiation 1, affecting cell differentiation. Based on the above-mentioned findings, it could be concluded that an extra energy source in the form of ATP addition enhanced molecular mechanisms of muscle cell proliferation, and ATP and AgNPs could accelerate the growth and maturation of muscle cells [
