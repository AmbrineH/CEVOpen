<p class="p">The in ovo administration of NPs could be considered as a new method of nano-nutrition to supply an additional quantity of nutrients to embryos. ZnNPs, CuNPs and SeNPs supplemented in ovo at doses 20, 40, 60, and 80 μg ZnNPs/egg, 4, 8, 12, and 16 μg CuNPs/egg, and 0.075, 0.15, 0.225, and 0.3 μg SeNPs/egg (18th day incubation, amniotic route) did not show any adverse effect on the developing embryo and did not influence the hatchability, best feed efficiency being observed with 40 μg ZnNPs/egg, 4 μg CuNPs/egg and 0.225 μg SeNPs/egg. Moreover, the application of 12 μg CuNPs/egg resulted in considerably higher breast muscle percentage [
