In another experiment, which was carried out with 126 one-day-old broiler chickens from day 1 to 35 post-hatching, the in ovo application of Cu enhanced the final body weight, average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio compared to control animals and resulted in a considerable improvement in energy and nitrogen utilization, mainly for CuNPs application. The CuNPs treatment also reduced cholesterol, urea, and glucose levels in the blood [

The supplementation of a Cu deficient basal diet of chickens with CuNPs in drinking water to the level of Cu exceeding the National Research Council (NRC) recommendation by 54% resulted in the increased antioxidant potential of the organism and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Antioxidant and immune defenses of chickens were simultaneously increased in chickens receiving diet supplemented with CuNPs up to 12 mg per bird during 6 weeks of feeding, i.e., up to a level exceeding the NRC recommendation for growing broiler chickens at the most by 7%. It could be mentioned that at a higher CuNPs supplementation, a deterioration in red blood cell parameters and the stimulation of the immune system reflected in an increase in interleukin-6, immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgY was observed [
