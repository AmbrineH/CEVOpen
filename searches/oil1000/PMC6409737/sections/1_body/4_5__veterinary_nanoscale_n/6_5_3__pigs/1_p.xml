<p class="p">ZnO and Cu salts, traditionally used in high doses as supplements to piglet’s diet, stimulate piglet’s daily gain and decrease feed conversion factor. However, the application of high concentrations of these metal additives could result in increased environmental pollution of soil and tap water; on the other hand, Zn applied at doses 2500–3000 mg/kg feed can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance and may regulate the expression of genes that modify piglets’ immune response. Consequently, higher bioavailability which could be achieved by applying nanosized ZnO/Cu particles could notably reduce the dietary inclusion rate and environmental pollution with preserving beneficial impact on pig’s health [
