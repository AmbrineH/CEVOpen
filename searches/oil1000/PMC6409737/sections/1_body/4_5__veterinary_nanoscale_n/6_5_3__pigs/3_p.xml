<p class="p">Cr(III) belongs to essential elements in the nutrition of both animals and humans, and in many animal species its deficiency results in reduced feed intake, lower weight gains, reproductive disorders, and increased lipid levels, and a moderate Cr deficiency represents a risk factor of ischemic heart disease with myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Cr improves lean body mass in animals, increases growth rate and feed conversion, and improves feed intake and energy efficiency, and the dietary Cr requirement of an animal body is probably 300 μg Cr/kg d.w. of feed. A pronouncedly increased Cr content in the blood, longissimus muscle, heart, liver, kidneys, jejunum, and ileum was observed in pigs receiving dietary Cr nanocomposite supplementation [

Dietary CrPic NPs supplementation at 400 ppb increased feed intake in finisher gilts during mid-summer and was able to improve some of the adverse effects of heat stress in pigs, through decreasing circulating cortisol levels [

Pigs with initial body weight of 66.10 ± 1.01 kg receiving basal diet supplemented with 200 or 400 μg/kg of Cr from Cr-loaded CS NPs (Cr–CS NPs) for 35 d showed increased carcass lean ratio and longissimus muscle area, decreased carcass fat ratio and backfat thickness as well as increased serum free fatty acids, lipase activity, and serum insulin-like growth factor I, while a decreased level of serum insulin was estimated. Moreover, decreased activities of fatty acid synthase and malate dehydrogenase and increased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase in subcutaneous adipose tissue were observed in treated pigs. These results indicate a favorable impact of Cr in the form of the Cr–CS NPs on growth, carcass characteristics, pork quality, and lipid catabolism in finishing pigs [

The control diet supplemented with 200 μg Cr from Cr nanocomposite pronouncedly reduced serum levels of glucose, urea nitrogen, triglyceride, cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acid, increased total protein, HDL, and lipase activity in finishing pigs with initial weight 64.8 ± 0.83 kg fed for 35 d, and considerably increased serum insulin-like growth factor I, while reducing serum insulin and cortisol levels. Moreover, it affected immune status in finishing pigs, which was reflected in notable increments of IgM and IgG contents in plasma [
