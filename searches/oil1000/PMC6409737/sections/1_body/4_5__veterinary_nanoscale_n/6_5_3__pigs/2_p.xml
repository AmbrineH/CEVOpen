<p class="p">The degree of the reduction of piglet diarrhea incidence observed with a low dose of ZnO NPs (600 mg Zn/kg) supplemented to the basal diet of weaning piglets was comparable with that observed with the dose of 2000 mg Zn/kg when bulk ZnO was used, which could be connected with improved intestinal microbiota and inflammation response in piglets at the ZnO NPs application. Moreover, the application of ZnO NPs could contribute to reduced Zn environmental pollution [
