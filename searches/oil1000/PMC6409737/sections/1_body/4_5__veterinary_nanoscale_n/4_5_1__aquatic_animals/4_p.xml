<p class="p">A 60-day feeding of red sea bream (
 <italic class="italic">Pagrus major</italic>) with CuNPs (2 mg/kg) or/and vitamin C (800–1200 mg/kg) improved its growth and health, and higher final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, protein gain, protein retention, feed intake, protease and bactericidal activities, and higher tolerance against stress than in controls was estimated as well. The feed and protein efficiency ratios and the body lipid content were considerably higher at treatment with 0/1200, 2/800, 2/1000 and 2/1200 mg CuNPs/vitamin C per kg, while the application of 2/800, 2/1000 and 2/1200 mg CuNPs/vitamin C per kg resulted in considerably enhanced body protein and higher tolerance against stress compared to the control was estimated as well [
