<p class="p">Nano-copper as a new growth promoter in the diet of growing New Zealand white rabbits was reported by Refaie et al. [
 <xref rid="B294-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">294</xref>]. Similarly, the male five-week-old New Zealand white rabbits fed with the basal diet supplemented with 60 and 30 mg ZnO NPs /kg diet had higher body weight, daily weight gain, daily feed intake, serum total protein, globulin, IgG, and SOD compared to control animals and rabbits fed with a diet supplemented with bulk ZnO (60 mg/kg diet), suggesting that traditional zinc sources in rabbit diets could be replaced by 30 mg ZnO NP/kg diet [

 <xref rid="B296-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">296</xref>] recommended the combined use of bulk and nanosized ZnO at ratio 1:1 in the dietary system of rabbitâ€™s farms ensuring dietary supplementation with Zn as an essential element but reducing adverse effects such as lipid peroxidation and oxidant stress induced by the whole dose of ZnO NPs. A complete overview of the used nanoscale veterinary dietary supplements is shown in
