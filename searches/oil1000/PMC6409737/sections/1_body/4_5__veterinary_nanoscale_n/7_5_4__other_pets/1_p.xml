<p class="p">Dried matrices of CS Cu chelate gels designed as a multimicronutrient feed additive for cattle were loaded with vitamin riboflavin. Following restricted rehydration in simulated rumen fluid, they exhibited sustained release of riboflavin without releasing Cu in these neutral conditions for up to 24 h, demonstrating Cu rumen bypass. A sustained release of the mineral was observed in abomasal conditions of pH 2 over a 3 h period suggesting that this formulation could supply nutritionally relevant levels of the free mineral in these conditions, as required for effective supplementation in cattle [
