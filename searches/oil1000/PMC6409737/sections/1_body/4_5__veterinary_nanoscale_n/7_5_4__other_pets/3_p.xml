<p class="p">Improved rumen fermentation and feed utilization, stimulation of rumen microbial activity, digestive microorganisms, and enzyme activity by supplementation of SeNPs in basal diet of sheep with optimum dose approx. 3.0 g/kg dietary dry mater was reported by Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B292-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">292</xref>]. Using the rumen simulation technique, it was observed that nanoemulsified soyabean oil modulated the PUFAs proportions in ruminal cultures, which was reflected in markedly increased proportions of oleic acid, α-LLA, and α-LNA in the fermentation fluid without any negative effect on rumen fermentation parameters [
