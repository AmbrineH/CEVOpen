<p class="p">Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) are essential nutrients for animals and humans, because these metals occur in various metaloenzymes as co-factors [
 <xref rid="B239-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">239</xref>]. Zn is a nutritionally indispensable trace element that is required for normal growth, bone development, feathering, appetite regulation, metabolic functioning of nearly 300 biochemical enzymes, hormone production, cell division, protein and DNA synthesis for all avian species [
 <xref rid="B239-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">239</xref>,
 <xref rid="B240-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">240</xref>]; so, it can affect animals production and reproduction performance [
 <xref rid="B241-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>]. Zinc deficiency in animals caused a decrease in feed intake, growth, serum insulin-like growth factor-I, and growth hormone (GH) and lowered the hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor-I, GH receptor, and GH binding protein [
 <xref rid="B241-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B242-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">242</xref>,
 <xref rid="B243-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">243</xref>,
 <xref rid="B244-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">244</xref>]. In addition, Zn is used to decrease fermentation of digestible nutrients in intestines and improve nutrients digestibility and appetite. Dietary Zn supplementation stimulates feed intake probably caused by increased ghrelin secretion [
 <xref rid="B245-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. It was observed that it caused an increase in insulin-like growth factor expression in the small intestine mucosa [
 <xref rid="B246-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. Increased Zn concentration in the intestines influences their structure and function. The growth-stimulating properties of dietary Cu have been attributed to its antimicrobial action, however, it was shown that also intravenous injection of Cu to weanling piglets stimulated their growth [
 <xref rid="B247-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>]. It seems that the growth-promoting properties of high dietary concentrations of Cu complement its antimicrobial action [
 <xref rid="B248-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">248</xref>].
