<p class="p">Se is very important in animal nutrition, because it functions as an anti-oxidant assisted by vitamin E; e.g., Se is a cofactor of glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx), deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, selenophosphate synthatase, selenoprotein P, selenoprotein W, etc. Se deficiency can be a major problem that can be reduced or prevented by supplementation with inorganic or organic sources of Se. On the other hand, Se in high concentration is toxic to human and animal [

In the following subchapters, an attention is mainly focused on the beneficial effect of some inorganic NPs (Zn, ZnO, Cu, CuO, Se, Ag) and nanoscale formulations containing organic active compounds (e.g., essential oils, vitamins) on growth performance and some important biochemical parameters of aquatic animals, poultry, pigs and other domestic animals like cattle, sheep, and rabbits. Nanoformulations have also found their way into the fortification of animal feeds [
