<p class="p">As mentioned above for humans, nanoformulated DISs can also be applied for animals. In general, these veterinary DISs are regulated by the FDAâ€™s Center for Veterinary Medicine [

 <xref rid="B237-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>]. Therefore, many different products can be found for veterinary applications. For example, the use of clinoptilolite (natural zeolite comprising a microporous arrangement of silica and alumina tetrahedra) showing unique antibacterial properties as a DIS in food and unifying properties of an immunomodulator and nutraceutical could represent an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in animals of veterinary importance. Valpotic et al. [
 <xref rid="B238-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">238</xref>] focused their attention mainly on clinoptilolite potentials and limitations in cattle related to metabolic and endocrine status, oxidative stress, and systemic local inflammatory responses involved in reproductive and metabolic disorders of dairy cows.
