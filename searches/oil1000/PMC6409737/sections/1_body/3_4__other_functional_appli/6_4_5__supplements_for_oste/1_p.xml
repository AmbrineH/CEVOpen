<p class="p">Many supplements in pharmacies serve to prevent or mitigate the effects of osteoporosis. Calcium (Ca) has clearly been shown to have some positive effect on osteoporosis, although the bioavailability of Ca from classical preparations is approximately 10â€“15% [

Recently, a number of scientific teams investigated Ca supplementation by nano-Ca either as solid peroral DISs or as nano-Ca from the fortified milk. Experiments performed in vivo on ovariectomized (OVX) rats demonstrated much greater absorption (up to 89%) and overall bioavailability (up to 42%) of preparations with nano-CaCO
