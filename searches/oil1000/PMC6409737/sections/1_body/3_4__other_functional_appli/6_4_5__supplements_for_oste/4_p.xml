For example, chocolate cakes were fortified by 3%, 6%, and 9% of them, and the results indicated that with respect to the Ca content, texture and sensory properties of the cakes, 6% eggshell supplementation (i.e., increased Ca content to 816.8 mg/100 g) was the best [

The preventive effects of nanopowdered eggshell (NPES) on postmenopausal osteoporosis in OVX rats was also studied, and the results were surprising. NPES fed rats showed an increase in bone mineral densities (BMD) by about 7% compared to OVX rats. Only powdered eggshell led to an increase of BMD by 2%. Serum analysis showed that NPES fed rats had a 22.4% higher osteocalcin level than OVX rats. Therefore, NPES attenuated the bone loss induced by ovariectomy in rats [

High-calcium yogurt as food for combat with osteoporosis was prepared using its fortification with 10-nm crystals of NPES. The addition of NPES up to 0.3% gave cow and buffaloâ€™s milk yogurts with acceptable composition, textural properties and sensory attributes, and this additive increased the Ca content of yogurt by about 15% [
