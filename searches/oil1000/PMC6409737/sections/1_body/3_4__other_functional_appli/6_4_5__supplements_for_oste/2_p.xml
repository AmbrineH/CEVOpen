<p class="p">Ca alginate NPs (200â€“500 nm in diameter) loaded with collagen peptide chelated Ca with the average diameter of approximately 150 nm and the Ca content of up to 130.4 g/kg notably enhanced Ca absorption and significantly increased femur bone mineral density and femur Ca content in rats, suggesting that they could prevent Ca deficiency and could be used as a new Ca supplement in the food industry [

A nanocomposite of whey protein hydrolysate chelated with Ca showed superb stability and absorbability under both acidic and basic conditions, which was beneficial for Ca absorption in the GI tract of the human body. Its pronouncedly higher Ca absorption on Caco-2 cells compared with Ca gluconate and CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in vitro suggested a possible increase in Ca bioavailability and thus its potential to be used as DIS for improving bone health of humans [
