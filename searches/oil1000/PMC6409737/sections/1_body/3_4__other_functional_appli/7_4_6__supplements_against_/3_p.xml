Additionally, Srinivasu et al. prepared nano ferric pyrophosphate (particle size 10â€“30 nm) as a potential food fortificant in iron-deficiency anemia and found that the peroral bioavailability of ferric pyrophosphate NPs in rats, calculated using hemoglobin regeneration efficiency, was 103.02% with respect to the reference salt, ferrous sulfate, while the NPs did not show any significant toxicity [
