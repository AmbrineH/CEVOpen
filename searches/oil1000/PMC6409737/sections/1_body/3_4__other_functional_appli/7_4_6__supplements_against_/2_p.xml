<p class="p">The most promising preparation (iron hydroxide adipate tartrate: IHAT) showed ~80% relative bioavailability to FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in humans and, in a rodent model, IHAT was equivalent to FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> at repleting hemoglobin. Moreover, IHAT did not accumulate in the intestinal mucosa and, unlike FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, promoted a beneficial microbiota. In an in vitro study, IHAT was 14-fold less toxic than Fe(II) sulfate/ascorbate. The results of IHAT NPs observed from three-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Gambian children 6â€“35 months of age in relation to ferrous sulfate and non-inferiority in relation to placebo in terms of diarrhea incidence and prevalence confirmed the hypothesis that supplementation with IHAT eliminates iron deficiency and improves hemoglobin levels without inducing GI adverse effects [
