<p class="p">Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics could suppress enteric pathogens, because they can compete with pathogenic microbiota for adhesion sites, inhibit the growth of pathogens, or stimulate, modulate, and regulate the immune response of the host by initiating the activation of specific genes in and outside the intestinal tract. Moreover, it was also shown that probiotics regulate fat storage and stimulate intestinal angiogenesis [

Based on this technology, a wide range of microorganisms have been immobilized within semipermeable and biocompatible materials that modulate the delivery of cells [
