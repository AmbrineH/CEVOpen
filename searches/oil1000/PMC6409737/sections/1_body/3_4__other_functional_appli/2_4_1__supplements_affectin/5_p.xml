<p class="p">Probiotics are also affected by prebiotics apart from other things. Therefore, Peredo et al. [
 <xref rid="B173-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>] investigated the influence of natural prebiotics potato starch, 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago psyllium</italic>, and inulin co-encapsulated with alginate on the viability of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus casei</italic> Shirota and two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> Lp33 and Lp17. The results showed a higher encapsulation yield when 
 <italic class="italic">P. psyllium</italic> (94% for Lp17) and inulin (78% in Lp33) were used; 
 <italic class="italic">P. psyllium</italic> ensured a higher viability of the bacteria during storage at 4 Â°C and the best protection in GI conditions.
