<p class="p">Fermented soybean nanonutraceuticals administered to rats intoxicated with colchicine and showing impairment in learning and memory and decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) caused an increase of AChE activity (42%), a reduced activity of GSH (42%), SOD (43%), and catalase (41%), and decreased lipid peroxidation (28%) and protein carbonyl contents (30%), which suggests a possible neuroprotective efficiency of the nanonutraceuticals, and in addition, a significant amyloid-β and BACE-1 inhibition activity was demonstrated in an in silico study. The beneficial effect of the discussed nanonutraceuticals is associated with their strong antioxidant activity, and it could be assumed that they could also positively influence cognitive defects associated with Alzheimer’s disease [
