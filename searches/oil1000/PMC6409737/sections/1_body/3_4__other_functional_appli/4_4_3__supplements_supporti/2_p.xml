<p class="p">Encapsulation in bovine-milk exosomes could protect cargos against enzymatic and nonenzymatic degradation. RNAs encapsulated in exosomes could be delivered to circulating immune cells in humans, and some microRNAs and mRNAs in bovine-milk exosomes could regulate human gene expression and be translated into protein. Gene expression can be altered by low concentrations of dietary microRNAs through noncanonical pathways, such as the accumulation of exosomes in the immune cell microenvironment and microRNA binding to Toll-like receptors. In mice, the proliferation of intestinal cells was promoted by porcine-milk exosomes, suggesting that milk exosomes and their cargos could be used in human nutrition. Therefore, it was suggested that milk modified in this way could contribute to better mental, psychomotor, and functional development of infants [
