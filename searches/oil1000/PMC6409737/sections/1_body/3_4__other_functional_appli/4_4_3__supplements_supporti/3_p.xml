<p class="p">Natural compounds that are commonly present in foods and beverages are regarded as promising molecules in a nutraceutical approach associated with life-long healthy diets. An increased attention is devoted to food molecules that are candidates to enter clinical trials as such or after targeted molecular engineering and could have a beneficial effect on amyloid neurodegenerative diseases. Natural phenols abundant in healthy food products, such as green tea, red berries, extra virgin olive oil, red wine, and spices, could be considered particularly promising [

Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs encapsulating ginsenoside Rg3 (an important constituent of ginseng, playing a significant role in memory and improving cognition) and thioflavin T, which showed neuroprotective effects, were reported to be a theranostic material for the detection and treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease [
