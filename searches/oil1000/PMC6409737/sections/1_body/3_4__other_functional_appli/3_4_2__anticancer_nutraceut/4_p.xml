<p class="p">Biopolymer core-shell NPs consisting of hydrophobic protein (zein) as the core and a hydrophilic polysaccharide (pectin) as the shell fortified with CUR showing strong anticancer activity with the diameter of 250 nm, which were converted into a powdered form resulting in good water dispersibility, were reported to be suitable for incorporating CUR into functional foods and beverages as DISs, and pharmaceuticals [

Bioavailable NEs loaded with nutraceuticals (CUR and fresh and dry tomato extracts rich in lycopene) with the hydrodynamic size of NEs approx. 100 nm applied in combination with doxorubicin enhanced cell viability in cardiomyoblasts (H9C2 cells) by 35–40% compared to that observed in cardiomyoblasts treated with doxorubicin alone, provided protection against oxidative stress, inhibited the release of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, TNF-α, and nitric oxide by approx. 35–40%, and increased IL-10 production by 25–27% compared to cells without NE treatment. The best cardioprotective profile was showed by a lycopene-rich NE capable to effectively protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by reducing inflammation and lipid oxidative stress [
