<p class="p">A nanonutraceutical formulation of ω-3 PUFAs (fish oil) could effectively inhibit the release of ROS and reactive nitrogen species from human neutrophils and murine macrophages, the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and MCP1, and tumor-cell proliferation in FaDu head and neck squamous carcinoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells in in vitro cultures. The ω-liposomes, in which docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was formulated, could be used for intravenous delivery of fish oil fatty acids resulting in beneficial effects in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer [

It is known that DHA (ω-3 PUFA), a component of fish oil, suppresses rat mammary carcinogenesis, reduces cell growth, and induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines. An acid stable liposome formulation of DHA with the use of ether and phytanyl lipids similar in structure to those found in Archaea having the mean particle size of 137 ± 12 nm and a slightly negative charge was resistant to oxidation and stable over the pH range of 1.0–7.4 at 37 °C for two hours. Cell viability in MCF-7 cells and apoptosis in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were reduced more effectively by this liposomal formulation than by free DHA, suggesting that it could be potentially used in breast cancer prevention [
