<p class="p">Temporal improvements in vitamin D status by vitamin D supplementation resulted in an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and reduction of serum homocysteine concentrations suggesting that such treatment could reduce risk factors for CVD and may potentially contribute to the primary prevention of CVD [

Liposome-in-alginate beads were used to encapsulate the oyster hydrolysates showing antihypertensive effect to improve their bioavailability, protect them from degradation, and obtain sustained release; the release time of the oyster hydrolysate in the simulated GI fluid was up to 16 h [

Encapsulation of naringin, a flavonoid that occurs naturally in citrus fruits and possesses strong health benefits (recommended for the prevention of CVD and diabetes), in ternary NPs consisting of amylose, α-LLA, and β-Lglb resulted in a gradual release of naringin from the ternary NP–naringin inclusion complex in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, and ternary NPs effectively improved the bioavailability of bioflavonoid [
