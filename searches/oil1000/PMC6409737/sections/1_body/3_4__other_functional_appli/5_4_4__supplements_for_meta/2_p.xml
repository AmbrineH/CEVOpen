<p class="p">Using advanced proteomic and bioinformatic approaches, Kar et al. [
 <xref rid="B195-nanomaterials-09-00296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>] characterized the protein components of six different protein sources (casein, partially delactosed whey powder, spray-dried porcine plasma, soybean meal, wheat gluten meal, and yellow meal worm) and predicted the bioactive properties of these protein sources after in silico digestion with monogastric proteolytic enzymes. The tested protein sources were potentially rich in bioactive peptides, in particular, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and peptides with antioxidant properties, and could be used as alternative sources of protein in animal feeds for monogastrics.
