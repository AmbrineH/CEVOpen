<p class="p">To control the release of the anti-hyperglycemic agent fisetin for nutraceutical and/or therapeutic applications, an oral controlled release system consisting of polymeric NPs (140–200 nm) based on poly-(ε-caprolactone) and poly(lactic-
 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol-COOH encapsulating fisetin was designed, which protected and preserved the release of the active compound in gastric simulated conditions, controlled the release in the intestinal medium, and showed an improved α-glucosidase inhibiting activity of fisetin compared to that of the commercial formulation acarbose [
