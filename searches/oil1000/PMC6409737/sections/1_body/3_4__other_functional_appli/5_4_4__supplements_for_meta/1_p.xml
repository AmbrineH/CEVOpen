<p class="p">Sodium alginates could be used for the management of GI tract disorders and the attenuation of components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. They could also protect cells during transplantation from immune responses of the host, and, in combination with antacid alginates, be applied in the treatment of gastric reflux disease. Moreover, alginates decrease food intake by inducing satiety, increase weight loss in patients on a calorie-restricted diet, and reduce both glucose and fatty acid uptake, and a decrease in blood pressure by alginates in rat models of hypertension was reported as well [
