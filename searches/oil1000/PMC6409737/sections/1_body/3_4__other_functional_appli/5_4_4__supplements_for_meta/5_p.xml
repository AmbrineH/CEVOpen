<p class="p">Although natural nanosized clinoptilolite and/or metformin did not affect pronouncedly the levels of serum glucose, minerals, and lipid profile in rats with high-fat-diet/STZ induced diabetes, the co-treatment of clinoptilolite with the drug notably increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, while Cu and Ca levels increased only in the metformin group [

In STZ induced diabetic rats treated with nanosized clinoptilolite, blood glucose was found to decrease to near normal levels (12.4 vs. 27.5 mmol/L), but no significant impact on oxidative stress markers was estimated [

Nanosized clinoptilolite injected to STZ induced diabetic rats caused a partial improvement in their weight status and lack of undesirable effects, although beneficial changes in lipid profile were not detected, which could be connected with short study duration [
