<p class="p">Viscosity is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of liquids. A viscosity shift in a liquid medium can alter mixing efficiency, chemical reactions [

 <xref rid="B2-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Accordingly, monitoring of viscosity is an essential step to ensure good quality control. In the food industry, the chemical structures of cooking oil change after repeated heating (e.g., deep frying) likely due to increases in saturated fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B4-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Prior studies [

 <xref rid="B6-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] have also indicated that oil degradation is noxious to human health due to massive formation of free radicals. In biology, the viscosity of physiological fluids varies in different samples. For example, blood and tissues can alter their physiological viscosity in response to environmental stimuli. As a result, the baseline viscosity is treated as an important sign of normality [
