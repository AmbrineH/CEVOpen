 <xref rid="B16-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], have been deployed in many fields, but these devices are usually incapable of micro-volume (&lt;several tens of microliters) viscosity measurement. To address the technical obstacles, numerous innovative techniques have been developed over the past decade [
 <xref rid="B17-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], for example, reported a method of local viscosity measurement (&lt;30 μL) by evaluating the critical escape velocity of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bead trapped by an optical tweezer and found that the escape velocity has an inverse relationship with the liquid viscosity. However, the dynamic range of measurement of this technique was limited to low-viscosity liquids (&lt;1.6 mPa·s) due to weak trapping forces. In addition, operations of the optical tweezer relied on highly trained personnel. Similar work with an integrated optofluidic chip was also conducted by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Instead of trapping microbeads, they laterally shot single microbeads in a microchannel with optical fibers. In their study, fluid viscosities ranging from 1 mPa·s to 100 mPa·s and small sample volumes (&lt;1 μL) were achieved. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] proposed a micro-viscometer on a microchip with 10 array microchannels to achieve a wide-ranging shear rate; this device was used to estimate the dynamic viscosity of blood in different conditions, e.g., hematocrit. However, the microchip required flowing fluids and, thus, a large sample volume (at least several tens of microliters). Alternatively, Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] fabricated a MEMS-based cantilever resonant microsensor to measure viscosity by immersing the whole device in a sample fluid. The resonant frequency showed a tendency to decline with increasing viscosity. However, the measurement region of interest was limited by the size of the cantilever beam (~hundreds of microliters), and the moving part could disrupt the local viscosity by imparting the contact liquid with extra energy. Instead of developing contact measurement, a continuous and non-intrusive approach was proposed [
 <xref rid="B23-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] to monitor the time-varying viscosity of bacterial biofilms by simply combining video tracking with a semi-empirical flow model. Despite no external probes needed for targets, this approach lacked accuracy and could not be used in transparent media. In addition to intercellular liquids, rising endeavors have also been focused on the intracellular world due to the importance of single cell analysis. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] recently investigated the cellular microviscosity of 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> by time-resolved linear dichroism spectroscopy. The cytoplasmic volume in cells is roughly less than 1 pL. Myoglobins (cMbCO) in the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells were excited by a linearly rotated light, and the subsequent rotational diffusion time was detected. The final microviscosity of the cytoplasm was found to be roughly threefold higher than that of water. Despite the promising applications of the device in live cells, however, it was excessively sophisticated and relied on some special proteins. Similar techniques focusing on the microviscosity of cells can be found in the literature [

 <xref rid="B29-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Although intracellular viscosity measurement is not in the scope of our current study, researchers [
 <xref rid="B29-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] have successfully demonstrated the potential of Brownian motion based on particle tracking for cellular microviscosity. By injecting nanobeads into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, they achieved the study of intracellular viscoelasticity during cell division. According to their inspiring attempt, a similar study based on our platform can be realized in the same fashion by reducing the current Janus microbeads into nano-sized beads in the future.
