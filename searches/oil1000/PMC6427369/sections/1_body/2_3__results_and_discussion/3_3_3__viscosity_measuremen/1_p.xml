<p class="p">The proposed technology was applied to five oil products, including lubricant oil, baby oil, food oil, olive oil, and motor oil, to demonstrate its applications. Here, 1-μm Janus microbeads were mixed with all of the oil products before measurement. Surfactant (5% (

The change in viscosity of the oils before and after addition of the trace surfactant was negligible. The temperature of the microchip was maintained at 28.5 °C. Each oil sample was measured thrice, and only 2 μL was needed for each measurement. The measurement duration was increased to 50 s in response to the significantly increased viscosity of all oil products (

As predicted, the viscosities (lubricant oil: 1.7 cP, baby oil: 16.9 cP, olive oil: 74.0 cP, food oil: 97.5 cP, and motor oil: 434.5 cP) derived from the measured characteristic correlation times show comparable data with those (15.7, 56.0, 104.6, 112.2, and 409.2 cP, respectively) measured by the rotational viscometer (

The accuracy of calibration curve can be improved by increasing the number of measurement. Notably, surface tension only matters when Janus microbeads need to be resuspended in the oil media. As long as microbeads are well mixed with oil, translational and rotational Brownian motion is mainly dominated by viscosity according to both Stoke-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations. This reasoning was also supported by the good agreement between our diffusometer and the rotational viscometer as shown in
