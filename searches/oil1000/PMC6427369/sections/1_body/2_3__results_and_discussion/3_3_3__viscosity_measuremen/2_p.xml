<p class="p">Another evaluation was conducted to verify oil viscosity changes after heating at a high temperature. Prior research [
 <xref rid="B3-sensors-19-01217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] states that fatty acids in oil degrade after deep frying due to oxidation and polymerization. An increase in saturated fatty acid content, therefore, influences the physical properties of oil, such as its viscosity. The oil viscosity shift can serve as an indicator of the degradation of oil quality after heat treatment. Food oil and olive oil were selected for the degradation experiment. Both oils were heated in a frying pot on a hotplate at 1000 W for 10 min to a temperature above 100 Â°C. Smoke was observed. Both food oil and olive oil exhibit increases in viscosity from 35.4 and 59.8 cP to over 1325.2 and 123.6 cP, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01217-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c,d). Olive oil tends to undergo less extensive viscosity changes than food oil, thereby implying good stability during the high-temperature treatment. This finding is consistent with those in previous studies [
