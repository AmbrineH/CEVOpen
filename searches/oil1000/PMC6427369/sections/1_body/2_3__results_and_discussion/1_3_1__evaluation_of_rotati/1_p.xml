<p class="p">First, the time-elapsed correlation intensities of pure 1-μm PS and Janus microbeads were compared (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01217-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a). All correlation intensity values were normalized by the initial one for a better comparison. The Janus microbeads significantly outperform the pure PS microbeads in terms of SNR of correlation intensity. The intensity change of the Janus microbeads is nearly double that of the PS microbeads, and the intensity variation of the former is smaller than that of the latter. The overall results indicate that rotational Brownian motion measured from the Janus microbeads is the dominant signal in the correlation intensity. Subsequently, two Janus microbead sizes, 1 and 3 μm, were evaluated with the rotational diffusometer. Normalized logarithmic fitting curves are depicted here to show time-elapsed correlation intensity of both Janus microbeads (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01217-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b illustrate the microscopic fluorescent images of the beads. A crescent-shaped fluorescence can be explicitly observed in the 3-μm Janus microbeads, and the time-elapsed cross-correlation intensity of the 1-μm Janus microbeads shows a much steeper decline compared with that of the 3-μm Janus microbeads. The ratio of measured characteristic correlation times between the 3 and 1-μm microbeads is 21.37, which is close to the predicted ratio of 27 derived from Equation (4). While the decline in correlation intensity may be seriously compromised by a high viscosity or large bead size, the characteristic correlation time may still be found by extending the measurement duration. Considering that the 1-μm microbeads have a shorter correlation time in water, these beads were used for subsequent studies, unless otherwise mentioned.
