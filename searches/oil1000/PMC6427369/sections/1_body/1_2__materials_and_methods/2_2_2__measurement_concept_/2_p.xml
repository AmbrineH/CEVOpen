The final viscosities of other unknown samples were derived from the calibration curve. Subsequently, five oil products, including lubricant oil (DB, Gulf, London, UK), baby oil (Johnson’s, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), food oil (a combination of soybean oil, sunflower oil and rice oil; Neptune Gold, CALOFIC, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam), olive oil (García de la Cruz, Toledo, Spain), and motor oil (Active 20W-40, Castrol, Berkshire, UK), were evaluated by our rotational diffusometer and a commercial rotational viscometer (Rheolab QC, Anton Paar, GRAZ, Austria). Each oil product was measured thrice.
