<p class="p">According to the Stokes–Einstein–Debye relation, the Brownian motion of microbeads can directly reflect the viscosity of medium when the ambient temperature is well controlled. To this end, 1-μm Janus microbeads were thoroughly mixed with a test liquid medium in advance. Surfactant (5%,

Exactly 2 μL of the suspension was pipetted onto a glass slide. A glass cover was then placed on top of the suspension droplet with a spacer of 170 μm. A thin thermal couple was also inserted into the same droplet to monitor its temperature. By positioning the sandwiched suspension droplet under a fluorescent microscope (IX 71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 64× objective, a series of consecutive particle images were captured by a digital camera (Firefly MV FMVU-13S2C, Point Grey, Richmond, BC, Canada) at a frame rate of 23 Hz for 50 s (

Blinking signals measured from the Janus microbeads provided visual information of rotational Brownian motion.
