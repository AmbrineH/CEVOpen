<p class="p">Considering that microbead size can be a factor altering rotational Brownian motion, size uniformity must be carefully controlled in a rotational diffusometer. To fabricate uniform Janus microbeads with a diameter as small as 1 μm, we adopted the procedure of metallic half-shells [

Fluorescent PS beads 1 μm in diameter were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA, R0100, Excitation: 541 nm/Emission: 611 nm); the size variation of these beads was well defined below 5% coefficient of variation. First, a glass slide was treated with oxygen plasma to create a superhydrophilic surface to avoid the coffee-ring effect during evaporation. Second, a small drop of the microbead suspension was allowed to dry on the surface of the glass slide. Within 30 min, a well-spread mono-layer of microbeads formed on the slide. Next, a thin layer of 30 nm gold film was deposited on the mono-layer of microbeads via an e-beam evaporator. The Janus microbeads were subsequently harvested from the glass slide by sonication for 30 min and resuspended in water with 5% (

The concentration of the colloidal suspension significantly dropped after filtration. Finally, centrifugation was performed thrice to boost the concentration of the suspension up to 2 × 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01217-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, nearly half of the surface of the PS microbeads was covered by the metallic film, as expected. Despite irregular edges of the coating, the non-uniformity influenced only the visibility of blinking signal. The time-elapsed correlation intensity would not be seriously altered since the blinking frequency was not shifted. In addition, the random variation was mitigated when more microbeads were put into calculation. As a result, averagely 40–70 microbeads were analyzed in each image to overcome the uncertainty for each data point. The elements on the microbeads were examined by X-ray spectrometry (EMAX HR, Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan), and the small fraction of gold shown in the table of elements in

No chemical interactions between the gold film and liquid media were observed. The shelf life of Janus microbeads was more than weeks according to our observation. In addition, the gold surface provides an ideal substrate for future biological modifications.
