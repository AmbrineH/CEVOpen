<p class="p">Micro-volume viscosity measurements have long been a challenging task in many fields because existing viscometers cannot provide an appropriate solution. This study presents a rotational diffusometer using Janus microbeads to estimate oil viscosity. The Janus microbeads were fabricated by depositing a thin gold film on the half-surface of fluorescent PS microbeads and produced blinking signals in response to different media according to the Stokes–Einstein–Debye relation. A plot of time-elapsed correlation intensity was fitted to an exponential curve to enable calculation of the characteristic correlation time of the measured data. Compared with translational Brownian motion, rotational Brownian motion was proven to enhance the SNR of correlation intensity. A calibration curve covering the viscosity range from 0.8 cP to 574.8 cP was then obtained from glycerol–water mixtures. Five common oil products, including lubricant oil, baby oil, food oil, olive oil, and motor oil, were investigated, and their viscosities were determined by our diffusometer to be 1.7, 16.9, 74.0, 97.5, and 434.5 cP, respectively; these values are comparable with those measured by a commercial rotational viscometer (15.7, 56.0, 104.6, 112.2, and 409.2 cP, respectively). When food oil and olive oil were heated at a high temperature above 100 °C for 10 min, their viscosities increased from 35.4 and 59.8 cP to 1325.2 and 123.6 cP, respectively. These viscosity increases imply an increase in saturated fatty acid composition, resulting in degradation of oil quality. Olive oil appeared to be more invulnerable to high temperatures than food oil due to its lower viscosity shift. Evaluations suggest that the proposed rotational diffusometer can be a promising tool for micro-volume viscosity monitoring of Newtonian fluids.</p>
