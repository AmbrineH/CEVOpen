 <p> Conceptual illustration of the proposed rotational diffusometer and experimental setup. The rotational diffusometer is implemented with bead-based sensors made up of Janus microbeads ( left). Only a small drop (2 Î¼L) of Janus microbead suspension is required to be sandwiched between two glass slides before each measurement. A real image showing the microchip alongside a ruler displays its actual dimensions ( middle). A fluorescent microscope is used to visualize the blinking Janus microbeads and acquire a series of particle images for computation of rotational Brownian motion ( right). </p>
