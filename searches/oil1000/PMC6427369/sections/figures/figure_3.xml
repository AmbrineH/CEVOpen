  <p class="p">Fabrication procedure of the Janus microbeads. The flow chart is narrated in an order from the top to the bottom. A glass substrate is firstly treated with oxygen plasma to enhance hydrophilicity. Next, a drop of fluorescent PS suspension is dried on the glass slide to form a mono-layer of microbeads by self-assembly. A thin film of gold (30 nm) is deposited on the top of the mono-layer of microbeads by E-beam evaporation. The SEM image and X-ray spectrum confirm the gold coating on the microbead. At last, Janus microbeads are collected from the glass substrate by sonication and purified through a filtering process.</p>
