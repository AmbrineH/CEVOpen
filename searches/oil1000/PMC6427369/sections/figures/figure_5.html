 <p> ( a) Time-elapsed correlation intensity of glycerolâ€“water mixtures of different ratios. The water contents of these mixtures ranged from 1% to 100% ( v/ v). The error bars are standard deviations obtained from data points measured from three different sites in the same medium. ( n = 3) ( b) Calibration curve of characteristic correlation time versus viscosity. The error bars represent standard deviations obtained from data points measured from three independent glycerol-water solutions. ( n = 3). </p>
