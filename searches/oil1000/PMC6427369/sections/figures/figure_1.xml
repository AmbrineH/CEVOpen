   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Illustration of rotational Brownian motion in response to viscosity and bead size changes. Both bead size (top row) and viscosity (bottom row) result in translational and rotational Brownian motion changes. As demonstrated, the increase in the bead size or in the viscosity reduces Brownian motion of microbeads and vice versa. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Schematic of the cross-correlation algorithm. In the algorithm, each image is divided into multiple interrogation windows to facilitate computation. A pair of particle images (captured at different time frames) can yield a correlation function to express the degree of instantaneous Brownian motion.
