 <xref rid="B124-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Changes of up to 13.5 dB in the transmitted optical power were detected on exposure to different concentrations of acetone and dichloromethane vapours. The sensing mechanism relied on the measurement of the decrease of the transmitted power through the tapered fibre caused by a vapour-induced RI change of the coating.
