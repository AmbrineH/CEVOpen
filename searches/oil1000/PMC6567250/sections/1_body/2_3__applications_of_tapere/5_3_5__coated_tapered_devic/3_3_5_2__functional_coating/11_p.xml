<p class="p">A hydrogen sensor based on the change in absorption of the evanescent field in a 12 nm thick Pd-coated single mode tapered fibre was reported [
 <xref rid="B125-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B126-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. The sensorâ€™s sensitivity was adjustable by means of the taper diameter, interaction length, and/or the wavelength of the light coupled into the fibre. The sensor was capable of detecting hydrogen concentrations below 4% and had a response time of less than 100 s.
