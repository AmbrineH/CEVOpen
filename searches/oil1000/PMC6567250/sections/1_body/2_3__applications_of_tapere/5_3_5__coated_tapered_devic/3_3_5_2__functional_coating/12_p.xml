<p class="p">A multimode tapered optical fibre modified with a 15 nm-thick Pd thin film was used to detect H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The power transmitted thought the Pd-coated taper (50 μm diameter and 10 mm length) increased when the sensor was exposed to a 2% concentration of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B125-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Pd films are susceptible to cracking on repeated exposure to hydrogen, which degrades the performance of the sensor. It has been shown that this can be overcome by using Pd–Ag alloy thin films [
 <xref rid="B127-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. Another hydrogen sensor was demonstrated by depositing a 150-nm-thick Pd coating over an FBG written in a 50-μm-diameter tapered optical fibre. The sensing head was able to detect H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in the range 0–1% (v/v) H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at room temperature. A maximum sensitivity of 81.8 pm/% (v/v) H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was attained, with temperature compensation that was achieved by employing a second FBG inscribed in the un-tapered section [
