<p class="p">A humidity sensor was demonstrated by coating a tapered single-mode fibre (taper waist of 11 Î¼m and length of 1 mm) with a humidity sensitive nanofilm composed of Poly(Diallylmethilammonium chloride) (PDDA) and the polymeric Dye R-478 (Poly-R), deposited using the electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) technique [

 <xref rid="B119-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. The sensitivity of the device was shown to depend on the optical thickness of the coating, allowing the sensitivity to be optimised by ensuring that it corresponded to the highest slope of the transmitted optical power [
 <xref rid="B115-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. The sensing mechanism was based on the measurement of the intensity change induced by the RI change of the humidity sensitive coating. The authors showed that tapers coated with films of higher RI exhibited higher humidity sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B115-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>], as did tapers with thinner waists. The response time of the device was shorter than 300 ms, making this device a candidate for use for the monitoring of human breathing [
