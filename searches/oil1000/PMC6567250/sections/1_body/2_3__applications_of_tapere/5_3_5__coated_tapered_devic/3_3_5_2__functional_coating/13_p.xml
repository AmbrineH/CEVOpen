<p class="p">A pH sensor was demonstrated by depositing a nanoscale coating of a quinolinium dye onto a tapered optical fibre using the Langmuir–Blodgett technique [
 <xref rid="B8-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. It was shown that sensor performance depended on the diameter of the tapered region, with the sensitivity to pH found to be ΔpH = 5 × 10
