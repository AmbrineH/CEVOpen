Three tapered silica optical fibres, uncoated and coated with metallic (Al or Cu) and dielectric layers (TiO2), were used to determine the presence of oil and hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) in water. The principle of operation was based on the measurement of the RI change induced by the presence of the HNSs. The three tapers with their different coatings were used to cover the wide range (1.329–1.501) of the RI change associated with the pollutants. Several uniform-waist tapers were manufactured with the following geometrical values: total length: 18.3 mm; transition length: 10.98 mm; waist length: 6.34 mm; diameter waist: 40 μm. These tapered devices were coated then with the different coatings to cover the wide RI range (1.329–1.501). Although sensors lacked selectivity toward specific pollutants, the work demonstrated the ability to detect oil and HNS spills in seawater.
