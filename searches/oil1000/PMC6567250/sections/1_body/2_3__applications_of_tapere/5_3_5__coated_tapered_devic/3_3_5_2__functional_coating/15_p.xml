<p class="p">The functionalization of optical fibre modal interferometers based on MZI and MI configurations have been investigated [
 <xref rid="B132-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. To endow the sensor with chemical functionality, the surfaces of the fibres were modified with self-assembled polyelectrolyte layers (chitosan (CS)/polysodium styrene sulfonate (PSS)), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f022" class="xref">Figure 22</xref>. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was immobilized on the polyelectrolyte layer and anti-immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) molecular binding events were monitored through measurement of wavelength shifts of the channelled spectra of the interferometers. The proposed immunosensors exhibited anti-IgG detection sensitivities of 27.37 nm/(ng/mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and 5.91 nm/(ng/mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) with concentration detection limits of 0.181 and 4.941 nM for the MZI and MI sensors, respectively. The specificities of the sensors were investigated using correlated/non-correlated anti-IgGâ€“IgG pairs.
