<p class="p">Tapered optical fibres can also be used as optical probes to measure parameters of interest with spatial resolution on micrometre scales, allowing the direct probing of biological specimens at the cellular level [
 <xref rid="B129-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. In a typical fabrication procedure, the end of the optical fibre is tapered to produce a tip with submicron dimensions onto which a thin metal film is deposited, yielding a submicron-sized transmissive aperture at the apex of the probe tip [
 <xref rid="B129-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Such optical fibre tips are used in photon scanning tunnelling microscopes or, when modified with functional materials, to measure chemical and biochemical reactions in microscopic environments [
 <xref rid="B130-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. pH sensors of micron and submicron dimensions were developed by immobilising a fluorescent pH sensitive reagent, fluorescein, within a glass film which was deposited on the surface of the fibre tip using a sol-gel process. The probe was used to measure the pH of the intracellular environment of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells [
 <xref rid="B130-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. A similar approach was used to develop a pH optrode, using a pH sensitive reagent, 2’,7’-Bis(2-carbonylethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, immobilized onto the end-face of taper in a thin xerogel layer [
 <xref rid="B131-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. The sensor was employed for local detection of pH in samples simulating native conditions of plant cells, with the measurement based on pH induced changes of fluorescence-intensity spectra. Indium-tin oxide or aluminium coated fibre probes were successfully tested over a pH range from 5.0 to 7.0.
