<p class="p">The LbL method was used to deposit a multi-layered porphyrin film onto the tapered region of a single mode (Corning SMF28) optical fibre with the aim of demonstrating an ammonia sensor [
 <xref rid="B9-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The coating was composed of alternate layers of tetrakis-(4-sulfophenyl) porphine (TSPP) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). Exposure of the PAH/TSPP coated non-adiabatic tapered optical fibre with a waist diameter of 10 μm to ammonia induced significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the optical fibre. The changes in the coating RI modified differentially the effective indices of the two dominant modes excited in the taper, resulting in a change in phase of the channelled transmission spectrum. The sensor showed a linear sensitivity to the concentration of ammonia in the range of 10–100 ppm, with response and recovery times of order 100 s. The 3σ limit of detection (LoD) was estimated to be ca. 2 ppm. Tiwari et al. [
