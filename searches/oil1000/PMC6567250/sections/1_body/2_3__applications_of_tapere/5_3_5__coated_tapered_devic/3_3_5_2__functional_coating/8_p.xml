<p class="p">An optical fibre humidity sensor working in reflection mode was demonstrated with a multimode fibre taper spliced between an FBG and the input single mode fibre (Corning SMF28). The taper region was coated with a layer of polyvinyl alcohol that was sensitive to water vapour, while the FBG acted as a reflective filter, reflecting the optical signal back into the taper [
 <xref rid="B120-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Exposure to humidity caused changes in the RI of the coating, with a concomitant change in the transmission of the light signal. The measurement sensitivity was enhanced by passing the light through the taper twice. A maximum sensitivity of 1.994 μW/%RH was demonstrated within the measurement range of 30–95% RH, with a taper waist diameter of 50.2 μm. The average response time was ∼2 s and the measurement was nearly insensitive to temperature with negligible 8 nW change of optical power when temperature changed from 20 to 100 °C.
