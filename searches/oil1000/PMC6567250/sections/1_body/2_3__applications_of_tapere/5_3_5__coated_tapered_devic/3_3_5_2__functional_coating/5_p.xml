<p class="p">In a similar design rabbit anti-goat IgG was immobilised onto an optical fibre taper to provide selectivity towards (tetramethyl rhodamineJisothiocyanate)-labelled goat IgG. The design of the taper proposed by the authors provided a uniform fluorescent signal return along the fibre’s length [

 <xref rid="B113-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. From fluorescence measurements, the optimum diameter of the coned part of the taper was found to be 35–48 μm for multimode fibres. The mono- and di-protonated forms of free-base porphyrin have distinct fluorescence spectra. This phenomenon was employed to demonstrate a pH sensor operating in the pH range 0.6–3.8.
