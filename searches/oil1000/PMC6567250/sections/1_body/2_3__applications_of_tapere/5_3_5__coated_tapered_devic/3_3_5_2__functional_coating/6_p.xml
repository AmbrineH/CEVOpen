 <xref rid="B114-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. The principle of operation of the device is based upon changes in the RI of the polymer layer deposited onto the non-adiabatic taper region of a single mode fibre (Corning SMF28) (tapered region radius is 5.0 μm and a taper elongation of 2.5 mm and an assumed coating thickness of 3.75 μm), which cause a change in power transmitted. An increase in the transmitted intensity was observed when sensor was exposed to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas, while the opposite effect was observed for exposure to NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. The sensitivity of the device increased with the increment of the taper beat length, which is determined by the difference in propagation constants of fundamental and higher order modes, with the response times measured to be in the range of seconds.
