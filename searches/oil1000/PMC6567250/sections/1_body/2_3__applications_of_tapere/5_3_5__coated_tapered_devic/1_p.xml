<p class="p">It should be noted that the refractometers reported in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-sensors-19-02294" class="xref">Section 3.3</xref> were not selectively sensitive. To create a chemically or bio-selective sensor, a thin film that can change its optical properties in response to the presence of the particular analyte has to be deposited onto the surface of the optical fibre.
