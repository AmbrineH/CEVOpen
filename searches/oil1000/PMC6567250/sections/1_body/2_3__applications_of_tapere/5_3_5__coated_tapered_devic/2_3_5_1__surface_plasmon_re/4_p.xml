 <xref rid="B94-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] proposed a more complex approach with a multi-tapered fibre optic SPR sensor, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f021" class="xref">Figure 21</xref>. The sensitivity was found to increase with increasing number of tapers (from one to eight) and with decrease in taper period from 2.15 to 1.15 mm. An RI sensitivity of 2 Ã— 10
