<p class="p">Tapered optical fibres facilitate a strong interaction between the propagating modes and the surface plasmon wave generated when the taper is coated with a layer of gold. A number of tapered fibre SPR sensors have been demonstrated. Dı´az-Herrera et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] studied SPR sensors based on doubly deposited uniform-waist tapered fibres (DLUWTs) in which the coating deposited onto the tapered fibres consisted of a metal layer and a dielectric layer. The sensitivity of the DLUWT was shown to be enhanced by increasing the roughness of the optical fibres prior to deposition of the double coating, providing a larger surface area to which to attach the ligands [
