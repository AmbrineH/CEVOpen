 <xref rid="B95-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>], simulated the behaviour of a tapered fibre sensor in which two identical tapered fibre regions are formed around the metal-coated uniform section of the multimode core sensing region. The study showed that a probe geometry where the ratio of the radii of the fibre core at the input and output ends of the taper lies between 1.5 and 2.0 provided the best performance, with a predicted sensitivity of 15 Ã— 10
