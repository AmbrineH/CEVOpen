The principle of operation of the sensor was based on the evanescent wave excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), the collective oscillation of conduction electrons confined to metal nanoparticles, whose resonance frequency has been shown to be dependent strongly on the particle’s size, shape, composition, and on the dielectric properties of surrounding medium. The sensing strategy relies on the measurement of the transmission intensity change due to the evanescent field absorption of the gold nanoparticles immobilized on the tapered fibre surface. The RI resolution was 3.2 × 10
