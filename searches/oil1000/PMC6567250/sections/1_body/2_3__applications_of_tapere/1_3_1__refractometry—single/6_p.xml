<p class="p">Tapered optical fibres can be used for the quasi-distributed sensing of RI, using optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to interrogate an array of tapered sections created in series in a single optical fibre. Changes in the attenuation of the Rayleigh backscattered signal from the tapered regions were used to monitor the RI of the surrounding medium. An analysis of the performance of the system showed that, for tapers of diameter 50 Î¼m, up to nine tapers could be multiplexed using commercial OFDR instrumentation [
