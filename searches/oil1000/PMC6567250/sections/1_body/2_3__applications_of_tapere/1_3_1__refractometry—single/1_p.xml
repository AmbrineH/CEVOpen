<p class="p">Refractive index is a fundamental property of any material, which depends on environment parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity and concentration of any chemicals present. The measurement of RI can provide valuable information about these important environmental parameters. It should be noted, that measurements of the RI does not allow to discriminate what chemicals are present in the medium. </p>
