<p class="p">As was mentioned above, generally, two parameters of the transmission spectrum can be measured to reveal information on changes of the external RI; the wavelength shift of the interference features in the transmission spectrum of a non-adiabatic taper, or the attenuation (radiation losses) of the light transmitted through the tapered waist. Typically, the performance of optical fibre refractometers is tested in the 1.333–1.360 range, corresponding to the typical refractive indices of biological fluids. Villatoro reported a sensor based on surrounding-refractive-index-induced radiation losses in a tapered multimode optical fibre with a waist diameter of 60 μm, which was capable of measuring RI in the range 1.36–1.46, with a limit of detection below 10
