<p class="p">Modal interferometers based on non-adiabatic tapered optical fibre (NATOF) sensors can be used to measure changes in the RI of a solution, and thus the concentration of an analyte, without specificity, by monitoring changes in the phase of the channelled spectrum. For instance, a taper of diameter 7 μm was used to measure the concentration of D-glucose in deionized water. The limit of detection of the NATOF was 55 ppm for D-glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 mg/mL, and the limit of detection of the RI measurement corresponding to these concentrations, which lay in the range from 1.3330 to 1.3447, was 8.2 × 10
