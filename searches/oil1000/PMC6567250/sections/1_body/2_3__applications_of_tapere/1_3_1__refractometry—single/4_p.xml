<p class="p">NATOF sensors can also be used to monitor RI changes induced by bio-molecular interactions in biological systems. The response of an NATOF was used to show that the interactions of various groups of amino acids (AA), such as L-alanine, L-leucine and L-cysteine with D-glucose, sucrose and water molecules, depend on functional groups such as OH, H, CH
