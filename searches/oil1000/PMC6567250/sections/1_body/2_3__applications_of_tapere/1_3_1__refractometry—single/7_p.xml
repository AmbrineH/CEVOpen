<p class="p">The sensitivity of tapered optical fibre refractometers can be improved by deposition of a mesoporous coating of silica nanospheres onto the surface of the taper via covalent immobilization [
 <xref rid="B63-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The sensitivity enhancement was attributed to the coupled effects of Mie scattering and multimode propagation. The presence of the scattering centres increases the power fraction of the evanescent wave and thus the interaction of the light with the surrounding medium, providing higher sensitivity as compared with non-scattering tapers [
 <xref rid="B63-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The effect of the taper dimensions on sensor performance was studied and the sensitivity was improved by two orders of magnitude when a taper (thickness 2.8 Î¼m and length 14 mm) was coated with a 400-nm thick film of silica nanospheres as compared with unmodified taper [
