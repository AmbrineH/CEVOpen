<p class="p">FBGs are generally insensitive to the RI of the medium surrounding the fibre cladding, unless fabricated in tapered optical fibres or in sections of fibre in which the cladding is thinned. FBG based refractometers can be interrogated by monitoring changes in the reflected wavelength or changes in the reflectivity. The intensity of the Bragg reflection from an FBG fabricated in a taper of diameter 30 μm was used to measure changes in the RI of the ambient environment as low as 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> RIU over a range of 1.450–1.456 RIU. A 150 pm shift of the Bragg wavelength was observed in response to an increase of the RI from 1.450 to 1.456, providing measurements with a resolution of 5 × 10
