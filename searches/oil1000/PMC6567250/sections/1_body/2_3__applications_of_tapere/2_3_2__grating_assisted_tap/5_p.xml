<p class="p">One of the significant advantages offered by FBGs is the ability to wavelength-division-multiplex a serial array of FBGs in a single length of optical fibre. This was exploited to measure RI by splicing a tapered multimode fibre between two lengths of single mode fibre (SMF, Corning SMF28), each of which contained an FBG, as illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>) with different Bragg wavelengths were used for signal demodulation. Changes in the RI influenced the attenuation of the tapered section of the fibre, which modified the intensity received from FBG2. The intensity difference between the two FBG signals was used to determine the change of RI of the medium surrounding the multimode fibre taper (MFT). Monitoring the Bragg wavelengths allowed the temperature to be measured. Experimental results showed that the sensor possessed a tailorable sensitivity to the change of the external RI by controlling the taper waist diameter [
