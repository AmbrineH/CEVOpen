<p class="p">Mach–Zehnder-like interference effects have been observed when LPGs with period larger than 300 μm were inscribed in a tapered fibre with a waist diameter of 25 μm. The devices exhibited a RI resolution of ±8.5 × 10

The fabrication of a pair of identical, cascaded LPGs separated by a section of optical fibre to create an in-fibre Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) has been investigated for sensing applications. The light coupled into the cladding by the 1st LPG is recoupled into the core by the 2nd LPG to interfere with the core mode, creating the interferometer. The sensitivity of such devices to changes in the surrounding RI can be increased if the section of fibre separating the LPGs is tapered, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>, as the RI sensitivity of the cladding modes’ effective indices is enhanced [
