<p class="p">The combination of gratings with tapered fibres offers the prospect for the flexible design of devices with enhanced capabilities. The resonance bands in the transmission spectra of LPGs are inherently sensitive to the surrounding RI by virtue of the dependence of the resonance wavelength on the effective index of the cladding mode to which coupling occurs. The sensitivity of the LPG’s transmission spectrum to changes in surrounding RI can be increased by fabricating the LPG in the tapered region of an optical fibre [
