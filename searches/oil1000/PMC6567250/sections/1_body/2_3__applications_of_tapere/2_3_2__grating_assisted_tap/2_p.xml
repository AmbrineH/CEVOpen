<p class="p">It is also possible to create modal interferometers by combining LPGs with tapers. For example, an LPG fabricated in a section of tapered optical fibre can be used to excite selectively cladding modes that subsequently interfere at the second transition region with the light that propagates through the core. This produces a channelled spectrum within the envelope of the resonance bands of the LPG, such as that shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>. Rather than relying upon the fabrication of small diameter NATOFs, such modal interferometers can be created in tapers of larger diameter, which can be easier to fabricate and be more robust. An LPG with a grating period of 400 μm and of length 5 cm was fabricated in a biconical fibre taper with 34 μm diameter and 3.2 cm length made from standard step-index optical fibre, producing the channelled spectrum illustrated in
