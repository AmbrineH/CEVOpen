<p class="p">By cascading two waist enlarged structures that facilitate coupling and recoupling between the fibre core mode and the cladding modes, a simple and low-cost MZI was demonstrated (

 <xref rid="B157-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. The first waist enlarged structure coupled the core mode to cladding modes, while the second recouples the light from the cladding modes into the core mode, producing a high visibility channelled spectrum. For an interferometer of length 22 mm, the temperature sensitivity of the device was 46.8 pm/°C and the strain sensitivity was 14 pm/με. Using a similar configuration, sensitivities of 57.5 pm/°C and 1.02 pm/με for temperature and strain, respectively, were achieved [
