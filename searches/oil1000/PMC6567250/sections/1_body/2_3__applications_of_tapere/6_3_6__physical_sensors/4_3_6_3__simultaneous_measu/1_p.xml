<p class="p">As mentioned previously, the inscription of a grating within a taper section of optical fibre, or the tapering of a region already containing a fibre grating, can facilitate multi-parameter measurements, where two or more parameters are measured using the same device. Generally, the principle of simultaneous measurement of two or more parameters utilises the difference in sensitivity of the sensor to these parameters. A simple matrix operation allows determination of the desired parameters.</p>
