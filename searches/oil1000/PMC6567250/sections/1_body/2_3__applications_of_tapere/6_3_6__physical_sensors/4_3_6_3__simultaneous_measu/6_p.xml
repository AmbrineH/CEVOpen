<p class="p">In another example of the use of MI, the simultaneous measurement of axial strain and temperature was demonstrated by introducing a 20 × 4 μm spindle-shaped spot produced by a femtosecond laser and located 30 mm away from the fibre taper (with the diameter and length of 60 and 600 μm respectively) in a standard single-mode optical fibre. The spot in the optical fibre can be regarded as a Mie scattering centre where the fundamental core mode will be scattered into higher order cladding modes. This results on the interference between the light coupled by taper and light coupled to higher order modes by a spindle-shaped spot. The experimental results indicate axial strain sensitivities of −1.0 and −1.2 pm/με (blueshift) and temperature sensitivities of 81.3 and 98.8 pm/°C (redshift) at 1513.4 and 581.2 nm, respectively, corresponding to two interference orders [
