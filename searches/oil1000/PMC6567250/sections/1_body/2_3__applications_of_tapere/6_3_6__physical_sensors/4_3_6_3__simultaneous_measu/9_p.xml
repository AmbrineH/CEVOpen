<p class="p">It was shown that it is possible to measure simultaneously three parameters, such as RI, force and temperature, by monitoring different interference peaks of the transmission spectrum of an MZI based on a tapered hollow core optical fibre [
 <xref rid="B91-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. The sensor demonstrated an RI sensitivity of about 7041.21 nm/RIU in the range of 1.4406∼1.4458, a stress sensitivity of −6.26 nm/N in the range of 0∼1 N and a temperature sensitivity of 9.8 pm/°C in the range of 30∼100 °C.
