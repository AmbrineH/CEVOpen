<p class="p">An MZI with a length of hundreds of microns was demonstrated based on an S-tapered fibre (SFT), shown in

 <xref rid="B162-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. The dependence of the spectral characteristics of the SFTs on the axial offsets and diameters has been studied. An SFT with an axial offset of 114 μm and a taper waist diameter of 54.6 μm was found to exhibit the best sensitivity to RI, with a sensitivity of 2066 nm/RIU in the 1.407–1.421. The strain sensitivity was –183.4 pm/με when the axial offset of the SFT was 138 μm and the taper waist diameter was 65.0 μm. By embedding S-tapered optical fibres into a polydimethylsiloxane patch, such that the patch transduced a transverse load into an axial strain, measurement of load and temperature with sensitivities of −29.03 nm/N and −2.17 nm/°C were reported.
