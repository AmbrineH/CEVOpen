Bragg fibres are cylindrical waveguides consisting of a low-index core surrounded by concentric rings of material with alternating high and low RI, acting as a cylindrical Bragg mirror. The sensitivity was 22.68 pm/με and 185.10 pm/deg to strain and angle, respectively. Another interesting approach to the measurement of several parameters simultaneously employed a heterogeneous multicore optical fibre, where in one fibre there are several cores, each having different propagation properties [
 <xref rid="B164-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>]. Tapering such a fibre allowed the demonstration of a temperature sensitivity of 47.37 pm/°C for the central core and 53.20 pm/°C for the outer core, with a strain sensitivity of 1.10 pm/με for the central core and 0.84 pm/με for the outer core. Different spatial channels (cores) in heterogeneous multicore fibre have dissimilar responses to the outer environment allowing multiparameter measurements. Using temperature-strain matrix, the measured relative errors were estimated to be less than 5%.
