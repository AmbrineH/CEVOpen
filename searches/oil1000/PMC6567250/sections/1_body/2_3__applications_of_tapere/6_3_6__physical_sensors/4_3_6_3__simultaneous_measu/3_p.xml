<p class="p">FBGs have been combined with tapers to facilitate the measurement of temperature and strain by writing the FBG in a linearly etched fibre that provided information encoded in the peak wavelength and in the spectral width of the FBG. The spectral width of the grating depended uniquely on the applied strain and was temperature independent. An uncertainty of ±15.26 and με ±1.92 °C was achieved [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f026" class="xref">Figure 26</xref>. In the first configuration, FBGs of uniform period were fabricated in the untapered and tapering sections, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f026" class="xref">Figure 26</xref>a. The effective index of the propagating mode changes along the tapering section, introducing a chirp to the grating and broadening the Bragg spectrum, while the change in diameter offers a variation in strain sensitivity along the grating length, allowing an applied strain to influence the chirp. The second sensing head consists of FBGs written the two tapering regions, where these regions have different taper angles, providing a larger difference in the strain sensitivity of the structure. The second structure offers a higher sensitivity compared to the first sensing head with strain and temperature sensitivities determined to be 1.81 ± 0.03 pm/με and 9.67 ± 0.09 pm/°C, respectively [
