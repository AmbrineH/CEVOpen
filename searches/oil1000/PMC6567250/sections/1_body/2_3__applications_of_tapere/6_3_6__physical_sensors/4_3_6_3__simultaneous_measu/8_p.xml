<p class="p">The use of an MZI realized in a tapered single-mode optical fibre was proposed for the measurement of RI and temperature [
 <xref rid="B161-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. The features of the channelled spectrum shift with changes in the surrounding RI and temperature. Simultaneous measurement of RI and temperature with corresponding sensitivities of up to 26.087 nm/RIU (blueshift) and 0.077 nm/°C (redshift) was achieved. In other work, the RI and temperature sensitivities for a device comprising two bi-tapers and an LPG were 108.16 nm/RI and 0.12 nm/°C, respectively [
