<p class="p">Simultaneous measurement of strain and temperature was demonstrated using a periodically micro-tapered fibre grating (period of 1.3 mm and the diameter of the tapered region was 76 mm), where the resonance wavelength was blue-shifted and the transmission decreased with increasing strain, while the opposite was observed for increasing temperature. Consequently, it was possible to discriminate the influences of strain and temperature with the sensitives of –0.55 nm/με and 49.6 pm/°C by measuring the resonant wavelength and the transmission with the sensitives of −0.32 dB/ με and −0.01 dB/°C [
