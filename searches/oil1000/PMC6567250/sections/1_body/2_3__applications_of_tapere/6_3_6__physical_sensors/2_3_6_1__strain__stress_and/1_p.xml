<p class="p">Tapers with different taper angles were formed in multimode fibres that were subsequently embedded into glass fibre reinforced epoxy composites. The light transmission characteristics were measured as a function of applied stress. The stress sensitivity of a tapered optical fibre with a 5Â° taper angle was found to be 0.04 V/GPa. The light intensity transmitted by optical fibre had a linear response as a function of applied stress for different taper angles and the stress sensitivity was shown to increase exponentially with the increase of the taper angle [
