<p class="p">A noncontact displacement microfibre sensor using a U-shaped adiabatic tapered fibre was proposed with the sensitivity of 0.2 dB/mm operating over the range from 0.6 mm up to 12 mm at a minimum tapered diameter of 8 μm [

 <xref rid="B146-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. The transmission spectrum of the interferometer was measured under different transverse pressures and with the loading at different locations along the interferometer. The spectra were analysed using a fast Fourier transform with the amplitude and spatial frequency of different peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum corresponding to different cladding modes can be utilized to evaluate local fibre geometry deformation. The sensitivity to lateral compression distance was found to be determined by the fibre taper structure (such as waist diameter and its length) with values of 9.996 × 10
