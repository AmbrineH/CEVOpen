<p class="p">A similar approach was used to develop an optical fibre inclinometer [
 <xref rid="B144-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>] based on an FBG inscribed in a tapered region of an optical fibre with a measurement range of 0°–90° tilt and an accuracy of ca. 1°. A sensitivity of −4.49 nm/° was achieved using an abrupt taper cascaded with a waist enlarged taper [
