A change in the bending radius induces a change in the path length of the higher order mode and hence a phase shift between the fundamental and higher order modes. It is possible to control the parameters of the MI, such as its sensitivity and mode coupling conditions, by adjusting the bend- radius. A microfibre taper with a 1.92 μm-waist diameter was optimized by changing the bending radius to minimize the spectral shift of the sensor arising from temperature changes. Through modelling it was shown that the temperature dependence of a locally bent microfibre taper relates strongly to the microfibre taper waist diameter and that it is possible to minimize the temperature dependence over a diameter range from 1.84 to 2.06 μm. The transmission spectrum exhibited a sensitivity of 102 pm/μm.
