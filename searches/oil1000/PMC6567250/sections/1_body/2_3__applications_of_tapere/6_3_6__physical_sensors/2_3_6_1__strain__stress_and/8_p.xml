<p class="p">Interferometric measurement configurations can also be implemented using PCF. A tapered PCF interferometer and a microhole-collapsed PCF interferometer have been used for the detection of interaction forces generated in surgical devices, the key feature is that they use of PCF means that they are inherently immune to the influence of ambient temperature variation [
 <xref rid="B148-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. The devices were used for force characterization in laparoscopic scissor and standard surgical scissor blades. It was found that PCF-instrumented surgical blades outperformed blades fitted with the FBG sensors during static load measurement, with the strain sensitivity of 1.68 pm/με for PCF sensor and 1.2 pm/με for the FBGs.
