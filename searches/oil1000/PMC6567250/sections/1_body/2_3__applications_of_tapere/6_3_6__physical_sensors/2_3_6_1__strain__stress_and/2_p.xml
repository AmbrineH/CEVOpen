<p class="p">FBGs inscribed in the waist of tapered fibres offer specific attractive properties for force-sensing applications. A small-diameter fibre reduces its influence on the mechanical properties of the structure for embedded measurements. For tensile forces, the sensitivity scales inversely with the fibre cross-sectional area and it is possible to increase the force sensitivity by several orders of magnitude as compared to FBG sensors in conventionally sized fibres [
 <xref rid="B140-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. For tapers with a diameter of 3.5 μm, a force sensitivity of 1900 nm N

Due to the small axial stiffness of such tapers, tapered FBGs would be suitable for measurements within thin substrates or in materials of small Young’s modulus, or for the measurements of small forces.
