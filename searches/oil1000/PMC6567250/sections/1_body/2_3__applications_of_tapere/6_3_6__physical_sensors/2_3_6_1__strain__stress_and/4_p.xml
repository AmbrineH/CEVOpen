<p class="p">A fibre taper Michelson modal interferometer consisting of an adiabatic taper of diameter 80 μm located 30 mm from cleaved end of the fibre, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f023" class="xref">Figure 23</xref>, was investigated as a bend sensor in [
 <xref rid="B142-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. The bending angle was determined by passive interrogation of the interferometer by generating two quadrature phase-shifted signals from two FBGs with appropriately selected resonant wavelengths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f023" class="xref">Figure 23</xref>). Optical phase-to-bending sensitivity of 0.3 rad/degree and a bend angle resolution of 0.014 degree/√Hz were achieved.
