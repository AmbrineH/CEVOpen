<p class="p">A fibre optic sensor composed of identical FBGs written on the either side of a tapered cavity was used for temperature independent strain measurement. The sensor possesses two spectral peaks within its main Bragg reflection band acting as an interferometer due to a phase difference between the light reflected by the two gratings. The normalized power difference between the two peaks changes linearly with applied strain but is independent of temperature variation. The accuracy of this particular sensor in measuring strain was estimated to be ±29 με in a range of 1200 με [

 <xref rid="B53-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] demonstrated a pressure sensor based on an LPG fabricated using arc discharge to create periodic tapers in a standard single mode fibre, which had a sensitivity of 5.1 pm/bar, an order of magnitude greater than that of a standard FBG.
