<p class="p">An optical fibre MZI consisting of two waist enlarged tapers with a temperature sensitivity of 0.070 nm/°C for a 7.5 mm long interferometer was reported by [
 <xref rid="B149-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. A strain sensor was demonstrated using a MZI composed of two abrupt single-mode fibre tapers exhibiting a sensitivity of 2000 nm/ε similar to that of LPG sensors, but simpler to manufacture [
 <xref rid="B150-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. An MI can be built with tapered large mode-area microstructured optical fibre (MOF). Such a fibre had the following parameters: core diameter of 11 m, average hole diameter of 2.7 μm, average hole spacing (pitch) of 5.45 μm, and outside diameter of 125 μm. The tapering was used to collapse the air holes such that, in the taper waist, the fibre was transformed into a solid unclad multimode fibre. This allows the coupling between the fundamental HE
 <sub class="sub">11</sub> MOF mode and the HE
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> modes of the solid fibre. The interferometer was used to demonstrate a wavelength-encoded temperature sensor, showing a linear response over a temperature range from 200 to 1000 °C [
 <xref rid="B151-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. An S-tapered fibre MZI created in an all-solid photonic bandgap fibre was used to measure temperature in the range of 20–80°C with a sensitivity of 49.52 pm/°C and low sensitivity to strain of 0.455 pm/με [
 <xref rid="B152-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Measurement of temperatures up to 800 °C was demonstrated by splicing a thin core optical fibre to a length of SMF and fabricating an up-taper at the splicing point, forming an MI sensor. A sensitivity of 0.140 nm/°C was achieved in the range of 30–800 °C.
