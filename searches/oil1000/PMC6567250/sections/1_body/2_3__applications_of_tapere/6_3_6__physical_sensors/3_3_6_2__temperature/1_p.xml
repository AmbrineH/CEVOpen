<p class="p">An LPG induced in a tapered optical fibre attached to a heated metal grating, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f025" class="xref">Figure 25</xref>, was studied [
 <xref rid="B57-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The temperature and RI sensitivities were enhanced compared with LPGs of the same period fabricated in standard optical fibres, and the unusual spectral response of decreasing phase-matching wavelength with respect to increasing grating period and temperature was observed. The temperature and RI sensitivities were measured to be 0.24 nm/Â°C and 650 nm/RIU, respectively.
