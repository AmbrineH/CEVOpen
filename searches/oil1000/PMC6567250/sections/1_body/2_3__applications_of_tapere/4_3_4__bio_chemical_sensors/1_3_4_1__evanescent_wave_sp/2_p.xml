 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), the transmission spectrum of a non-adiabatic tapered single mode optical fibre consists of a channelled spectrum, arising from the interference of modes excited in the taper, as well as the absorption spectrum of the surrounding medium. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f018" class="xref">Figure 18</xref> shows changes in the central wavelengths of the channelled spectral features of the taper’s transmission spectrum (taper diameter 10 μm, length 25 mm) in response to the change of the RI of a solution of Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate Porhine (TSPP), arising from an increase in concentration, as well as the decrease of the intensity at 700 nm corresponds to the concentration induced changes in the absorption of the TSPP compound. The absorption spectrum of TSPP solution measured using a conventional dual pass spectrometer is also shown in
