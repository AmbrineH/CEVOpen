<p class="p">The first example of the use of a tapered optical fibre sensor for fluorescence spectroscopy was reported in 1996 [
 <xref rid="B98-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. The output from an argon ion laser was coupled into the proximal end of a single mode optical fibre with the cut-off wavelength of 450 nm (SM450), which was tapered at the distal end to a diameter of 1 Î¼m. The fabricated probe was modified with the fluorophore compounds (affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG-(H+L) fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate or affinity-purified goat anti-human IgA (alphachain specific)-tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) conjugate). The fluorescence was excited by the 488 or 514 nm lines of the output from an argon-ion laser that passed through a mechanical chopper. The fluorescence from the bound fluorophores was coupled into the guided mode of the taper. The device offered high sensitivity, 75 pg/mL, and a simple immobilization protocol.
