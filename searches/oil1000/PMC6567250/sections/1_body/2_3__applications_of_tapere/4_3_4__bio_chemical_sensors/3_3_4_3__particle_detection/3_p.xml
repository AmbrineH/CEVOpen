 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f020" class="xref">Figure 20</xref>a. The sensor consists of a taper of diameter 8 Î¼m and length 3 mm. The sensing method is based on monitoring the transmitted light power, which shows abrupt jumps as single particles bind to the taper surface. The operation of the sensor was demonstrated with polystyrene nanoparticles of radii 120 and 175 nm, as show in
