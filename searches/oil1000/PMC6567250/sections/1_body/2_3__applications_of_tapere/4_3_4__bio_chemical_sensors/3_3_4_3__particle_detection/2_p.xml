 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f019" class="xref">Figure 19</xref>a, where a particle is in contact with the waist of a fibre taper. The light scattered by the particle from the evanescent wave of the light propagating through the taper is collected in a direction transverse to the optical fibre and the Raman spectrum is analysed. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f019" class="xref">Figure 19</xref>b shows an image of a typical experimental configuration, where a 2 μm diameter polymer microsphere is adhered to a fibre taper of 1 μm diameter. The particle was delivered to the taper by another fibre mounted to a three-dimensional stage and was held in place on the surface of the taper by van der Waals forces.
