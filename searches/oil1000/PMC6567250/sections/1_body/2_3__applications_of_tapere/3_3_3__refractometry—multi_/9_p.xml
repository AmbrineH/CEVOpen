<p class="p">Abrupt tapers and connector-offset attenuators have been proposed as mode-coupling devices to transfer optical power between core and cladding modes in an optical fibre and to create modal interferometers. The devices were assessed as RI sensors by monitoring the wavelength shifts of features in their channelled spectra [
 <xref rid="B79-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Given a wavelength resolution of 10 pm, an RI resolution of 10
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’4</sup> RIU was reported, similar to that of a cascaded LPG-based MZI.
