 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f014" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>) and an embedded down-stretching-bitaper (DSBT), where the waist enlarged tapers excited high-order cladding modes and the DSBT enhanced the evanescent field, was proposed by [
 <xref rid="B21-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. By employing the interaction between the strong evanescent field of the high-order cladding mode and the ambient environment, an RI sensitivity of 86.565 nm/cm/RIU was achieved over the RI range from 1.3332 to 1.4140. This sensitivity is about an order of magnitude higher than that of waist-reduced taper-based in-fibre MZIs [
