<p class="p">A temperature-independent refractometer based on an MZI fabricated by sandwiching a tapered photonic crystal fibre (PCF) of length 29 mm between two standard telecommunications SMFs, with the air holes of the PCF fully collapsed in the fusion spliced regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref>), was investigated [
 <xref rid="B80-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. It was found that tapering the PCF greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the refractometer. A maximum sensitivity of 1529 nm/RIU was achieved over an RI range from 1.3355 to 1.4130. The refractometer was found to be nearly temperature-insensitive due to the ultra-low temperature sensitivity of the PCF. In a similar configuration, a sensitivity of 1600 nm/RIU was reported, which is nearly eight times as high as that of an un-tapered PCF interferometer [
 <xref rid="B81-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] and 20 times higher than that reported for an S-tapered PCF interferometer [
 <xref rid="B82-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. A recently reported MZI based on PCF for RI sensing achieved a sensitivity of 1426.70 nm/RIU in the range of 1.3917–1.4204 [
 <xref rid="B83-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] and 281.6 nm/RIU in the range of 1.3333–1.3737 [
