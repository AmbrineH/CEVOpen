<p class="p">A similar configuration was used to implement an in-fibre Michelson interferometer (MchI) for RI measurements [
 <xref rid="B71-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In the proposed MchI design, a single taper and a mirror at the tip of the optical fibre are employed. The modes excited in the cladding by the taper and the propagating core mode are reflected by the mirror and then recombine at the taper section. The experimental results show that a change in the RI of 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> caused a phase shift of ∼1.35° in the demodulated signal, given the use of an abrupt taper MchI with a sensing length of 20 cm.
