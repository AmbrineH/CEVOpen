 <xref rid="sensors-19-02294-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the performance parameters of the tapered optical fibre based refractometers discussed here. Due to a lack of consistency in the characteristics that are reported in the literature, it is difficult to compare directly different sensors configurations in terms of their performance parameters such as sensitivity, resolution and response time. For example, only one paper [
 <xref rid="B60-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] reports on the response time. In general, modal interferometers have a higher sensitivity than grating based taper devices and single taper devices. The highest reported sensitivity was 7041.21 nm/RIU [
 <xref rid="B91-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>], but this value was achieved for RIs close to the RI of the cladding. The best RI reported resolution in the biologically relevant RI range was 8.2 × 10
