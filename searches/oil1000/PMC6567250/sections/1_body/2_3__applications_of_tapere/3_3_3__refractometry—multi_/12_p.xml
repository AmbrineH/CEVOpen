The principle of operation is based on the interference of the fundamental mode with the higher order modes excited by the tapered region of the PCF, where the air holes are collapsed. Since the circularly symmetric character is changed by the imposition of the S-shape, more high-order modes may be excited within the S-tapered section as compared to the straight tapered PCF. On the other hand, the collapsed section is so short that the fundamental mode retains a great part of the total optical power. The S-taper also increases
