<p class="p">The combination of tapered optical fibres with fibre loop ring down technology was reported by Wu [
 <xref rid="B87-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. The sensing principle is based on the dependence on the external RI of the ring-down time, referred to as the time when the light intensity

 <xref rid="B87-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. In another configuration, a Sagnac loop, in combination with a reflective tapered fibre coupler, was used to measure RI [
 <xref rid="B88-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. The sensor showed a sensitivity of 3617 nm/RIU for measuring RI in the range 1.33–1.41.
