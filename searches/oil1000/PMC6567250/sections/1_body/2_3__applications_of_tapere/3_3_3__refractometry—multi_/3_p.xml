<p class="p">Microanalysis systems for early diagnosis and treatment of diseases, or for the detection of a single physiological cell or small specimens such as human embryonic stem cells, require a cellular-dimension sensing technique. Fibre sensors capable of detecting index variations of picoliter (pL) volume specimens therefore offer a promising platform [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>, with a device length of 179.5 μm and consisting of two micro-abrupt-tapers in a cladding-reduced strongly-guiding fibre, was proposed for extremely low volume RI measurements. The cladding of the fibre was etched chemically before being irradiation by a focused CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> laser beam that heated and softened the section of the optical fibre to create a periodic structure. The RI sensitivity was 4000 nm/RIU measured at a wavelength of 1.61 μm over a RI range in the region of 1.45 with a liquid volume of 65.5 pL. Immersion of the sensor in a 72 pL volume of a glucose solution of concentration of 200 mg/mL was shown to cause a red-shift of the channelled spectrum of 0.8 nm and 8 nm with sensitivities of 600 and 4000 nm/RIU at wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.6 μm, respectively [
