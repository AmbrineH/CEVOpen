<p class="p">An interferometric refractometer with variable sensitivity was constructed by placing a single-mode non-adiabatic tapered optical fibre sensor into a fibre loop mirror [
 <xref rid="B76-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The adjustment of the polarization state of the light input to the tapered region, via polarization state controllers (PSCs) inserted in the loop, allowed the excitation of different cladding modes in the taper, resulting in different optical paths for the clockwise and the counter clockwise beams. By variation of the PSCs’ settings, the RI sensitivity of the sensor over the range 1.3380–1.3510 RIU could be tuned from 876 to 1233 nm/RIU.
