<p class="p">The practical application of a tapered RI sensor was explored recently by Ghahrizjani [
 <xref rid="B89-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>], who demonstrated the measurement of engine oil quality and the time of oil expiration. The oil acts as the external medium for this sensor, and any changes in quality, particle size, and pollution of the oil will influence the optical properties such as the optical power output. By comparing the optical powers between fresh and used oil, the quality of the oil was predicted. Bending of an optical fibre containing two identical tapers at different angles increased the sensitivity to the RI change [
 <xref rid="B90-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. It was shown that sensitivities of 106.4 and 126.15 nm/RIU were observed at 45° and 90° bending angles, respectively, for RIs in the range 1.333–1.359.
