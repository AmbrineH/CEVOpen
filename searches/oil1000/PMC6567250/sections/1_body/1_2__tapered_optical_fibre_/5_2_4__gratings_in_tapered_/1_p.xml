<p class="p">Introduction of the periodic modulation of the refractive index inside the core of the optical fibre by exposure to a spatially modulated intensity pattern from a UV or femtosecond laser creates a diffraction grating, which can be used for sensor development. Generally, optical fibre grating sensors are classified as fibre Bragg grating (FBG) (reflection type gratings;
