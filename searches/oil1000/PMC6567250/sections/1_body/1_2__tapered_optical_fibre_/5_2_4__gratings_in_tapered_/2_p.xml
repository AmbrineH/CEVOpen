<p class="p">Optical fibre grating sensors are sensitive to parameters that can influence the period of the grating or RI of the fibre. Fibre Bragg grating sensors are typically sensitive to strain and temperature [

 <xref rid="B51-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Since in FBG all optical power remains in the core they are generally not sensitive to RI. To sensitise FBGs to the surrounding RI, an access to the EW needs to be obtained and this can be achieved by polishing, etching or tapering optical fibre. Changes in the surrounding RI induces the Bragg wavelength shifts and modulates the reflected power [
