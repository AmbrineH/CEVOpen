<p class="p">A further approach to LPG fabrication, in which the tapered section of an optical fibre is embedded into a polymeric periodic structure using soft mold-replica lithography has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B56-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] or side-contacted with metal grating [
 <xref rid="B57-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. It was observed that the best performance (−1.328 nm/°C and 21 nm/RIU) obtained for polymeric structures is when a 10 mm long grating with the period of 400 µm, and a waist diameter of 20 µm is used. An advantage of the polymeric grating over metallic is the flexibility of fabrication, which allows for the optical fibre to be embedded in the grating and eliminates needs of further adjustments [
