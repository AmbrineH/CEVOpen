<p class="p">In the typical SPR configuration, the so-called Kretchmann arrangement, a prism coated with a metal layer is employed, creating a sensor that requires bulk optics and expensive mechanical parts. Optical tapered fibre based SPR, in which a tapered fibre optic is coated with a thin metal film, offers advantages over the standard SPR configuration owing to its small size, light weight and automatic alignment, with no compromise in terms of sensitivity and overall sensor performance [
