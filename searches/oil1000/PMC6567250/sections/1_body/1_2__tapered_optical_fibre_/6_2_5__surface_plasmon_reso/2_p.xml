<p class="p">The analyte-induced change in optical parameters at the interface between the gold coating and the surrounding medium modulates the resonant coupling of incident light to the propagating surface plasmon wave [
 <xref rid="B59-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The existence of the surface plasmon wave is dictated by the electromagnetic properties of the metal (typically gold or silver)â€“dielectric (sample medium) interface [
 <xref rid="B59-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The characteristics of the resonant coupling provide information about compounds bound to the metal layer. This information is tracked by monitoring either the wavelength at which coupling occurs at a fixed angle of incidence, the angle of incidence at which coupling occurs at a particular wavelength or the intensity of the light at a fixed angle and wavelength.
