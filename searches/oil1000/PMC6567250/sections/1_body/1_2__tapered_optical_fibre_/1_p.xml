 <xref rid="B37-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The first approach exploits detection of the light losses within the tapered region, which can be caused by both the change in spectral properties of the analyte and RI of the surrounding medium [
 <xref rid="B38-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The second method utilises interferometric method in which the change of the effective refractive indices of the modes propagating through the taper, is measured by using mode coupling devices such as in-fibre gratings, surface plasmon resonances [
 <xref rid="B39-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and lossy mode resonances [
