<p class="p">For some of the modes in an optical fibre, the guidance conditions are not satisfied owing to the reduction of the size of the cladding and the core diameters caused by the tapering of the optical fibre, resulting in radiation losses, i.e., leakage of these modes from the fibre into the surrounding medium. The magnitude of the radiation losses depends strongly on the RI of the surrounding medium. This mechanism has been employed for the development of an RI sensor with a resolution of 7 × 10
