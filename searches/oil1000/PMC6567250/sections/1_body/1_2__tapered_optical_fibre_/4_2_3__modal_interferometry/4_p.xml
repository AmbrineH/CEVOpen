<p class="p">In general, two interrogation approaches can be employed for tapered optical fibre sensors: (i) measurement of the dependence of the amplitude of the signal on the particular measurand [

 <xref rid="B48-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It should be noted that first approach requires a reference measurement to compensate for any drift in the light source intensity and for any losses induced by the bending of the optical fibre.
