<p class="p">Modal interferometry (MI) is a sensitive and powerful approach in sensor development that exploits the interaction between lower and higher order modes in the fibre region. Those modes propagate with different effective refractive indices and respond to the analyte differently resulting in the change in phase that is measured on the mode recombination. </p>
