<p class="p">Depending on the taper geometry, optical fibre tapers can be divided into adiabatic and non-adiabatic types: if the angle of the taper transition region is small and the cylindrical symmetry of the optical fibre is retained, resulting in most of the optical power remaining in the fundamental mode the tapers are considered adiabatic; if the optical power is coupled into higher order modes the tapers are non-adiabatic tapers. For non-adiabatic tapers of diameter less than 10 Î¼m, the linearly polarised, LP
