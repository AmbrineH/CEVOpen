<p class="p">The spectroscopy and hence chemical composition of the surrounding medium can be analysed simply by detecting the transmitted light by coupling the output from the distal end of the optical fibre into a spectrometer. It is important to match the parameters of the light source and spectrometer such as emission wavelength and sensitivity range with the absorption properties of the particular compound that needs to be detected. Typically, the absorption features of environmental pollutants are located in the infrared and mid-infrared spectral range (2.5–10 μm) which limits the application of silica optical fibres since they are not transparent in this spectral window. The low attenuation of chalcogenide glasses in the infrared region, where specific absorption features of organic molecules are located, makes the use of the low losses of tapered chalcogenide optical fibre attractive for evanescent wave spectroscopy [
