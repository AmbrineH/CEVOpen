 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02294-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the “heat and stretch” approach to tapered optical fibre fabrication. The polymer buffer coating (typically acrylate) is removed from a section in the middle of a length of optical fibre using a mechanical stripper or suitable solvent. The optical fibre tails on either side of the section to be tapered are then fixed on translation stages. The buffer coating-removed section is exposed to the heat source while the fibre tails are pulled in opposite directions. Using this approach, optical fibre tapers of different diameters with well-defined taper waists can be fabricated. The optical characteristics of a tapered optical fibre are determined by the taper diameter and by the geometry of the taper transition region. If the transition regions satisfies the adiabaticity criteria, which requires that the taper transition length is longer than the beat length between the fundamental and 2nd order modes and thus a lower angle taper [
 <xref rid="B19-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], there is no energy coupling to higher order modes. Such adiabatic tapers are characterised by low losses and single mode operation. In non-adiabatic tapers, where this criterion is not satisfied, the coupling of light to higher order modes increases the losses of the taper, and also introduces features into the transmission spectrum that are caused by interference between the propagating modes, which can be used for sensing applications.
