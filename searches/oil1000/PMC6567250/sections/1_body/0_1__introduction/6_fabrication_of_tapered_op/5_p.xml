<p class="p">It has been shown that, for a given heating profile, the shape of a tapered fibre is independent of the material properties and the stretching conditions applied at the fibre ends [
 <xref rid="B25-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Thus, control of a taperâ€™s shape can be achieved simply by using different heating profiles, achieved for example by scanning the heat source along the section of the fibre to be tapered.
