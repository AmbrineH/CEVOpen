<p class="p">One of the simplest methods for the fabrication of optical fibre sensor elements is based on the tapering of a relatively short section (of length ranging from sub-millimetre to tens of millimetres) of the optical fibre. This provides access to the evanescent wave (EW) of the mode propagating through the tapered region, facilitating interaction with the surrounding medium and allowing the measurement of parameters such as RI or chemical composition. A tapered optical fibre consists of a region of fibre with reduced and uniform diameter (the waist) that is bounded by conical sections where the diameter of the fibre changes to merge the tapered section with the unperturbed surrounding fibre. The optical properties of the tapered fibre waveguide are influenced by the profile of the conical tapering sections, by the diameter of the taper waist and by the RI of the surrounding medium. The proportion of the power in the EW, and thus the interaction with the surrounding medium, increases with decreasing diameter of the taper waist and with decreasing difference between the RI of the fibre and surrounding medium [

Tapered optical fibres offer a number of attractive features for sensor development, including large evanescent fields, flexibility and compactness. In the case of a tapered optical fibre that is coated with a functional material, the properties of the waveguide are influenced by the optical thickness (product of RI, and geometrical thickness) of the coating.
