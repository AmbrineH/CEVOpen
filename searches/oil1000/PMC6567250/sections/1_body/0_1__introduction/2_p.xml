<p class="p">Optical sensors detect changes in optical parameters (refractive index (RI), absorbance, reflectance, fluorescence, etc.) that depend upon the physicochemical parameters (pressure, strain, temperature, chemical composition, etc.) of the investigated environment. Optical fibres offer a convenient method for creating optical sensors, directing light to, and collecting light from, the measurement region, so called extrinsic sensors [

 <xref rid="B5-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Fibre optic sensors possess several advantages over conventional sensor techniques [

 <xref rid="B6-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. They are not susceptible to electromagnetic interference, they can survive harsh environments and tolerate high temperatures. They are biocompatible and are readily multiplexed, allowing the simultaneous monitoring of a number of measurands. They can be used for remote monitoring of the environment because of the low attenuation that is a property of light propagation in telecommunications grade single mode optical fibres.
