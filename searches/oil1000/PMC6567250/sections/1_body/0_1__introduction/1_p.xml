 <xref rid="B3-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This requires the monitoring and control of critical environmental parameters, which can broadly be divided into physical (temperature, strain, pressure, etc.) and bio-chemical (concentration of contaminants and bio-hazardants). A recent publication [
 <xref rid="B3-sensors-19-02294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] provided a comprehensive review on the use of optical fibre sensors for environmental monitoring in civil, petroleum and agricultural engineering. This paper focuses on the use of tapered optical fibre sensors for the measurement of parameters important in environmental monitoring.
