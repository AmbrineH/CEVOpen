<p class="p">Optical fibre-based measurement techniques have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of analytical areas such as chemical and biological sensing, environmental and structural health monitoring and medical diagnosis. The large variety of designs and measurement schemes that may be implemented using optical fibres provides the potential for the creation of highly sensitive and selective sensors for deployment in real world environments.</p>
