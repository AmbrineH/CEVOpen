<p class="p">A review of the uses of tapered optical fibres as sensors has been presented. The theory of light propagation in the tapered optical fibres and methods for their fabrication was discussed briefly. The measurement of physical and chemical parameters using a variety of optical fibre tapers configurations has been outlined. Despite clear advantages, such as high sensitivities and simplicity of fabrication, the wide variety of configurations and their versatility, there are limited reports of practical application of the tapered optical fibres. The majority of the work that has been conducted is laboratory-based in well-controlled environments. One of the major challenges for future applications of tapered optical fibre sensors lies in the reliable and reproducible fabrication of the devices. It should be also noted that in simplest form tapered devices are not selectively sensitive and require coating that provide specificity. In addition, addressing issues around packaging, handling and mechanical strength is essential.</p>
