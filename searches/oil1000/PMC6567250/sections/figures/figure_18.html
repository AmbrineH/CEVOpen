 <p> Transmission spectra of a tapered single mode optical fibre (cut-off wavelength 670 nm) with a taper waist of diameter 10 μm and of length 25 mm, measured in: H 2O, black line, an aqueous solution of Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate Porhine (TSPP) of concentration 10 μM, red line. The absorption spectra of TSPP measured using a conventional UV-vis spectrometer is shown by the blue line [ 42]. </p>
