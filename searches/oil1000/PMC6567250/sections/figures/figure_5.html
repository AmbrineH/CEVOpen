 <p> ( a) Schematic illustration of the structure of a tapered optical fibre; HE 11 fundamental core mode coupled to higher order modes HE 12 at the first taper transition region; higher order modes are then combined with the fundamental core mode at second transition region HE 11 + HE 12; and ( b) a typical channelled transmission spectrum of the non-adiabatic taper with waist diameter of 10 Î¼m fabricated in an optical fibre with a cut-off wavelength of 670 nm (Fibrecore SM670).
