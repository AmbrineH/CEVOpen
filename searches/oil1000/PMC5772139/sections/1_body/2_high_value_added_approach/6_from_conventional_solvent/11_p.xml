<p id="Par32" class="p">Another highly cited green and sustainable technique to isolate organic compounds from bio-based waste is based on supercritical fluid processing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). It is widely known that substances at temperatures and pressures near or above their critical points have exceptional solvent characteristics for analytical purposes. These supercritical fluids possess liquid-like solvating and gas-like diffusivity power, and other tuneable properties that can be adjusted varying temperature, pressure and the addition of other components acting as a modifier. Due to its gas-like low viscosity and high diffusivity, the supercritical fluid can easily penetrate into plant materials with a fast mass transfer rate. Possibly, the most important property of supercritical fluids for separation processes is diffusion, obtaining solubility and diffusion good enough to provide quantitative extraction yield [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>]. Carbon dioxide (scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) is the fluid most widely used for extractions, with critical parameters of 31.1 °C and 73 atm (7.39 MPa), at relatively low operating conditions. It behaves as a nonpolar or polarizable solvent and low molar mass alcohols (co-solvents) are often added in small quantities to modify the solvent polarity. Because carbon dioxide can be depressurized to the gaseous state, the solvent is easily removed and supercritical fluid-based separation methods are easily coupled with subsequent analysis. Therefore, scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> provides miscibility to the majority of natural products, availability and low cost, reliably high purity, negligible toxicity, facility for removal and reuse, resulting in many advantages for downstream processing in terms of product purification and/or catalyst recycling [
