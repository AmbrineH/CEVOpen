 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>], as is the case of carotenoid separation from pomegranate peels using different vegetable oils as solvents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. Sunflower and soybean oils were used as solvents and parameters such as time, temperature, solid/oil ratio used were analyzed considering the yield. It was found that the optimum mild operating conditions were: extraction temperature, 51.5 °C; peel/solvent ratio, 0.10; amplitude level, 58.8%; solvent, sunflower oil. Additionally, a subsequent separation of oil and carotenoids was not necessary, since the pigmented oil can be used as a carotenoid source in different commercial products in this format.
