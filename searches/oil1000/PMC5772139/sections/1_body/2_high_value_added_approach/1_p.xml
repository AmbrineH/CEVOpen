<p id="Par17" class="p">More recently, trends in green and sustainable extraction, fractionation and purification techniques have largely focused on minimizing the use of solvents, energy and materials that are intrinsically benign to human health and the environment [

 <italic class="italic">status quo</italic> and perspectives related to natural product separation from waste, a systematic literature review was conducted using the ISIS Web of Knowledge platform (reviews and papers) from 2006 to 2017, combining the descriptors “natural product” and “green extraction/separation” (or “sustainable extraction/separation” or “eco-friendly extraction/separation”) and “waste” (or “residue”). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the number of publications during this period. There were more than 160 research papers and reviews that, to the best of our knowledge, are reasonably representative to show the strongest tendencies in this field over the last decade. It can be clearly observed that there has been an increase in the number of manuscripts over the last 10 years, covering the principles, advances, and applications of these green methods.
