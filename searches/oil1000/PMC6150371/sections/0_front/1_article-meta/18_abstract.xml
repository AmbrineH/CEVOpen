  <italic class="italic">Baccharis reticularia</italic> DC. is a plant species from the Asteraceae family that is endemic to Brazil. Despite the great importance of 
  <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> genus, no study has been carried out regarding either the phytochemical composition of 
  <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> or the evaluation of its larvicidal potential. Considering the intrinsic immiscibility of essential oils, this study shows larvicidal nanoemulsions containing the 
  <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> phytochemically characterized essential oil and its main constituent against 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>. The major compound found was 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene (25.7%). The essential oil inhibited the acetylcholinesterase, one of the main targets of insecticides. The required hydrophile-lipophile balance of both nanoemulsions was 15.0. The mean droplet sizes were around 90.0 nm, and no major alterations were observed after 24 h of preparation for both formulations. After 48 h of treatment, the estimated LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were 118.94 μg mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 81.19 μg mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 
  <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil and 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene nanoemulsions, respectively. Morphological alterations evidenced by scanning electron micrography were observed on the larvae treated with the 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene nanoemulsion. This paper demonstrated a simple and ecofriendly method for obtaining 
  <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil and 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene aqueous nanoemulsions by a non-heating and solvent-free method, as promising alternatives for 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> control.
