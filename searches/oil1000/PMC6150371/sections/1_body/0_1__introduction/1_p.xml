 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae) is the vector of neglected and emergent tropical diseases. It is the primary dengue and chikungunya vector and, more recently, it was associated to Zika virus outbreak. This is a critical public health problem of international concern due to a possible correlation between infection of pregnant women and neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, in newborns [

 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, including the mechanical elimination of breeding sites, adulticidal and larvicidal agents [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In addition to the removal of breeding sites (also called environmental methods), the mechanical methods may make use of traps. The chemical methods using conventional insecticides may be used either on adults or larvae. However, the problems associated to inducement of resistance is a main issue related to this approach. On the other hand, the biological methods, including those with essential oils have been considered promising [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Domestic host breeding sites, such earthenware vases, barrels, cisterns, gutters, cans, tyres and plant saucers, are the main targets for the control. For example, the presence of fertilizers (e.g., NPK) in the water of plant saucers is considered a possible attractant for gravid females [
