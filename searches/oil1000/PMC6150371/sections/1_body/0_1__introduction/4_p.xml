<p class="p">However, to our knowledge, no efforts have been carried out to prepare a nanostructured product with the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> or to evaluate its larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>. Thus, the aims of the present study were to elucidate the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> and to prepare and characterize larvicidal nanoemulsions with this natural raw material and its major constituent, using a non-heating and solvent free low energy method, against 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> larvae.
