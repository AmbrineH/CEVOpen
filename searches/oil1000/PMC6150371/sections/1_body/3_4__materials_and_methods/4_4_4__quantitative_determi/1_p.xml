<p class="p">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay was performed using a method that uses acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], with some modifications. 340 μL of test solution (1.25 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in MeOH), 1660 μL of 0.1 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 200 μL of AChE solution (30 mU/mL, sodium phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.5) were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction started with the addition of 1000 μL of 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 0.68 mM) and 200 μL of acetylthiocholine iodide (17 mM). The hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide was monitored by the formation of the yellow 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion as a result of the reaction of DTNB with thiocholine at 412 nm. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (the concentration of test compounds that inhibit the hydrolysis of substrates by 50%) were estimated by linear regression of the natural log of concentration of essential oil versus percentage of remaining enzyme activity in the presence of essential oil and then solving the resulting equation for a 50% remaining activity [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. Physostigmine was used as positive control. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion in 1 min under the conditions defined.
