 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae were obtained from the Arthropoda Laboratory (Universidade Federal do Amapá, Macapá, AP, Brazil). Biological assay was performed under controlled conditions, being early fourth-instar larvae kept at 25 ± 2 °C, relative humidity of 75 ± 5% and a 12 h light-dark cycle. The experimental evaluation was performed according to World Health Organization protocol [
