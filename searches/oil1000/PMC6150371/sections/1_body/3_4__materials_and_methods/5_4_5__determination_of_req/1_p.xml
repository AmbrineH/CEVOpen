<p class="p">Two non-ionic surfactants with low and high hydrophile-lipophile balance value (HLB) were blended together in order to achieve a wide range of HLB values (8.0–15.0). rHLB value of each blend was calculated as follows: rHLB = [(HLBsm × mSm) + (HLBp80 × mP80)]/(mSm + mP80), where HLBsm is the HLB of sorbitan monooleate, HLBp80 is the HLB of polysorbate 80, mSm is the mass (g) of sorbitan monooleate and mP80 is the mass of polysorbate 80. rHLB value of the
