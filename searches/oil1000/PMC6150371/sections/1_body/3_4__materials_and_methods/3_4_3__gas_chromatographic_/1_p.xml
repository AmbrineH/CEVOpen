<p class="p">The essential oil was analyzed by a GC-MS-QP2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer using electron ionization (Shimadzu, Barueri, SP, Brazil). The GC conditions were as follows: Injector temperature, 260 °C; detector temperature, 290 °C; carrier gas (Helium), flow rate 1 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and split injection with split ratio 1:40. Oven temperature was initially 60 °C and then raised to 290 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The sample was diluted with n-hexane (1:100,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and injected on a ZB-5 column (i.d. = 0.25 mm, length 30 m, film thickness = 0.25 μm). The MS conditions were voltage, 70 eV, and scan rate; 1 scan s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The retention index was calculated by the interpolation of each substance retention time and the retention time of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons analyzed in the same conditions [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The identification of substances was performed by comparison of their retention index and mass spectra with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. MS fragmentation pattern of compounds was also checked with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) mass spectra libraries. Quantitative analysis of the chemical constituents was performed by GC-FID (Shimadzu, Barueri, SP, Brazil), under the same conditions of GC-MS analysis and percentages obtained by GC-FID were performed by peak area normalization method.
