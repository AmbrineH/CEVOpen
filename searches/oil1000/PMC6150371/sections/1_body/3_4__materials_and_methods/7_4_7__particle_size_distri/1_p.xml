<p class="p">Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) analysis was carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS, (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) equipped with a 10 mW “red” laser (X = 632.8 nm). Samples were measured at a 90° scattering detector angle immediately after preparation (Day 0) and after 24 h (Day 1). The nanoemulsions were diluted with deionized water (1:25,
