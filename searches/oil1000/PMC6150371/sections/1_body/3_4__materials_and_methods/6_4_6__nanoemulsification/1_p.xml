<p class="p">The nanoemulsions were prepared according to a non-heating and low energy method [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil and surfactant(s) were pooled together and homogenized for 30 min. Then, distilled water was added dropwise and the system was submitted to magnetic stirring for 1 h. The final concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil was 2500 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and surfactant to oil ratio (SOR) was 1:1. This same procedure was used for the preparation of a nanoemulsion with the main constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil.
