<p class="p">Several nanoemulsions with 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil or 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene were prepared by using blends of a non-ionic surfactant pair at different ratios, using a low energy and solvent-free method without heating. Despite some studies aiming to generate essential oil-based nanoemulsions focus on high energy methods to generate small size droplets, the utilization of low energy methods that makes use the physicochemical properties of the system are also a good alternative [

Moreover, a solvent-free preparation would lead to less impairment to the environment, being in accordance with a sustainable and eco-friendly approach. rHLB can be predicted based on a series of emulsions prepared with known ratios of a pair of two non-ionic surfactants. It is also a satisfactory strategy to achieve low mean droplet size and its determination has been used to develop larvicidal nanoemulsions [
