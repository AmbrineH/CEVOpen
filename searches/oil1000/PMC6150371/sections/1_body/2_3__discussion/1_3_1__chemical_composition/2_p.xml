<p class="p">The essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> showed moderate anticholinesterase activity when compared to other oils from the Asteraceae species [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The inhibition of the AChE is one of proposed mechanisms of insecticide action [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], causing death and paralysis on the insects by blocking neural signal transduction. Essential oils are mixtures of volatile compounds that can be produced by plants as a part of their chemical defense against phytophagous invertebrates mainly by inhibition of this enzyme [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Despite some ongoing efforts which were carried out to investigate the anticholinesterase activities of extracts and isolated compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], studies regarding the anticholinesterase potential of the essential oils from this genus still remain scarce. In the present study, the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> was able to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 301.9 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (263.2–354.2), demonstrating moderate anticholinesterase activity when compared to other oils from Asteraceae species [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Limonene presented known anticholinesterase activity against some insects, including from 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> genus. Seo and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] obtained an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value around 130 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the isomer 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-limonene against acetylcholinesterase of 
 <italic class="italic">Reticulitermes speratus</italic> (Japanese termite). The evaluation of the enantiomers 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-limonene and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene against the Culicidae 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic> demonstrated different acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 20% and 40%, respectively when assayed at 1000 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Anticholinesterase assay of the 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene against commercial enzymes from 
 <italic class="italic">Electrophorus electricus</italic> and butyrylcholinesterase from equine serum were also performed and revealed IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 225.9 ± 1.3 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 456.2 ± 5.6 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Despite the fact that several volatile terpenoids (mono- and sesquiterpenes) show insecticidal activity by inhibitions of AChE [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], some of them may have the activity modulated by the presence of other substances, including those from complex mixtures such as essential oils [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Based on this preliminary in vitro assay and due to the fact that the essential oil presented a satisfactory IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value, in accordance with the literature data for its major compound, both essential oil and limonene were used for the preparation of nanoemulsions for evaluation against 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> larvae.
