<p class="p">The decrease of 34% on the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> nanoemulsion as a function of time observed in this study is in accordance with literature data. Oliveira and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] showed 42% of reduction on LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> from 24 to 48 h (371.6 to 213.7 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) after a larvicidal assay with 
 <italic class="italic">Pterodon emarginatus</italic> essential oil-based nanoemulsion against 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> larvae. 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene nanoemulsions also showed a decrease on its LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (11%) from 24 h to 48 h in this study, which is in accordance with the literature. Zahran and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] observed a reduction about 11.4% on LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> from 24 h to 48 h from 140 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 124 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively, after incubation of 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-limonene against another Culicidae species (
 <italic class="italic">C. pipens</italic>). Kassir and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] observed a 20% LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> reduction from 24 to 48 h (from 53.8 to 32.52 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) after incubation of pure limonene with 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The enhancement of activity may be associated to gradative release of the larvicidal compounds from nanostructure systems as nanoemulsions [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Further studies aiming to correlate the release of compounds with mortality as function of time should be performed to better understanding of the phenomena involved in the larvicidal action of nanoemulsions, including those based on 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic>.
