<p class="p">The estimated LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene nanoemulsions obtained in this study is close to the one reported 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene non-nanoemulsified against fourth-instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> (71.9 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The highest mortality levels were reached during the first 24 h on the groups treated at 125, 175 and 250 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This data is in accordance with Pavela and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] that found 100% of mortality induced by 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene on 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae at 250 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
