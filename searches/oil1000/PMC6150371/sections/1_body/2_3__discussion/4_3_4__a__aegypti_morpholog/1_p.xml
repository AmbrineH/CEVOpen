<p class="p">The observed morphological alterations in treated 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> larvae are in accordance with previous works [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and may affect larvae development and motility contributing to the observed high mortality. For example, the increase in the number of sows can hamper the exoskeleton exchange process, as seen by Borges and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-22-01990" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. However, other factors can contribute for larvicidal activity on mosquito larvae, such as the damage to the digestive tube which is associated to anti-feedant behavior [
