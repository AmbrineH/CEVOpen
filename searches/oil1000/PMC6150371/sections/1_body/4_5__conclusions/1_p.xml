<p class="p">Few studies about preparation of nanoemulsions by low energy methods with essential oils are available when compared to high-energy methods. In addition to the successful preparation of nanoemulsions with 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> essential oil and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene by a titration non-heating and solvent-free method, we showed the larvicidal potential of these nanostructured systems against 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, the main vector of the dengue, zika and chikungunya viruses. The facility of nanoemulsion preparation using an ecofriendly approach and the larvicidal activity indicate great perspectives for the further utilization of these raw materials for nanophytoproducts, which are potentially useful to control the mosquito vector by dispersing low water soluble compounds in aqueous media through innovative nanoemulsions.
