<p class="p">The evaluating of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> morphology after exposure to the nanoemulsion prepared with the 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularia</italic> major compound was performed, since highest mortality (100%) was reached with the nanoemulsion prepared with 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, together with a lower LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for this nanoemulsion, when compared to the essential oil-based nanoemulsion. Photomicrographs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> after incubation with the nanoemulsion containing 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene at 250 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01990-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The larvae of the control group showed an elongated and vermiform appearance, with the body well defined. The head and the thorax presented a globular aspect, with greater amount of chitin in the cuticles. The abdomen was smooth and flexible, consisting of segments that provided larvae mobility in water. On the other hand, the larvae of the group treated with nanoemulsions containing 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene presented a fragile appearance, low resistance, with little mobility and all wrinkled body surface showing alterations on head, thorax, siphon and on cuticles of abdomen. An increase in the number of sows could be also seen (
