<p class="p">On the day of preparation, most of the nanoemulsions (with hydrophile-lipophile balanceâ€“HLB, ranging between 8 and 12) presented a milky aspect which is associated to conventional macroemulsions, in addition to creaming. All the nanoemulsions presented a negative superficial charge. High mean droplet size and polydispersity index were observed mainly for low HLB formulations (

The best results were obtained with nanoemulsions prepared solely with polysorbate 80 as surfactant (HLB 15), which presented the best maintenance of the physicochemical characteristics after one day of preparation, including a mean droplet size below 200 nm. Considering the observations above, it can be suggested that the required HLB (rHLB) value of both
