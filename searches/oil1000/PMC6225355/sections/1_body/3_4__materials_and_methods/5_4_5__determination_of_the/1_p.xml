<p class="p">MIC and MBC of the EOs were determined using broth microdilution method in 96 well U shaped bottom microtiter plates in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (2011) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. We dissolved EOs in sterilized DMSO at a final concentration of 7% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), and then performed serial two-fold dilutions from 0.00875–0.56% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) of the EOs. We prepared an inoculum of 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> in BHI broth and RCM, respectively, with OD
 <sub class="sub">600nm</sub> adjusted to 0.5. We diluted the inocula to obtain a final turbidity in wells approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL. We incubated aliquots of 50 µL of bacteria and 50 µL of different concentration of each EO, at 25 °C for 24 h for 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> in aerobic conditions and 37 °C for 48 h for 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> bacteria under anaerobic conditions. We measured bacterial density changes using ELISA plate reader (InfiniteF50 Tecan-Sweden) at wavelength of 620 nm. We determined the lowest concentration of EO at which no bacterial density was detected as the MIC of the EO. We tested each EO at each concentration in triplicate and repeated the experiment three independent times. We used 50 µL of bacteria-free broth and 50 µL DMSO as negative control. For MBC determination, we inoculated 10 µL of mixtures of respective bacteria and EOs at different concentrations on agar plates (as detailed above) and determined bacterial counts expressed as CFU/mL after incubation at 37 °C at 24 and 48 h for 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>, respectively. We determined MBC as the lowest concentration of the EO at which incubated respective bacteria showed no detectable colonies on respective agar plates. To determine MBC, we tested each EO at each concentration in triplicate and repeated the experiment three independent times.
