 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) mixture of EO and Pluronic F127. The EO and surfactant mixture was prepared at a concentration of 4.5% of Pluronic F127 and the oil at 0.5%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>. We added the defined amounts of oregano oil and Pluronic F127 and mixed by stirring at 800 rpm for 30 min. A stable nanoemulsion was formed by adding water drop wise at 3.5 mL/min flow rate while stirring at 800 rpm for 1 h. We stored the formed nanoemulsion at 25 °C and observed after 24 h and 1, 3, and 4 weeks of preparation. The droplet size and polydispersity index of the prepared nanoemulsion were measured using photon correlation spectroscopy (Zetasizer ZS, Malvern, UK). We expressed the mean diameter of the droplet size in μm and all measurements were made in triplicates.
