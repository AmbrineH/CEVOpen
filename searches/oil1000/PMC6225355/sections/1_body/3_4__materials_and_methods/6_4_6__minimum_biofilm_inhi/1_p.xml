<p class="p">We determined MBIC for EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> biofilm using the microtiter plate method, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, we incubated 100 µL of 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> at 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL in BHI–1% glucose (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) with 100 µL of the EO concentrations 0.00875–0.56% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) at 25 °C for 24 h. Following incubation, we removed the contents of each well and gently rinsed the wells twice with 300 µL of PBS. We air dried the plate for 30 min and stained the formed biofilm with 0.1% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) crystal violet (CV) for 30 min at room temperature. We then washed the excess CV from the plate with 200 mL of PBS per well, repeated washing three times and air-dried the plate. To measure the biofilm stained with CV, we solubilized CV using 95% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) ethanol and measured the CV color intensity at OD
 <sub class="sub">595nm</sub> using a Microplate reader (Infinite F50 Tecan). We determined MBIC for oregano, thyme, lemongrass, tea tree EOs, and thymol. We used BHI broth as a negative control and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> cell culture without EOs as a positive control. We determined MBIC as the EO concentration at which the OD
 <sub class="sub">595nm</sub> is equal to that of the negative control. Experiments for each EO concentration were performed in triplicate and the assay was repeated three independent times.
