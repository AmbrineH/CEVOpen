<p class="p">Time-kill kinetics assay was performed for oregano EO against 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> as described previously [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Bacterial suspensions at a final concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL were used as the initial inoculum. We assayed oregano EO killing time at concentrations of mg/mL (0.035%), mg/mL (0.07%), and mg/mL (0.14%) equivalent to 1, 2, and 4 MIC. We incubated different concentrations of oregano EO with the two bacterial cultures and measured killing capacity at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h using broth micro-dilution method. At each time point, we used 50 µL of the assay solution to make ten-fold serial dilutions and performed viable counts on BHI and RCM agar plates for the respective bacteria. We incubated the agar plates at 25 °C for 24 h under aerobic conditions and 37 °C under anaerobic conditions for 48 h for each respective bacterium. We expressed viable count of each bacterium as CFU/mL. We used DMSO solvent and equivalent broth as negative controls. Each concentration of EO was assayed as triplicate and the entire assay was repeated three independent times.
