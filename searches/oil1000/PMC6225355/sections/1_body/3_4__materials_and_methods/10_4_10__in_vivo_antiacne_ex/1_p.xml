 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5 BALB/c mice) to examine the possible irritability of the oregano nanoemulsion was performed. In this preliminary experiment, we applied epicutanously 10 ÂµL nanoemulsion (2 MIC against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> as calculated by our in vitro assays) on ears of a group of healthy uninfected mice and observed over 5 days for any signs of inflammation.
