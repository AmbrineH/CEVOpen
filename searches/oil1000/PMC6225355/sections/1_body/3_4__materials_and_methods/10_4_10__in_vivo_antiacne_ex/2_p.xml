<p class="p">In our in vivo experiments for assessment of oregano nanoemulsion efficacy, we used 45 BALB/c male mice divided into three groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5 mice/group/experiment). We measured mice ear thickness prior to injections, then, we injected mice the right ears intradermally with 20 µL PBS (healthy control ear) using Hamilton syringe 50 µL model 705 RN (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA). We induced acne infection and inflammation by injecting the left ear with 20 µL of 10

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. We observed the mice for microcomedones formation for 24–72 h and measured daily changes in ear thickness using electronic digital micrometer caliper (0–25 mm/0.001 mm). We considered appearance of microcomedones and the increase in mice ear thickness ≥10% as indicators of acne induction [

For infected mice ears, we applied epicutanously either 20 µL of 2 MIC oregano formulated nanoemulsion (test group), or 2% erythromycin (positive control), or no treatment (negative control) for 3 days. We recorded daily changes in mice ear thickness, weight, and took digital photographs of mice ears. At the end of the experiment, we excised mice ears and performed viable bacterial counts and histopathological assay.
