<p class="p">For histological examination, we preserved whole excised mice ears in 10% formalin-saline solution before preparing the histological sections using paraffin method technique. We dehydrated all sections in ascending grades of ethanol, cleared in xylene and then embedded in paraffin wax. We mounted transverse sections (4â€“5 micron, thickness) on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains. We examined all sections for the evaluation of inflammatory response.</p>
