<p class="p">We analyzed the chemical components of oregano and thyme EOs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a Shimadzu Model GC-17A gas chromatograph interfaced with a Shimadzu model QP-5000 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). We separated volatiles on a DB5-MS column with specifications: 30 m length, 0.5 mm i.d., and 0.25 μm film (J&amp;W Scientific, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We injected the EOs at a split ratio of 1:10 for the 30 s. We used the following operating conditions: Injector 220 °C, column oven 38 °C for 3 min, then programmed at a rate of 12 °C min
