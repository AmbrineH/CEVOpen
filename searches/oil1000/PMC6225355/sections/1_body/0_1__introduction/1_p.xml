<p class="p">Acne vulgaris is the 8th most prevalent disease and second top skin disease globally [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Adolescents of both genders are typically affected by acne. Acne in adolescents can cause psychological disorders and in severe cases can lead to depression [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Acne is a multifactorial disease characterized by pathological alteration in pilosebaceous units of the neck and upper trunk. It results in the formation of non-inflammatory comedones and inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules, and nodules [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Two bacteria are associated with acne pathogenesis: 
 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. These bacteria are part of normal human skin microbiota, but if dysbiosis occurs, infection of pilosebaceous units can lead to acne. Accordingly, most anti-acne drugs are directed against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> infection and associated inflammatory responses. Anti-acne therapy includes systemic and topical therapies. Topical therapies include comedolytic agents, anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Bacterial resistance accompanies topical anti-acne antibiotics. Resistance to topical anti-acne antibiotics is attributed to multiple factors, including use of repeated single antibiotic, sub-inhibitory concentrations, or use over extended time [
