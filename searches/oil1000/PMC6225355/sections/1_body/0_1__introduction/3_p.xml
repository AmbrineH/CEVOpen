<p class="p">Another aim of this study was to develop a pharmaceutical formulation of the EO with the highest antimicrobial effect. Based on our in vitro antibacterial results of tested EOs against acne-causing bacteria, we formulated oregano EO as a nanoemulsion formula. Nanoemulsions offer enhanced solubilization capacity for hydrophobic, poorly soluble drugs as typical in the case of EOs [
