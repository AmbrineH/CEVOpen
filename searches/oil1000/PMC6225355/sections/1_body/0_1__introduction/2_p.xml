<p class="p">To overcome the emerging resistance to conventional antibiotics, alternative natural antimicrobial agents have been investigated. Essential oils (EOs) of aromatic plants such as oregano, tea tree oil, lemongrass, and thyme have antimicrobial activities that can be used as a natural alternative [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of these EOs is attributed to their major constituents: Monoterpenoid phenols. In addition, EOs’ minor constituents, such as the monoterpene hydrocarbons, γ-terpinene, and
