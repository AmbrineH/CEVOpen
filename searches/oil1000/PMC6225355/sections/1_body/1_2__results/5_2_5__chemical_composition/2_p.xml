<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity data showed that oregano EO exhibited the largest inhibition zones and MIC among the tested seven oils. Oregano EO displayed the best MBC and MBIC among selected top four EOs, along with rapid killing rates of both tested bacteria. Moreover, our GC-MC analysis showed that thymol content in oregano EO was higher than thyme EO, suggesting that thymol might be the reason for oregano superior antimicrobial activities. Therefore, we next aimed to assay thymol antimicrobial activity compared to oregano and thyme EOs.</p>
