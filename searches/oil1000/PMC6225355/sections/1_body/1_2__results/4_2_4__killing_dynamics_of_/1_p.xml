<p class="p">Since our results of agar disc diffusion, MIC, MBC and MBIC assays showed that oregano EO was superior, the dynamics of oregano EOâ€™s killing activity was determined. MIC, 2MIC and 4MIC of oregano EO showed significant reduction in the number of both 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> after 4 h of application (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02164-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Oregano EO killing capacity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> was higher than 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> at 8 and 12 h (
