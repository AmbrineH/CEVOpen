 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of oregano EO and Pluronic F127, exhibiting a clear stable solution. The nano formulation stability was assessed for four weeks at room temperature. No signs of cloudiness, creaming or phase separation were observed. The prepared nanoemulsion had a particle size of 39.54 nm, with a polydispersity index of 0.285, indicating its low size distribution.
