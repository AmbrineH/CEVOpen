<p class="p">Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test results confirmed that the most potent EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> were oregano, thyme, lemongrass and tea tree oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02164-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Oregano EO displayed lowest MIC values of 0.34, 0.67 mg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>, respectively. Second to oregano was thyme EO, exhibiting an MIC of 0.65, 1.30 mg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>, respectively. Consequentially, oregano, thyme, lemongrass, and tea tree EOs were selected for determining minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), demonstrating the most effective inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> by disc diffusion and MIC assays.
