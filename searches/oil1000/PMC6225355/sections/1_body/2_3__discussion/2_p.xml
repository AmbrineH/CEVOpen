<p class="p">Thymol exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against acne-causing bacteria, but less than oregano EO itself. Thymol exhibits significant bactericidal activity [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Thymol antimicrobial action is mainly mediated via inhibiting bacterial growth and lactate production, decreasing cellular glucose uptake, causing lysis of fungal hyphal wall [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thymol was the principal phenolic component of oregano EO (&gt;99%) and thyme EO (&gt;70%). It is thus suggested for its role in mediating the EOs’ antimicrobial effect. However, thymol alone was less potent than oregano EO. It could be that other minor volatiles present at lower levels such as 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-thujene and cineole synergized thymol’s effect in oregano EO and may account for difference in activity between oregano and thymol. Composition of EOs depends on a number of factors, including harvesting seasons, plant cross-section, extraction method, and geographical sources (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]). This can account for differences between results obtained from different studies, where variation in thymol amount is significant [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The EOs used in this study were obtained from plants collected during the flowering stage, which could explain the high phenolic compound levels. Collectively, oregano EO was the most potent antimicrobial. Consequently, it was formulated in nanoemulsion topical dosage form to be assessed as anti-acne formula in vivo on acne-induced mouse model.
