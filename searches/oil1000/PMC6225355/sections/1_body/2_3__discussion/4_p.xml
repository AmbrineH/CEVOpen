Overall, our results indicate that the proposed oregano nanoemulsion exhibits high antimicrobial and healing effects with fewer side-effects than anti-acne reference antibiotics. The potential use of our proposed oregano nanoemulsion as an anti-acne agent opens the field for new alternative treatments of natural origin, avoiding the problems associated with the use of antibiotics for acne. Further clinical studies on our proposed formulation can increase its potential as a drug to be used clinically in humans.
