<p class="p">Oregano EO exhibited the strongest antimicrobial effect against the tested acne-causing bacteria. Using disc diffusion, MIC, and MBC assays, oregano, thyme, and thymol were the top three antimicrobial agents against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>. Meanwhile, tea tree and lemongrass EOs exhibited an intermediate antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>. Both tested acne-causing bacteria were resistant to chamomile, lavender, and menthe EOs. Thus, in this study, the anti-acne effects of oregano EO surpassed that of other EOs evaluated including commercialized over-the-counter acne treatment tea tree EO [

 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> biofilm formation. Bacteria growing in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics compared to planktonic lifestyle [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the anti-biofilm ability of the most potent antimicrobial EOs and found that oregano EO exhibited strongest anti-biofilm activity. Moreover, oregano EO at 4 MIC showed rapid killing of both tested acne-causing bacteria.
