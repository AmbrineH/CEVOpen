  <p class="p">Oregano EO nanoemulsion showed higher antimicrobial effect against 
   <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> than erythromycin control in acne mouse model. We induced acne in a mouse model by intradermal injection of BALB/c mice left ears with 10
   <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU in 20 µL of 
   <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>. The mice’s right ears served as uninfected control. We applied epicutanously either oregano EO nanoemulsion or 2% Erythromycin solution on infected mice ears. A third group of mice served as untreated control. Viable counts of 
   <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic> load in mice ears at the end of the treatment of various mice groups were performed. Oregano nanoemulsion significantly lowered bacterial load in treated mice ears than 2% Erythromycin. Bacterial load was expressed as Log
   <sub class="sub">10</sub> CFU/mL. Data represented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments, total mice per group 15 mice. 
   <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test was used for comparing groups with 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 considered significant.
