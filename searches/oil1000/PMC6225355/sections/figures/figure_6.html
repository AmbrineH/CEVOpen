 <p> Oregano EO nanoemulsion showed higher antimicrobial effect against P. acnes than erythromycin control in acne mouse model. We induced acne in a mouse model by intradermal injection of BALB/c mice left ears with 10 8 CFU in 20 µL of P. acnes. The mice’s right ears served as uninfected control. We applied epicutanously either oregano EO nanoemulsion or 2% Erythromycin solution on infected mice ears. A third group of mice served as untreated control. Viable counts of P. acnes load in mice ears at the end of the treatment of various mice groups were performed. Oregano nanoemulsion significantly lowered bacterial load in treated mice ears than 2% Erythromycin. Bacterial load was expressed as Log 10 CFU/mL. Data represented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments, total mice per group 15 mice. T-test was used for comparing groups with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant. </p>
