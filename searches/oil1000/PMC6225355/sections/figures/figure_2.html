 <p> Oregano EO inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis faster than P. acnes. Oregano EO at concentrations of 0.672, 1.34, 2.68 mg/mL (1, 2, 4 MIC) and no EO control was used for assaying the killing rate of bacterial cells at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 h and expressed as the surviving bacteria (log 10 CFU/mL) at different exposure times. We used starting bacterial suspension concentration 10 8 CFU/mL. Oregano EO killing rate against ( a) S. epidermidis and ( b) P. acnes. </p>
