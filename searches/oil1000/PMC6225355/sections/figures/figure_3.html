 <p> Thymol exhibited lower inhibition zone than oregano EO. Antibacterial activity of thymol and the most bioactive EOs using disc diffusion method (zone of inhibition in mm) against ( a) S. epidermidis with thymol and EOs at concentration of 0.7%; ( b) S. epidermidis with thymol and EOs at concentration of 1.4%; ( c) P. acnes with thymol and EOs at concentration of 0.7%; ( d) P. acnes with thymol and EOs at concentration of 1.4%. Data is represented as means of inhibition zones (mm) Â± SD. Controls used were clindamycin and erythromycin as positive control with DMSO as negative control. </p>
