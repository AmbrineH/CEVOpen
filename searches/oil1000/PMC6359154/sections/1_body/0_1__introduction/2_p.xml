<p class="p">In general, PCMs can be classified into two types: organics and inorganics. Organic PCMs, such as paraffin waxes [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and fatty alcohols [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], have the advantages of little supercooling, no phase separation and non-corrosiveness [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, low thermal conductivity, relatively low phase change enthalpy, large volume change during phase transition and high price limit the widespread use of organic PCMs [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. By comparison, inorganic PCMs have the advantages of low cost, incombustibility, large latent heat and relatively high thermal conductivity, making them show great potential for application [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Inorganic PCMs can be further classified into hydrated salts, molten salts and metals, which are suitable for use in low, medium and high-temperature application fields [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. As a major PCM used in low-temperature environment, hydrated salts show great potential uses in various fields, such as solar water heating (SWH) systems [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], heating and cooling buildings [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], off-peak power utilization [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], heat pump water heating systems, etc. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the supercooling phenomenon, phase separation and poor thermal reliability of hydrated salts have become unavoidable problems that needs to be solved urgently. For the better applications of hydrated salts, it is necessary to develop an inorganic PCM with high latent heat, good thermal stability and thermal reliability, and low supercooling degree.
