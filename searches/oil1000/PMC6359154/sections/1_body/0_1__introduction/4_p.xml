<p class="p">In the current work, two hydrated mixtures were explored by combining aluminum ammonium sulfate dodecahydrate (NH

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) or aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate (KAl(SO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is a hydrated salt with a melting point of 117 °C and a melting enthalpy of about 150 kJ/kg. Owing to the abundant magnesium chloride resources in salt lakes, MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is an ideal low-cost PCM. But the high melting point (117 °C) influences the thermal stability and reliability of MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O because it is higher than the boiling point of water (100 °C, at standard atmospheric pressure). On the other hand, NH

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O are common hydrated salts in daily life with phase change temperatures of about 93 °C and latent heat of up to 260 kJ/kg. However, the large supercooling degree (10–15 °C) and relatively high phase change temperature limit their practical application in SWH systems. In order to reduce the melting point of NH
