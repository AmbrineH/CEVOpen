 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Sensible thermal energy storage (STES), latent thermal energy storage (LTES) and thermo-chemical heat storage (TCHS) are the main approaches to realize TES [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Compared to STES and TCHS, LTES using phase change materials (PCMs) has attracted increasing interest because of high energy storage density [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. PCM can absorb or release a large amount of heat during the phase change process while maintaining the system at a constant temperature around its melting point [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In order to further enhance the heat storage performance of LTES, PCM should possess the merits of large latent heat, good thermal stability and excellent thermal reliability. Moreover, it is desirable in industrial applications that PCM has a low cost and a suitable phase change temperature for target thermal system. Therefore, the exploration of PCMs that meet the above requirements is of great significance for accelerating the latent heat storage technology to be applied into various fields.
