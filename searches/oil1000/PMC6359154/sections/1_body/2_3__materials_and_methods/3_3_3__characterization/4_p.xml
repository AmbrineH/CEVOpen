<p class="p">In order to investigate the thermal stability of the mixture, the thermal gravimetric analysis of the samples were conducted by a thermoanalyzer instrument (TGA, STA409PC, Netzsch, Waldkraiburg, Germany). Each sample (8–12 mg) was placed in an alumina crucible and then heated from 30 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a constant stream of nitrogen at a flow rate of 100 mL/min.</p>
