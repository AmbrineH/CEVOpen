<p class="p">The thermal reliability of the mixture was tested by using the High-low temperature (alternate) humid heat test chamber (TH300, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Before the melting-freezing cycle test, the mixture was sealed in a reagent bottle to avoid water loss. To ensure the reproducibility of experimental result, five samples (20~25 mg) were prepared for testing under the same cycle test conditions. The melting-freezing cycle experiment was carried out as following process: At first, the chamber was heated from room temperature to 80 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. Then, the five samples were heated at 80 °C for 60 min to completely melt the mixture. After that, the chamber temperature decreased to 30 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. Finally, the samples completely solidified after cooling 60 min at 30 °C. After repeating 200 cycles melting-freezing experiments, the samples were characterized by DSC and XRD to study the thermal reliability.</p>
