<p class="p">The phase change temperature and latent heat of the samples were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, DSC Q20, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). For DSC measurements, 5–10 mg for every sample was sealed in an aluminum pan and heated from 30 °C to 100 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a constant stream of nitrogen at a flow rate of 50 mL/min.</p>
