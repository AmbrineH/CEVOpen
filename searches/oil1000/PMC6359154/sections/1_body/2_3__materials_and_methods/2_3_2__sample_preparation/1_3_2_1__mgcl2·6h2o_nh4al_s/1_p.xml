 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Al(SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·12H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were weighed and placed in a reagent bottle. After simply stirring the two hydrated salts, the mixture was heated to 85 °C and maintained for 3 h. Then, intermittent stirring was used to ensure uniform mixing of the two hydrated salts during heating process. Finally, the solution was cooled at room temperature to obtain a MgCl
