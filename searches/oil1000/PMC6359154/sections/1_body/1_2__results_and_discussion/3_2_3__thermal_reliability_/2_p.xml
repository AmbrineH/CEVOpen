<p class="p">In order to ensure that the structure of the mixture-A didn’t change after the cycle tests, XRD patterns and cooling curves before and after experiencing 200 melting-freezing cycles were measured. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a that the XRD patterns before and after the tests are almost the same, suggesting that the mixture-A has good structure stability. Moreover, the cooling curves of the mixture-A before and after the test almost coincide with each other (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·12H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O mixture possesses excellent thermal reliability, making it show great potentials for practical applications. In addition, the material expansion experiment result shows that the mixture A has no significant volume change before and after the phase change (
