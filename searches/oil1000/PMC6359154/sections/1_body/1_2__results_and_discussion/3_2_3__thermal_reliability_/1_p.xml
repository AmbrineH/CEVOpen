<p class="p">As we know, it is essential that PCM has good thermal reliability to undergo a number of thermal cycles. Therefore, the melting-freezing cycle test was carried out on mixture-A and mixture-B to investigate their thermal reliabilities. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows the DSC result of the mixture-A and mixture-B before and after experiencing different numbers of melting-freezing cycle tests. There is significant difference in thermal reliability between mixture-A and mixture-B. After 200 cycles of the melting-freezing cycle test, mixture-A exhibits a phase change temperature of 65.12 °C and a melting enthalpy of 189.28 kJ/kg (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a). Compared with the experimental result before the test, the deviations in phase change temperature and melting enthalpy are only 1.51% and 1.20%, respectively. However, the thermal property of mixture-B changes greatly with the increase in the number of cycles. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b, the melting enthalpy of mixture-B decreases to 101.3 kJ/kg after undergoing 30 cycles melting-freezing cycle tests. As mentioned in

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O was reduced by more than 50% after 10 cycles of 60–105 °C. The large decrease in melting enthalpy may be because the poor reversibility of the combination of aluminum potassium sulfate and crystal waters. In this work, when the number of cycles reaches 10, the melting enthalpy of mixture-B decreases by 15.14% compared to the sample before the cycle test. It can be known that the combination of MgCl
