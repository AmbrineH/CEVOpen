<p class="p">In order to describe the experimental results clearly, the mixtures were classified into 2 series, as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the molten mixtures including mixtures-A and mixtures-B with different mass fractions of MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (F
 <sub class="sub">MgCl2·6H2O</sub>). It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a that mixtures-A containing 30% and 40% MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O show transparent and semitransparent solutions, while others are in solid state. On the other hand, mixtures-B containing 30%, 40% and 50% MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O are semitransparent solutions, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b. To investigate the effect of F
 <sub class="sub">MgCl2·6H2O</sub> on the thermal properties of mixture-A/mixtures-B, the melting point (T
 <sub class="sub">melt</sub>) and enthalpy (△H) of each sample was measured by DSC (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,c)). The thermal characteristics of mixtures-A/mixtures-B are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00363-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. It can been seen that T
 <sub class="sub">melt</sub> first increases then decreases with the increase of F
 <sub class="sub">MgCl2·6H2O</sub>. As for mixture-A/ mixture-B, when F
 <sub class="sub">MgCl2·6H2O</sub> exceeds 50 wt%, T
 <sub class="sub">melt</sub> and △H decrease significantly. The results show that there is an optimum mass fraction of MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O for mixture-A/mixture-B. It can be seen from the experimental results (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were prepared and characterized by DSC to determine the optimum F
