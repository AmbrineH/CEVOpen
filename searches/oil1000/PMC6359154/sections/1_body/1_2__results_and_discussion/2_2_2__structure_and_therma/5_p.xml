 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a), it starts to decompose at about 60 °C and the weight loss due to the adsorbed air humidity is about 4.25%. At the temperature of 163.4 °C, the weight loss reach the second peak and the weight loss at this stage is 24.64%. After that, the product MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O starts to decompose, resulting in the maximum rate of water loss. The MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O lose two crystal waters and becomes MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. However, the weight loss of the sample is 25.82% at 179.81 °C, which is lower than the theoretical value of 35.42%. It indicates that the product at this stage is not only MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O but also partially undecomposed MgCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is 58.07%. Except for the first weight loss corresponding to adsorbed air humidity, the experimental value (58.07% − 4.25% = 53.82%) is coincide with the theoretical value of 6 crystal waters (53.2%). For NH

In the second stage (175~250 °C), the sample continues to lose two crystal waters and the final weight loss is 47.43%. According to the experimental result, the value of crystal waters lost from the sample is calculated to be 11.8, which is almost equivalent to 12. Similar to NH

When the temperature continues to increase and exceeds 250 °C, the remaining three crystal waters are lost and the final weight loss is 44.01%. The error between experimental result and theoretic value (45.53%) is only 3.34%.
