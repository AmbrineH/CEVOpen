 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O exhibit octahedral crystals with sizes of 100–150 μm, which are much larger than those of MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. In the first stage of the crystallization of mixture-A, a number of acicular crystals (MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) grow rapidly within 1 s. Some 70 s later, it can be seen that several octahedral crystals (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>Al(SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·12H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) start to grow at a slow rate. Finally, the acicular crystals stick into the gaps among the octahedral crystals or attach to the surfaces of the octahedral crystals. As shown in the crystal image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, 320 s) of the mixture-A, two crystals with different shapes are tightly bound together to form the crystal of mixture A. Similarly, the acicular crystals (MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) grow rapidly during the crystallization of mixture-B. The octahedral crystals (KAl(SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·12H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) begin to appear at 30 s and develop gradually. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00363-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b that the acicular crystals finally attach to the surfaces of the octahedral crystals. However, there is no connection of acicular crystal between two octahedral crystals.
