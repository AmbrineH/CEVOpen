 <p class="p">Developing phase change materials (PCMs) with suitable phase change temperatures and high latent heat is of great significance for accelerating the development of latent heat storage technology to be applied in solar water heating (SWH) systems. The phase change performances of two mixtures, NH

  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) are 64.15 °C and 60.15 °C, respectively, which are suitable for SWH systems. Moreover, two mixtures have high latent heat of up to 192.1 kJ/kg and 198.1 kJ/kg as well as exhibit little supercooling. After 200 cycles heating-cooling experiments, the deviations in melting point and melting enthalpy of mixture-A are only 1.51% and 1.20%, respectively. Furthermore, the XRD patterns before and after the cycling experiments show that mixture-A possesses good structure stability. These excellent thermal characteristics make mixture-A show great potential for SWH systems.
