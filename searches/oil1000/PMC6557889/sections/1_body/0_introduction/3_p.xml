<p id="Par4" class="p">Many microbiological studies in mangrove ecosystems have been reported in the last few years. Some of these studies have isolated and identified microbial strains with the potential for biotechnical use

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. The anaerobic and high salinity environment of the mangrove wetlands provide conditions for archaea to thrive, so the domain archaea is particularly important for mangrove ecosystem

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. However, previous studies have mainly focus on bacterial communities, so there was a lack of information regarding archaeal communities in mangrove soils. The archaeal communities in mangrove soils have been examined using clone libraries

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>, but details of archaeal community diversity in mangrove wetlands could not be revealed using this method. This is the first characterization of the archaeal community within mangrove ecosystem soil that has been reported using data from high-throughput next generation sequencing. Next generation sequencing, like pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing provides a relatively detailed picture of microbial communities compared to other methods. In this study, we describe details of bacterial and archaeal communities that exist within different sites of the mangrove wetland using pyrosequencing. These results may be helpful for guidance to isolate bacteria of interest within these distinct sites.
