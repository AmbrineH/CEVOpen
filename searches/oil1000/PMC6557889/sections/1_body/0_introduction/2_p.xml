  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, mangrove plants and microorganisms have a close relationship. For example, many microorganisms are beneficial to the growth of mangrove plants. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria have been isolated and cultured from mangrove soils
