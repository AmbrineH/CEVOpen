<p id="Par26" class="p">Microbial DNA was extracted from five soil samples using the FastPrep® SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, U.S.) according to manufacturer’s protocols. The bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (95 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) using primers 341F (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′)-1073R (5′-ACGAGCTGACGACARCCATG-3′), and the archaeal 16S ribosomal RNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) using primers 344F (5′-ACGGGGYGCAGCAGGCGCGA-3′)-915R (5′-GTGCTCCCCCAATTCCT-3′). PCR reactions were performed in a 20 μL mixture containing 4 μL of 5 × FastPfu Buffer, 2 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μM), 0.4 μL of FastPfu Polymerase, and 10 ng of template DNA. After purification using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, U.S.) and quantification using QuantiFluor™ -ST (Promega, U.S.), a mixture of amplicons was used for pyrosequencing on a Roche 454 GS FLX+ Titanium platform (Roche 454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, U.S.) according to standard protocols. The raw reads were deposited into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (Accession Number: SRP040784 for bacteria and SRP041275 for archaea).</p>
