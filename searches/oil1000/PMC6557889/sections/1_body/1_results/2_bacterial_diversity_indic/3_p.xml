<p id="Par8" class="p">In the Proteobacteira phylum, Alphaproteobacteria (40.51% of the Proteobacteira phylum on average), Deltaproteobacteria (32.89%) and Gammaproteobacteria (23.01%) were the main three classes detected in the five samples (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). However, the proportion of these three classes differed among the five samples. Alphaproteobacteria was present in the highest abundance (77.99% in the Proteobacteira phylum) in sample BM5, and in the lowest abundance (11.34%) in sample BM2 (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Deltaproteobacteria was detected in the highest abundance (62.67%) in sample BM2, and in the lowest abundance (3.27%) in sample BM5 (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Gammaproteobacteria was detected in the highest abundance (36.25%) in sample BM1, and in the lowest abundance (16.61%) in sample BM5 (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>).
