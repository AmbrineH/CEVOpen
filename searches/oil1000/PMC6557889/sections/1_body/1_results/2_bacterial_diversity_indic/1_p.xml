<p id="Par6" class="p">The effective sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using 97% similarity cutoff with UPARSE, which is a method with a focus on reducing OTU inflation. The OTU number range for all five samples was 427 to 870 OTUs using a distance cutoff level of 3% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The BM5 sample contained the lowest OUT number. Diversity was highest in the BM4 sample and the lowest in BM5 sample (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The Shannon diversity index also revealed that the BM5 sample had the lowest bacterial diversity among the five samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The rarefaction curves of the five samples did not reach a plateau, indicating that the data did not contain enough sequence depth to ascertain the full bacterial diversity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
