<p id="Par7" class="p">Thirty-four phyla were detected within the five samples. The top 10 phyla present in the samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Cyanobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Chlorobi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in all five samples. The highest percentages of Proteobacteria were detected in the samples BM3 and BM4 (51.40% and 53.53% of the total sequences in each sample, respectively). The lowest percentage of Proteobacteria was detected in sample BM5 (31.53%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Actinobacteria was the second most abundant phylum, with the highest percentage of 48.40% in the sample BM5 and lower percentages of 10.10% and 8.86% in the samples BM1 and BM2, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The percentages of Chloroflexi were higher in the samples BM1 and BM2, (16.30% and 15.28%, respectively), than those of other three samples, (which ranged from 2.99–6.54%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Acidobacteria were detected in greater abundance in the sample BM5 (10.37%) than in the other four samples (4.25–8.43%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The percentages of Cyanobacteria and Deferribacteres in the samples BM1 (3. 55% and 1.31%, respectively) and BM2 (4.78% and 3.39%, respectively) were higher than those of the other three samples (0.53% and 0.23% on average, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Gemmatimonadetes were detected in greater numbers in the samples BM3 and BM4 (2.98% and 4.07%, respectively) than those of the other three samples (which ranged from 0.27–1.50%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In summary, the percentage abundance of different bacterial phyla differed between the five samples. Compared with the other four samples, the composition of the bacterial community in sample BM5 was distinct, and dominated by Actinobacteria (representing 48.70% of the total sequences), Proteobacteria (31.53%), and Acidobacteria (10.37%). However, some predominant bacterial clusters were similar between some samples. For example, the predominant phyla in samples BM1 and BM2 were similar. These samples were composed of Proteobacteria (with 44.20% and 43.27% of the total sequences in each sample, respectively)), Chloroflexi (with 16.30% and 15.28%, respectively) and Actinobacteria (with 10.10% and 8.86%, respectively). The bacterial community composition in samples BM3 and BM4 were both mainly dominated by Proteobacteria (with 51.40% and 53.53% of the total sequences in each sample, respectively), Actinobacteria (with 24.82% and 16.70%, respectively), Acidobacteria (with 7.30% and 8.43%, respectively) and Chloroflexi (with 6.54% and 6.57%, respectively) (Table
