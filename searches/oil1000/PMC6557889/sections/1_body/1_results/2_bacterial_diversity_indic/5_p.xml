<p id="Par10" class="p">The results of principal component analysis (PCA) at OTUs levels indicated that the five samples could be separated into three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1a</xref>). The BM1 and BM2 samples were grouped together, and the BM3 and BM4 samples clustered together. Sample BM5 was separated from the other four samples. The results of PCoA analysis using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics gave results that were similar to the PCA results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1b,c</xref>).
