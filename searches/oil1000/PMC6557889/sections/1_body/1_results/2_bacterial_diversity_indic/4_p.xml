<p id="Par9" class="p">Within Alphaproteobacteria, the dominant orders were Rhizobiales and Rhodospirillales, with the highest abundance detected in samples BM3 (21.62% of total sequences) and BM5 (14.96% of total sequences), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The majority of Deltaproteobacteria sequences belonged to Desulfobacterales and Syntrophobacterales, which were both present in high abundance in samples BM1 and BM3 (accounting for 13.80% and 3.83%, respectively) compared to the other three samples (accounting for 3.15% and 0.73%, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Within Gammaproteobacteria, the dominant orders were Xanthomonadales and Chromatiales. Xanthomonadales were detected in all five samples with percent abundances ranging from 1.92–7.23%. Chromatiales were not detected in sample BM5 but presented in the other four samples at similar percentages ranging from 2.66% to 3.46% (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Acidimicrobiales, Frankiales, Gaiellales, Solirubrobacterales, as the major orders of Actinobacteria, were present in high proportions in sample BM5 (especially for Frankiales, with a percent abundance of 22.20%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). In summary, In summary, the bacterial community composition differed between the five samples the level of order. The main orders detected in sample BM1 were Desulfobacterales (10.51%), Xanthomonadales (7.23%), Anaerolineales (5.94%), Rhizobiales (5.82%) and Acidimicrobiales (4.50%). The main orders detected in sample BM2 were Desulfobacterales (17.08%), Anaerolineales (7.04%), Nitrospira (4.35%), Rhizobiales (3.90%) and Syntrophobacterales (3.79%). The main orders detected in sample BM3 were Rhizobiales (21.62%), Acidimicrobiales (7.77%), Solirubrobacterales (7.14%) and Gaiellales (6.41%), Xanthomonadales (4.55%). The main orders detected in sample BM4 were Rhizobiales (19.54%), Desulfobacterales (6.29%), Gaiellales (5.94%), Acidimicrobiales (4.10%) and Solirubrobacterales (4.06%). The main orders detected in sample BM5 were Frankiales (22.20%), Gaiellales (15.31%), Rhizobiales (8.66%), Rhodospirillales (14.96%) and Solirubrobacterales (5.25%) (Table
