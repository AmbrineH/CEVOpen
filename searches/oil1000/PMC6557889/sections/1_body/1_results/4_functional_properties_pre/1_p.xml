<p id="Par15" class="p">PICRUSt was used to explore the different metabolic potentials among the samples from different sites in the mangrove wetland. The metabolic pathways including metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, organismal systems and human diseases were all detected for bacterial and archaeal functional profiles (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). For bacteria, PICRUSt analysis revealed that metabolic pathways such as energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, replication and repair and translation were more abundant in the seaward edge samples, and membrane transport pathway was more abundant in inner samples, and pathways related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, lipid metabolism and transcription were more abundant in the landedge sample (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). For archaea, the pathways such as nucleotide metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, lipid metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, translation and replication and repair were more abundant in seaward edge samples, and amino acid metabolism, membrane transport, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were more abundant in the other three samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
