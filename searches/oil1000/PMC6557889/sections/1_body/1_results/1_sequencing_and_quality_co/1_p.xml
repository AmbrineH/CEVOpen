<p id="Par5" class="p">A total of 94013 and 100585 valid reads, for bacteria and archaea, respectively, were obtained for five soil samples in the Bamenwan Mangrove Wetland (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The average read lengths for bacterial and archaeal samples were 597 bp and 499 bp, respectively. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows that 77–82% of the raw reads met quality and length standards for bacteria. After initial quality check mentioned above, the chimera, Achaea and singleton reads were also checked and filtered out. Finally, 7951, 8072, 7757, 8992 and 8039 effective bacterial sequences were extracted from each of the five samples, respectively, for use in downstream bioinformatic analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For archaea, 86–89% of the raw reads met quality and length standards. 13640, 3056, 15636, 16203 and 12819 effective archaeal sequences were obtained from each of five samples, respectively, for use in downstream bioinformatic analyses after the initial quality check (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
