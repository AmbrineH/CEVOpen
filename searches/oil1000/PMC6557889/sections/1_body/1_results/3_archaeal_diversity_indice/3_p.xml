<p id="Par13" class="p">In summary, similar patterns in abundance in archaeal community composition at the order level were detected in samples BM1 and BM2. Both samples contained MCG, MBGB, Halobacteriales, Thermoplasmatales and Group C3. In these two samples, however, the percentages of MCG and Halobacteriales showed the reverse trend (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The most abundant archaeal clusters differed between the two mangrove forest samples, with SCG (75.60%) and Halobacteriales (8.10%) present in BM3 and SCG (43.00%), Methanosarcinales (13.90%) and MBGB (12.60%) present in BM4. Compared to the former four samples, the dominant archaeal clusters in BM5 were unique, containing Terrestrial Group (68.70%) and SAGMCG-1 (14.80%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
