<p id="Par11" class="p">For archaea, the OTU number, the taxon richness level reflected by Chao1 and ACE estimators, and the Shannon diversity index were relatively higher in samples BM1 and BM2, and lowest in sample BM5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The archaeal richness and diversity were higher in the soil inside 
 <italic class="italic">Xylocarpus mekongensis</italic> mangrove forest (sample BM4) than inside the 
 <italic class="italic">Bruguiera sexangula</italic> mangrove forest (sample BM5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Like the bacterial rarefaction curves, the archaeal rarefaction curves of the five samples did not reach a plateau, indicating the sequencing depth of these samples was not sufficient to fully assess archaeal diversity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
