<p id="Par14" class="p">The results of PCA at OTUs levels indicated that the five samples could be separated into four groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1d</xref>). BM5 was separated from the other four samples. The BM1 and BM2 samples were grouped together, and the BM3 and BM4 samples clustered with one another. Similar results were also found in PCoA analysis using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1e,f</xref>). The PCA and PCoA results were consistent with the community composition results mentioned above.
