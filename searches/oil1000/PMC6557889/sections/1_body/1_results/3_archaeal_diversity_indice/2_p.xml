<p id="Par12" class="p">Three different archaeal phyla, Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, were detected in this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were dominat in the five samples, but the proportion of each phylum differed between samples. The relatively higher proportion of Euryarchaeota were in samples BM2 (43.25%) and BM1 (30.85%), and then in samples BM4 (24.06%) and BM3 (15.66%), and the lowest proportion in BM5 (11.11%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The observed trend in Crenarchaeota abundance was the reverse of the trend observed in Euryarchaeota. The highest abundance was detected in sample BM5 (88.86%), then in samples BM3 (84.34%) and BM4 (75.76%), and relatively lower proportion in the samples BM1 (68.06%) and BM2 (55.97%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Crenarchaeota were only observed at low abundance in sample BM1 (0.02%). The Halobacteriales, Methanosarcinales and Thermoplasmatales orders dominated within Euryarchaeota, with the highest abundances observed in BM2 (20.8%), BM4 (13.9%) and BM2 (18.4%), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The observed Crenarchaeota mainly belonged to the Marine Benthic Group B (MBGB), Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG), Soil Crenarchaeotic Group (SCG), South African Gold Mine Group 1(SAGMCG-1), Group C3, and the Terrestrial Group (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). MCG was found to be relatively abundant in BM1 (36.20%) and BM2 (16.80%), and followed in BM3 (2.40%) and BM4 (8.40%). SCG was detected at high abundance in BM3 (75.60%) and BM4 (43.00%), and at low abundance in the other three samples (ranging from 0.90% to 2.40%) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). MBGB and Group C3 accounted for a large proportion of samples BM1, BM2 and BM4, but were absent in the sample BM5. Terrestrial Group and SAGMCG-1, as the predominant orders with 68.70% and 14.80%, respectively, were only detected in the sample BM5 (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
