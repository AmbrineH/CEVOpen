These results suggest that mangrove and adjacent coastal ecosystems not only contain high levels of organic matter, but also high levels of pollutants. Indeed, it has been reported that the offshore areas (including mangrove ecosystems) of China are heavily polluted with organic contaminants and heavy metals due to the rapid economic development of coastal regions
