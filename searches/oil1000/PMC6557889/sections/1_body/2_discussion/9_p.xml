 </sup>. In the present study, a higher relative abundance of the two archaeal clusters was observed in seaward edge samples. No sequences were observed in the landedge sample. This distribution pattern was consistent with the previous reports. It is hypothesized that MCG and MBGB are to be anaerobic heterotrophs that consume buried carbon

 </sup> reports that MCG plays an important role in degradation of detrital proteins in anoxic marine soils. Based on these studies, the prevalence of MBGB and MCG in coastal sediments could contribute to the degradation of organic matter.
