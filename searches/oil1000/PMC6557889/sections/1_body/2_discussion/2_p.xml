<p id="Par17" class="p">Metagenomic data collected from mangrove soil samples in Sao Paulo State, Brazil revealed an abundance of Proteobacteria (47.1–56.3%), Firmicutes (10.5–13.8%), Actinobacteria (5.4–12.2%), and Bacteroidetes (3.8–11.8%)

 </sup>. In this study, Proteobacteria (31.53–53.53%), Actinobacteria (8.86–48.70%), Acidobacteria (4.25–10.37%), and Chloroflexi (2.99–16.30%) were dominant bacterial groups detected in the two samples taken from inside of the mangrove forest. In the previous two studies, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were both the predominant bacterial groups, which might suggest these bacterial groups are cosmopolitan inside of mangrove environments. However, differences between the abundant bacterial groups detected in these studies were also obvious. For example, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were detected at 0.76–5.43% and 0.40–6.28%, respectively, in the present study. These differences might be due to biogeographical, ecological (such as different mangrove plant community composition), and anthropogenic factors (such as nearby aquiculture and urbanization).
