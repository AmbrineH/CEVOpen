<p id="Par22" class="p">Frankiales, belonging to Actinobacteria, was the most dominant order detected, with up to 22.20% in the landedge sample (BM5). 
 <italic class="italic">Acidothermus</italic> was the major genus of Frankiales (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). This genus contains a single species, namely 
 <italic class="italic">A. cellulolyticus</italic>, which is thermophilic, acidophilic and could produce many thermostable cellulose-degrading enzymes

 </sup>. Gaiellales, a member of order Actinobacteria, was also abundant in the landedge sample (BM5). However, little is known about the physiology of Gaiellales. It is a novel order within the class Actinobacteria

 </sup>. Rhodospirillales, the third most abundant order detected in the landedge sample, is comprised of many acetic acid-producing bacteria. These bacteria may be responsible for the low pH of the land sample soil.
