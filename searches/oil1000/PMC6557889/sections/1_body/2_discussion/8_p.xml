 </sup>. Bacillales may play a special role in mangrove ecosystems by engaging in long term promotion of plant growth. It is possible the Bacillales promote growth by producing endospores under stressful environmental conditions and by secreting large quantities of enzymes, such as phytase, a critical component of the phosphorous cycle
