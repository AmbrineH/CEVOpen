 </sup> and bulk soils around the mangrove tree roots. This suggests Rhizobiales may be common in mangrove soil bacterial communities and the presence of Rhizobiales is not restricted to one mangrove tree species. Rhizobiales are comprised of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plant symbionts. Recently, a genomic analysis indicated that Rhizobiales are very metabolically versatile and are capable of degrading aromatic compounds

 </sup>. Our results indicate the proportion of Rhizobiales in the two inner mangrove wetland samples is much higher than the proportion in the seaward and landedge samples. This suggests that Rhizobiales contribute to nitrogen-fixation in mangrove soils and promote mangrove plant growth. In addition, some specific orders are present within the two samples, such as Anaerolineales, Gemmatimonadales, Nitrospira, Syntrophobacterales detected in the soil sample from

This suggests mangrove plants have some impact on bacterial community composition not only in the rhizosphere, but also in the bulk soils around plant roots. Previous studies have illustrated that soil physiochemical properties, such as salinity, soil pH, nutrient concentration and composition, and root exudates, are the major factors influencing the activity and microbial community of mangrove soils
