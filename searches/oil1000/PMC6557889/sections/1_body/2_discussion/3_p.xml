 </sup> reported that spatial differences had a significant effect on bacterial community composition. For example, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Verrucomicrobia were enriched in the nutrient-rich inner mangrove soils, but Proteobacteria and Deferribacterias were enriched in the outer mangrove soils.

 </sup> compared the bacterial communities in the mangrove wetland with that of freshwater reservoirs and marine sediments, and found that diverse groups of bacteria with functions related to the primary production were enriched in the mangrove wetland. These studies suggest that the intertidal mangrove wetland has a unique bacterial community. The mangrove wetland may be unique at the level of bacterial composition because it is the only forest ecosystem in marine environments, making it a unique intertidal ecosystem. The mangrove plant root exudates secreted from the roots of plants into the rhizosphere and surrounding sediment may act as nutrient sources or inhibitors for microbial populations
