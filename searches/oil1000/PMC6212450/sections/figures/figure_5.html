 <p> Friction and wear performance of layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates as additives in PAO8 lithium-based grease. ( a) P B values with different weight fraction from 1.0 wt.% to 7.0 wt.%. ( b) WSD values under different loads (from 98 to 980 N). ( c) Dynamic friction curves under maximum applied loads (K-LMP 980 N, K-LCP 588 N, MoS 2 490 N, Base grease 490 N). Test conditions: four-ball test, P B: 25 °C, 1770 rpm, 10 s; WSD/COF: 75 °C, 1200 rpm, 3600 s. </p>
