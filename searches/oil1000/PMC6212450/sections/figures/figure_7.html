 <p> Analysis of the rubbing surface after long run (3600 s) friction-wear testing. ( a) Non-contact 3D. ( b) SEM. ( c) EDS. Details of friction-wear test conditions are as follows: coconut oil calcium-based grease; 75 °C, 1200 rpm, 3600 s. The layered phosphates clearly formed protective films on friction pairs during the friction-wear tests. </p>
