 <p> Friction and wear performance of layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates as additives in coconut oil calcium-based grease. ( a) P B values at different temperature (25, 75 and 120 °C). ( b) WSD values under different loads (from 98 to 686 N). ( c) Dynamic friction curves under maximum applied loads (K-LMP 686 N, K-LCP 588 N, MoS 2 490 N, Base grease 490 N). Test conditions: four-ball test, P B: 1770 rpm, 10 s; WSD/COF: 75 °C, 1200 rpm, 3600 s. </p>
