 <p> Friction and wear performance of various typical layered lubricant materials as additives in PAO8 lithium-based grease. ( a) P B values at different temperatures (25, 75 and 120 °C). ( b) WSD values under different loads (from 98 to 686 N). ( c) Dynamic friction curves under standard load (392 N) and maximum applied loads of β-LDS and α-ZrP (686 N). Test conditions: four-ball test, P B: 1770 rpm, 10 s; WSD/COF: 1200 rpm, 3600 s, 75 °C. </p>
