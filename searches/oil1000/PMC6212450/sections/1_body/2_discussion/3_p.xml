<p id="Par19" class="p">In order to prepare materials suitable for lubrication, conditions for synthesising K-LMP and K-LCP were optimised. Regular flake particles with an average particle size of ~2.0 Î¼m were obtained by altering the magnesium/calcium source, the molar ratio of raw materials, and the reaction temperature. The low solubility and high alkalinity of magnesium/calcium hydroxide may play a key role in particle size control.</p>
