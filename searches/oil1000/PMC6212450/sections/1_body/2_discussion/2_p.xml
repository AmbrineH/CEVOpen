<p id="Par18" class="p">In order to identify effective layered solid lubricants, we assessed layered phosphates using crystallographic data, and selected only materials with a corrugated layer that were water-insoluble, environmentally friendly, and available as an abundant resource. Following these rules, two representative layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates (K-LMP and K-LCP) were selected from more than 17 layered magnesium and calcium phosphates identified in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).</p>
