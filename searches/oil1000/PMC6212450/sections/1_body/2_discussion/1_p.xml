<p id="Par17" class="p">Effective use of lubricants is an important route for reducing the world’s energy resource consumption. Identifying effective, environmentally friendly layered materials that meet the demands of solid lubricants is therefore of great importance. Herein, we compared the load-carrying capacity of various typical layered lubricant materials (β-LDS, α-ZrP, MgSH, MgAl-LDH, MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and graphite) under identical test conditions, and probed the relationships between the load-carrying capacity and crystal structure. We found that layered materials with a corrugated layer performed better in terms of load-carrying capacity. The general view is that the planes of layered materials slide easily over one another, providing resistance to shearing forces and contributing to lubrication. In the present work, we found that increasing the sliding resistance of interlayers using corrugated layers could increase the load-carrying capacity of layered solid lubricants. This finding expands on the traditional lubrication mechanism of layered materials.
