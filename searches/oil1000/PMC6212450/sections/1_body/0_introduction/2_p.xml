<p id="Par3" class="p">Solid lubricants are essential for heavy impact/load operations since they provide wear protection and enhance load-carrying performance. Molybdenum disulfide (hereafter referred to as MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) is the predominant material used as a solid lubricant due to its lamellar crystalline structure with weak van der Waals-type bonds between planes. This substance can prevent metal on metal contact under high-load conditions

 </sup>. However, molybdenum is a scarce resource that represents a source of heavy metal pollution, and the lubricating ability of MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> deteriorates over time due to oxidation to MoO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Thus, it is important to develop other layered materials as effective and environmentally friendly solid lubricants.
