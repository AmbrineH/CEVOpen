<p id="Par6" class="p">Guided by these finding, we selected environmentally friendly layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates with corrugated layers using the periodic table and the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Synthesis conditions were established by varying the magnesium/calcium source, the molar ratio of raw materials, and the reaction temperature. A four-ball tester was employed to evaluate the tribological properties of biodegradable coconut oil calcium-based grease using the synthesised layered phosphates as solid lubricants. The results revealed that the layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates significantly increase the load-carrying capacity.</p>
