<p id="Par5" class="p">In the present work, the tribological properties of the above-mentioned layered materials were investigated under identical test conditions, and the relationships between crystal structures and tribological properties were analysed based on the experimental data. We found that layered disodium silicate and layered zirconium phosphate possess better tribological properties than magnesium silicate hydroxide and layered double hydroxides, especially under higher load. The lubricating action is not only due to weak van der Waals-type bonds between planes, but also the corrugated layer, which generates slide resistance and acts as a buffer that facilitates a higher load-carrying capacity.</p>
