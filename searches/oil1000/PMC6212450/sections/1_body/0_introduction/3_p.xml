 </sup>. Among these, magnesium silicate hydroxide and layered double hydroxides possess good friction-reduction and anti-wear properties, but fail to improve the load-carrying capacity of lubrication oil and grease. Layered disodium silicates and layered zirconium phosphates exhibit good anti-wear, friction-reduction and load-carrying performance. The tribological properties of these layered materials have been evaluated under different test conditions, but the relationships between crystal structures and tribological properties remain poorly understood.
