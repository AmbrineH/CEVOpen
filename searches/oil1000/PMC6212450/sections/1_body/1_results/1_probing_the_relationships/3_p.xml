<p id="Par9" class="p">In the layered materials, the atoms within a layer are strongly bound to each other, while the layers themselves are relatively far apart and held together via weak van der Waals forces between layers

 </sup>. As a result, the lubricity of the layered materials is due to planes of atoms sliding easily over one another. To better understand why β-LDS and α-ZrP possess good tribological properties, we obtained crystal structure data,

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The crystal structure data revealed that graphite has a monolayer carbon atom layer in which the atoms lie in almost truly planar basal planes. Meanwhile, the atom layers of the other five materials are arranged in multilayers. Atoms in the outer layer board of MoS

 <sub class="sub">B</sub> data under short (10 s) test conditions, the maximum non-seizure loads for β-LDS, α-ZrP, MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, MgSH, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 1568, 1235, 617, 617, 490 and 441 N, respectively. Meanwhile, under longer (3600 s) friction-wear test conditions, the maximum applied loads for β-LDS, α-ZrP, MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, MgSH, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 686, 686, 490, 392, 392 and 392 N, respectively. From the above results, layered materials with multilayer atom plates appear to support higher carrying loads than graphite with its monolayer carbon atom layer. β-LDS and α-ZrP have a corrugated layer, and displayed the best load-carrying capacity and had better anti-wear properties, especially under a higher applied load. When subjected to an impact force, the corrugated layer may induce slide resistance and provide a buffer to maintain a higher load-carrying capacity. Therefore, materials with a corrugated layer may perform better at improving the load-carrying capacity. Based on this assumption, an investigation was launched to rapidly select environmentally friendly layered phosphates as solid lubricants using crystallographic data.
