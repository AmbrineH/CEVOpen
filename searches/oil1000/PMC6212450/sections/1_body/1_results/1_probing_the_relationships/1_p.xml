We then evaluate their friction and wear performance as additives in PAO8 lithium-based grease (hereafter referred to as lithium-based grease) under identical test conditions using a four-ball tester, which is commonly employed in friction tests. To investigate the lubricating properties of the six layered materials as lubricant additives, they were dispersed in pure lithium grease as described in the Methods section. The maximum non-seizure load (

The anti-wear (WSD value, the wear scar diameter) and friction-reducing (COF value, the coefficient of friction) properties were also studied under different applied loads and temperatures.
