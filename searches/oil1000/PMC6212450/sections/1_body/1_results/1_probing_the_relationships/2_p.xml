 <sub class="sub">B</sub> value of pure lithium grease, and 5.0 wt.% β-LDS and 5.0 wt.% α-ZrP performed better than the other four additives at increasing the load-carrying capacity of base grease at different temperatures (25, 75 and 120 °C). Since the additive amounts rang from 1.0 wt.%, 3.0 wt.% and 7.0 wt.% at different temperatures (25, 75 and 120 °C), the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> values tended to be similar to the amount at 5.0 wt.% (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). WSD values as a function of load at 75 °C are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>. The highest load with no seizure was recorded with β-LDS and α-ZrP at 686 N, and the second highest was with MgSH (490 N), whereas only 392 N was recorded for MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, graphite, MgAl-LDH and pure lithium grease. Under the highest applied load, WSD values for β-LDS and α-ZrP were 0.57 and 0.46 mm, respectively, lower than other materials under their maximum applied load. This trend held true on temperatures between 25 °C and 120 °C (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The corresponding worn surfaces of β-LDS and α-ZrP, assessed using a 3D optical profiler, were narrower and shallower than those of the other additives under their maximum applied load (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). These results showed that β-LDS and α-ZrP have better anti-wear properties under a higher applied load. From the dynamic friction curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>, the friction coefficient of β-LDS and α-ZrP were 0.057 and 0.067, respectively, and remained steady throughout the maximum applied load tests (686 N). The friction coefficients for MgSH, MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 0.112, 0.071, 0.094 and 0.076, respectively, under the applied load (392 N). Consistent with the dynamic friction results at 25 °C and 120 °C (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), β-LDS and α-ZrP displayed better friction reduction performance than the other additives at higher load. Indeed, β-LDS and α-ZrP not only showed excellent load-carrying capacity, but also improved the anti-wear and friction-reducing properties of lithium grease.
