 </sup>. Thus environmentally friendly layered phosphates are in demand as solid lubricants. According to the periodic table, alkali metals sodium and potassium, and alkaline earth metals magnesium and calcium are environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Sodium and potassium phosphates are water soluble, so their crystal structures may be unstable in damp environments. However, magnesium and calcium phosphates are not only green, plentiful and water-insoluble; they also perform important physiological roles, and are safe for use in foods, medicines and cosmetics

 </sup>. Thus, layered magnesium and calcium phosphates with corrugated layers were tested in the present work. A search of the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) identified 17 layered magnesium and calcium phosphate compounds with corrugated layers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Among these, materials intercalated with the uneconomic lithium, the heavy metal copper, and environmentally-unfriendly amine compounds (including inorganic ammonium and organic amine compounds) were excluded. Two representative layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates (MgKPO
