 </sup>. The resulting crystals ranged in size from 10−20 μm, and the particle size was too large and therefore unsuitable for lubrication

 </sup>. In order to obtain a suitable particle size, various magnesium sources were chosen for K-LMP synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). K-LMP platelets with a particle size of ~2.0 μm were obtained by replacing magnesium chloride with magnesium hydroxide. The low solubility and high alkalinity of magnesium hydroxide may play a key role in controlling particle size. Detailed synthesis conditions are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. By changing the synthesis conditions, K-LMP can be prepared using a feed ratio range P/Mg = 2.0–2.2, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O/Mg = 15–30, and a temperature range 100–150 °C in 24 h.
