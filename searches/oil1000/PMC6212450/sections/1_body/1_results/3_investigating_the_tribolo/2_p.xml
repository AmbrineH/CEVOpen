 </sup>. Lubricants based on environmentally friendly and renewable raw materials and their derivatives are attracting increasing attention for various applications. The general grease composition contains between 65.0 and 95.0 wt.% base oils, 5.0 to 35.0 wt.% thickeners, and 0 to 10.0 wt.% additives. The biodegradability of grease is dependent on the biodegradability of base oils. Herein, coconut oil was chosen as the base oil for investigating the tribological properties of K-LMP and K-LCP as additives in calcium grease.

 <sub class="sub">B</sub> values increased from 510 to 1235 and 1235 N at 25 °C, from 510 to 1235 and 1098 N at 50 °C, and from 470 to 1235 and 1098 N at 75 °C, respectively. WSD values as a function of load at 75 °C are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>. The highest applied load for K-LMP and K-LCP was 686 N and 588 N, respectively. The corresponding WSD values were 0.43 and 0.42 mm, which are much lower than that of MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at different loads, and the dynamic friction coefficients of K-LMP and K-LCP were stable under maximum applied load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b,c</xref>). This trend is similar to that of temperature variation at 25 °C and 50 °C (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). K-LMP and K-LCP as additives in calcium-based grease also displayed good load-carrying, anti-wear and friction-reducing capacities.
