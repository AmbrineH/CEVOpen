<p id="Par13" class="p">The tribological properties of the synthesised K-LMP and K-LCP dispersed in lithium grease were evaluated under different concentrations and loads. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> values for K-LMP and K-LCP were better than that of MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for enhancing the load-carrying capacity of base grease at different additive amounts. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref> shows the variation in WSD values with different applied loads. The highest operating loads for 5.0 wt.% K-LMP grease, 5.0 wt.% K-LCP grease, and 5.0 wt.% MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> grease were 980, 588 and 392 N, respectively. The WSD values for K-LMP and K-LCP were smaller than that of MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> under the same load, especially at high loads. Under the highest applied load, the friction curve for K-LMP and K-LCP is stable and smooth, while the curve for base grease and MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has numerous fluctuations. These results demonstrate that K-LMP and K-LCP exhibit good performance in terms of anti-wear, friction-reduction and load-carrying capacity.
