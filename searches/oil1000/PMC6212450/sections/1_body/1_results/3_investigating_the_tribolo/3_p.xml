<p id="Par15" class="p">Non-contact 3D optical profiling, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterise worn surfaces of friction pairs 
 <bold class="bold">(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The worn surface of coconut oil calcium-based and grease containing MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was severely damaged, with a larger number of deep furrows at an applied load of 294 N. The wear volumes (×10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> mm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) of base grease and grease containing 5.0 wt.% MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, K-LMP and K-LCP were 6.93, 4.76, 0.79 and 0.73, respectively. Moreover, with K-LMP or K-LCP as additive, at the highest applied load the worn surface was smaller with much less furrowing. The wear volumes (×10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> mm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) for K-LMP and K-LCP were 0.97 and 0.94, respectively. The EDS results showed that no elements other than those of the friction pair itself (C, O, Fe, Cr) were present on the worn surface of the friction pair lubricated by base grease and grease containing MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. However, when using grease with K-LMP, Mg, P, and K were present on the worn surface besides Fe, Cr, C, and O, and Ca, P, and K were present when using K-LCP. Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref> shows the results for the PAO8 lithium-based grease, which are consistent. These results suggest that the layered phosphates with corrugated layers as lubrication additives may form protective films on friction pairs, thereby increasing the lubricating ability, in agreement with the results for β-LDS and α-ZrP in our previous study
