<p id="Par16" class="p">To investigate the influence of lubrication on the K-LMP and K-LCP, coconut oil calcium-based grease containing K-LMP or K-LCP after long run (3600 s) friction-wear test at 294 N was adequately diluted with petroleum ether, oleic acid and alcohol to completely remove calcium soap and coconut oil. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM were used to characterise typical solid samples before and after lubrication testing. The powder XRD patterns (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>) of K-LMP and K-LCP showed that the diffraction peak positions and diffraction peak intensities are consistent with the original samples. SEM images (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>) further confirmed that neither the particle size nor the morphology of K-LMP and K-LCP changed after lubrication testing. The above characterisation results demonstrate that K-LMP and K-LCP as grease additives can remain stable under long-term working conditions.
