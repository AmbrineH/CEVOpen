<p id="Par30" class="p">The crystallinity and phase-purity of the products was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku MiniflexII diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 30 kV and 15 mA. The particle size and morphology of materials were investigated by SEM (Hitachi, TM-3000).</p>
