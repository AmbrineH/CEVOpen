<p id="Par35" class="p">The lubricating properties of grease were determined on a four ball tester (Tenkey, MS-10A). The tester is operated with one steel ball, referred to as the “top ball”, under a load rotating against three steel balls held stationary and clamped together for three-point contact. The balls (diameter 12.7 mm, HRc 59–61, Grade 25 EP (Extra Polish)) used in the test were made of GCr15 bearing steel (SAE52100 steel) (composition: 0.95–1.05% C, 0.15–0.35% Si, 0.24–0.40% Mn, 0.027% P, &lt; 0.020% S, 1.30–1.67% Cr, &lt; 0.30% Ni, &lt; 0.025% Cu).

The four-ball tester was also used to evaluate the anti-wear properties of GCr15 bearing steel self-mated frictional pairs under the lubrication of grease. Lubricating greases were brought to 25, 75 and 120 °C, the rotating speed was 1200 rpm and loads were set to 98, 196, 294, 392, 490, 588, 686, 784 and 882 N for test durations of 3600 s. After each test completion, the WSD values on the stationary balls were measured on an optical microscope with an accuracy of 0.01 mm in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the sliding motion. Three identical tests were performed for an average so as to minimize data scattering. 3D Optical Profiler (ZeGage), SEM (Hitachi, TM-3000) and EDS (Bruker, QUANTAX 70) were employed to analyze the worn surface.
