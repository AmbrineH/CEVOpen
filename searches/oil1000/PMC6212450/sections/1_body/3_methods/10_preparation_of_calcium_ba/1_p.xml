<p id="Par32" class="p">Calcium-based grease was prepared as follows. First, the predetermined amounts of coconut oil, 12-hydroxystearic acid and stearic acid were added to a grease kettle and the mixture was stirred and heated to 75 °C until it became homogeneous; second, calcium hydroxide powder was slowly added into the above mixture, then heated to 100–105 °C and kept at this temperature for approximately 2 h until the calcium soap formed. Additional coconut oil was slowly added into the calcium soap at 120 °C for 5–10 min. The mixture was kept at 140 °C for 5–10 min, then transferred to ice water and quenched to room temperature and ground on a triple-roller mill three times to form the desired grease.</p>
