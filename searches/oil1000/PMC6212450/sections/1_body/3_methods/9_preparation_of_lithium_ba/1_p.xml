<p id="Par31" class="p">Lithium-based grease was prepared as follows. First, the predetermined amounts of PAO8, 12-hydroxystearic acid, and stearic acid were added to a grease kettle and the mixture was stirred and heated to 85 °C until it became homogeneous; second, a water slurry of lithium hydroxide initially heated to about 80 °C was slowly added into the above mixture, then heated to 120 °C and kept at this temperature for approximately 3 h until the lithium soap formed. Additional base oil was slowly added into the lithium soap at 90 °C and once again heated to 130 °C until the water completely evaporated. The mixture was kept at 205 °C for 10 min, then cooled to room temperature and ground on a triple-roller mill three times to form the desired grease.</p>
