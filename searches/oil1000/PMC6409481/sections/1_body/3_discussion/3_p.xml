<p class="p">The protein digestibility of the dried mealworm larvae containing diets tended to be slightly higher than those of the other experimental diets containing other animal by-products (p = 0.05). Increased dietary protein digestibility aids weight gain in chicks [

 <xref rid="b19-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Although growth performance was not determined in this study, improved growth performance with dried mealworm larvae could be deduced with current result of protein digestibility when compared with other three animal by-products.
