 <xref rid="b32-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] have conducted studies using housefly meal in broilers and reported digestibility of 98.5% and 69%, respectively. However, the later study reported that the AA digestibility was over 90% while the CP digestibility was much lower. This might have attributed to indigestibility of chitin-N and/or ADF bound-N [
 <xref rid="b32-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Chitin, a linear polymer of β-(1–4) N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units with a chemical structure similar to that of cellulose, is combined with protein and distributed widely on cell wall and shell of crabs, shrimp, and insects. Chitin is rarely found in nature alone. It is distributed in the form of chitin-protein complexes as a major component of the cuticle layer [

 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae are mainly composed of proteins derived from cuticle and other proteins, including various hemolymph proteins, endurance proteins (such as hexamerin), and different enzymatic proteins [
 <xref rid="b34-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In this study, the protein digestibility was relatively high (AID, 89.58%; SID, 90.05%) and there was no significant difference when compared with those of total AA digestibility (AID, 89.60%; SID, 90.05%). There was little effect of chitin on protein digestibility. The chitin content of mealworm larvae has been estimated to be 2.8% of DM [
 <xref rid="b35-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Although dried mealworm larvae have protein-chitin complex, the inclusion rate of that was only 9.95% in total experimental diet. It had little effect on digestibility of total feed protein. It can be deduced that there is no need to consider protein-chitin complex at about 10% level as a protein source.
