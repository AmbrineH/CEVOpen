<p class="p">Pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal showed similar AID of lysine (89.65%), histidine (89.68%), and arginine (89.74%) with results of Ji et al [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], reporting that AID values of lysine, histidine, and arginine were 89.33%, 88.00%, and 92.00%, respectively, in early-weaned piglets (Phase 2, Day 29 to 56). Even though the pigs were younger than those of this study, the digestibility was similar due to complexity of experimental diet, having more digestible raw materials. However there was significant variation in AID values of alanine, cystine, and glycine (78.67%, 77.00%, and 70.67%, respectively) in the results of Ji et al [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] while there was no significant variation in digestibility between AAs in this study. They inferred that the lower AID values were due to different AA structure and said that further studies were needed to explore this possibility [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal showed higher AID and SID of lysine (89.65% and 89.96%), histidine (89.68% and 90.07%), and arginine (89.74% and 89.9%) in comparison with pigs in other treatment groups.
