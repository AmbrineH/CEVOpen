<p class="p">It would appear from the results of this study, that dried mealworm (
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic>) larvae would be a suitable ingredient in growing pigs, being especially valuable from the stand-point ileal AA digestibility. High protein and AA digestibility of dried mealworm larvae may act on the deposition of AAs in pig meat and on the growth performance in growing pigs. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility.
