<p class="p">In general, dried mealworm larvae contain high amounts of CP (46% to 52%) and fat (25% to 35%) with relatively low ash content [

 <xref rid="b27-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Fresh larvae contain about 60% moisture. They are also relatively low in Ca content. The dried mealworm larvae used in this study were about 3.5-month old with CP, essential AA, crude fat, and Ca contents of 48.2%, 46.3(g/16 g-N), 29.5%, and 0.04%, respectively. The AA profiles and protein contents of dried mealworm larvae and three animal protein by-products are superior to soybean meal, the main protein source used in pig and poultry feed. Soybean meal has a CP content of 49% to 56% DM and has a crude fat content of 3% DM [
 <xref rid="b28-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The other three animal protein sources have protein content of 65.5% to 73% in as-fed basis. With regard to protein content and AA quality, dried mealworm larvae are comparable to meat meal and poultry meal as well as fish meal. The other three animal protein sources have protein content of 65.5% to 73% in as-fed basis. Essential AA (lysine, methionine+cystine, threonine and tryptophan) index, EAAI [
 <xref rid="b29-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] values for fish meal, meat meal, poultry meal and dried mealworm larvae were 0.57, 0.40, 0.45, and 0.58, respectively (AA requirements based on Daehan feed Co. data). EAAI of dried mealworm larvae was similar to that of fish meal.
