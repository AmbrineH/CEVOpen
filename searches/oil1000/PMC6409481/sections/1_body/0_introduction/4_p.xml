<p class="p">Dried mealworm larvae contain high amounts of crude protein (CP, 46% to 52%) and fat (25% to 35%) which contain abundant essential fatty acids with superior oxidative stability [
 <xref rid="b11-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Fresh larvae contain about 60% water. They have low Ca content and very low Ca:P ratio as other insects. Their Ca is slightly less available than Ca from oyster shells [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Exclusive feeding of mealworms can lead to Ca deficiency and symptomatic metabolic bone disease [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] because of their low Ca content and low Ca:P ratio. Studies on the feed value of the mealworm larvae have been done in poultry [
