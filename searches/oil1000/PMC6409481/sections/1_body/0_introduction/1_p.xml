Increasing global population and meat consumption have led to urgent need for additional supplies of protein to be included in livestock feed. However, world’s agricultural land area is about 5 billion hectares, which is about 37% of the planet’s area. The area suitable for the production of crops, feed, and food is only 1.35 billion hectares. There is a limit to increase the production of crops to meet the increasing requirement of vegetable protein raw materials (soybean meal etc.) for livestock. Marine overexploitation has reduced the abundance of small pelagic forage fish from which fish meal and fish oil are derived for aquaculture feed. Prices of soybean meal and fish meal as traditional protein feed stocks will rise sharply which will limit their usage in the future.
