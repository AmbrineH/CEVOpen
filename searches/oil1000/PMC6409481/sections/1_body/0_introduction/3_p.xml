<p class="p">Insects are rich in proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins. Their protein has a higher utilization rate than proteins of other animal by-products, thus attracting attention as a substitute for plant protein source [

 <xref rid="b7-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In general, proteins contents in insects are 40% to 65%, similar to protein contents of meat meals. Lipid contents in insects (up to 36% oil) are also similar to lipid contents of meat meals. Unsaturated fatty acid concentration varies according to insect species: 60% to 70% in housefly maggot meal, yellow mealworm, and house cricket; 19% to 37% in black soldier fly larvae [

 <xref rid="b4-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] have confirmed that palatability of insect larvae meal or insect meal to animals is good. Thus, insect larvae meal or insect meal could be used to replace 25% to 100% of soymeal or fishmeal depending on animal species.
