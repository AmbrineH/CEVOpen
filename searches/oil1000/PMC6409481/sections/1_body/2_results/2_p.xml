<p class="p">Pigs fed meat meal, poultry meal, or

 <xref rid="t6-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The SID of Arg was higher (p&lt;0.05) in pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet compared to that in pigs fed fish meal or meat meal diets. Furthermore, pigs fed poultry meal, meat meal, or 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet showed increased (p&lt;0.05) SID of Cys compared to pigs fed fish meal diet. Pigs fed with 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet tended to show increased SID of DM, total energy, CP, total AAs, the rest of essential AAs (Lys, Met, Thr, Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, and His), and the rest of non-essential AAs (Asp, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Tyr, and Pro) than pigs fed meat meal, poultry meal, or fish meal diet.
