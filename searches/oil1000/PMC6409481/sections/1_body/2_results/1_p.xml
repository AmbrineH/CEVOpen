<p class="p">Nutrient contents of dried mealworm larvae and the other three animal protein sources are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t1-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. These data indicated that mealworm larvae contained higher percentage of essential AAs (46.3%) than other protein sources. Results of AID are presented in 
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The AID of Lys was higher (p&lt;0.05) in pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet compared to that in pigs fed Fish meal diet. Pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet showed increased (p&lt;0.05) AID of His and Arg compared to pigs fed Fish meal or Meat meal diet. In addition, the AID of Cys was increased (p&lt;0.05) in pigs fed Poultry meal or 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet compared to pigs fed Fish meal diet. Although there were no significant differences, pigs fed 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> diet tended to show increased AID of DM, total energy, CP, total AAs, and the rest of essential AAs (Met, Thr, Val, Ile, Leu, and Phe) and non-essential AAs (Asp, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Tyr, and Pro) than pigs fed fish meal, meat meal, or poultry meal diet. The digestibility of each nutrient showed similar tendency in the case of poultry meat and meat meal diets.
