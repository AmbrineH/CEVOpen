<p class="p">Diets and collected samples were grounded by a Cyclotec CT 193 Sample Mill (Foss Tecator, Hillerod, Denmark) and then analyzed. Analysis of the dry matter (DM) was conducted according to AOAC Method 967.03 [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The nitrogen content was analyzed by using the Kjeldahl procedure with Kjeltec (Kjeltec TM2200, Foss Tecator, Höganäs, Sweden) and calculating the CP content (Nitrogen×6.25; procedure 981.10; AOAC [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). For the analysis of AA except for methionine and cysteine, diets and samples were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 110°C for 24 hours (AOAC Method 999.13 [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). Methionine and cystine were determined after cold performic acid oxidation overnight and hydrolyzed with 7.5 N HCl (AOAC method 994.12 [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). Individual AA was measured by using an AA analyzer (Beckman 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer; Beckman Instruments Corp., Palo Alto. CA, USA). Chromium concentrations were determined via UV absorption spectrophotometry (UV-1201, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Gross energy was determined using a Parr 6100 oxygen bomb calorimeter (Parr instrument Co., Moline, IL, USA).
