Dietary treatments included the following: i) Fish meal, corn-vegetable by-product basal diet+9.95% fish meal (TripleNine, Esbjerg, Denmark); ii) Meat meal, corn-vegetable by-product basal diet+9.95% meat meal (DK O&amp;T, Eumseong, Korea); iii) Poultry meal, corn-vegetable by-product basal diet+9.95% poultry meal (Harim Co, Ltd., Iksan, Korea); and iv)
