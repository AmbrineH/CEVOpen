Metabolizable energy, CP, methionine, lysine, Ca, and P requirement of experimental diets were adjusted according to requirements of NRC [

Each pig was fed 1 kg of experimental diet four times a day at 07:00, 11:00, 15:00, and 19:00 h which was 2.8 times the maintenance energy requirement (MEn = 106 kcal ME/kg
