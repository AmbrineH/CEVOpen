<p class="p">Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA was calculated according to the method described by Stein [

 <xref rid="b25-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] as an objective indicator of AA digestibility. Basal endogenous losses of CP and AAs were measured using samples collected at the end of the ileum after feeding with non-nitrogen feed [
 <xref rid="b26-ajas-18-0647" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Calculation of digestibility was done based on the relative chromium concentration of feed and ileal samples. AID and SID were calculated using the following equations:
