<p class="p">Antifungal activities were determined for carnosol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-11-00033-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Carnosol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) showed a potent antifungal activity against the dermatophyte 
 <italic class="italic">Mircrosporum canis</italic> (CBS 136538) and against 
 <italic class="italic">Pyricularia oryzae</italic> (LM 120). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values (mg/mL) determined for carnosol against 
 <italic class="italic">P. oryzae</italic> are very close to those of the reference well-known pesticide flutriafol (0.01 mg/mL). Although this result does not validate a property of the plant extract, it constitutes a new biological property described for compound 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>. These results clearly show that the activity of carnosol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) is similar to that of flutriafol on 
 <italic class="italic">Pyricularia oryzae</italic> but not competitive to that of intraconazol on 
 <italic class="italic">Mircrosporum canis</italic>. More experiments are under way in this respect.
