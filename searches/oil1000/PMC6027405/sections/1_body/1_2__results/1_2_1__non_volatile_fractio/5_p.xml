<p class="p">5-Hydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxy flavone (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) was identified by comparison of the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR, and ESI-MS data with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectrum clearly indicated that compound 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> was a flavone containing a free phenolic OH group and two methoxy groups. The one-proton singlet at δ 13.60 in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectrum, exchangeable with D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and assignable to a phenolic proton bridged to the carbonyl group, suggested a free phenolic OH group in position C-5 [
