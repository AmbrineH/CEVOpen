<p class="p">The structure of carnosol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) was established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystallographic data were the same as those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]: orthorhombic crystal; P21212; a = 15.762 (1), b = 13.757 (1), c = 7.7747 (7) Å, Z = 4, V = 1688.2 Å3, and R = 0.031. The structure elucidation was also supported by the comparison of the

 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR and DEPT spectra indicated the presence of four methyls, four methylenes, two methines, one oxymethine, six aromatic carbons, two quaternary carbons and one ester carbon [
