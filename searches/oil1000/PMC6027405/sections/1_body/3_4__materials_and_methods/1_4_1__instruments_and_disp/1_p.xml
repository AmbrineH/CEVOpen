<p class="p">Solvents were reagent grade or HPLC grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Low pressure preparative column chromatography was carried out on Merck LiChroprep RP-18 (Darmstadt, Germany) (25–40 μm) or Merck silica gel (230–400 mesh), in reversed and normal phase column chromatography, respectively. Medium pressure flash-chromatography was carried out on Biotage

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-EtOH (4:1), followed by heating at 100 °C. The SPE columns, used for chlorophyll removal, were Discovery DSC-18 (Sigma-Aldrich) 60 mL tubes, containing 10 g of C-18 reversed phase. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter (Waltham, MA, USA) (concentration expressed in g/mL). Melting points were measured with a Thermo Scientific Fisher–Johns hot-plate instrument. Refractive indices were measured with an Abbe refractometer (Boeco Germany, Hamburg, Germany). LC-MS spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL Linear ION Trap mass spectrometer, equipped with an ESI source. X-ray crystallographic analysis was performed at the “Centro Grandi Strumenti (CGS)” of the University of Pavia. NMR spectra were recorded on an NMR Varian 400 MHz spectrometer or, alternatively, on Bruker 300 MHz and 200 MHz instruments. Chemical shifts (δ are given in ppm and coupling constants (
