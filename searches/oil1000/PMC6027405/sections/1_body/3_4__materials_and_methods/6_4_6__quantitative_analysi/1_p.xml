<p class="p">The quantitative analysis of the essential oil was performed by GC-FID, with the same instrumental configuration and method of the qualitative analysis. The constituents were quantified by external calibration, using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-nonane as the internal standard. According to the literature [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], the response factor in FID detection is almost constant and close to value 1 within isomeric compounds, allowing the use of a single standard to quantify a family of analytes, all characterized by the same molecular formula. The same considerations are reported in reference [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Therefore, an isomer was used to quantify isomeric metabolites; if an isomer was not available, a structurally closely related terpene was selected. Hence, the following terpenoids (purity &gt; 98%) were used as calibration standards: limonene for aliphatic monoterpene hydrocarbons (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9962), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene for aromatic monoterpene hydrocarbons (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9986), linalool for monoterpene alcohols (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9956), carvone for monoterpene ketones (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9958), cedrene for sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9998), and nerolidol for sesquiterpene alcohols (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9997). All calibration curves were built on six points. Quantitative results were reported as the main values and standard deviations of three replicates for each distillation.
