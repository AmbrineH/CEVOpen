<p class="p">Antifungal activities were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). MIC and MFC values were measured using a stereoscope and were determined for two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Microsporum canis</italic> (CBS 136538, from CBS-KNAW culture collection, NL), a human dermatophyte fungus, and a 
 <italic class="italic">Pyricularia oryzae</italic> (LM120 strain, isolated by S.T. and A.M.P. from leaf lesions of Italian rice varieties), a plant pathogenic fungus. The compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1%
