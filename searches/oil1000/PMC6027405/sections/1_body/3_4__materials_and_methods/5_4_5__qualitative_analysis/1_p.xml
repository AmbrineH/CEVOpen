The carrier gas (He) was set at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The analysis was performed in thermal gradient conditions, with the following temperature program: 60 °C for 5 min, increased to 110 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, then to 148 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min. and to 250 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min, and then held at 250 °C for 2.4 min. The MS was operated in a SCAN mode, with a scan rate of 2 scan/s within a mass range of 40–350
