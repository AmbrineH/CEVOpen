<p class="p">The enantioselective analysis was performed by GC-MS, under the same conditions reported above except for the oven temperature that was set according to this program: initial temperature hold at 60 째C for 2 min, then increased to 220 째C at a rate of 2 째C/min, and then held at 220 째C for 2 min. The elution order of the separated enantiomers was determined by injection of enantiomerically pure standards, available in the laboratory of one of the authors (C.B.). LRIs were calculated as in qualitative analysis, according to Van den Dool and Kratz (see
