A voucher specimen, with number PPN-la-005, was deposited at the herbarium of the “Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja”. After collection, leaves and flowers were separated and submitted to different processes. After drying in the dark at 35 °C, the leaves were submitted to solvent extraction. Fresh leaves and flowers were both steam distilled to obtain the essential oils. A quite complete study of the essential oil from leaves has recently been published [
