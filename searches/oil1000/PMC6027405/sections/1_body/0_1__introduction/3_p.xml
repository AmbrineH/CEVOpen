<p class="p">This fungus can cause two symptoms: leaf blast and neck blast [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The leaf blast is characterized by white to gray green lesions or spots with darker borders appearing on the leaves. The old lesions are elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic border. The neck blast is characterized by dark brown lesions on the base of the panicle neck, so that it cannot support the panicle. 
 <italic class="italic">P. oryzae</italic> can infect the rice plant at various growth stages [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Our research group is interested in the discovery of new antidermatophyte substances from natural resources [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and new agents against plant pathogenic fungi. The aim of this research was the isolation and identification of antifungal compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic>. In order to accomplish this task, the dermatophyte 
 <italic class="italic">Microsporum canis</italic> and the phytopatogen 
 <italic class="italic">P. oryzae</italic> were selected as targets for the in vitro antifungal assay of our samples. Up to now, the antifungal activity of this plant has been described only for the essential oil distilled from leaves [
