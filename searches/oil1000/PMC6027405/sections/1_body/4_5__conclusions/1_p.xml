<p class="p">In this work, the results of the first chemical investigation on both non-volatile and volatile secondary metabolites from the leaves and flowers, respectively, of 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> are reported. Carnosol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), ursolic acid (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>), oleanolic acid (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>), viridoflorol (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), chrysothol (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>), and 5-hydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxy flavone (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) have been isolated from the leaves. Furthermore, the chemical analysis and the enantiomeric recognition of the essential oil distilled from the flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> are described. The qualitative compositions of the essential oils from the flowers and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> have also been compared. δ-3-Carene, eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol, thujopsan-2-α-ol, β-pinene, valerianol, limonene, and β-phellandrene were the major components of both oils, while at least 16 minor compounds can be considered qualitatively different in the two volatile fractions.
