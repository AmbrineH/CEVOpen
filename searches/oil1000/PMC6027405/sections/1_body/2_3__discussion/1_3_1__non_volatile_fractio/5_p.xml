<p class="p">Oleanolic acid (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>) was isolated from more than 120 plant species, as it results from a partial survey about its occurrence in plants used in folk medicine, and its biological activity. As a typical example, both oleanolic acid (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>) and ursolic acid (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>) are present in 
 <italic class="italic">Sambucus chinesis</italic> Lindl. This plant is used in folk medicine to treat inflammatory disorders and acute hepatitis. Compounds 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> were identified as the metabolite responsible for this activity [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-11-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Ursolic acid is chemically and pharmacologically similar to oleanolic acid. The multiple uses of oleanolic or ursolic acid containing plants in folk medicines are due to anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, analgesic, cardiotonic, sedative and tonic effects, among others [
