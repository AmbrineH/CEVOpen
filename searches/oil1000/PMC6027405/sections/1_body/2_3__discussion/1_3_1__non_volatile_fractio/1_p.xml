<p class="p">Over 71 years ago, a bitter principle was isolated from sage, 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia carnosa</italic> Dougl. The natural substance, having the formula C
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">26</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, was named carnosol and noted to be a diphenolic ester, containing a hydrophenanthrene moiety, presumably identical to a compound also obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> L. Indeed, the correct structure was eventually deduced from chemical studies mainly performed on a sample isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>. It was also showed that carnosol was identical with pikrosalvin (picrosalvin) isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> L. [

 <italic class="italic">Sphacele chamaedryoides</italic>, and it was determined to be more cytotoxic against gastric tumour cells AGS than normal fibroblasts [
