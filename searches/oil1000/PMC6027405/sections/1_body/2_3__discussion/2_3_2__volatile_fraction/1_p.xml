<p class="p">The essential oil distilled from flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> is composed of monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid compounds (55.6% and 44.4% respectively). The main constituents (&gt;4%) were: δ-3-carene (24.2%), eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol (13.0%), thujopsan-2-α-ol (11.9%), β-pinene (8.0%), valerianol (5.2%), and co-eluting monoterpenoids limonene and β-phellandrene (4.5%). Since major constituents of the essential oil distilled from flowers are the same as the one distilled from leaves, the two chromatograms result in being qualitatively quite similar. However, quantitative analysis demonstrates that the overall composition of the two volatile fractions is actually different. In 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-11-00033-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the quantitative chemical composition of the two essential oils, expressed as percent abundance, is reported. Aliphatic monoterpens and sesquiterpens are the families showing the greatest difference, passing respectively from 24.5% to 48.9% in flowers and from 9.9% to 36.0% in leaves.
