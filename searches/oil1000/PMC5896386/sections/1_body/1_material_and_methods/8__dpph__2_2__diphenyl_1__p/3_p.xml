<p class="p"> where A0 is absorbance of the blank and AS is absorbance of the sample at 520 nm. Also the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the plant was obtained by plotting the percent DPPH remaining at the steady state (60 min) of the reaction against the corresponding antioxidant level. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> is the concentration of antioxidant to quench 50% DPPH under the experimental conditions.
