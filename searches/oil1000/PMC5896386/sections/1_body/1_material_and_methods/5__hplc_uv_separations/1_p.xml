<p class="p"> Methanol extract (80%) and essential oil of the plant were evaluated in this study. The main Polyphenol standards were used for separation and characterisation of phenolic compounds in the aromatic herb. The analysis of phenolic acids was performed with a HPLC system Knauer-Germany equipped with UV-Vis detector according to the method proposed the authors.

 </sup> The filtered samples were injected on Eurospher 100–5 C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column (25 cm X 4.6 mm; 5 μm) from Agilent Technologies. In this experiment, the mobile phase for the HPLC-UV system was composed of deionized water/acetic acid (2% v/v) as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B at flow rate 0.8 ml/min. The gradient used in the evaluation was as follows: from 0 to 5 min isocratic 85% A flow, from 5 to 19 min a linear gradient of 85% A to 100% B. In this process, fifteen minutes of equilibration (85% A) is required before another injection. The column temperature was maintained at 25°C and the injection volume was 20 μl. Peaks were detected at 280 nm. Finally, phenolic compounds were determined according to their UV spectra, relative retention times and comparison with reference curves.
