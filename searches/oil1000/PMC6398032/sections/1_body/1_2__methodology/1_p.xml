<p class="p">Studies with original data related to the presence of functional activity compounds in Amazonian plants (published between 1999 and 2018) were identified by searching electronic databases and reviewing citations. Among the databases were Elsevier, ScIELO, Dialnet, and Redalyc, including publications in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Eligible studies for this review included randomized controlled trials in humans, experimental animals, or cell cultures, with prospective, parallel, or crossed designs, with full text, and whose results showed a protective effect against oxidative stress and/or favorable effects on some pathological conditions. There was no restriction on the type of publication or sample size. Documents whose main information was related to technological processing or could not verify the functional effects of Amazonian plants were excluded.
