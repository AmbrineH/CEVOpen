<p class="p">In the vicinity of the Amazon River, a large number of plants grow. Many of them are slightly known by a large part of the population living in this region. Most of these plant fruits not only are edible but are potentially functional with a variety of beneficial compounds to health. Basically, the problem with native Amazonian fruits is summarized in poor processing technologies and ignorance of their functional compounds and that outside the region, we have very little knowledge of it. The aim of this mini review is to examine the state of the art of the main bioactive components of the most studied Amazonian plants.</p>
