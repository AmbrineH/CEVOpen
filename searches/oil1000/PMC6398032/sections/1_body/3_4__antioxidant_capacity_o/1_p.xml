 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the different methods used in the references examined in the present mini review. However, the comparisons are extremely complicated so it would be more appropriate to review clinical studies performed on animals, but unfortunately, to date, there are very few of them. The antioxidant capacity methods were DPPH, FRAP, TEAC, ABTS, and ORAC. Comparison of antioxidant capacity between fruits should be made only when the conditions (method, solvent, sampling, expression of results, etc.) analyzed are the same; therefore, results are not comparable with a great disadvantage that presents to compare the antioxidant capacities of various fruits.
