<p class="p">The polyphenolic profile and antioxidant activity of Colombian acai are different from the one carried out with several Brazilian acai studies. Colombian acai has higher proportions of delphinidin, cyanidin (cyanidin-3-glucoside), and ferulic acid with high antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Proanthocyanidins were detected from acai seed aqueous extract, as well as their bioactivity (antioxidant and cytotoxic activities) depending strongly on their phenolic profile. However, other nonphenolic compounds may be involved in their antioxidant activity [

Moreover, in healthy women, it has been observed that the consumption of acai pulp improves the concentration of antioxidant cellular enzymes and serum biomarkers increasing catalase activity, total antioxidant capacity, and the reduction of reactive oxygen species and carbonyl protein concentration [
