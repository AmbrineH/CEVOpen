<p class="p">Polyphenols derived from copoazú were studied evaluating the distribution and metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract of mice and the microbial metabolic conversion of a unique combination of flavonoids (flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, and flavones). These compounds are accumulated mainly in the stomach and small intestine where they could exert local effects. Procyanidin microbial metabolism was different from cocoa that contains procyanidin too [
