<p class="p">It has a moisture content of 82-83% and an acidic taste (pH~2.5). It is a delicate and easily decomposable fruit; the postharvest shelf life is shortened as a result of anthracnose and other decay problems [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Protein content and minerals are 11.9 ± 0.5 and 4 ± 0.1, respectively (dry base); soluble sugar content represents around 50% of the dry weight being its main constituent fructose. Total dietary fiber content is high compared to other tropical fruits, reaching about 35% (d/w) [

Some studies have shown antioxidant activity and a high phenolic content that differ between different arazá genotypes. Arazá fruit revealed a total phenolic quantity of 184.05 ± 8.25 mg of gallic acid/100 g of extract with antioxidant activity. No cytostatic effects have been demonstrated; however, antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activities were observed at doses of 300 mg of extract/kg of body weight; so,
