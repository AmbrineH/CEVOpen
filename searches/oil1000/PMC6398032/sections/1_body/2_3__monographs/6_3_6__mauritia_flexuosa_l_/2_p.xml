<p class="p">The moriche plant has phenolic compounds mainly flavonoids and glycosylated anthocyanins like the following: catechin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, naringenin, myricetin, vitexin, scoparin, rutin, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, epicatechin, and kaempferol [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. On the other hand, the fruits show a reasonable amount of phenolic compounds, carotenoids (with predominance of 
 <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-carotenes), and antioxidant activity, which confirms the functional potential of moriche [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Fruit pulp extracts showed six phenolic acids: p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, and quinic. Quinic acid is much more abundant than other phenolic acids in pulp; extracts also show seven kinds of flavonoids such as catechin, epicatechin, apigenin, luteolin, myricetin, kaempferol, and quercetin [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In leaves, tricine-7-O-rutinoside, apigenin-6-C-arabinoside, 8-C-glucoside (isoschaftoside), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorine), quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), luteolin-8-C-glucoside (orientin), and luteolin-6-C-glucoside (isoorientin) were identified [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Leaf extract revealed its great ability to inhibit food pathogens, like 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and a moderate antimicrobial activity when applied in fruits [
