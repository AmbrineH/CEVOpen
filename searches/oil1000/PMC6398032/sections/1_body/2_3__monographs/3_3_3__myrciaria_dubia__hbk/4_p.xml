<p class="p">It has been observed in rats with diabetes type 1 that camu-camu frozen pulp extracts attenuate hyperlipidemia and lipid peroxidation. This could be due to the presence of flavonoids such as quercetin and myricetin that would be contributing to avoid oxidative damage, relieving diabetic complications in this animal model [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Camu-camu juice has an antigenotoxic effect in acute, subacute, and chronic treatments in blood cells of mice. This effect is being observed only in ex vivo studies, with more significant results in juice acute administration, without toxic effects or posttreatment death [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Moreover, compounds such as ellagitannins, ellagic acid, quercetin glucosides, syringic acid, and myricetin could be the main reason for a protection effect against microvascular complications (associated with diabetes type 2) and against some bacterial infections; 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> evaluation showed antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, and cell rejuvenation activities [
