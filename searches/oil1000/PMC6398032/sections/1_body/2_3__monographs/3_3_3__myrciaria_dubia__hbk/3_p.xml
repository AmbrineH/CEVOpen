<p class="p">Chemical analysis by HPLC identified the presence of catechin, delphinidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, ellagic acid, and rutin. Other phenolic compounds were also present such as flavan-3-ol, flavonol, flavanone, and ellagic acid derivatives. Acid hydrolysis of phenolic fraction revealed the presence mainly of gallic and ellagic acids, which suggests that this fruit has important quantities of hydrolyzed tannins (gallotannins and/or ellagitannins) [
