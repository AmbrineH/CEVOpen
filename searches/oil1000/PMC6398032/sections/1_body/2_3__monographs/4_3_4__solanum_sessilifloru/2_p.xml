<p class="p">Its components include the presence of p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxydihydrocoumaric acid, naringenin, methyl salicylate, long-chain hydrocarbons, fatty acids, and their methyl and ethyl esters. Some of these compounds accumulate only in fruit epicarp. Chromatographic profile comparison between volatile compounds and different morphotypes (oval, small round, and large round) showed chemical differences; the oval morphotype exhibits greater chemical complexity in terms of volatile and nonvolatile metabolites. Furthermore, cytotoxic, genotoxic, and antigenotoxic potential was evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>, observing a noncytotoxic effect on bone marrow cells and a nongenotoxic effect on Wistar rats. Cocona antioxidant capacity may contribute to the antigenotoxic effects [

Finally, cocona flour administration showed a reduction of total cholesterol concentration, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), and liver cholesterol and increasing cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c) fecal excretion in hypercholesterolemic rats [
