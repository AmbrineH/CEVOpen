<p class="p">The most studied and interesting fraction of this fruit is its oil. Fruit seeds are a suitable oil source (35-60%) rich in omega 3 and 6, whose composition varies according to seed varieties. Found were significant contents of

 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherols), phytosterols (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol and stigmasterol), and phenolic compounds like ferulic acid. However, no correlations have been found between hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity. It suggests a complex interaction of different antioxidant compounds with different action modes. Although there are few studies on the sacha inchi oil effects on health, there are evidences that it could act by improving the lipid profile [
