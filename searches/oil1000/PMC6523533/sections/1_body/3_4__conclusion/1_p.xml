<p class="p">This work successfully evaluated the physicochemical and biocompatibility properties of electrospun composites based on polyurethane (PU) added with pepper mint (PM) oil and copper sulphate (CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). The fabricated composites showed improved physicochemcial properties compared to the pristine PU. Blood compatibility studies showed improved anti-coagulation time and less toxic behavior for the developed composites than the pristine PU. Finally, the cell viability of the fabricated composite was higher than the pristine PU as indicated in MTS assay. Hence, the fabricated wound dressing composite based on PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> rendering better physicochemical and biocompatible nature, mark its suitability for wound healing applications. In the future, it would be interesting to explore the cell proliferation and morphology characteristics of HDF cells using SEM analysis at different time points, which will further validate the claims of cytotoxicity.
