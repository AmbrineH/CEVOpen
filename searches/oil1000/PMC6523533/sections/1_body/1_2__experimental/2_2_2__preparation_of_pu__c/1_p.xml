<p class="p">The homogeneous solution of PU, PM oil, and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was prepared at 9 wt %, 4 v/v % and 4 wt % respectively. To make 9 wt % of PU solution, 0.315 g of PU pellets was added to 3.5 mL of DMF and stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Similarly, 80 ÂµL of PM oil was added to 2 mL of DMF and stirred for 1 hr maximum to make 4 v/v % PM solution. Further, 4 wt % of CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution was done by adding 0.080 g of CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in 2 mL of DMF and stirred for 2 h respectively. The prepared PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> homogeneous solution were added to the PU solution at an 8:1 v/v % for PU/PM and 8:0.5:0.5 v/v % for PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. In this research, the electrospinning technique was used to develop a fibrous scaffold from the prepared homogenous solution. They were electrospun at a voltage of 11 kV, a flow rate of 0.3 ml/h, and a distance of 20 cm respectively [
