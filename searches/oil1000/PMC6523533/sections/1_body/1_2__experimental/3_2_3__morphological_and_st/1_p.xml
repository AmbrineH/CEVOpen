<p class="p">Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) unit (Hitachi SU8020, Tokyo, Japan) was employed to analyze the morphology of as-spun membranes. The samples were coated with gold and imaged at different magnifications. The fiber diameter was measured using Image J software by choosing 30 locations randomly from the captured image. The wettability of the fibrous membranes was determined through static video contact angle equipment (AST products, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). Sample with a size of 1 × 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was placed on the measuring surface and deposited with a water droplet (0.5 µL). The image of the water droplet was captured within a few seconds via video camera. The computer integrated software measure the manual contact angle and the experiment was repeated for three trials. For IR analysis, the electrospun samples were measured over wavelengths between 600 and 4000 cm

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resolution in Nicolet iS 5, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA. The ATR crystal employed is Zinc Selenium (ZnSe). The thermal stability was measured in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) unit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) by heating a small piece of electrospun membrane (3 mg) between 30–1000 degree celcius under the nitrogen atmosphere. The remaining weight residue was measured at each temperature point and the obtained values were exported in an excel sheet. Finally, the surface morphology was determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) unit (NanoWizard®, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) under normal atmosphere by scanning the electrospun membrane in size of 20 um × 20 µm area and images in 256 resolution were obtained. Ra was calculated at three different locations using the integrated JPKSPM software.
