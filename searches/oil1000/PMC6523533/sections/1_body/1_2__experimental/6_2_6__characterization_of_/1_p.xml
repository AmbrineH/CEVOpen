<p class="p">HDF (Human Skin Fibroblast Cells 1184, ECACC, UK, primary cells obtained from the dermis of the skin) were cultured in DMEM medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The medium was replaced every 3 days. The electrospun membranes with dimensions of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm were cut and placed in the 96 well plates. Once the cells reached 80% confluence, they were seeded onto the scaffolds at a density of 10 × 10

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. MTS assay was used to determine the cell viability of the cells after 5 days culturing. After 5 days of culture, the medium in which cell is grown on the electrospun membranes was added with 20% of MTS solution and incubated for 4 h. After 4 hr, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader.
