 <sub class="sub">4</sub> composite was measured by universal testing equipment (Gotech Testing Machines, AI-3000). The samples with a size of 40 mm × 15 mm was clamped in the testing machine with a gauge length of 20 mm. The test was performed at a velocity of 10 mm/min with a load cell of 500 N at room temperature. The computer integrated software displays the stress–strain curve from which the average tensile strength at maximum stress was measured.
