<p class="p">Hemolysis assay was done to investigate the toxicity of electrospun membranes with red blood cells. Initially, the samples (1 × 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were soaked in 0.9% w/v of physiological saline at 37 °C for 30 min. Next, they were added with a mixture of aliquots of citrated blood and diluted saline (4:5) for 1 h at 37 °C. After, the samples were retrieved and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Finally, the supernatant was aspirated and the optical density was recorded at 542 nm which depicts the release of haemoglobin. The percentage of hemolysis or hemolytic index was calculated using the formula 
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Hemolysis ratio (HR)=(TS−NC)/(PC−NC)×100
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where TS, NC, and PC are measured absorbance values of the test sample, negative control, and positive control at 542 nm, respectively.
