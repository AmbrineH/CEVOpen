<p class="p">To analyse the effect of PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> incorporation on the surface roughness of the pristine PU, AFM was performed. The representative 3D images of the fibrous membranes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. The average roughness (R
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) of the pristine PU ranged 776 ± 468 nm, while the PU incorporated with PM and PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> have an average roughness of 1039 ± 198 nm and 515 ± 123 nm, respectively. The surface roughness measurements depicted that the fabricated PU/PM composites have rougher surfaces, while PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> had smoother surfaces compared to the pristine PU. Hyung Hwan Kim et al studied the effect of fiber diameter on surface roughness in electrospun polycaprolactone membrane. It was reported that the average surface roughness was increased with an increase in fiber diameter. Our electrospun PU/PM oil showed a larger fiber diameter which might favor the improvement in the surface roughness. In contrast, the electrospun PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> displayed smaller fiber morphology which results in smooth surfaces [

 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The smooth surface will have a smaller fiber diameter which would be suitable for the fibroblast cells to adhere and grow [

 <xref rid="B33-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The influence of surface roughness on the cellular response is still unclear and the various physico-chemical properties of the manufactured composites might have a role in the cell adhesion behavior. To state, the smaller fiber diameter favors the enhanced adhesion of protein which results in large cell attachment and proliferation [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Further, the adequate porosity also helps in efficient transport of nutrients and waste removal for better cell adhesion and growth [
