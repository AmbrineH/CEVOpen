<p class="p">Mechanical testing of the electrospun membranes was indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00586-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The tensile testing clearly indicated that the tensile strength of the pristine PU was enhanced on incorporating PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. PU showed a tensile strength of 6.83 MPa and, on adding PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, it was increased to 7.04 MPa and 13.60 MPa, respectively.
