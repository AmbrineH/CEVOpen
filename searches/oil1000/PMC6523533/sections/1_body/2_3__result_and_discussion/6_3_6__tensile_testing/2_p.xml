<p class="p">The increase in tensile strength was perhaps due to the homogeneous dispersion of PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in the polymer matrix. Unnithan et al. electrospun wound dressing scaffold utilizing polyurethane (Mw = 110,000), Medical grade) and emu oil. It was observed that the polyurethane/emu oil having smaller fiber diameter favored the enhancement of the tensile strength. They concluded that the addition of emu oil might favor the attachment of fibers owing to the hydrogen bond formation between polyurethane and emu oil molecules [

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. Jaganathan et al. fabricated a wound dressing polyurethane (Tecoflex EG 80A) scaffold added with zinc nitrate. It was found that the zinc nitrate incorporation into the polyurethane exhibited improvement in the mechanical strength which correlates with our findings. They concluded this behavior was because of the smaller fiber diameter (568 ± 136.69 nm) of the electrospun composites compared to the polyurethane (1159 ± 147.48 nm) [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our fiber diameter reduction was found to be similar to that reported above, which might have resulted in the improvement of the mechanical strength.
