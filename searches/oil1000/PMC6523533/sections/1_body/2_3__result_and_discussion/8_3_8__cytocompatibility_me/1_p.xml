After five days of cell culture, it was observed that the HDF cells were well adhered and proliferated in all electrospun membranes compared to the control plates. The cell viability percentage for the PU membrane was reported to be 130 ± 4%, while the electrospun PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> composites showed cell viability of 133 ± 11% and 144 ± 3%, respectively. Further, HDF cells viability in the electrospun PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> composites was observed to be higher than the PU/PM composites. As reported in the introduction section, PM oil contains polyphenols as one of their bioactive constituents. It has been reported that the phenolic components help in protecting the fibroblast cells against oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide resulting in cell proliferation and migration. The phenolic compounds present in the PM oil might have influenced cell viability [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The reason for the improved HDF cell viability was perhaps due to their smaller fiber diameter (PU/PM) and hydrophilic behavior (PU/PM/ CuSO
