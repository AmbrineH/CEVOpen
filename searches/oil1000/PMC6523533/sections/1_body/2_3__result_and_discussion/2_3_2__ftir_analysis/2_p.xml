<p class="p">The band at 3322 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicates the stretching of NH group, peaks at 2932 and 2853 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> represent the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CH, and twin peaks at 1730 and 1702 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to the CO group. The vibration of the NH group was observed at 1531 and 1597 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and for CH vibrations it was shown at 1414 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The other sharp peaks at 1220, 1078, and 770 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicate the CO group with respect to alcohol [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. For composite membranes, it was found that no new peaks were observed but the intensity of PU was altered (increasing for PU/PM and decreasing for PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) indicating a formation of a stronger hydrogen bond [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The hydrogen bond was formed between molecules of PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> with PU. The hydrogen bond formation was due to the combination of OH and CH molecules present in PM oil with the molecules of the pristine PU. Hence, the FTIR study confirms the existence of PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in the polyurethane matrix.
