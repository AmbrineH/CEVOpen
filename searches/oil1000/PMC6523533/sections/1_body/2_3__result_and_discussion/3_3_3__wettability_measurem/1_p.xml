<p class="p">The contact angle is a measure of the wettability of the developed membranes. The static contact angle (CA) measurements of the pure PU and their composites were presented. The pure PU fibrous membrane showed a contact angle of 106° ± 3° indicating its hydrophobic behavior. Upon the incorporation of PM into the polyurethane matrix, the contact angle was increased to 111° ± 2°, indicating higher hydrophobicity than the pristine PU. On another hand, the addition of CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> to the PU/PM resulted in the hydrophilic nature showing a contact angle of 82° ± 1°. Hence, the addition of CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> improved the wettability of the polymer matrix. Jaganathan et al. electrospun polyurethane (Tecoflex EG 80A) scaffold incorporated with zinc particles for wound dressing applications. It was reported that the incorporation of zinc particles improved the wettability of the pristine PU which correlates with our observation. The contact of polyurethane was reported to be 100° ± 0.5774°, while polyurethane added with zinc nitrate displayed contact angle of 84° ± 4.041°. Further, the scaffold with improved wettability exhibited enhanced fibroblast cells adhesion than the pristine PU [

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> improved the wettability of the PU/PM which might be suitable for better fibroblast cell adhesion and proliferation.
