<p class="p">The thermal properties of electrospun PU, PU/PM, and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. In the case of pristine PU, the initial degradation temperature was observed to be 266 °C, while for electrospun PU/PM the temperature was increased to 286 °C and for PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, it was decreased to 227 °C. Hence, the thermal properties were increased with the addition of PM. However, adding CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> into the polymer matrix decreased its thermal stability. The decrease in the thermal stability was due to the moisture evaporation present in the copper sulphate pentahydrate. Further, DTG was performed for the electrospun membranes as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> and their weight loss peaks were listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00586-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. From the results obtained, the electrospun PU/PM showed only three weight loss peaks compared to the pristine PU showing four weight loss peaks. However, electrospun PU/PM/CuSO4 showed weight loss peaks as that of pristine PU, but their weight loss intensity was decreased. Hence, the reduced weight loss peaks and decrease in weight loss intensity confirms the reduced weigh loss of the fabricated nanocomposites. Moreover, this attribute also confirms the presence of PM and CuSO4 in the polyurethane matrix.
