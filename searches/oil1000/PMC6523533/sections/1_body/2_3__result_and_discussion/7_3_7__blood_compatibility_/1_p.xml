<p class="p">The dressing materials used for wound treatment will frequently come in contact with body fluids such as leakage of plasma and other blood components. If the dressing material does not have hemo-compatible properties, there might be risk of activating an undesired immune response which ultimately result in formation of thrombosis, inflammation, and foreign body reaction. This in turn delays the wound healing process. Hence, an ideal wound dressing should possess better blood compatible properties [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Blood clotting time of the electrospun PU, PM, and PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was measured using APTT and PT assay. The coagulation assays showed the enhanced anticoagulant nature of the electrospun PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> compared to the PU membrane as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. The developed PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mat exhibited blood clotting time of 175 ± 4 s and 172 ± 4 s (mean differences were significant compared with pure PU (p &lt; 0.05)), while the PU showed blood clotting time of 155 ± 2 s as calculated in the APTT assay. Similarly, the developed PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mat exhibited blood clotting time of 84 ± 2 s and 82 ± 2 s (mean differences were significant compared with pure PU (p &lt; 0.05)), while the PU showed blood clotting time of 70 ± 1 s as calculated in the PT assay. The existence of PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in the PU matrix delayed the blood clotting time. Further, the hemolytic assay was measured to analyse the electrospun membranes toxicity with red blood cells. The results of hemolytic assay represent that the index value of the electrospun PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mat was found to be lower than pristine PU. The pristine PU showed an index value of 2.7% and for the electrospun PU/PM and PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mat, it was 1.66% and 1.85% (mean differences were significant compared with pure PU (p &lt; 0.05)) as denoted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>. The fabricated composite was considered as non-hemolytic because its index value was less than 2% according to ASTMF756-00(2000) [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In blood compatibility assessments, the electrospun PU/PM oil showed prolonging blood clotting time compared to the pure polyurethane. However, there is a slight reduction in the blood clotting time while blending CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> to the PU/PM but the observed blood clotting values were still higher than the pristine PU. According to Huang et al, the blood compatibility is influenced by multiple surface parameters such as wettability, fiber diameter, and surface roughness [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Jaganathan et al. electrospun a novel scaffold based on polyurethane and mustard oil. They found the improvement in the blood compatibility of the pristine PU with the addition of mustard oil and reported this might be because of an increase in surface roughness [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In another study, Ayyar et al. electrospun polyurethane scaffold incorporated with indhulekha oil and determined its anticoagulant nature. It was found that the electrospun PU/indhulekha oil composite with hydrophobic behavior showed prolonged blood clotting time than the pristine PU [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Further, Jaganathan et al. 2017 developed polyurethane scaffold loaded with castor oil using the electrospinning technique. The developed PU/castor oil showed prolonged blood clotting time compared to the pristine PU and this may be due to their smaller fiber diameter [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Hence, the addition of PM and CuSO4 into the PU matrix caused reduced fiber diameter morphology (PU/PM/CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and hydrophobic behavior (PU/PM) which might have resulted in the improvement of the anticoagulant nature.
