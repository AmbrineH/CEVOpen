<p class="p">FESEM images of the prepared electrospun fibrous mats are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00586-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. All the as-spun nanofibrous scaffolds showed a non-woven structure with smooth and beadless morphology. The average fiber size for pure PU was found to be 915 ± 137 nm, while the PU incorporated with PM and PM/ CuSO4 exhibited fiber sizes of 997 ± 134 nm and 359 ± 166 nm, respectively (mean differences were significant compared with pure PU (p &lt; 0.05)). Hence, the addition of PM increased the fiber diameter of the pristine PU, while adding CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> resulted in a decrease in fiber diameter. The alteration in fiber diameter morphology was due to a change in solution parameters while adding PM and CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> into the polyurethane matrix. The increase in fiber diameter of PU adding PM oil was due to the interaction of PM oil bioactive constituents with the PU molecules. On the other hand, adding CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> to the PU/PM, CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plays a vital role in reducing the fiber diameter which may be due to the interaction of PM oil bioactive constituents with the CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> particles. Similar observations were seen in a recent work (Jaganathan et al.), which fabricated polyurethane (Tecoflex EG 80A) scaffold with added copper particles for wound dressing applications. It was found that the addition of copper particles resulted in the reduction of the fiber diameter which correlates with our observation. Further, in their work, the developed composites showed an enhanced proliferation rate of fibroblast cells than the pristine PU [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The fiber diameter of the fabricated composites showed a reduced fiber diameter compared to the pristine PU which might be conducive for the wound dressing applications. Further, EDS study was performed to confirm the presence of copper in the polyurethane matrix. From 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00586-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, it was evident that the polyurethane matrix showed some content of copper (1.5%) in addition to the carbon and oxygen content.
