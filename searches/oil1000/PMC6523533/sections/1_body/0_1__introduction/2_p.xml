<p class="p">Nanofibers were fabricated using various processing techniques such as emulsion freeze drying, self-assembly, and phase separation [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The nanofibers fabricated using the above techniques were used in several applications such as energy applications [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], treatment of water and environment [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], healthcare, and biomedical engineering [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, the nanofibers produced using these techniques does not meet the requirements of the ideal wound dressing membrane because of their large diameters and low porosity [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In addition, the nanofibers based on the electrospinning technique were widely used in biomedical applications because of their large surface area to volume ratios and porous structure [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The small interconnected pores of the electrospun membranes do not help suitable cellular response and tissue ingrowth. However, the pore size can be tailor made by optimizing or tuning the electrospinning parameters such as voltage, flow rate and collector distance [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Tang et al. reported that the increase in flow rate resulted in an increase in fiber diameter [
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Similarly, Zhang et al observed that the low voltage favors the smaller fiber diameter while the high voltage results in broader fiber diameter [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Further, Yuan et al. reported that the thin fiber was formed for a larger collector distance and vice versa [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Tarus et al reported that the solvent with lower surface tension causes smoother fibers and fibers will be higher for other solvents with higher surface tension [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Further, electrospinning is a cost effective, facile, and well established technique used to fabricate nanofibers from both natural and synthetic polymers [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Some of the natural polymers used in the wound dressing were chitosan, collagen, alginate, gelatin, chitin, and silk fibroin. While the synthetic polymers used were poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(lactic acid), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(ethylene oxide) [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In this study, the Tecoflex EG 80A was used to fabricate the wound dressing scaffold. It belongs to the family of aliphatic polyether polyurethanes. It possesses good mechanical and ultraviolet (UV) stability [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. For the past few decades, it was widely used in biomedical applications because of its biocompatible and biodegradable behaviour, oxidative and thermal stability [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>].
