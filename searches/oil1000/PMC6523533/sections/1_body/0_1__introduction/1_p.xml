<p class="p">The largest organ in the human body is skin which plays a critical role in homeostasis and inhibits microorganism invasion. A wound is an injury to the skin when the skin tissue gets damaged. An injury is caused due to trauma, burns, or other by other factors like foot ulcers due to diabetes. Once the skin gets affected, it should be treated immediately, otherwise it can cause acute pain, serious infections, and also wound burden [
