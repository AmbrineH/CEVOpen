<p class="p">An ideal scaffold for wound dressing must possess improved biocompatibility for influencing the fibroblast adhesion and also have antimicrobial activity to inhibit the microbes penetration. Unnithan et al. studied electrospun polyurethane (Mw = 110,000, Medical grade) scaffold with added emu oil fibers. It was shown that the emu oil incorporated PU scaffolds showed enhanced adhesion of fibroblast cells compared to the pristine polyurethane [

In another study, Jaganathan et al. fabricated polyurethane (Tecoflex EG 80A) scaffold added with grape seed oil, honey, and propolis. It was reported that the addition of grape seed improved the fibroblast adhesion compared to the pristine PU [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Hence these studies have proved that the addition of essential oil influenced the fibroblast adhesion and proliferation. Hence, these types of studies motivated us to use pepper mint (PM) oil for wound dressing applications. Mentha piperita L., known as peppermint oil, is a medicinal plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It is widely found in temperate areas of the world, mainly in North America, Europe, and North Africa. Peppermint is composed of 29–48% menthol, about 20–31% 
 <underline class="underline">menthone</underline>, 6.8% menthofuran, and 3–10% menthyl acetate. Other bioactive compounds include flavonoids, caffeic acid, polyphenols, tocopherols, carotenes, tannins, betaine, and choline [

 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Owing to their various bioactive constituents, it was used in food, cosmetic, and clinical applications. It has been utilized for treating colds, cancers, cramps, indigestion, sore throat, nausea, and toothaches. The polyphenolic constituents of PM oil might stimulate the immune system and help in preventing colds and similar viral infections [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These constituents also help in protecting the cells from free radicals and exert anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Further, it has been reported to possess some biomedical activities of an antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant nature [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore for wound dressing applications, it must impart or enhance the antimicrobial activity. Hence, it is necessary to add some efficient antibacterial agents into the fabricated scaffolds. In this research the copper sulphate (CuSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) is selected. Literature reported that silver, copper, and zinc are less toxic with excellent antimicrobial activity compared to the other metallic particles. In addition to promising antimicrobial activity, copper also plays a vital role in aiding the various physiological and metabolic processes like promoting endothelial cells growth, accelerating angiogenesis, and equilibrium of extracellular skin proteins [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-11-00586" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The aim of this research is to develop and characterize a novel wound dressing scaffold based on polyurethane added with PM oil and CuSO
