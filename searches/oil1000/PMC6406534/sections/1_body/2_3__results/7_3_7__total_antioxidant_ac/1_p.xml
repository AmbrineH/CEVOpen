<p class="p">Although the extracts wholly exhibited an effective reducing power of the radical species target DPPH

The strongest antiradical potential was detected in January (91.02%) which was not constant, and it significantly decreased from February, and the extracts collected in March showed lower total antioxidant activity (TAA) (86.90%). The TAA of the extracts began to increase during spring and summer and peaked in July (90.15%). After that, a significant decrease trend was observed in the ability to scavenge free radicals of the extracts harvested in August and September. The TAA increased again from October to January (
