<p class="p">The quantitative analysis of total flavonoid content (TFC) showed a significant difference in the diverse seasons (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, there was a high level of TFC when the plants were harvested in the winter and summer, while its amount was low during the spring and autumn seasons. The maximum amount of TFC was found in December (11.31 mg QUE/g DW) and remained constant in January and, then, clearly decreased from the end of the winter season (February) and finally reached the minimum level in the middle of the spring (March) (9.40 mg QUE/g DW). Afterwards, a considerable rise occurred in June (11 mg QUE/g DW) which followed on July (10.92 mg QUE/g DW). However, this rate remained unchanged, and it began to increase again from September to December after a sharp drop in August (9.64 mg QUE/g DW).
