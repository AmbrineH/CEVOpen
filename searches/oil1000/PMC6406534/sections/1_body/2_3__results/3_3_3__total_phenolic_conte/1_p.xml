 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The TPC gradually increased in December and reached its maximum amount in January (13.69 mg GAE/g DW). Then, a slight drop in TPC occurred in February (12.49 mg GAE/g DW) and March (11.19 mg GAE/g DW). Although, there was no significant difference among TPC of March, April, and May extracts, it increased slightly in spring, and the highest content was obtained in early summer (13.52 mg GAE/g DW). TPC dramatically declined from to September (9.48 mg GAE/g DW). The samples collected in autumn contained a lower value of TPC than those collected in other seasons. However, the least amount was recorded in September (9.48 mg GAE/g DW).
