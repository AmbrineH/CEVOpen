<p class="p">Total anthocyanin content (TAC) significantly differed (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) from one month to another (1.26â€“2.81 mg C3G/100 mL). The pattern of seasonal variation of the TAC was interestingly quite reverse with respect to the TFFC pattern. The plants collected in winter contained higher levels of TAC compared with other seasons, and the maximum amount was observed in January (2.81 mg C3G/100 mL). Conversely, the anthocyanins were in lower concentrations during spring and especially summer. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, it declined from February to August with relatively sharp slope and the least level was obtained when the plants were harvested in August (1.26 mg C3G/100 mL), which was 2-fold less than that obtained in January. Then, the TAC increased during autumn from September to November.
