<p class="p">A quite different trend in the amount of caryophyllene oxide in fresh and dried sample’s oils from other components was found. The amount of this constituent in the fresh plant’s oils of summer and winter seasons was higher than in spring and autumn seasons and the maximum content was obtained in January (6.38%). The maximum of caryophyllene oxide of dried sample oils was observed in June (7.29%) whereas the least amount was obtained when plants were collected in September (4.48%). Similarly, the variations in the amount of (5E,9Z)-farnesyl-aceton, (6Z,10Z)-Pseudo phytol, phytol, and 7α-hydroxy-manool throughout the year was the same as those of caryophyllene oxide changes.</p>
