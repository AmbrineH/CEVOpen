<p class="p">Sabinene, caryophyllene oxide, (6Z,10Z)-Pseudo phytol, (5E,9Z)-farnesyl-aceton, phytol, and α-pinene in fresh oils were less than in dried ones. In contrast, the fresh oils contained higher amounts of the β-caryophyllene, laurenene, phytane, manool oxide, and abietadiene compared with dried aerial parts. The most abundant chemical groups of the total fresh and dried sample’s oils were sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and monoterpenes. However, the fresh oils were richer in sesquiterpene and diterpene hydrocarbons, and the dry oils contained higher amounts of the oxygenated types of diterpenes and sesquiterpenes.</p>
