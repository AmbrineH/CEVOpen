 <xref rid="foods-08-00052-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> clearly shows a high variability in the percentages of the EO composition throughout the year. The biosynthesis of β-caryophyllene, as a major constituent of Arabian lilac’s oil, markedly varied in different months and its annual fluctuation trend was the same for both fresh and dried oils. β-Caryophyllene in fresh oils had an ascendant trend from January, and the highest level was recorded in March (35.03%). Then, there was a clear decline during April and May. Moreover, the lowest level was obtained in June (22.60%). The amount of β-caryophyllene of dry oils increased continuously from February and declined again after rising in September. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum percentage of β-caryophyllene in dry oils were recorded in September (32.43%) and February (25.14%), respectively.
