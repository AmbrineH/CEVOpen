<p class="p">The results demonstrated that the EO content underwent profound changes that seemed to strongly depend on the collection time (

The oil content of these samples began to increase from January and reached the highest amount (0.22%) at the beginning of the heat period (March). After that, the accumulation of EO gradually decreased from April, and the lowest amount was obtained in July (0.09%). There was a significant difference between the oil content of the plants collected from August to December. Similarly, the accumulation of oils increased again with a slight slope in August and September and showed the second peak in October (0.18%). Then, the percentage of EO declined from November and eventually reached its lowest level in December (0.10%). The dried aerial parts of plants contained more EOs than fresh ones varying in the range of 0.21 to 0.45%. Moreover, the essential oil content of the dried aerial parts significantly changed during the different seasons (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and showed a pattern similar to the one reported for the fresh aerial parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The maximum amount of oils was detected in March (0.45%), followed by October and November (0.39%) while the minimum was recorded in August (0.21%).
