<p class="p">The assessment of total anthocyanin content (TAC) content was performed by the pH differential method [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Fresh leaves (3 g) were extracted with 20 mL solvent methanol: 10 N HCL (90:10%, 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>). The obtained extract was shaken at 200 rpm for 10 min, and the sample solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, 4 mL supernatant were separated and diluted with 36 mL of two different buffers; potassium chloride pH = 1.0 (0.025 M) and sodium acetate pH = 4.5 (0.4 M), respectively. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature and dark, the absorbance of samples was measured at 520 and 700 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1201). The concentration of anthocyanin calculated using Equations (1) and (2).
