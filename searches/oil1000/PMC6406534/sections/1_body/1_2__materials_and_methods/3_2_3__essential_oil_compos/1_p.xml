<p class="p">The essential oils were analyzed by Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometer; HP-5MS (5%-phenyl–95%-methyl polysiloxane) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA); helium carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min; injector temperature 280 °C; detector temperature 300 °C; column temperature 40 °C (1 min)–300 °C (3 min) at 5 °C/min. The injection was done with a split ratio of 10:1. Scanning (1 scan/s) was accomplished in the range 50 to 500

The gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analyses were performed with a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column CP-Sil8-CB (5%-diphenyl–95%-dimethyl polysiloxan, Agilent technologies, CA, CA, USA) of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness, using the same conditions of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The relative number of individual components of oil were calculated by the GC peak and arranged in order of GC elution. EOs constituents were identified based on the retention indices relative to C
