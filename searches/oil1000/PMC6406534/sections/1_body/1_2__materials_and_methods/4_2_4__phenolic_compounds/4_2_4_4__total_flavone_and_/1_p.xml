<p class="p">The total flavones and flavanols were assayed according to the modified method of Popova et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In brief, the methanolic extract (1 mL) was mixed with 1 mL of AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (5%), and the sample solution was adjusted to 2.5 mL with methanol (70%). The absorbance of samples was recorded at 425 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1201). Quercetin solution (0–35 μg/mL) was used as a reference standard, and total flavone and flavanol content was expressed as mg QUE/g of dry weight.
