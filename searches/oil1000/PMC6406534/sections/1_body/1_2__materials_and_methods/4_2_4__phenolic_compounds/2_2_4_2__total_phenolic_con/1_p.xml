<p class="p">Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined by the spectrophotometric method using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent described by Wojdylo et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Briefly, the methanolic extract (100 µL) was mixed with 200 µL of Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent (50%) and 2 mL of deionized water in a test tube. After 3 min, 1 mL of 20% Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution was added to the test tube and vortexed well. The mixture was maintained for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance of the samples was recorded at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1201, Kyoto, Japan). The concentration of total phenolics was calculated based on a standard curve of gallic acid (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 μg/mL) as a reference and expressed as mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/g of dry weight.
