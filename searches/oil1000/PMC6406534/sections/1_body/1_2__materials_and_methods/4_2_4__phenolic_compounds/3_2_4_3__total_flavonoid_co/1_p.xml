<p class="p">The determination of total flavonoid content (TFC) was performed by the aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. For this purpose, 1 mL of the extracted sample solution was blended with 300 µL of NaNO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution (5%). After 5 min, 600 µL of AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (10%) was added to the reaction mixture that was allowed to remain for 6 min. Then, NaOH (4 mL, 1 M) was added to the sample solution and adjusted to 10 mL with distilled water. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer. A calibration curve was constructed with quercetin solutions at concentrations 0 to 1000 μg/mL, and TFC was expressed in term of mg QUE (quercetin equivalents)/g of dry weight.
