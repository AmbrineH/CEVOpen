<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the extracts was estimated by the reduction of free radical DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method, as described by Oke et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] with minor modifications. The methanol extract (100 µL) was mixed with 5 mL of 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH radical. The reaction mixture was vigorously shaken, then incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance was read against a blank (methanol) at 517 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1201 spectrophotometer, and the percentage of antioxidant activity was calculated as Equation (3). 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">AA = [(A

 </disp-formula> where, AA is antioxidant activity expressed as a percentage, A
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> is absorbance of the blank (containing reaction mixture without sample extract) and A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub> is absorbance of the reaction mixture with sample extract.
