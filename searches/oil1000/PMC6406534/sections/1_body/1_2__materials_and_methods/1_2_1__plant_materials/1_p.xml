Plant material was taxonomically identified by the botanist Dr. Mehrangiz Chehrazi and voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium (KHAU-235). One kilogram of plant material was collected from five trees close to each other during the year. Samples were harvested from all (four) sides of each plant. The samples were mixed; half (500 g) was used to extract EO and stored in liquid nitrogen to determine total anthocyanin content. The second portion (500 g) was shade dried at room temperature (20–25 °C) to extract the EO of dried aerial parts and measure total phenolic, flavonoid, flavone, and flavanol contents and antiradical capacity.
