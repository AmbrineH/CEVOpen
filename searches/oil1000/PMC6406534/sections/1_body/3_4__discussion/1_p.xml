<p class="p">In the current study, the EO content extracted from fresh and dried aerial parts of Arabian lilac significantly varied in different collection periods and the samples harvested in spring and autumn showed higher EO contents than those collected during summer and winter. It seems that the increase of EO content (due to defense and protection roles) in the mentioned seasons might be related to the plant's exposure to stress because of a sudden change in environmental and climate conditions in the early spring (when the temperature begins to warm) and early autumn (when temperature begins to cool) (

On the other hand, the decrease in EO content during the summer and winter seasons could be due to change in the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites toward the production of metabolites with more defensive potential such as phenolic compounds.
