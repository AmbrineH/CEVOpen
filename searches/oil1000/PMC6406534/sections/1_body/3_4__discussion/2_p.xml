<p class="p">The variety of the EO’s composition is influenced by some factors including radiation, humidity, soil condition, and temperature. Environmental stresses during seasonal variations can also alter the biosynthetic pathways [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In our findings, β-caryophyllene clearly decreased in summer and winter. Since β-caryophyllene is converted to its oxidized form, namely caryophyllene oxide, through an oxidation reaction, the reduction of the level of this component (in fresh and dried aerial parts’ oils) and increase of caryophyllene oxide in these seasons could be ascribed to oxidative stress due to high and low temperature as well as the activation of enzymes of the oxidation reactions. Moreover, the opposite variation patterns of manool with other components of the same class and the reduction of their content in the fresh and dried plant’s oils collected in summer and winter could be attributed to their conversion to oxidized and hydroxylated forms such as manool oxide and 7α-hydroxy-manool, respectively (
