<p class="p">According to the literature, this is a first-time evaluation of changes in the TAC during the year. The TAC of the plant obtained in winter was significantly higher than in other seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). A significant increase in the concentration of anthocyanins in the winter seems to be probably a defense mechanism against low temperature stress to reduce the damage of cell and tissue freezing [

 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], it seems that the decrease in temperature during winter has led to a change in the biosynthesis of flavones towards the production of anthocyanins, thereby reducing flavones and increasing anthocyanins.
