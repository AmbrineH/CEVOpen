<p class="p">Moreover, there were two peaks in the quantities of TPC and TFC during the summer and winter while their amount declined significantly in the spring and autumn (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The increase in the TPC of extracts collected in summer and winter could be associated to the high quantity of flavones and flavanols content of Arabian lilac in summer and anthocyanins content in winter. Hence, the amount of TPC and TFC decreased in spring and autumn that could be related to a shift in the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites towards the production of EOs in the plant. It seems that when the plant encounters oxidative stress due to a sudden change of temperature in the early spring and autumn, the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites in the plant is directed toward the production of EOs rather than phenolic compounds [
