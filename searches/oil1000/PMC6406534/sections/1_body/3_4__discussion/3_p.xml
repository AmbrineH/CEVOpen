The current study showed the total flavone, and flavanol contents of Arabian lilac significantly varied through the year and extract collected in summer, particularly on July, contained higher amounts of total flavones and flavanols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00052-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Regarding the ability of flavonoids to inhibit free radicals and the results obtained in this study, it seems that flavones and flavanols represent a defense mechanism of Arabian lilac against severe heat stress in the summer to reduce the harmful and destructive effects of the oxidative stress caused by heat stress. Our findings confirmed the results of Bujor et al. [
