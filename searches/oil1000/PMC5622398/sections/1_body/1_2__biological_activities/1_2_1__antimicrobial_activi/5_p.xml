<p class="p">The antimicrobial properties of EOs are mediated via several mechanisms: (a) EOs disrupt the permeability barrier in cells and induce various morphological and physiological changes (lipophilic moieties of the EOs attack the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to changes in membrane stability, hydrophobicity, fluidity, and fatty acid composition [

 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ions, resulting in the inhibition of H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ion-dependent movement of solutes across the membrane and the disruption of the intracellular pH.
