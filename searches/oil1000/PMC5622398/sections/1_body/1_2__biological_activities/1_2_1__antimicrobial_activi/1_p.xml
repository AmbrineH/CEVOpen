<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of essential oils has been widely reported by Hammer et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and Dorman and Deans [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. These authors reported that phenolic compounds present in essential oils, for example, carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol (from various plant origins), are active against many microorganisms. They show different activities against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, mainly due to the position of the hydroxyl group in the phenolic structure of the terpenes [
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The main mechanism of antibacterial activity is the denaturation of proteins. An increase in the antibacterial activity of terpenoids depends on the type of alkyl substituent incorporated in a non-phenolic cycle. The presence of a carbonyl function in the terpenoidsâ€™ chemical structure also increases the antibacterial properties. Another aspect which influences the bioactivity of essential oils is their stereochemistry and the introduction of a double bond which increases the activity against Gram-negative bacteria [
