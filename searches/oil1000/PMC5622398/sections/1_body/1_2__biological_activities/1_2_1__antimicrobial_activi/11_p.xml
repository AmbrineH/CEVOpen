Since EOs possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, and antiviral properties, their use may be part of a good strategy to control meat spoilage. Despite this, they may also represent some disadvantages: EOs may eliminate certain types of bacterial populations and produce favourable environments for the promotion of virulence and the growth of undesirable microorganisms. Additionally, strong aromas and flavours associated with EOs may cause negative organoleptic changes which will affect the consumer acceptability of the meat. Finally, it also must be noted that some EO phytochemicals interact with meat constituents and, in this way, reduce the efficacy of the EOsâ€™ meat spoilage prevention.
