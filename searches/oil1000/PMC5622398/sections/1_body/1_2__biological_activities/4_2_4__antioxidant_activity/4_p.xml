<p class="p">The antioxidant property of essential oils and their components has often been verified in vitro by physical–chemical determination. In this respect, Kulisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] studied the oxidation of lard in the presence/absence of some EOs (
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic>) or their components. These EOs showed a strong phenolic profile characterized by the presence of the phenolic monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol. The antioxidant capacity of the essential oils was lower in comparison to α-tocopherol, synthetic antioxidants (BHA and BHT), and ascorbic acid. Different cases of synergism between EO components were reported, for example oregano EO (containing 67% thymol + carvacrol and ~14% terpinene). In contrast, for 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> EOs (80% thymol + carvacrol and ~5.5% γ-terpinene), an intermediate behaviour was reported. Regarding the application of essential oils in food systems, different studies have reported that EOs prevented unwanted oxidation and controlled oxidative spoilage in bakery products [
