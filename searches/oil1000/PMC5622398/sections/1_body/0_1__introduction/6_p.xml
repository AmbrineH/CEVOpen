<p class="p">Plants synthesize essential oils for a variety of purposes, including protection of the plant against fungi and bacteria, allelopathic activity, defence against insects (terpenoids are known to repel animals and insects) and attraction of pollinators and dispersal agents to favour the dispersion of seeds and pollens (the aromas and scents of the plants are responsible for the attraction of insects by the essential oils, characterized by volatility and a strong odour). Essential oils can protect plants against viruses, bacteria, fungi, insects, and herbivores [
