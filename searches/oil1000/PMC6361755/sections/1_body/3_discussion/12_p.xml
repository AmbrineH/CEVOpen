<p class="p">One of the challenges to use essential oils to preserve food is the high cost that can be up to six times higher than chemical fungicides (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burt (2004)</xref> reported that the increase in the demand of essential oils can result in bioengineering of their synthesis in plants. Also, large scale production could reduce production cost. According to the European Pharmacopoeia, to develop the applications of essential oils, a minimum of 2 mL/kg of plants at flowering shoots is required (
