<p class="p">The main compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> essential oil found in our study were oxygenated sesquiterpenes such as spathulenol and nerolidol that have high hydrophobicity, thereby allowing easier penetration across the plasma membrane and interaction with intracellular proteins and/or intra-organelle sites (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). The surface polarity of spathulenol and nerolidol is 20.2 Å
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and these compounds have one hydrogen bond donor and one acceptor (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pajouhesh and Lenz (2005)</xref> reported that drugs with a PSA of 60 Å
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> or less are completely absorbed by the cell, whereas those with at least 140 Å
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> are not. Therefore, spathulenol as well as nerolidol are able to interact and pass through the cellular membrane.
