<p class="p">The physical and chemical characteristics and the yield of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> essential oil obtained in our study were different from the ones reported by 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fabiane et al. (2008)</xref>. For these authors, 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> leaf essential oil had yield of 1.5%, density of 91 g/mL, and refraction index of 1.4593. The differences may be related to the utilized plant part in the extraction of the essential oil. In our study, aerial parts were used and harvested during the flowering period when there is a natural increase in the production of the plant essential oil to attract pollinators. In the report by 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fabiane et al. (2008)</xref> only leaves harvested during the vegetative phase of the plant were utilized. The plant phenophase is a determining factor in the yield, chemical composition, physical and chemical characteristics of the essential oil (
