<p class="p">Minimum inhibitory concentration and MBC values found in our study were higher for the essential oils than for the controls. However, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Vuuren (2008)</xref>, in a review of over 500 publications detailing the antimicrobial activity of plants, proposed that essential oils with MIC of 2 mg/mL or lower or natural products with MIC values below 1 mg/mL could be considered noteworthy; however, in extracts, they must have MIC values below 8 mg/mL to be considered. Therefore,
