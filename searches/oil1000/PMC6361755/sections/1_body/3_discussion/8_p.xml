<p class="p">For sesquiterpenes such as spathulenol and nerolidol, the antimicrobial action via cell membrane-disrupting mechanism is described and, hence, results in the leakage of K

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Togashi et al. (2007)</xref> terpene alcohols with carbon chains of C10 to C12, as nerolidol, exhibit a strong antibacterial activity against
