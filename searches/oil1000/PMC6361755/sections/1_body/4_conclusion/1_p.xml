<p class="p">The aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> present high essential oil yield (17 mL/kg dry plant) with 30 components, and the major ones are spathulenol and nerolidol, followed by heptacosane, Î²-pinene, bicyclogermacrene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene and germacrene D. The essential oil presents greater action against bacteria than against fungi, mainly against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. Essential oil of
