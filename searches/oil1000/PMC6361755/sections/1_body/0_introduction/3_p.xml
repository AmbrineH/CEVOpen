<p class="p">Despite of some reports on the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic>, mainly related to its antifungal activity, the antimicrobial activity spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> essential oil in the flowering phenophase and against agents causing foodborne diseases is unknown or little studied. Food spoilage is a serious widely neglected problem, mainly by mycotoxins in grain storage due to poor harvesting practices, inappropriate drying, handling, packaging, storage, and transport conditions (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bhat et al., 2010</xref>). The utilization of synthetic chemicals has increased microorganism resistance, mostly against antibiotics, and the search for alternative agents to control microorganisms is therefore necessary (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ventola, 2015</xref>). An alternative to reduce synthetic chemicals is the search for antimicrobials from medicinal plants (

 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> aerial part essential oil for potential applications to preserve food by non-synthetic compounds.
