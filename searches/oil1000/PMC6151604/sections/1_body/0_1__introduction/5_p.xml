<p class="p">According to Isman [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], most essential oils (EOs) and their major constituents are relatively non-toxic to mammals, with acute oral Lethal Dose (LD) values in rodents ranging from 800 to 3000 mg·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for pure compounds and &gt;&gt;5000 mg·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for formulated products. Many EOs show toxic effects against several insect species due to their multiple modes and sites of action in the insects’ nervous system [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], it is important to test some parameters of EOs such as their human toxicity, before promoting their use. Although some of them such as citronella, lemon and eucalyptus oils are recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) as repellent ingredients for application on the skin due to their relative low toxicity, comparable efficiency and customer approval, others might possess a higher toxicity than chemicals and thus cause skin irritation [
