Pyrethroids, organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, DDT), organophosphates and carbamates are the active insecticidal ingredients recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for IRS, while pyrethroids were the only products used for LLINs. These insecticides are known to be neurotoxic. Unfortunately, resistance to most pyrethroids used against adult mosquito populations in public health treatments has been detected in many countries and is now widespread and reported in two thirds of the countries with ongoing malaria transmission problems [
