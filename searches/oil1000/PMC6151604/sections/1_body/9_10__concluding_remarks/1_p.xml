<p class="p">Pyrethroids are widely used in controlling mosquitoes. They are used in bednet treatments, impregnation of clothes, indoor residual spraying and spatial treatments [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. The advantage of pyrethroids is their effectiveness at low dosages. They are also toxic, irritant, fast acting, stable and safe for humans [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. According to Duvallet [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>], pyrethroids have four main effects on mosquitoes causing: (i) a spatial repellent effect by deterrence of adults from entering treated rooms; (ii) a contact irritant effect by short-lived settling of mosquitoes on treated bednets or walls; (iii) an anti-feedant effect by inhibition of blood feeding by female mosquitoes and (iv) toxic effect by inducing a knock down (KD) and mortality effect. In Africa, pyrethroid resistance in 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> populations is now widespread and could compromise the vector control strategies. Thus, the use of EOs as mosquito control insecticides would be greatly increased if their mode of action is not the same as that of currently used chemical products [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. This raises the following question: Can EOs be used as an alternative to the pyrethroid resistance?
