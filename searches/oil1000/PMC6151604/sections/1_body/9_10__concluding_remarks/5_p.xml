<p class="p">The synergistic interactions between EOs components are interesting; it is possible to mix two or three compounds with different effects to avoid habituation behaviour from mosquitoes. To date, microencapsulation, which improves the duration of action of certain EOs, can favor the use of ingredients of EOs in terms of impregnation of mosquito bednets. In conclusion, EOs have both toxic and repellent actions and could be envisaged as a way for sustainable management of pyrethroid resistance in Africa.</p>
