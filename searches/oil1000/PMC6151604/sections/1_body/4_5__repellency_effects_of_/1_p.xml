<p class="p">The repellent ability of EOs seems to be the major promising entomological use in the human health. According to Choochote [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], repellents are substances that act locally or at a distance, deterring an arthropod from flying, landing on or biting humans or animals (or any surface in general). It is also defined as a phenomenon that prevents a pestâ€™s ability to track, locate and/or recognize its host. Hence, a repellent phenomenon can be a movement away from an odor source, but also an inability to find the host [
