<p class="p">According to Dias and Moraes [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], plant essential oils were considered active when their LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were below 100 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> against larvae vector mosquitoes such as 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> sp. Thus, essential oils from 63 plant species demonstrated larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. arabiensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. dirus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. funestus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> s.l., 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> s.s., 
 <italic class="italic">An. quadrimaculatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. subpictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01321-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01321-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows that LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were between 1.8 and 91.2 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> whereas LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> were from 4.1 to 199 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Many researchers have shown the efficiency of major compounds from EOs on 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> sp. larvae (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01321-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> was the most toxic against 
 <italic class="italic">An. quadrimaculatus</italic> larva. All values are above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 1 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for larvicides. The use of EOs extracted from plants seems to be problematic with regards to their LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values. However, these studies should be interesting, if the tests carried out take into account the susceptibility of reducing the use of the chemicals commonly used in human protection.
