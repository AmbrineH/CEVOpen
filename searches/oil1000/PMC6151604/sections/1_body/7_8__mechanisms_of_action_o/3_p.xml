<p class="p">According to Abdelgaleil et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] monoterpenes such as cuminaldehyde, 1,8-cineole, limonene and fenchone have strong insecticidal activity and potent AChE inhibitory activity whereas other compounds like geraniol or 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>-carvone have strong insecticidal activity but are weak inhibitors of AChE. Hideyuki and Mitsuo [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] noted that the mixture of monoterpenoids could be active as synergists in the inhibition of AChE. In fact, these authors found out that limonene, linalool and lynalyl acetate mixture showed synergistic effects and were more inhibitory than bergamot oil or single monoterpenoid applications.
