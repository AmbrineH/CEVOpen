 <xref rid="B113-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>] by analysing synergistic and antagonistic interactions of anticholinesterase terpenoids, concluded with the evidence of synergy since the inhibitory activity of individual terpenes was lower than the whole oil. Keane and Ryan [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>] mentioned that the validation of an inhibition in vitro of the AChE should be demonstrated additionally by an appropriate effect in vivo. These authors also pointed out the importance of not excluding additional modes of action of monoterpenoids.
