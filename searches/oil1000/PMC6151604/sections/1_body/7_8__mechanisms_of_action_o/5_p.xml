<p class="p">Another possible target for essential oil activity is the octopaminergic system of insects. Octopamine is a naturally occurring multifunctional biogenic amine, which plays key roles as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator and neurohormone in invertebrate systems, with a physiological function similar to that of nornephrine in vertebrates [
