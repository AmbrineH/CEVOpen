<p class="p">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a key role in cholinergic synapses that are essential for insects and higher animals [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. It is known to be a class of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitting agent acetylcholine (ACh). Inhibition of AChE causes accumulation of acetylcholine in the synapses, so that the post-synaptic membrane is in a state of permanent stimulation, which results in ataxia i.e., general lack of co-ordination in the neuromuscular system, and eventual death [
