 <xref rid="B122-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] showed that some monoterpenoids can affect the functioning of insects’ GABA systems by binding to the GABA receptor and increasing the chloride uptake activated by GABA. Their studies revealed that in the American cockroach’s ventral nerve cord, carvacrol, pulegone, and thymol all significantly increased the

 <sup class="sup">−</sup> uptake stimulated by GABA, and that they did not increase the 
 <sup class="sup">36</sup>Cl
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> uptake in the absence of GABA in the assay system showing that carvacrol, pulegone, and thymol were all positive allosteric modulators for insect’s GABA receptor. They modulated the insect GABA system by binding at the receptor and increasing chloride anion influx into the neurons.
