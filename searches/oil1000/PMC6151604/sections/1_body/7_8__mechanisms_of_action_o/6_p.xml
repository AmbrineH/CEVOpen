<p class="p">Physiological functions of OA appears to be mediated by pharmacologically distinct class of octopamine receptors viz. octopamine receptors (myogenic rhythm via Ca√æ concentration), octopamine 2A and octopamine 2B, octopamine 3 (activation of adenylate cyclise activity), which are coupled to different second messenger system belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (G-PCRs) [

It was subsequently shown that treatment with the octopaminergic antagonist phentolamine effectively inhibited the cyclic AMP levels induced by essential oil treatment, indicating a possible competitive activation of octopaminergic receptors by essential oil constituents.
