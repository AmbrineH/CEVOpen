<p class="p">Studies on the interactions between oil compounds against 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> remain very scarce. Recently, Deletre [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] investigated and showed a complexity in the biological activity of EOs for toxicity, irritancy and repellent tests. Nevertheless, no correlation was found between the activity of EO and activity from their major components. Many of the repellent studies have shown that synthetic compounds or blends of pure compounds are less effective when compared to the activity of their corresponding essential oils [
