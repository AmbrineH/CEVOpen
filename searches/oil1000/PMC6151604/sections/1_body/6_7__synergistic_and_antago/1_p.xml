<p class="p">The inherent activity of an EO can be expected to be related to the chemical configuration of the components, the proportions in which they are present and to interactions between them [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. An additive effect is observed when the combined effects are equal to the sum of the individual effects. Antagonism is observed when the effects of one or both compounds are less when they are applied together than when applied alone. Synergism is observed when the effect of the combined substances is greater than the sum of the individual effects [

In some cases, the whole essential oil exhibited a greater pesticidal activity than its major components isolated, suggesting that the minor components are critical to the activity and may have a synergistic effect or potentiating influence [
