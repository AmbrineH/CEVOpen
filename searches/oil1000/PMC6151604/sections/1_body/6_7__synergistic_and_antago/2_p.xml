<p class="p">In general, it appears that the effect of an active compound could be enhanced by other major compounds and/or modulated by minor compounds to give additive or synergistic effects. For example, repellency and toxicity of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde could be synergistically enhanced by minor compounds like benzaldehyde, coumarin, phenyl ethyl alcohol, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde, while the irritancy of carvacrol appeared to be reduced by minor compounds such as myrcene, borneol, α-pinene, γ-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol, limonene, and α-thujene [

 <xref rid="B102-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. A synergistic phenomenon among the metabolites may result in a higher bioactivity compared to the isolated components [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. This synergistic effect is also observed with mixtures of oils. The high insect repellency and toxicity of the mixed oils might have resulted from synergistic action of the main components in the oils.
