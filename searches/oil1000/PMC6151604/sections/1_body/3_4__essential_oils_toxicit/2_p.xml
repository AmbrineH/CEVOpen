 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> resistant strains were susceptible to all essential oils at the diagnostic doses tested, except for 
 <italic class="italic">C. tinctorium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. longepedunculata</italic>, for which resistance was suspected because the mortality was less than 97%. Then, according to the WHO protocols [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], diagnostic doses are defined as twice the lethal concentration (LC) for 99% mortality (LC
