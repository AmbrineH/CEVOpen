<p class="p">The compounds should be selected taking into account to their low toxicity to humans and must provide protection for at least 4 h. According to Deletre [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], compounds from citronella can be potential alternatives to repellents, especially since they are non-toxic individually and when mixed. This explains why this EO is used in microencapsulation experiments. Recently, a simple, low cost, scalable, and reproducible method has been set up by Specos [
 <xref rid="B130-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. This technology consists in preparing complex of coacervation microcapsules containing citronella EO. Using this technology, the study aimed at assessing repellent activity by exposure of a human hand and arm covered with treated textiles to 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. According to these authors, fabrics treated with microencapsulated citronella exhibited a higher and longer lasting protection from insects compared to fabrics sprayed with an ethanol solution of the essential oil, assuring a repellent effect higher than 90% for up to three weeks. Salomon et al. [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>] showed that microencapsulation decreased membrane permeation of citronella EO by at least 50%. Another technology is encapsulated citronella oil nanoemulsion which is prepared by high pressure homogenization at varying amounts of surfactant and glycerol [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-22-01321" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. These authors showed that the release of citronella oil from high amounts of glycerol was much slower than that from the low glycerol amounts resulting in sustained mosquito protection time.
