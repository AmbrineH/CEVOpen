<p class="p">The isoprene unit builds up in repeating units to form monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes and tetraterpenes containing 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 isoprene units, respectively. Only monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes are found in essential oils. Monoterpenes together with sesquiterpenes are the most abundant constituents of essential oils [
