<p class="p">The larvicidal activities of the essential oil can be related to its main compounds. The three main components of the essential oil of

 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-carveol, and limonene—were responsible of its larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">An. Stephensi</italic> [

 <italic class="italic">An. subpictus</italic> with LC
