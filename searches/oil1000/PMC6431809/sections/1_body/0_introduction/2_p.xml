<p class="p">Designer/functional food through biotechnological strategies promises quality food products that can be served to the people [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Designer food is genetically engineered food with enhanced nutritive value and is intended to improve the health of people. The term designer food seems sophisticated, but even the normal process of fermentation is a value addition to the food, and hence comes under the same domain [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Modification and manipulation of nutritive values of food derived from animal origin are of extreme interest due to the increasing demand for specialized market production [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Modifying the nutritional constituents of the diet supplied to animals seems to be a promising approach to improve the health-enhancing ingredients of animal products. Intervention at this level not only improves the nutritive quality of animal origin food but also changes the perception of the public regarding the foods from animal origin [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. By feeding animals to create nutritionally modified food products or using techniques, i.e., cross-breeding, genetic engineering, and induced genetic mutation, the designer foods are produced to enhance or reduce the presence of particular nutrients and/or to improve them. Designer foods can be created with a sufficient amount of nutrients, which are considered beneficial for health. Several nutrients such as Vitamins C and E, Î²-carotene, amino acids, L-carnitine, and other phytochemicals have been identified to be very effective in preventing issues related to the heart and other vital organs, cancers, and cataract. Many food items have been created containing a large amount of these beneficial ingredients for the betterment of human health [
