<p class="p">Milk and its products produced from milk are healthy food nutrients containing sufficient amount of essential nutrients such as oleic acid, CLA, omega-3 fatty acids, short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Other bioactive compounds in milk and its food items may have positive health effects. However, little information is available regarding this very important and emerging aspect of nutrition [

Still, a greater risk to these biological systems is oxidative stress which can cause severe injury to them. It is illustrated that, when the oxygen is reduced, it produces a persistent amount of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human body. Human body has numerous mechanisms for the neutralization and scavenging of ROS. The first line of defense against ROS is comprised of enzymes such as GSHPx, catalase, SOD, ubiquinol, and uric acid which also inhibit the excessive production of free radicals [
