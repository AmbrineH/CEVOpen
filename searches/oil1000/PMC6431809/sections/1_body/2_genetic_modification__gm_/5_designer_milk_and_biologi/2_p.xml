<p class="p">Designer milk is manufactured by modification of primary casein structure or changing the lipid profile or increasing the protein recovery and adapting to the needs of infants. In addition to the presence of significant level of nutraceuticals, low milk fats change in the fatty acid profiles due to LA and omega-fats which have more beneficial activities [
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], improved amino acid profiles, more varieties of proteins, less lactose to reduce calories value, and absence of β-LG to diminish milk allergy which are important considerations for modified milk production [
 <xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The ideal milk in terms of fat content should have &gt;82% mono-SFAs, &lt;8% SFAs, and &lt;10% UFAs. Achieving this target is difficult though reduction in fat content can be explored [
 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Different approaches are used over a period of time for designing modified milk that will be accepted by the general public. Milk contains good quantity of fat for human, as one of its constituents, which are not appreciated by all people. Skimmed milk is a variety of milk, where the cream has been removed from milk to make it fat free. Several other approaches have also been tried to reduce the fat content of milk [
 <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Abomasal administration of LA has reduced fat content of milk [
 <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Rumen microbes can hydrogenate oils/oil seeds fed through oral route, and hence, they should be infused directly to abomasum and/or it should be given in an encapsulated form to pass rumen. Encapsulated canola oil feeding to cattle has increased UFA concentration in milk [
 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The milk obtained when used for butter making has good spreading compared to ordinary milk. Similar studies with encapsulation of both canola and soybean meal improved the butter spreading ability [
 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Focusing on enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase in mammary gland can reduce the synthesis of fat in milk [
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Some researchers tried breeding policies to select animals which yield milk with less fat. Transgenic milk has been obtained from goats expressing various novel proteins and thereby enhancing the antimicrobial properties of goat’s milk. Transgenic milk with elevated lysozyme concentrations has successfully enhanced the development of the small intestine in goats, decreased the levels of inflammation, and reduced the colonization of enteropathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> in the intestine of neonatal and weaned pigs as well as in children [
 <xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Insomnia or sleep disorders can be treated with melatonin, and hence, enhancing the melatonin secretion from milk can help to treat insomnia [
 <xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. As milk contains two major components; melatonin and tryptophan which help in sleep disorder and relaxation. This melatonin in the milk acts as intrinsic factor to treat sleeping disorder.
