<p class="p">During normal cellular and biochemical reactions, free radicals such as ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated which are usually counteracted by body’s own defense antioxidant system. However, in certain circumstances (diseases or exposure to certain toxic agents), either there is excessive production of these free radicals or the body’s antioxidant system weakens which leads to an imbalance. Oxidative stress is defined as the physiological imbalance between the production of free radicals and their neutralization by the antioxidant system [

The most common environmental pollutants acting as an exogenous source of increasing oxidative stress are heavy metals, pesticides, benzene, and certain other chemicals (xylene, phthalates, and bisphenol) [
