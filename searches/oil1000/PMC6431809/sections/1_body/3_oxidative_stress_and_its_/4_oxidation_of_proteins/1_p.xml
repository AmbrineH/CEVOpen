<p class="p">Proteins are major targets to be effected in biological oxidation. They are susceptible to the action of ROS toxic effect. In addition to cell membrane component, proteins also constitute the enzymes which catalyze cellular reactions, so oxidative damage of proteins might have serious outcomes in certain diseases such as diabetes. The level of carbonyl esters can be employed as a biomarker of insulin resistance (IR) in type 2 diabetes, as it has shown a great correlation with homeostasis model assessment-IR and glycated hemoglobin. Carbonyl ester assays provide a quick means of measuring the oxidative stress status [
