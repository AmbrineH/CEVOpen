<p class="p">LPO is the oxidative degradation of lipids by free radicals or ROS. In this scenario, free radicals snatch the electrons from lipid/fat molecules in cell membranes, and such chemical modification disrupts normal cell membrane functions by inactivating membrane-bound receptors and enzymes and also increases cell permeability. During this reaction, various aldehydes are formed. Malondialdehyde has been used for many years as a biomarker for assessing oxidative stress status in diabetes. Similarly, evidence exist about the elevated level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in diabetic patients. TBARS acts a biomarker for oxidative damage [
