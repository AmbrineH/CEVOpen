<p class="p">DNA damage has been seen in the form of oxidative DNA damage, DNA strands break, and mutations occur. Such alterations in DNA are related to numerous chronic diseases. Fragmentation of DNA base will yield several products, containing 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHdG), thymine glycol, adenine, and hydroxyl methyl urea [
