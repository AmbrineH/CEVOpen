<p class="p">Metabolic modifiers such as antibiotics can affect the growth and digestion as well as digestive tract efficiency by affecting microbial population. Other substances, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, anabolic steroids, and somatotropins, may disturb breakdown and usage of fascinated bioactive nutritive compounds [

At present, hormones are used by a large number of beef and dairy farmers to get more products with fewer animals. To date, beef cattle are the only meat-producing animals that are approved for receiving hormone injection in the United States and Europe [

 <xref rid="ref209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>]. The hormones can be administered through an implant under the skin of the ear that delivers measured amounts of the hormone throughout the animal’s life, and such animals convert feed into muscle faster and more efficiently [
 <xref rid="ref210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>]. The meat produced by this method is also lean than conventionally grown animals. Bovine somatotropin (BST) or recombinant bovine growth hormone is the only growth hormone approved for use in dairy cattle use. The hormone is administered through injection and simulates certain natural hormone such as insulin-like growth factor-1, which helps the cows to convert nutrients into milk, thus cows administered with BST have higher milk production than non-injected cow [

On the other hand, the use of antibiotics in food animal is a complex issue that is quite often oversimplified by both critics and proponents. It has evoked lots of concern about antimicrobial resistance. The estimated farm-to-fork risks from farm antibiotic use are extremely low. The meat or milk from an animal undergoing antibiotic therapy is allowed to enter the food supply only after the withdrawal period has passed, and the animal’s system has been given time to sufficiently clear the medicine. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has documented required periods for withdrawing medication for each drug and species. However, easy access to antibiotics is required for the prevention and treatment of animal diseases and production of safe food. Therefore, policy actions regarding the use of antibiotics in food animal production should be based on scientific knowledge after carefully weighing the consequences of any specific course of action [
