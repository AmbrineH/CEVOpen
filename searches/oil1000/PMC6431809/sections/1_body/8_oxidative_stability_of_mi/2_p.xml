<p class="p">Antioxidant capacity assays are important for general antioxidant activity in foods and can be categorized into two main assays: Hydrogen atom transfer-based assays and electron transfer-based assays [
 <xref rid="ref201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>]. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity reported by Benzie and Devaki [
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] shows that hydrogen atom transfer-based assays evaluated antioxidant activity from amino acids in milk that can act as hydrogen donors. Determination of nitric oxide free radicals, total phenolic contents, flavonoid contents, DPPH free radicals, inhibition of oxidation of linolenic acid, and total reducing capacity can be used for the characterization of antioxidant capacity in milk and dairy products [
 <xref rid="ref202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>]. Lipid oxidation in milk can be measured by several methods; these include instrumental methods, such as transition in fatty acid profile, concentration of Vitamins A, E, and C, and total antioxidant assays. Peroxide value measures the primary stages of autoxidation; it is a useful parameter to determine the oxidation status of milk, cheese, butter, and ice cream [
 <xref rid="ref203" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. TBA test is also used for the estimation of secondary oxidation in food products. Nadeem 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>] demonstrated that the use of olein fractions improves the oxidation status of ice cream. Sensory techniques are also commonly used for the assessment of oxidized flavor in milk and milk products [
