<p class="p">Dairy industry is facing a concern regarding the oxidative stability of milk and dairy products. The negative impact of oxidation reactions in milk is related to strong off-flavors and deterioration of nutritional quality in milk. There is a delicate balance between anti- and pro-oxidative processes of milk and dairy products. Oxidative stability of milk and dairy foodstuffs depend on fatty acid structure, contamination with metal ions, and concentration of tocopherols and carotenoids [

 <xref rid="ref199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. Antioxidant activity is used to monitor the oxidation in a product. Antioxidant capacity of milk and milk products is mainly attributed to tyrosine and cysteine, Vitamins A and E, carotenoids, and enzyme systems such as SOD, catalase, and GSHPx [
