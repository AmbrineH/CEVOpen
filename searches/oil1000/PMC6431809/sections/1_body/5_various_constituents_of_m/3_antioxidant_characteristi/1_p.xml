<p class="p">Carotenoids are lipophilic molecules, and they have the tendency to accumulate in lipophilic region of cells such as membrane or lipoproteins [

As a feature of aerobic life, human body is exposed to a wide range of pro-oxidants that can cause serious damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Among the various antioxidant systems in milk, carotenoids act a scavenger of singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [
 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. One molecule of β-carotene can scavenge/quench up to 1000 molecules of singlet oxygen [

Autoxidation and light-triggered oxidation are mainly stimulated by a multifaceted interaction of pro- and anti-oxidants mechanisms. Vitamin E and carotenoids constitute fat-soluble antioxidants, and milk fat globule membrane is considered as the most volatile site for autoxidation [
 <xref rid="ref134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. Photo-oxidation is predominantly inhibited by β-carotene; it absorbs light that would otherwise be absorbed by riboflavin, which may give rise to quality-related issues. β-carotene absorbs light in a concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="ref135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. Carotenoids act as scavengers of singlet oxygen and some ROS [
