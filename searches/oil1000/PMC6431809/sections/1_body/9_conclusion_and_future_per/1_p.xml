<p class="p">It has been concluded that functional foods such as milk and its products have antioxidant activities which may enhance human health, immunity, nutritive values, prevent or treat health threats, help in fighting some diseases such as diabetes and cancers, reduce blood pressure and cholesterol-related problems as well as ameliorate cardiovascular disorders, lower risk of chronic diseases, and allergic reactions. In particular, free radicals such as ROS and RNS generated during normal cellular, and biochemical reactions play a major role in the pathogenesis of the chronic diseases. The free radicals are usually counteracted by body’s own antioxidant system. However, in certain conditions, either the body’s defense mechanism will be weak, or the production of free radicals will outweigh. Therefore, controlling the pro- and anti-oxidant balance through antioxidant-enriched diet is important. Designer foods such as milk can be used against lifestyle disorders due to the presence of antioxidant activities. In the new era, functional or designer foods are still new. The development of genetically modified animals for food and industries is one of the most promising applications of biotechnology, but all the claims surrounding functional food health promoting benefits must be backed by a good scientific background. Genetic engineering has a great influence on the production of functional as well as designer foods which, in turn, is a great addition to the agriculture, livestock, pharmaceutical, and socioeconomic sector. Milk and related dairy products are gaining some attention due to their extraordinary proprieties which will have a direct influence on the health concerns, economic status, and environmental status that can cover all the aspects on benefits relative to risk which should be analyzed before commercial production. Research is a necessary tool to explore the benefits of functional foods which can satisfy both consumers and producers through verbal communication. Improved health benefits, enhanced profitability of products produced by the novel scientific techniques, and social and ethical issues, such as animal welfare, environmental impact, regulatory processes, and safety, all contribute to the acceptance of the “designer” products. All these points need to be addressed well in advance before commercialization and introduction of the designer food for human consumption. Although there are various advantages of GM of food, there remain some limitations that need to be addressed immediately so that customer/consumers can be convinced to accept these products. Safety of these food designed by genetic manipulation needs to be addressed, and toxicity studies and flavor studies should also be conducted.</p>
