<p class="p">Milk and its products possess several nutritive properties such as energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Major reason behind the use of dairy products is to enhance the nutritive and dietary value of milk, subsequently for the betterment of human health as nutraceutical source [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The linoleic acid (LA) present in milk is known as the potential anticarcinogen, which can be controlled through diet management [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In recent years, it has been illustrated that casein micelle has the potential to transport polyphenols that show a significant decrease in colon cancer cells [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thus, alterations in the diet of dairy animals could be focused to enhance the bioefficacy of bioactive polyphenols in milk to improve human health. As being more saturated, milk fat raises more public health concern than oils from plants. Hence, milk fatty acid composition needs to be improved by modifying the feeding strategies of the dairy animals [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. A fatty acid profile of milk that has a great impact on oxidative stability of milk and dairy products has been mentioned for different species (cow, buffalo, goat, and sheep) as shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table-1</xref> [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The role played by dairy nutrition in production of quality fat and fatty acids to increase the oxidative stability of milk has been studied worldwide [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Transfer efficiency is the term used to refer to the amount of fatty acids that can be transferred from dietary fat. Many studies illustrated that the transfer efficiency ranges from 2% to 4% for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which is lower than docosapentaenoic acid (DHA) [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. It was found that feeding fish oil in a rumen-protected manner increases transfer efficiency. Supplementation of 250 g/day fish oil produced 20-30% of transfer efficiency [
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Diet is the major source of milk LA level, and many trials have been conducted with the aim to enhance milk conjugated LA (CLA) content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure-1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Increasing the rumen vaccenic acid output will raise the milk LA level [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Several vegetable oils have LA enhancing property in milk. Rumen biohydrogenation can be prevented by addition of oilseeds; hence, inclusion of oilseeds in the diet has been explored in many studies [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Many trials established that a high level of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) in milk, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), increases the risk of oxidation and off-flavor [
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. A significant increase in milk monounsaturated fatty acids was found when the animals were fed with naked oats combined with grass silage or whole rapeseed grass [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Fish oil at recommended level in dairy diet seems to increase milk LA compared to vegetable oils. Combination of both fish and vegetable oils enrich with LA has the potential effect to increase milk LA level like soybean and sunflower [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Yu and Hu [
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] found that, when cereals were substituted with lupin seeds, there was an improvement in milk production and higher concentration of milk protein and fat. Supplying sweet lupin to dairy cows considerably increased the milk C18:1 c-9 and reduced the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) compared to a control diet. Processed oil seeds enrich in LA and/or linolenic acid resulted to up regulate milk LA as compared to whole oilseeds, yet were not as fruitful as utilizing the pure oil [
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Dietary supply of PUFA combined with modification to rumen environment can increase the milk fat LA. Feeding fresh pastures increases the milk CLA content by 2-3 folds [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Therefore, diet can extremely influence the levels of LA in milk fat, and there are likewise extensive contrasts between dairy species. The main reason for increasing milk fat LA is to increase the vaccenic acid outflow from rumen and increasing âˆ†9-desaturase activity. Through the diet and nutrition, the levels of LA can be improved; similarly, EPA and DHA can also be improved to a little extent by the above-mentioned way.
