<p class="p">Milk catalase is a heme protein, molecular weight of catalase is 200 kDa, with isoelectric pH of 5.5, and this enzyme is stable in a wide range of pH 5-10 and rapidly loses activity when it is out of this pH range [
 <xref rid="ref169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>]. Most of the catalyzes contain heme, catalase causes the dismutation of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, a chemical reaction in which H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> causes oxidation of the other H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> molecules, consequently, one is converted to O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and the other two are converted to two molecules of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O [
