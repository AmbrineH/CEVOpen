<p class="p">Antioxidant molecules have the capability of either accepting or donating an electron to terminate the unpaired state of a molecule. They are either endogenous or taken from exogenous sources through food, especially in milk. The endogenous antioxidant molecules are GSH, uric acid, ferritin, coenzyme Q, bilirubin, alpha lipoic acid, L-carnitine, and melatonin [
