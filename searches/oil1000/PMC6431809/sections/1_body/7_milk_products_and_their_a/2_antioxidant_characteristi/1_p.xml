<p class="p">The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Pediococcus pentosaceus</italic> on antioxidant characteristics of probiotic yogurt was studied in cow, goat, and camel milk, and the results showed that antioxidant of goat milk yogurt was 93% as compared to 86% in camel milk. These results suggested that antioxidant characteristics of yogurt can be enhanced by probiotic bacteria [

Yogurt was added with carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, and red sweet pepper at 10% concentration, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and DPPH assays were used for antioxidant activity during the storage period of 14 days. Yogurt added with broccoli, and red sweet pepper revealed higher DPPH free radical scavenging activity and FRAP. However, antioxidant activity decreased during the storage period of 14 days [
 <xref rid="ref154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Cow, buffalo, and goat milk yogurts were supplemented with aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Beta vulgaris</italic>. DPPH free radical scavenging activity and FRAP of goat milk yogurt were greater than other cow and buffalo milk [

In another study, antioxidant capacity of yogurt was increased by supplementing the yogurt milk with 60 mg Vitamin C, 12 mg Vitamin E, and 3 mg Î²-carotene. Antioxidant characteristics of supplemented yogurt were higher than non-supplemented yogurts with no effects on sensory properties [

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus bulgaricus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> as starter cultures, and total phenolic contents, ascorbic acid, and total antioxidant activity were analyzed. Yogurt added with papaya fruit pulp had higher total phenolic contents, antioxidant activity, and Vitamin C concentration [
