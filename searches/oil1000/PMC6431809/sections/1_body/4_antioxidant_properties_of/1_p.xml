Uncontrolled free radicals in body can lead to oxidative stresses, which have been implicated in the breakdown of vital biochemical compounds, lipids, protein, DNA, diabetes, accelerated aging, carcinogenesis, and cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. The anticipated carcinogenicity of synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyl anisole, butylated hydroxyl toluene, and tertiary butylatedhydroxyquinone has led to the increased usage of natural antioxidants for the stabilization of foods. Functional foods have several health-promoting substances beyond traditional nutrients. Change in lifestyle has a great deal of impact on disease patterns, and about 20-30 years ago, infectious diseases were more than non-communicable diseases, but now the non-communicable/metabolic diseases are on the higher side. In the current scenario, healthy/functional food should be selected to avoid and/or minimize non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases [
