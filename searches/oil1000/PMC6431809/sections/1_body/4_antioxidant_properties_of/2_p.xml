<p class="p">The leading antioxidants present in milk can be grouped into lipid-and water-soluble antioxidants. Carotenoids, retinol, and α-tocopherol are lipid-soluble antioxidants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure-2</xref>), whereas ascorbic acid is water-soluble antioxidant [
 <xref rid="ref111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. α-Tocopherol is largely present in milk fat globule membrane and it is considered the most effective lipid-soluble antioxidants present in milk [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. It has properties such as preventative, chain-breaking antioxidant, and quencher of singlet oxygen in milk [
 <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Milk can develop off-flavor as a result of photo-oxidation and contamination with copper, and existence of antioxidants in milk can inhibit the free radical mechanism by donating the proton and thus inhibit the onset of autoxidation. Vitamin E inhibits the activity of plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme, and second, it can directly scavenge the free radicals [
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. β-carotene is regarded as preventive antioxidant, it can also quench singlet oxygen, and one molecule of β-carotene can quench 250-1000 molecules of singlet oxygen [
 <xref rid="ref113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C is the major and most important water-soluble antioxidant present in milk and has strong affinity to scavenge free radicals [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. Ascorbic acid can scavenge superoxide, iron oxide, nitric oxide, and alkoxyl radicals [
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. Supplementation of 100 mg α-tocopherol/kg milk fat and 100 mg ascorbyl palmitate/kg milk fat to ultra-high-temperature milk decreased the concentration of hexanal during the storage period of 4 weeks [
 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. Lactoferrin and casein can inhibit LPO, generation of peroxide radicals, TBARS, uptake of oxygen, and iron oxide free radicals [
 <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Antioxidant activities such as SOD, catalase, GSHPx, casein, and certain peptides are well established [
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>]. GSH and selenium enhanced the functional value, antioxidant capacity of milk. Antioxidant activity of zinc and selenium for the inhibition of SOD is scientifically proven [
