 <p class="p">In this study, a novel superhydrophobic nano-aluminum/iron (III) oxide composite has been prepared by a facile one-step process of electrophoretic deposition, with wide potential applications. The optimal suspension included ethanol, acetyl-acetone, and the additives of fluorotriphenylsilane and perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The microstructure, wettability, and exothermic performance were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microcopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), water contact angle measurements, and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The water contact angle and the heat-release of the target composites could reach to ~170Â° and 2.67 kJ/g, and could still keep stable, after exposure for six months, showing a great stability. These results provided an exquisite synthesis of ideas, for designing other superhydrophobic energetic materials with self-cleaning properties, for real industrial application.</p>
