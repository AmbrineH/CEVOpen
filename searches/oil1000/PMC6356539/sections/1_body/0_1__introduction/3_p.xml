<p class="p">The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method have been reported in the literature, to be a low-cost and highly efficient technique for fabricating promising films or coatings [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. As for the Al/Bi
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> thermite system, a facile two-step method of EPD and surface modification was introduced, in our previous research work, to construct a superhydrophobic Al/Bi
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>; their exothermic stability could be maintained for two years, which is of great benefit for practical applications [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Moreover, the mentioned method has also been applied to the Al/CuO system [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The focus of this work was to attempt to prepare self-protected or superhydrophobic Al/Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> materials, by using an improved one-step process of EPD, based on the two-steps technique, to enhance their adaptive capacity in the real, natural environment. The corresponding mechanism diagram is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00234-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, the superhydrophobicity and exothermic stability and water-proof or self-cleaning property of the product composite films have been systematically studied in detail.
