 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], etc. Most relevant research works are mainly concerned with simplifying the synthesis technique, optimizing their morphology, or designing new structures to improve the exothermic capacity or develop the utilization rate of energy. For example, Dadbakhsh and Hao designed an Al/Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> powder mixture distributed uniformly, by using selective laser melting [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The self-assembly and solvent-based mixing techniques have been used to prepare an Al/Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> as nanotubes [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, the AP/Al/Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> ternary energetic materials have been successfully fabricated by sol-gel, wet impregnation, and solvent anti-solvent processes, by Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, the key components of nano-Al and Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> powders in energetic materials are hydrophilia or surperhydrophilia, leading to performance attenuation. Thus, it is rather interesting to develop the exothermic stability and nature environment resistance to develop in energetic materials. The one commonly used method for preserving target energetic materials is by virtue of a nitrogen or argon gas seal bag or equipment. Moreover, Zhou et al. have proposed the glancing angle deposition technique and magnetron sputtering deposition process, to obtain the highly superhydrophobic Mg/Fluorocarbon core/shell nano-energetic arrays, with a static contact angle up to 162Â° [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The Al/CuO, with excellent superhydrophobicity, has been fabricated by chemical vapor deposition with an atomic layer deposition technology, by Collins et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, the most recent reported technologies, generally, are high in cost and complicated. Thus, it is still an impassable bottle-neck, to design novel Al/Fe
