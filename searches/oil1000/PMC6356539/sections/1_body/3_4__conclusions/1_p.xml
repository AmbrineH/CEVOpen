<p class="p">In brief, SAFFs, with wide applications, have been fabricated by a facile one-step-process-controllable EPD technique. The resulting energetic product exhibited an outstanding superhydrophobicity, with a contact angle up to ca. 170Â°, and a great heat-release performance with Q up to 2.67 kJ/g, respectively. Moreover, the hydrophobic stability and exothermic stability of the SAFFs could be retained for at least six months, in changeable circumstances. Thus, this work provided a new perspective for designing novel energetic material with a high real-environment tolerance, for real industrial applications.</p>
