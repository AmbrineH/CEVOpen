The distance of electrodes was controlled at 1 cm, and the field strength during EPD was set as 100 V cm

After an efficient EPD process (DYY11, Beijing 61 Instrument Factory, Beijing, China), electrophoretic assembly superhydrophobic films were dried, at 373 K, in a vacuum oven (DGG-9076AD, Shanghai Qixin Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), for 30 min, to remove the liquid impurities. At last, the deposited films were treated by microwave heating (WBBX-2, WKTR Science and Technology Ltd., Beijing, China), for 10 min at a certain power, and then stored in a vacuum drying oven (DGG-9076AD, Shanghai Qixin Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), for the performance analysis.
