<p class="p">The microstructures and materials composition the of SAFFs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7800F, Tokyo, Japan) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu, ZD-3AX, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The wettability was analyzed by an optical contact angle meter (HARKE-SPCA, Beijing, China) and a digital camera (D7000, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The following exposure tests were conducted in the open-door real nature environment, for different times. The different humidity levels were controlled by using a salt-spray test chamber (YWX/Q, YSL, Inc., Beijing, China) to explore the stability of the product. The heat output (Q) of the products were analyzed by using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, STA449F3, NETZSCH, Selb, Germany) on a freestanding ceramic crucible, with a temperature range of 298 Kâ€“1173 K, under a high purity (99.999%) argon environment. </p>
