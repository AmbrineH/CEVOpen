<p class="p">In addition, the water droplet dynamic impact test was used here, to examine the water-proof property of the samples. The whole impact process of a dyed water droplet on the target surface process included the five steps of the initial state (I), the falling process (II), the contact process (III), the seceding state (IV), and the rebounding process (V). Due to the abundant air bubbles captured by the porous structures in the SAFFs [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], the droplet could secede quickly after a rather short contact time, with the superhydrophobic surface, and bounce off, which is demonstrated in
