 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00234-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the XRD result of the fabricated SAFFs. Clearly, all mainly diffraction lines for the Al (04-0787, the Fm-3m (225)), and the Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (33-0664, R-3c (167)) were identified, demonstrating the presence of Al and Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, in the product, which is characteristic of nano-composite films deposited by the EPD technique. In addition, no peak for Al

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> or Fe indicated no reaction between the Fe
