<p class="p">In order to analyze the heat-release performance of the SAFFs, all samples were characterized by the DSC technique. Generally speaking, the output of the heat is essential to the energetic materials or other kinds of explosive materials. In this special energetic system, energy release from the SAFFs was due to the process shown in Equation (1), and the corresponding specific exothermic process is recorded in
