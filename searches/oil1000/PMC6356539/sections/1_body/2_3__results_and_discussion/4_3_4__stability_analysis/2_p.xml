<p class="p">The relationship of the contact angle and the exposure time is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00234-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a, where the contact angle of the target SAFFs was nearly 170° and barely got smaller with an increasing exposure time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00234-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b displays the contact angle as a function of humidity, which was used to simulate a realistic environment. Clearly, there were few fluctuations on the contact angle of the samples, after six months of exposure, and the corresponding contact angle remained at a high level of 170°. Moreover, as the pH increased from 1 to 11, the contact angle also remained almost stable (

What needed to be specially mentioned was that different droplets, with different surface tensions, including water, diiodomethane, ethylene glycol, peanut oil, olive oil, and hexadecane, were used to examine the practicability of the SAFFs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00234-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>d, the contact angle of the product decreased with the surface tension in the droplet. However, the contact angle of the SAFFs was still more than 150° (the “superhydrophobic” materials) even when the surface tension of the hexadecane was as low as 27.5 mN/m [
