 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Briefly, preparation of the sun-dried meat consisted of cleaning the pieces, removing the chips, excess fat and connective tissue, and subsequent cutting of the meat into standard-sized pieces (approximately 3.00 kg). Then, the pieces were cut open in the middle to form a sheet with a maximum thickness of 5 cm. Parallel cuts were made every 4 cm in the direction of the fiber to facilitate penetration of the salt. Salting was performed with manual rubbing of 5% (150 g) sodium chloride (refined cooking salt) relative to the individual piece weight (3.00 kg). The meat was maintained for 16 h at room temperature (25°C) in plastic trays and turned after 8 h. After 16 h, the exudate was drained, and the sheets were washed with tap water and allowed to dry at room temperature suspended by hooks for 8 h. Thus, the total processing time was 24 h. Then, the sheets were individually vacuum-packed in polyethylene bags and aluminum foil to avoid oxidation and identified by treatment; one portion was refrigerated at 4°C for the physical-chemical, sensorial and oxidation analyses. Afterwards, the salted and sun-dried meat pieces were individually placed in labeled plastic bags and chilled at -20°C for the chemical composition and fatty acid profile analyses.
