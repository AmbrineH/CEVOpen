 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Panelists were adult people of the animal science department, and they were 40 women and 40 men comprising an age group between 18 and 45 years old accustomed to eating lamb meat. The salted and sun-dried meat samples (30 g) were grouped by treatment, placed on an electric grill (George Foreman Grill Jumbo GBZ6BW, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and cooked until the geometric center of the samples reached 71°C. Fragments 2.0 cm

No condiments were added. Water and cream-cracker type biscuits were provided to remove the aftertaste between consecutive tastings.
