<p class="p">Cooking weight loss (CWL) of the salted and sun-dried meat was determined with two samples that were 2.5 × 2.5-cm thick. The weight of the samples was recorded before and after cooking. The subcutaneous fat was trimmed off, and the samples were cooked on an electric grill. A stainless-steel thermocouple (Gulterm 700, Gulton do Brazil) was placed into the geometric center of each sample to record the internal temperature. The salted and sun-dried meat samples were cooked until the internal temperature reached 71°C; then, the samples were removed from the grill (George Foreman Jumbo Grill GBZ6BW, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), placed into a plastic bag and cooled at 10°C in an ice-water bath. Using the difference between the weights before and after cooking, the cooking weight loss of each sample was obtained and expressed in percentage. The sample were kept at equilibrated temperatures of 4°C overnight for the instrumental texture analysis conducted according to the AMSA [
