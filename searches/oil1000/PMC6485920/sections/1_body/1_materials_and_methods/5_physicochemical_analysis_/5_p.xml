Then, the L*, a* and b* coordinates were measured at three different points in the muscle on non-overlapping zones, and an average was calculated for each coordinate per animal. These measurements were performed using a Minolta colorimeter (Konica Minolta, Chroma Meter CR 410, Tokyo, Japan) that was previously calibrated with the CIELAB system using a blank tile with illuminate D65 and 10° as the standard observation points. L* is related to lightness (L* = 0 black and 100 white), a* (redness) ranges from green (−) to red (+), and b* (yellowness) ranges from blue (−) to yellow (+). The color saturation (chroma, C*) was calculated as (a*
