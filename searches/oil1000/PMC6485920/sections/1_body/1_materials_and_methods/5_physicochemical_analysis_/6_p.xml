<p class="p">The quantification of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was used for the determination of lipid oxidation in the salted and sun-dried meat samples (triplicate) at three time points (0, 25 and 50 days after slaughter) according to Grotto et al. [

Approximately 0.01-kg frozen samples were milled in a multiprocessor, and 0.2 mL of BHT (0.03%) antioxidant, 50 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of an antifoam solution (alcohol amylic acid) were added. The mixture was homogenized for 1 minute, and the contents were transferred to a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask; then, 50 mL of 4 M HCl was added, and the mixture was heated on a heating plate at 100Â°C. Then, 5 mL of distillate was transferred to a glass tube, and 5 mL of 0.02 M TBARS solution was added. The mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 35 min, cooled, and then taken to a spectrophotometer (GCMS-QP2010 SE). The samples were read at 530 nm, and the results were multiplied by 7.8 and expressed as milligrams of malonaldehyde per kilogram of meat sample.
