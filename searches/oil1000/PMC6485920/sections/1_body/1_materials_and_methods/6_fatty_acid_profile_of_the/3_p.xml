<p class="p">The sum of the total saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) and the MUFA:SFA, PUFA:SFA, PUFA:MUFA and n–6:n–3 ratios were calculated from the fatty acid profiles. To evaluate the nutritional quality of the lipid fraction of the meat samples, the atherogenicity index (AI) and Thrombogenic index (TI) were calculated according to the equation [

The hypocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic (h:H) fatty acid ratios were calculated as h:H = = [(ΣC18:1 cis-9, C18:2 n–6, C20:4 n–6, C18:3 n–3, C20:3n–6, C20:5 n–3, and C22:6 n–3)/ (ΣC14:0 and C16:0)] [
