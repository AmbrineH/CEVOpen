 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the samples and the standard were injected into the chromatograph together with an internal standard (Crotonic Acid, SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. United States), and the internal standard concentration used was 25.5 mg/ L. The FAMEs were identified by a comparison of the FAME retention times with those of authentic standards (FAME Mix, C4-C24, SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. Louis, USA). To quantify the fatty acid methyl esters, a response factor was generated for each fatty acid based on the sample in the standard, and the response factor of each fatty acid was obtained. All conditions to rigor in all procedures for quantification of fatty acids were ensured: quality of standards, weighing, pipetting, calibrated and clean material, and evaporation of solution solvents and concentration of solutes among others. The experimental response factors were close to the theoretical factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The results were quantified by normalizing the areas of the methyl esters and are expressed as g 100/g fatty acids methyl esters (FAME).
