The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were determined in triplicate using a gas chromatograph (GC Finnigan Focus model, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (CP-Sil 88, 100 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.20-μm film thickness, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. The initial oven temperature program was set to 70°C for 4 min, increased by 13°C/min to 175°C and held for 27 min, increased by 40°C/min to 215°C and held for 9 min, and increased for 7°C/min to 230°C and held for 9 min for a total of 65 min per sample. The injector temperature was set at 250°C, and the detector temperature was set at 300°C.
