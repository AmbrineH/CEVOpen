<p class="p">Because ruminal biohydrogenation is the main factor that affects the fatty acid profile absorbed by ruminants, changes in the microbial ecology that affects the extent of fatty acid biohydrogenation can improve the fatty acid profile in the tissues [

Condensed tannins (or proanthocyanidins) are phenolic compounds found in forage legumes, trees and shrubs; the main characteristics of these compounds are the ability to form hydrogen bonds with proteins and act as antioxidants [

 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Condensed tannins ingested by ruminants interact with proteins present in the saliva, mucosa and ruminal microbiota and thus are normally considered antinutritive compounds. However, when consumed in balanced amounts (i.e., up to 5% of the diet DM, the
