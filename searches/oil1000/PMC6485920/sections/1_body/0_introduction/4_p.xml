<p class="p">Thus, the use of condensed tannins in animals' diet can promote the incomplete biohydrogenation of lipids and provide a higher concentration of PUFAs, which will consequently be incorporated into the meat by absorption into the small intestine of the animal, thereby improving the nutritional quality of the meat [

Therefore, the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the inclusion of condensed tannins in the diet of young Nellore bulls improves the physical-chemical quality, fatty acid content and sensorial attributes of salted and sun-dried meat, thereby improving its quality and consumersâ€™ acceptance.
