<p class="p">Because the average WBSF for the salted and sun-dried meat was below 3.90 kgf/cm

 <italic class="italic">kgf/</italic>cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> across treatments, the meat was considered very soft according to Belew et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. This lower WBSF is desirable to improve muscle tenderness and occurs due to increased proteolysis caused by the use of sodium chloride (5%) during processing as discussed above. The WBSF is inversely related to lipids [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and is directly related to the collagen content. Christensen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] studied the relationship among collagen characteristics, the lipid content and the meat texture of young bulls and found that these three parameters were related to the determination of softness in meat. There was a decrease in collagen with tannin addition; therefore, the WBSF would be expected to follow the same response. However, the higher softness expected with the decrease in collagen may have been offset by the quadratic effect of tannins on the meat lipids.
