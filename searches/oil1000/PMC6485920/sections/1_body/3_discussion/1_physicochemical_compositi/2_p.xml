<p class="p">The average carcass final pH across treatments was less than 5.80 as recommended [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. An adequate pH reduction is dependent on the muscle glycogen stores and the acidification process that occurs in meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Animals suffering from prolonged stress before slaughter may deplete the glycogen stores, thereby preventing a normal pH reduction after slaughter [
