<p class="p">There was an increase in the WHC of the salted and sun-dried meat with the inclusion of condensed tannins. Protein denaturation caused by the addition of tannins may have occurred [

 <italic class="italic">in natura</italic> meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], because the addition of sodium chloride causes an increase in the WHC due to the formation of salt-protein complexes; however, the salt solubilizes the myofibrillar proteins as it diffuses into the meat, causing dehydration and a reduction of free water in the tissue and contributing to water loss [
