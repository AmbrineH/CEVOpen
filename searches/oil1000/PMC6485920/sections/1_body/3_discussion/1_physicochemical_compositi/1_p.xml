<p class="p">The manufacturing process for the salted and sun-dried meat promoted protein denaturation, which caused dehydration, a decreased ether extract percentage and an increased ash content compared to 
 <italic class="italic">in natura</italic> meat [

 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, the inclusion of condensed tannins did not modify the moisture, mineral and protein proportions in the salted and sun-dried meat. The use of condensed tannins in the diet caused a curvilinear response in the fat deposition in the muscles. Changes in the FA proportion in the meat were not expected, since the dietary FAs did not differ among the diets. However, because PUFAs decrease lipogenic enzymes [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and tannins increase PUFAs in ruminant muscle, reduced short and medium chain fatty acid synthesis may have been the cause of the changes in the lipid content in the sun-dried meat.
