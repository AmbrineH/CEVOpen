<p class="p">The inclusion of condensed tannins in the diets did not influence the color of the salted and sun-dried meat. However, the results showed that the salted and sun-dried meat had low lightness (L*) compared to 
 <italic class="italic">in natura</italic> meat. This result can be explained by the reduction of myoglobin and therefore the color a* value. Additionally, the reduction in the tonality of yellow (b*) was due to the lower lipid content, and the reduction in the saturation index (C*), which represented the color intensity, was an indicator of the oxidative state and oxidation on the surface of the meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The salt present in the sun-dried meat is responsible for the greater oxidation of myoglobin and the transformation of oxymyoglobin, which makes the meat bright red, and metamyoglobin, which makes the meat grayish-brown; thus, the salt has a pro-oxidant effect on myoglobin [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The same pro-oxidant effect is induced by salt, making the product more susceptible to lipid deterioration through the activation of muscle lipoxidase [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. These results justify the increase in the oxidation in the salted and sun-dried meat stored for 25 and 50 days.
