<p class="p">The reduction in the meat lipid content caused by the inclusion of tannins to the diets did not alter the shear force or affect the softness of the meat. The consumer panel for the sensory analysis showed that tannins had a quadratic effect on the sun-dried meat. The lipid content in meat is associated with the texture and flavor [

 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The effect on the flavor of the sun-dried meat may have been caused by changes in the lipid content when the young bulls were fed condensed tannins. However, the tenderness was not significantly affected. In the present study, the scores across all attributes varied from 6.79 to 7.51. Similar results were found by GouvÃªa et al. [
