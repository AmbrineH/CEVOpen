<p class="p">Nutraceutical compounds, such as CLA, the UFA:SFA and PUFA:SFA ratios, the n–3 and n–6 concentrations, the hypocholesterolemic:hypercholesterolemia ratio and the atherogenicity index (AI) of the salted and sun-dried meat did not change with the addition of condensed tannins to the young bulls’ diets. Although we observed an increase in C18:3 and a decrease in the C18:0 and C16:0 contents in the sun-dried meat, the magnitude of the changes was very low. For instance, C18:3 increased from 0.46 to 0.70 g/100 g of total fat, and C16:0 decreased from 22.8 to 21.6 g/100 g. Decreasing the SFA improves the profile of fatty acids beneficial for human health [
