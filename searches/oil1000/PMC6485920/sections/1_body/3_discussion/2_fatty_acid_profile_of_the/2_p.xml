<p class="p">The percentage of 18:3 in the sun-dried meat increased by approximately 52% compared to the control at the highest tannin level. Although there was an approximately 44% increase in the 18:2 nâ€“6 concentration with the highest inclusion of tannin, this difference was not significant. A similar response was observed for the PUFAs, with a 40% increase that was not significant. These results confirm that tannins impair the ruminal BH based on the overall increase in individual UFAs with dietary tannins in this study [
