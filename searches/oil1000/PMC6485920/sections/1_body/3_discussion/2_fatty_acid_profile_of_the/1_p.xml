<p class="p">One of the most pronounced effect of feeding tannins to ruminants is the impairment of biohydrogenation [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The biohydrogenation process basically involves two distinct groups of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]; the first group is responsible for the disappearance of linolenic and linoleic acids and the formation of CLA and vaccenic acid, whereas the second group is responsible for the hydrogenation of vaccenic acid to stearic acid [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This second group is composed mainly of gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Due to the differences in their cell walls, most feed additives that decrease ruminal biohydrogenation are associated with a decrease in the proportion of the gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial populations. Tannins also select against gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Thus, higher percentages of 18:2, 18:3 and the biohydrogenation intermediates (CLA and trans-octadecenoic acids) are expected to reach the duodenum when tannins are fed to ruminants. Changes in the profiles of FAs absorbed in the duodenum can be detected in ruminant products. In fact, higher amounts of UFAs meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0216047.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] are often attributed to an impairment of ruminal biohydrogenation when there is no change in the dietary FAs with a concomitant decrease in the C18:0 content.
