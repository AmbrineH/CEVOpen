 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, lipid oxidation values for the groups on day 1, day 4 and day 8 are presented. It was observed that the effects of the addition of CAP, CAR, CIN or CAP+CAR+CIN at a dose of 150 mg / kg on the lipid oxidation in breast and leg meat on day 1, day 4 and day 8 were not statistically significant compared to control group (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] reported that the addition of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg of cinnamon oil had no effect on MDA level in the 
 <italic class="italic">pectoralis major</italic> muscles taken from chicks on days 1, 3, 5 and 9 as well as in the 4th, 5th and 6th months. Luna et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] stated that addition of 150 mg/kg thymol and 150 mg/kg carvacrol improves MDA values in breast and leg meat. They claimed that this effect for breast meat was more prominent on day 5, partial on day 10, and for leg meat it is partial on day 5 and more prominent on day 10. Ciftci et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] stated that addition of 1000 ppm cinnamon oil improved MDA value relative to control group, which could be due to antioxidant property of cinnamon oil. Faix et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] associated the fact that the addition of 250 ppm - 1000 ppm cinnamon oil reduced the MDA level in the blood serum to the reduction of lipid oxidation through increase of hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathioneeproxidase, superoxidedismutase, catalase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, etc.). Regarding the secondary metabolites that make up the working material, Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>] and Lillehoj et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] reported that they were effective on antibacterial activity and on lipid metabolism. According to the results of our study, CAP, CAR and CIN generally affected lipid oxidation in samples taken from breast and leg meats, but this effect did not appear statistically significant. However, it is the combination of CAP+CAR+CIN that most positively affected lipid oxidation in both breast and leg meat although this effect remained at just numerical level.
