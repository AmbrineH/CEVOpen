<p id="Par43" class="p">The nutrient compositions of the groups are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>. The results indicate that, the addition of the secondary metabolites to ration was effective on crude fat and crude ash levels in breast meat and dry matter as well as crude fat and crude ash levels in leg meat. The highest crude fat ratio for breast meat was found in CIN group, and for leg meat in the control group; the highest proportion of raw protein for breast meat was found in CAR group and for leg meat in CAP+CAR+CIN group. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of dry matter ratio in the breast meat, this ratio for leg meat was highest in CAR group. Kavouridou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>] reported that 10% coconut, palm or flax seed oil extraction were not effective on the chemical composition of broiler chick and so did Fotea et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] for additions of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.7% thyme oil extraction; and Kirkpinar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] for the additions of 300 mg thyme, garlic, thyme+garlic. Duarte et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] associated the ineffectiveness of 3.3, 6.6 and 9.9% of corn oil additions on CF of the chicken meat with the level of energy intake; and claimed that it could be due to the fact that the energy value of the feed had not changed.
