<p class="p">The samples investigated were evaluated in terms of the content of the following substances: tyrosol derivatives (salidroside and its aglycon tyrosol) as well as rosavins (
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamic alcohol derivatives, including rosavin, rosarin, rosin, and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamic alcohol) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01767-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Because these compounds are regarded to be responsible for the pharmacological activity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic>, they were used to standardize the raw materials [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The content of tyrosol derivatives and rosavins in 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> underground organs depends on various factors, i.e., harvest time, age of the plant, its origin, method of raw material stabilization, and extraction method [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The samples examined in this work differed as to the content of listed compounds. In general, dry extracts, being more concentrated, were more abundant in phenolic compounds (except 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamic alcohol) in comparison to powdered raw material. Here, the amounts of certain compounds were clearly affected by the solvent used for extraction. Salidroside and rosarin dominated in powdered raw material (146.30 and 141.03 mg/100 g, respectively); in aqueous extract, salidroside was present in the highest amount (249.87 mg/100 g), while, in the ethanolic one, rosavin dominated (969.71 mg/100 g). The ethanolic extract was characterized by significantly greater contents of the compounds studied than the aqueous extract, especially in regard to rosavin (969.71 mg/100 g and 129.15 mg/100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively). Previous data concerning the recommendations of solvent and extraction methods seem to be contradictory. According to Altantsetseg et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], water appears to be the best extraction medium for salidroside and tyrosol. However, Węglarz et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] claimed that the highest content of salidroside can be obtained when 70% ethanol is used. Results by Kucinskaite [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] show that, for salidroside, it is better to use 40% ethanol than 70%. Listed authors recommended 70–75% ethanol to isolate rosavins.
