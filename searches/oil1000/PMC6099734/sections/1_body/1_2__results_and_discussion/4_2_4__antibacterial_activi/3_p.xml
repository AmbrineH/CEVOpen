<p class="p">Powdered raw material showed a weaker antibacterial effect than the two other tested preparations. The MICs of this preparation in relation to the majority of test strains ranged from 16 to 32 mg/mL, and MBCs were in the concentration range of 16‒64 mg/mL. This preparation inhibited only the 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> strains (MIC 1‒8 mg/mL, MBC 4‒8 mg/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Shigella sonnei</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus mirabilis</italic> (MIC/MBC 2–8 mg/mL) more strongly. Such results may be associated with the presence of essential oil in this sample. One of its dominant compounds, geraniol, is regarded to be strongly active against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The powdered raw material did not have bactericidal activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 in the concentration range tested (MBC &gt; 64 mg/mL).
