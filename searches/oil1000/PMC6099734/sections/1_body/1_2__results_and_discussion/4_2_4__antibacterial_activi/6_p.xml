 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> (A). The test preparations were characterized by a diversified spectrum of activity at each concentration tested. Due to the spectrum of activity on bacteria, they can be arranged in the following way: powdered raw material &lt; aqueous extract &lt; ethanol extract. Seventy-four percent of the test strains were inhibited by this extract at a concentration of 8 mg/mL, while powdered raw material at the same concentration inhibited 37% of strains, an aqueous extract of 47%.
