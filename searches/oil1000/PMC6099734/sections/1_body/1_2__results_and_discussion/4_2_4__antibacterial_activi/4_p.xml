<p class="p">The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> showed stronger bacteriostatic effects than the powdered raw material for most strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The inhibition by the aqueous extract of the growth of two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> ser. Enteritidis, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> ser. Typhimurium, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was two-fold stronger, and inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was four-fold stronger compared to the powdered raw material. However, the bactericidal effect of this extract was weaker or the same as the powdered raw material with respect to most test strains, with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> ATCC 11778, 
 <italic class="italic">P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922. The aqueous extract also did not indicate bactericidal effect on the two clinical strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> ser. Typhimurium (MBC &gt; 64 mg/mL). The ethanolic extract from 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> particularly inhibited the growth of all Gram-positive bacterial strains (MIC 1â€“4 mg/mL) from other preparations, with the 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> strain being the most sensitive (MIC 4 mg/mL, MBC 8 mg/mL). The ethanolic extract also revealed lower MBC values against most Gram-positive strains than the powdered raw material and aqueous extract. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the ethanolic extract more strongly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sonnei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC 4 and 8 mg/mL, respectively) than the powdered raw material and aqueous extract. In contrast, the bactericidal activity against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria strains was the same as the aqueous extract.
