<p class="p">On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that strains of Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the preparations of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> than Gram-negative bacteria. The reference strains showed greater sensitivity to the test preparations than the clinical strains belonging to the same species (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>). The MBC values of the preparations were, in most cases, greater than the MIC values. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> preparations has been the subject of very few studies [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Ming et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] showed that the methanol extract of the underground part of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> has inhibitory activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The effect of feeding mice with 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> extracts was studied on 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection by Bany et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The infection intensity was significantly lower in mice after treatment for 7 days with a daily dose of 0.4 mg of aqueous extract than in the control group.
