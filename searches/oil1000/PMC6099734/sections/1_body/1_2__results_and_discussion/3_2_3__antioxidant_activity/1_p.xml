<p class="p">The DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay are based on single electron transfer (SET) reactions. In the DPPH and ABTS assays, this reaction results in a decrease in the absorbance of free radical species, visible as the change of color from purple (in the case of DPPH) and green/blue (in the case of ABTS) to yellow, whereas the FRAP assay relies on the ability of antioxidants to reduce Fe
