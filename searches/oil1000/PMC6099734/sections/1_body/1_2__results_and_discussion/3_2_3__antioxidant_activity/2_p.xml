<p class="p">The results obtained in this work showed that the

 <xref rid="molecules-23-01767-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Such a result can be attributed to the fact that this extract was distinguished by the highest level of phenolic compounds, particularly salidroside, which is regarded as a strong antioxidant. According to Quian et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], salidroside-reduced hydrogen peroxide induces intracellular ROS production in human erythrocytes. Results by Mao et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] showed that salidroside can prevent morphological changes in cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts after sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide. However, as per recent studies, the aglycon of salidroside (tyrosol) does not possess antioxidant activity [
