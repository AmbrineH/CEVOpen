<p class="p">Given the results obtained, evidently the dried raw material (underground organs of

 <xref rid="molecules-23-01767-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This fact can be associated with the presence of volatile fractions within this sample. According to some authors, essential oils can reveal antioxidant activity, especially those rich in phenolics (e.g., thymol and/or carvacrol) [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. However, such activity of essential oils is rather low, particularly when compared to polar extracts [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Thus, the results obtained in this study suggest that the presence of essential oil in 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> underground organs is not related to the antioxidant activity of this raw material.
