<p class="p">Because the analyzed extracts contained only traces of the volatile compounds, the total content and composition of essential oil were determined only for the raw material. It was measured to be at a level of 0.07 g/100 g, which corresponds with results obtained by other authors [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In all, 27 compounds were identified in the study, comprising 95.09% of the total identified fractions. The following were the dominant substances: tetrahydronootkatone (18.31%), geraniol (16.46%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-pinocarveol (15.71%), octanol (11.43%), and myrtenol (11.29%). 
 <italic class="italic">Trans</italic>-carveol, myrtanol, and perilla-alcohol were also present in considerable amounts (

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. According to Hethelyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], geraniol, myrtenol, and linalool are responsible for the pleasant rose-like aroma of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic>’s underground organs. In his study, Rohloff [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] listed geranyl formate, geranyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and phenylethyl alcohol as well. Results obtained by Shatar et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] indicated the domination of geraniol (32.3%), myrtenol (15.7%), and octanol (13.7%) in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic>. However, Rohloff [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] showed that the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-decanol (30.38%) was the highest, while, in the studies by Hethelyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], it was myrtenol (36.9%). The results of Evstatieva et al.’s [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] study showed significant differences in the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> essential oil originating from plants growing in various locations (e.g., 56.97% of geraniol in the sample from China; 56.22% of phenylethyl alcohol—from India). Considering such variability, it is suspected that 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> creates different essential oil chemotypes. The sample examined in the present work represents a mixed (tetrahydronootkatone/geraniol/
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-pinocarveol) chemotype.
