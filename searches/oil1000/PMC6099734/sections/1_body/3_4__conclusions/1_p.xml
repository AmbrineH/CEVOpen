 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> has become very popular in recent years. Although the European Medicines Agency recommends only particular 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> extracts to be used for medicinal purposes, there are many other preparations available and being traded in markets in the form of food additives or diet supplements. Thus, the purpose of the presented investigation was to characterize three various 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> products that could be potentially used in the herbal or food industries. Examined samples (powdered underground organs as well as their aqueous and ethanolic dry extracts) differed considerably in terms of chemical composition and biological activity. The ethanolic extract was characterized by a significantly higher content of determined phenolic compounds (salidroside, tyrosol, and rosavin derivatives) than the aqueous one and the raw material, especially with regard to rosavin. This extract revealed the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activity as well. However, the raw material also revealed a strong antibacterial effect against, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> strains. Based on data from the literature, it is suspected that such results may be related to the presence of essential oil in this product.
