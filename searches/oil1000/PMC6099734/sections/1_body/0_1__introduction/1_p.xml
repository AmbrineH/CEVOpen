<p class="p">Plants belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> genus (
 <italic class="italic">Crassulaceae</italic> family) are distributed mainly throughout the arctic zone of the Northern hemisphere. They also occur in the mountainous regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, and can be classified as arctic-alpine oreophytes. The genus consists of nearly 200 species, of which approximately 20 are used as traditional medicine in Asia, for example,

 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic>, the so-called “golden root” or “roseroot” is the most widely known and investigated species. Its underground organs (rhizomes and roots) have been used for ages in the Far East as a natural remedy to eliminate fatigue, improve memory, and enhance physical and mental performance as well as to prevent high-altitude sickness. It also has been used in the treatment of heart diseases, depression, and anxiety, and is especially recommended for hard-working people, convalescents, and elderly people [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This raw material is mainly rich in phenylethanoids, phenylpropanoid glycosides, and other phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins. Phenylethanoids are represented here by tyrosol derivatives, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-tyrosol and salidroside, while among phenylpropanoid glycosides, there are 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamic acid derivatives, such as rosarin, rosavin, rosin, and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamic alcohol. 
 <italic class="italic">Trans</italic>-cinnamic acid derivatives, classified together under the name “rosavins” are specific for 
 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic> and are not detected in other 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In the group of phenolic acids, chlorogenic, hydroxycinnamic, and gallic acids have been found, while within flavonoids, there are 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic>-specific compounds, such as rhodionidin, rhodiolgin, rhodalidin, rhodionin, and rhodalin as well as kaempferol and tricin derivatives. The presence of proanthocyanidins (prodelphinidin-gallate esters), flavonolignans (rhodiolin), and cyanogenic glycosides (rhodiocyanoside A) has been reported as well [
