<p class="p">Due to having such a wide range of biologically active compounds, roseroot has various pharmacological activities, i.e., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fatigue, anti-depressive, anxiolytic, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, neuro- and cardioprotective, and normalizing endocrine and immune activity. Given such properties,

Taking into account the definition of an adaptogen (a substance that enables an increase in the human body’s resistance to various chemical, biological, and physical stressors), roseroot is regarded as one of the most active [

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), so-called free radicals, are highly chemically active forms of oxygen that have significant impacts on cells. At low levels, they modulate gene expression and cell proliferation and can also induce transcription and apoptosis. Moreover, they participate in inflammatory and angiogenic processes. However, these substances can be overproduced as a result of oxidative stress. Thus, in high concentrations, free radicals can damage all major cell components: cell membranes, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. This could be a reason for the development of various diseases, for example, cancer, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, with the development of civilization [

The number of antioxidant compounds synthesized by plants as secondary products, mainly phenolics, serving in plant defense mechanisms to counteract ROS to survive, is currently estimated to be between 4000 and 6000 [
