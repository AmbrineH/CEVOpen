<p class="p">ABTS (ABTS radical caption) was measured according to the method of Re et al. [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. A quantity of 0.25 g of sample (dry ethanolic extract, dry aqueous extract, and powdered raw material) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol. The stock solution was prepared by stirring 7 mM of ABTS and 2.45 mM (final concentration) of potassium persulfate in water and incubating at room temperature in the dark for 16 h before use. The concentrated ABTS was diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final absorbance of 0.72 (±0.2) at 734 nm. Then, 1 mL ABTS solution was added to 100 μL of examined extracts (2-, 5-, 10-, 50- and 100-fold diluted solutions). The absorbance of ABTS was measured on the UV/Vis Shimadzu 1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer after 6 min incubation in dark, at 737 nm. The ability of the test sample to scavenge ABTS was compared to the Trolox standard. The Trolox solutions were prepared in PBS, such that the final concentrations of the standards were 0.0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mg/100 mL. The percentage inhibition of ABTS of the test samples was calculated according to the following formula: % inhibition = [(
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> − 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>)/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub>] × 100, where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> is the absorbance of a blank sample, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> is the absorbance of the test sample. The results are expressed in μmol Trolox equivalents per gram of extract.
