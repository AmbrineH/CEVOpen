<p class="p">Measurement of the DPPH radical scavenging activity was performed in accordance with Yen and Chen [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], with modifications concerning the time of reaction, in accordance with Szlachta and Małecka [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. A quantity of 0.25 g of sample (dry ethanolic extract, dry aqueous extract, and powdered raw material) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol. Then, 3 mL of methanol and 1 mL of DPPH methanolic solution (0.12 mg/mL) were added to 1 mL of the examined extract. Absorbance was measured on the UV/Vis Shimadzu 1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after 10 min at 517 nm. The blind test extract was replaced by 1 mL of methanol. The antioxidant activity of extracts was calculated as 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> = [(
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> − 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>)/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub>] × 100, where 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> is DPPH inhibition (%); 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> is the absorbance of a blank sample (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0 min); and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> is the absorption of the extract solution (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 10 min). Trolox standard in concentrations of 0.3–4.9 μg/mL was used to estimate a standard curve. Results are expressed in μmol Trolox equivalents per gram of extract.
