Afterward, the extracts were filtered through a filter paper using a Buchner funnel connected to a vacuum pump (Vacuubrand 4C) at 500 mmHg. The extracts were concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Hei-Vap Value Digital) at a vacuum pressure of 50 mBar and a temperature of 50 °C. Drying was conducted in a vacuum dryer (Binder, VD 53) at a temperature of 60 °C. No drying carriers were used.
