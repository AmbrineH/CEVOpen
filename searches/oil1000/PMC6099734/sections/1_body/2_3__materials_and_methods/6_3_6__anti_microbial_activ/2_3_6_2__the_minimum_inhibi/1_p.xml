<p class="p">The MIC and MBC of plant preparations were determined using the serial microdilution method (CLSI, 2009). Two series of dilutions were prepared in Müller–Hinton Broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of plant samples in the concentration range of 0.5–64 mg/mL using polystyrene 96-well plates, each of a volume of 200 µL (Primo, ScholaGene, Krakow, Poland). Test bacterial inoculum was added to each well of the plate, so that the final number in 1 mL was 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>. The wells containing inoculated and non-inoculated broth were prepared as growth and purity controls simultaneously. The plates with bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC value was defined as the lowest concentration of plant preparation in which no visual growth of bacteria compared with the plant sample-free control was found, and is expressed in mg/mL. The MIC examination of plant preparations was repeated three times. The MBC examination involved the transfer of 100 μL of bacterial culture from each well where no growth was observed, to the plates with Müller–Hinton Agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The growth of colonies on the plates was verified after this time. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of plant preparation which resulted in complete inhibition of bacterial growth, and is expressed in mg/mL.
