<p class="p">Commercially available standards (ChromaDex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Irvine, CA, USA) were separately dissolved in methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznań, Poland) in 10 mL volumetric flask according to the ChromaDex’s Tech Tip 0003: Reference Standard Recovery and Dilution and used as standard stock solutions [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-01767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Working standard solutions were prepared by dilution of 100 µL and 2000 µL stock solutions of each compound with methanol in 10 mL volumetric flasks. The working solutions (1 µL) and stock solutions (1, 2, 5, and 10 μL) were injected on a column in six replicates (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) to generate a six-point calibration curve. A peak table and UV-spectra library (190–500 nm) of individual compounds were created. Quantitation was done with analytical wavelength appropriate for each compound: 222 nm for salidroside and tyrosol, and 249 nm for rosarin, rosavin, rosin, and

The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio approach was used to determine the limit of detection (LOD; S/N of 3:1) and limit of quantitation (LOQ; S/N of 10:1). The content of the determined compounds was calculated in mg per 100 g of dry matter.
