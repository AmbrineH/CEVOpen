<p class="p">The quantitation was performed using a Shimadzu chromatograph, equipped with an auto-sampler (SIL-20A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan ly)), photodiode array detector (SPD-M10A VP PDA (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)), and CLASS VP
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> 7.3 chromatography software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were achieved using a C18 reversed-phase, 2.6 μm, 100 mm × 4.60 mm Kinetex
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> column (ChromaDex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Irvine, CA, USA) with a porous outer layer on solid silica core particles (Phenomenex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Torrance, CA, USA). The binary gradient of deionized water was adjusted to pH 3 with phosphoric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznań, Poland) as phase A and MeCN (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznań, Poland) was used as phase B as follows: 0.01 min at 12% B; 5.50 min at 20% B; 5.51 min at 50% B; 6.50 min at 50% B; 6.51 min at 12% B, and at 11 min, the process stopped. The flow rate was 1.2 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the oven temperature was 45 °C, and the injection volume was 1 μL.
