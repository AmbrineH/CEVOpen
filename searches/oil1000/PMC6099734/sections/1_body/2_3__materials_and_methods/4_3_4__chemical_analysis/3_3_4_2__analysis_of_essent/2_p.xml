<p class="p">For quantitative GC-FID analyses, a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a Shimadzu autoinjector AOC-20is (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) was used. The injection parameters and temperature program were the same as reported above for the GC-MS analysis. The column was a Supelcowax-10 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). Inlet pressure 100 kPa. The carrier gas was He delivered at a constant linear velocity (
