<p class="p">Qualitative GC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a Shimadzu autoinjector AOC-20is. Data were collected with 
 <italic class="italic">GCMS Labsolution</italic> software (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). The operational conditions were as follows: the temperature program went from 50 °C (2 min) to 250 °C (10 min) at 3 °C/min. The columns were SLB-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness) and Supelcowax-10 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness), both supplied by Supelco (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The GCMS-QP2010 was equipped with a split-splitless injector (250 °C). An injection volume of 0.4 µL was used in split mode (split ratio 20:1). The inlet pressure was 37.7 kPa. The carrier gas was He delivered at a constant linear velocity (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The interface temperature was 250 °C. MS ionization mode was used for electron ionization. The detector voltage was 0.95 kV. The acquisition mass range was 40–350 u. The scan speed was 1666 amu × s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The acquisition mode was full scan with a scan interval of 0.20 s. The identification of essential oil compounds was based on a comparison with mass spectra from the Mass Spectral Database-FFSNC 2, NIST 11, Wiley 9-and by a comparison with the retention indices (RI) of relative to retention times of a series of
