<p class="p">Hydrodistillation is one of the oldest and most common techniques for essential oils extraction, mostly because of its simplicity. But at the industry level, steam distillation is used more often for the production of essential oil. Due to the heating and cooling in the process, especially at the industrial level, there is a high energy consumption and, therefore, higher extraction costs. These costs could be reduced by working under moderate pressures, because of the shorter distillation time, which reduces steam consumption or heat recuperation produced during vapor condensation, thus leading to energy savings without affecting the quality of the product itself [
