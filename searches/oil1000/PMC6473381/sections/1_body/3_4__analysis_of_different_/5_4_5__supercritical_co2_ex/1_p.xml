 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot5-plants-08-00055" class="xref">Section 3.5</xref>, but it is limited by high investments, capital, and operating costs. With regard to high work pressure, heating, and cooling, the equipment and the process of extraction are expensive [

 <xref rid="B68-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], cost of production of the SFE (Supercritical Fluid Extraction) extracts was lower than those produced by conventional methods. According to a paper by Shariaty-Niassar et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], manufacturing costs (70%â€“85%) are the most expensive because of the use of high-pressure valves and pumps, especially at higher pressures and temperatures. This cost falls under fixed costs, while raw material, labor, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> supply, and utility are the operating costs. The usual costs for the SFE unit include the electricity required to operate the pump, a condenser, heating the water to warm up device, and cooling the water. In another paper [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] variable costs including costs connected with incomplete product recovery, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressing and pumping, cooling system, and idle time cost are calculated as production costs. One of the proposed approaches in reducing production costs is to maintain the variable stream circulation of the solvent through the extraction bed during a particular process step.
