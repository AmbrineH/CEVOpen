<p class="p">Infusion is one of the most general techniques used for galenical preparations, especially in the past when there was no industrial production of herbal extracts in large scales. Infusions are prepared by macerating the crude part of the plant with boiling water for a short period of time. These preparations are intended for consumption and considered freshly prepared. They are prepared in water and rapidly produce a deposit as a result of the coagulation of inert colloidal material. They also support microbial growth, and because of the fungal and bacterial growth, preparations must be consumed in a period of 12 h, which makes it unacceptable for industrial production. A period of a safe consumption can be extended with the addition of 25% alcohol during or after the extraction process, followed by dilution, according to the instructions of the European Pharmacopoeia [
