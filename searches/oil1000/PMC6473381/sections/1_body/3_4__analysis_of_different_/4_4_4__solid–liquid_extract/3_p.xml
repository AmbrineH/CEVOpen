<p class="p">Microwave-assisted extraction is one of the simple modern extraction techniques using low-cost equipment. Because of the microwave exposure it is possible to reduce extraction time and solvent usage. In processing applications, the possibility to shut the heat source affects product quality and production economics as well. Also, due to the possibility of processing a high volume of raw material over the same period, the time needed to get the final products is reduced. The problem arises in cases of the extraction of volatile and thermo-sensitive components, since cooling or venting periods are required after the extraction process [
