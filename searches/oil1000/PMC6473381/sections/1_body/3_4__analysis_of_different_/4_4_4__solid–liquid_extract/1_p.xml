<p class="p">Maceration, as one of the most common forms of solid-liquid extraction, is a very simple extraction technique whose drawbacks are a long extraction time and low extraction efficiency [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Traditional maceration involves placing milled or crushed plant material in a closed vessel with the addition of a suitable solvent, with occasional shaking. In the case of industrial production, certain adjustments are required in order to allow better extraction efficiency, with as little solvent and evaporation costs as possible. Therefore, in the industrial production of extracts, the methods of constantly circulating solvents through plant material and a multistage extraction are used.
