<p class="p">Sage has been long used and has well-documented benefits for various health conditions, but continues to elicit interest by researchers around the globe. The most commonly used and tested is sage essential oil, but recent studies, especially in the field of oncology and neurodegenerative diseases, show that other sage products offer a huge potential. New extraction techniques, such as UAE and MAE or SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction, allow us to determine new compounds in sage extracts that are unable to get by hydrodistillation or infusion. By optimization of the extraction techniques, i.e., extraction parameters, we are able to get the desired composition with the highest activity for a specific purpose. As in all other cases when the processing material is a plant, harvesting conditions, geographical area, and the plant itself affect the yield and the final bioactive composition of the extract. We are yet to evidence the number of extracts and their benefits, especially for the treatments of cancers and neurological diseases.
