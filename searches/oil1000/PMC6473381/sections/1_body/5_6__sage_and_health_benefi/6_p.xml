<p class="p">Metabolic improvements in terms of glucose and lipid profile are interesting for the fact that alterations in these parameters are directly related to diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases, i.e., diseases with the highest mortality and morbidity rates with immense individual and societal burdens. Hernandez-Saavedra et al. [

Significant reductions in the total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and C-reactive protein was found, along with a decrease in body weight and abdominal fat mass [

A non-randomized crossover trial on six women who consumed 600 mL of sage infusion per day during 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of a wash-out period, found no effect on plasma glucose, but the level of LDL and the total cholesterol lowered, while HDL increased [
