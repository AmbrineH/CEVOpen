<p class="p">However, the main obstacle when assessing the relevance of reported results remains the variable extracts used (e.g., tea, essential oils, ethanolic extracts, etc.), with different compositions of bioactive compounds. For example, the anti-inflammatory effect of the methanolic extract is associated with a higher content of polar components such as rosmarinic, ursolic, caffeic, and oleanolic acids [
