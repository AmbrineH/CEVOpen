<p class="p">The influence of temperature, extraction time, solvent composition, sage particle size, and solvent-to-sage ratio was examined by Durling et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The authors studied the efficacy of extraction of carnosic and rosemary acid as well as the yield and composition of sage essential oil. The optimum conditions for the highest yield of carnosic compounds, rosemary acid, and essential oil, which were 10.6%, 6.9%, and 7.3% respectively, were a 1 mm sample size of dried sage, 55–75% ethanol, and a solvent-to-sage ratio of 6:1 at 40 °C for 3 h. It is well-known that diffusion of the solvent is better when the plant material is ground to the smallest particle size, but grinding can cause dust generation and heat production, which may affect the composition of the plant material itself. The increase in temperature increases yield, but at a certain temperature, in this case up to 40 °C, it can cause a reduction in the yield and the evaporation of the volatile components. By increasing the time of extraction, yields and total polyphenols did not increase, i.e., they were constant, but the yield of carnosic components, rosemary acid, and essential oil increased, with the conclusion that other components were unstable for a longer duration of extraction. Therefore, the authors recommended the duration of the extraction for no longer than 3 h. As the extraction of the bioactive components was limited by the solubility in the solvent mixture used, it is important to find a suitable solvent ratio and solvent-to-sage ratio to reduce the cost of solvents and the energy associated with solvent evaporation.
