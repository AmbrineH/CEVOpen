In addition to various solvents, the extraction took place at different temperatures (60 and 90 °C) for different times (30, 60, and 90 min) to show whether these parameters influenced the amount of total and individual polyphenols. The results showed that extraction with an aqueous solution of ethanol or acetone (30%) at 60 °C for 30 min was the most effective method for extracting polyphenols from dried sage leaves.
