They studied the effect of temperature, stirring, and ultrasound (ultrasonic bath or horn system) for 12 h, and the concentration of the components was measured not only during this 12 h period, but also after 7 days. The results showed that ultrasonic extraction for 12 h at room temperature with stirring had better results compared with convectional techniques. Stirring is an important factor since it was observed that almost the same results were obtained at 30 °C without stirring and at a temperature of 20 °C with stirring. Even better results were obtained with an ultrasound horn, where a 2 h extraction resulted in the same amount of bioactive components as a 12 h extraction, but the main disadvantage of this method is the inability to control the temperature.
