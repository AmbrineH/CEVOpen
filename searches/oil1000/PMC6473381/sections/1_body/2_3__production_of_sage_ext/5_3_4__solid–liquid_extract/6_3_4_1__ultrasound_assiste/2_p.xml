UAE was performed on an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and 40 °C, while maceration was carried out for a period of 6 h at 20 °C, with petroleum ether, 70% ethanol, and water as a solvent. Among these solvents, a 70% solution of ethanol appeared to be the most appropriate because the yield had the largest number of typical components. As far as the yields were concerned, a dependence on the solvent polarity was observed, where the yields increased with the solvent polarity. Therefore, the greatest yield was in the case of water and ethanol, respectively.
