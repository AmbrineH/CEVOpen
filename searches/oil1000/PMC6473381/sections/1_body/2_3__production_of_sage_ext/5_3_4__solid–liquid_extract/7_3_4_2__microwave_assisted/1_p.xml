 <xref rid="B47-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] examined the influence of solvent (distilled water, 30% aqueous ethanol, and 30% aqueous acetone), extraction time (3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 min), as well as microwave power (500, 600, and 700 W) at a constant temperature of 80°C on extraction of total polyphenols from sage. They showed that ethanol and acetone were better solvents for the extraction of polyphenols from sage than water, especially when using a microwave power of 500 W for 9 min. In a paper by Putnik et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], the same solvents were used, almost the same extraction times (3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 min), and 100–500 W microwave power, but the difference from the previous paper was in the optimization of extraction temperature (30, 50, 60, and 80 °C) and addition of 10% HCl for better hydrolysis of polyphenol conjugates. Their results are similar to those of Dragović-Uzelac et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]; they showed that the total polyphenols were better extracted with 30% aqueous acetone at 80 °C for 10 min without HCl. Looking at individual polyphenols, the highest content of most common polyphenolic acids was extracted using 30% aqueous ethanol with the addition of HCl at 80 °C.
