<p class="p">In the research by Roby et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], sage extracts were prepared with solvents of different polarity (methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, and hexane) with shaking at room temperature for 72 h. The yield differed depending on the solvent used, and the highest yield of 23.41% ± 2.65% was achieved with methanol, whereas the lowest yield (4.63% ± 1.73%) was obtained with hexane. Likewise, the highest number of total polyphenols was found in the extracts with methanol and ethanol (5.95% ± 2.65%; 5.80% ± 1.00%), while the lowest amount was found in hexane samples (4.25% ± 1.00%). These results were expected since the polar solvents are more effective in extracting phenolic components than less polar solvents.
