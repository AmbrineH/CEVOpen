According to their results, yield was higher in plants that originated from Serbia (2.50%) than from those in Montenegro (2.03%), and yield was higher in plants that were extracted with dichloromethane (3.23%). Harvest season did not influence the yields. The content of total polyphenols and flavonoids depended on the extraction solvent and harvest season, and was higher in those plants originally from Serbia and harvested in the summer. When ethanol was used as a solvent it exhibited the highest influence on content of polyphenols, unlike ethyl acetate, which had the highest influence on content of flavonoids. Extracts of sage harvested in the summer and extracted with ethanol showed a better antioxidant activity, proving correlation between total polyphenols and antioxidant activity, which confirms the fact that polyphenols have more effect on antioxidant activity than flavonoids.
