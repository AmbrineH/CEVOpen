They have shown that supercritical fluid extraction is effective for obtaining a pure extract, especially at 35 MPa and with the addition of 1% ethanol, whose addition increases the extraction yields. Additionally, antioxidant activity of these extracts was tested, indicating the dependence on the fractionation conditions. The stronger antioxidative effect is shown for the fractions extracted in the second and third separator.
