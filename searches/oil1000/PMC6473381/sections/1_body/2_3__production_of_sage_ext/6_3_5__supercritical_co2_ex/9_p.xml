<p class="p">At similar pressures as in Glisic et al. [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] extracted wild sage using the supercritical fluid extraction. The process parameters for supercritical fluid extraction were a pressure at 80 MPa and 100–300 MPa, a temperature at 40 °C, and a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow rate of 3.23 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> kg min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 4 h. The extract yield and composition depended on the parameters used, with the highest yield of 4.65% at 30 MPa, which was in alignment with the results of Glisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Isolation of the essential oil from the supercritical fluid extract showed that the highest proportion of essential oil was found in the extract at 80 MPa (59.79%). Occhipinti et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] compared the extraction obtained by supercritical fluid extraction and the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation to determine a more suitable method for α- and β-thujone extraction. Supercritical fluid extraction was carried out at pressure of 25 MPa, a temperature of 60 °C, a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow of 6 kg h
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 90 min, and a 2% ethanol co-solvent. The extracts were fractionated using two separators to separate the terpene fraction from heavy components. Considering the yields, the statistical analysis did not show any significant difference. The yield of essential oil was 90 ± 7.5 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and was 97 ± 3.7 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in supercritical fluid extract of the leaf dry weight. However, a noticeable higher concentration of α-thujone was found in the essential oil and the same amount of β-thujone in both extracts; therefore, the authors suggest that the production of essential oil by hydrodistillation was more cost-effective and economically more acceptable. Jokić et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] investigated the influence of process parameters (pressure, temperature, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow) on the yield and composition of the extracts, with an emphasis on oxygenated monoterpenes, α-humulene, viridiflorol, and manool. The SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction was carried out at a pressure range of 10–30 MPa, a temperature of 40–60 °C, and a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow of 1–3 kg h
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with a constant time (90 min) and particle size. The color of all the extracts was yellow-brown, and it was semi-solid with a strong aroma like the plant itself, as demonstrated by Aleksovski and Sovová [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] and Glisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Pressure had a statistically significant effect on the yield and composition of extracts, while the temperature and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow did not exhibit significant influence. Thus, the optimum conditions for extraction of desired components were 13 MPa, a temperature 40 °C, and a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow rate of 3 kg h
