<p class="p">In the case of supercritical fluid extraction, Fellah et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] showed that the yield depended on the time and pressure, with the maximum yield at 160 MPa and 150 min. In addition, they showed that the total yield of essential oil produced by hydrodistillation for 300 min was equal to the yield obtained by the supercritical fluid extraction at 120 MPa and 270 min.
