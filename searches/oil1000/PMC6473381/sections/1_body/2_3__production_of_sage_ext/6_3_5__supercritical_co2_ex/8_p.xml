They also compared their extracts with the one obtained by Soxhlet extraction using ethanol-water (70:30) mixture. The supercritical fluid extraction was carried out at a pressure of 7 MPa and 10–30 MPa at the temperature of 50 °C and a CO

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The yields differed depending on the technique used. The yield was 4.82% in the case of supercritical fluid extraction at the highest pressure of 30 MPa, the yield was 26.5% in the Soxhlet extraction, and the yield was 0.5% in the in process of hydrodistillation. They also examined the visual difference between the obtained extracts, which were in accordance with the investigation of Aleksovski and Sovová [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Their conclusion was that the supercritical fluid extract was yellow-brownish, the Soxhlet extract was dark green, and both were semi-solid, as opposed to the light-yellow liquid essential oil that was obtained by the hydrodistillation process.
