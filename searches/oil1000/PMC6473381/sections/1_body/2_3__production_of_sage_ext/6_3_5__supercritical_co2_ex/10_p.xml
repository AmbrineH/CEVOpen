<p class="p">In order to obtain the extracts with a higher concentration of desired components or antioxidative activity, Glisic, Ristic, and Skala [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] studied the ultrasound-assisted extraction with different solvents (water-ethanol mixture or just water), followed by re-extraction of obtained extract with SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (150 MPa, 50 °C at flow rate of 0.4 kg h
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The investigated SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction conditions influenced the selectivity of the terpenes responsible for the antioxidant activity of sage. The best extraction procedure suggested was the ultrasound pretreatment of plant material with distilled water and re-extraction of plant material (residue) using SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 50 °C and 150 MPa.
