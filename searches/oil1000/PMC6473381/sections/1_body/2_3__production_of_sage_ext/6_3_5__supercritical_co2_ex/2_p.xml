 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction process parameters on the composition of the sage extracts, compared to the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation. The influence of different process parameters of SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction on the composition of the sage extracts was examined in the 80–100 MPa pressure range at two temperatures 45–60 °C at a constant flow rate of 0.95 kg h
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The results showed the optimum extraction conditions for the maximum percentage of oxygenated compounds were at 90 MPa and 50 °C. Process parameters that affected the composition of supercritical fluid sage extract the most were extraction time, solvent density, and pressure, since the essential oils are soluble at lower pressures. It has also been shown that the content of sesquiterpenes and diterpenes were higher in the extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction, depending on the parameters used then in essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation.
