The essential oil was a transparent liquid of light-yellow color with specific odor, while supercritical fluid extracts were a light to dark yellow color with an aroma similar to the aroma of the plants themselves. The yield of the hydrodistillation process was 27 mL kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In the case of supercritical fluid extraction, the yield ranged from 2.7% to 4.8% depending on the process parameters (9 to 12.8 MPa, 25–50 °C, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow rate of 0.35 g min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in a time of 3 h). Maximum extraction yield of 4.8% was obtained at 12.8 MPa and 50 °C, proving that the extraction yield increased with both extraction temperature and solvent density.
