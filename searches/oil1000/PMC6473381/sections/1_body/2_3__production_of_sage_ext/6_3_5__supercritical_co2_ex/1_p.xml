<p class="p">In addition to the above mentioned classical procedures, the scientific literature examines innovative extraction techniques that were developed to overcome the deficiencies of classical techniques. SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction is one of the promising alternative technologies, characterized by a good dissolution ability equivalent to organic solvents with better diffusion, lower viscosity and lower surface tension of fluid, fast and easy separation of extract and solvent, easy removal and possibility to recycle supercritical fluid from extract, and extraction of thermolabile components with minimal deformations [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has proven to be a very desirable solvent due to the fact that it possesses convenient critical properties. It is natural, cheap and widely available, non-toxic, non-flammable, chemically inert, easily removable from the product, and has no taste nor smell [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. By using SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at increased pressure, separation of components that are less volatile, higher in molecular weight, and more polar was obtained. The highest affinity of SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was achieved in the case of oxygenated organic components with medium molecular weight. Due to the nature of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, this method was excellent for extraction of vegetable oils with a very high nutritional value [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-08-00055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. On the other hand, the lack of this type of extraction lies in the fact that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is an appropriate solvent for a non-polar and slightly polar components, with low affinity for the polar components, which can be improved by using polar co-solvents (ethanol, methanol) [
