<p class="p">Here some studies showing the isolation of phenolic and terpenoid compounds are reported. For instance, Deng et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], by studying constituents in the herb of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium maculatum</italic> L. var Kansuense, isolated and characterized ten compounds were obtained and they were identified as 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-mannitol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, rutin, 3â€²-methylquercetin-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-rutinoside, n-butyl-beta-D-fructopyranoside, daucosterol, acteoside, 20-hydroxyecdysone, allantoin. Nugroho et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] isolated and characterized two new flavanol glycosides, together with other three just known using column chromatography from aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic>. The Czerwinska et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] reported that the main constituents of the aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">L. Album</italic> were phenylpropanoids, iridoids, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Czerwinska et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] in the herb of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> underlined phenylpropanoid glycosides along with iridoids and flavonoids might be the valuable bioactive compounds present in these species. The peculiar constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> plants are phenlypropanoids and iridoids. The phenylpropanoids consist in a group of compounds with a great diversity of structures including simple phenylpropanoids (i.e., derivatives of cinnamyl alcohols, cinnamic acids, phenylpropanes) and complex phenylpropanoids [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Generally they can occur rarely in the free form and are often present in bound form, linked to carbohydrates, as examples of main forms found in 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> plants. Beside phenylpropanoids, another main constituent and potential chemotaxonomic marker of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> plants are iridoids: they are monoterpenes consisting of a cyclopenta[c]pyranoid skeleton (iridane skeleton) and mainly occurring as glycosides [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Molecules such as verbascoside, cis-acteoside, and lamalboside (lamiusides A), lamiusides B, C, and E, lamiridoside, lamiol, caryoptoside, albosides A and B are examples of phenylpropanoid glycosides, described
