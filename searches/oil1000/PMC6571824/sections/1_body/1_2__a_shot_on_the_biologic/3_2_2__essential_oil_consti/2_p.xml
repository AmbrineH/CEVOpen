 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. However, the volatile components of only some species have been well studied so far, out of the 25 species of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> that are accepted [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Various studies have demonstrated that the biological and chemical activities of essentials oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> plants, not merely varied within the species and its varieties but even amid the different agro-climatic and geographical regions [

 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. A study by Alipieva et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] on the essential oils of four 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> species from Bulgaria (namely, 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. garganicum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">L. maculatum</italic> flowers) collected from nine natural populations were analyzed by using GC-MS. Although a similarity of the volatile profiles of all samples was observed, quantitative and qualitative variations in oil composition of the plants obtained from different locations were also seen. For instance, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">L. maculatum</italic> (at Losen mountain: 1.9% while at Ljaskovetz: 1.2%), 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic> (at Vlado Trichkov: 1%) and 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> (at Vlado Trichkov: 0.2%) though not from all location sites. Besides, predominantly in 
 <italic class="italic">L. maculatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. garganicum</italic> were identified other terpenoids, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, found in highest concentrations in 
 <italic class="italic">L. maculatum</italic> (at Losen mountain: 1.6% and 0.8%).
