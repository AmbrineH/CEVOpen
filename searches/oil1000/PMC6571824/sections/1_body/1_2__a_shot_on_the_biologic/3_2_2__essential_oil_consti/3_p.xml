<p class="p">Furthermore, the study of Flamini and workers [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] showed that the composition of essential oils varied, in different organs of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> species investigated. For instance, in 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic>, the content of α- and β-pinene was 35.7% in the leaves, 7.5% in the bracts while it was 75.3% in the flowers. In addition, in 
 <italic class="italic">L. bifidum</italic>, bracts and leaves displayed a profile characterized by the common presence of germacrene D, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and β-elemene, while contrastingly, the flowers emitted profiles revealing high percentages of myrcene (47.2%), β-caryophyllene (11.8%) and sabinene (11.0%).
