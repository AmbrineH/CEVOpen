<p class="p">An interesting in vivo use of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> has been described in Punjab, a region of southern Pakistan. In this region, the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> are administered orally to ruminants affected by helminth infections, at a rate of 250 g at a time [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. The duration of treatment is not standardized and is not performed by veterinary staff but by local pastors. The efficacy of the treatment, therefore, is not certified by veterinarians and needs further investigation carried out with criteria and procedures of the veterinary medicine. However, the wide use of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> as an anthelmintic in ruminants suggests that there are concrete possibilities for effective action by substances contained in the plant.
