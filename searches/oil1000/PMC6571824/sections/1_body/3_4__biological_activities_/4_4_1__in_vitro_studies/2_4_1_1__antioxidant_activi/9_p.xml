<p class="p">Hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction are known to cause oxidatively induced breaks in DNA strands via the subsequent free radical-induced reaction on plasmid DNA. Hydroxyl radicals can react with nitrogenous bases of DNA producing base radicals and sugar radicals. Polyphenols are potential protecting agents against the lethal effects of oxidative stress and offer protection to DNA by chelating redox-active transition metal ions [
