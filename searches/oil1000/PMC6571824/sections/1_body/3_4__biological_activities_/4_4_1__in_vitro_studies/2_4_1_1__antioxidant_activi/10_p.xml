<p class="p">As another example, the antioxidant effect of butanol extracts from wild specimens 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic> L. (red dead nettle) collected in Romania were compared for DPPH and chemiluminescence activity. A possible correlation between the chemical composition, especially for the amount of total phenols, and the antioxidant activity of the extracts was found [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. In both cases, the extracts possessed dose-dependent scavenger activity evaluated after 30 min. Incubation with extracts, in all dose levels tested, whereas, the 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic> extract (1% concentration) exhibited the highest scavenging activity compared with 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> extract.
