<p class="p">As is known, antioxidant molecules can be technically defined as agents that prevent or slow down the phenomenon of oxidation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unavoidable sub-products of cellular aerobic metabolism [

The reactive oxygen molecules are capable of damaging the structures of the cell through the establishment of so-called oxidative stress, a situation that, if not kept under control, can lead or exacerbate many pathological states [
