<p class="p">Polyphenols can act as antioxidants through various mechanisms, including hydrogen donating reactions, metal chelation, inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms and up-regulation or protection of antioxidant defenses (e.g., intracellular glutathione levels) [

For instance, verbascoside has shown increased chromosome aberrations and in vitro sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocyte cultures [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. However, the results may be due to instability and degradation of verbascoside in caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. The genotoxicity of verbascoside seems to have been ruled out entirely by a recent study [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. This study clearly demonstrates that diets rich in verbascoside do not give rise to any mutagenic activity, resulting in non-cytotoxic to animals and suggesting its possible use in both animal and human diets.
