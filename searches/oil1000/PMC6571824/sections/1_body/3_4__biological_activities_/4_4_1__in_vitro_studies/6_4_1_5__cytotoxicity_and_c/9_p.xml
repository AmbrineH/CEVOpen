<p class="p">This prompted Paduch et al. [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>] to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> extract on human corneal epithelial cells (10.014 pRSV-T cell line) cultured in vitro. In that study, the first goal achieved was to ascertain the ethanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> was non-toxic to human corneal epithelial cells at concentrations up to 125 Î¼g/mL. Ethanol extract contained polar compounds which contribute to maintaining cells intact, or even, stimulate cellular mitochondrial metabolism as verified by MTT assay. Besides, flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds, better represented in ethanol extracts, also contributed to the reduction of inflammatory phenomena and ROS scavenging. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that soon, after further in vivo experiments, supplements for the treatment of mild eye diseases based on extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> herb may be used.
