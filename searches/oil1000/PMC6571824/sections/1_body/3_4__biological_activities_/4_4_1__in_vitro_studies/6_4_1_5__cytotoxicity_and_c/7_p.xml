<p class="p">It is interesting to reiterate that solvent extracts of the same species, 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic>, can exert cytoprotective or cytotoxic effects according to the methods of extraction, application of the extract and the tested cell lines. Moscova-Doumanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] investigated the effect of methanol, and chloroform extracts, obtained from in vivo and in vitro cultivated plants of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic>, on the cell viability, adhesion, and cell cycle of the type A549 human lung cell line. Different combinations of methanol and chloroform extracts were tested. Preliminary results showed that both the extracts have a cytotoxic effect on lung cancer cells. They caused a reduction in the adhesion properties of the cells with a stronger effect by extracts from in vivo plants. After 48 h of incubation time, all extracts cause retention in the G2 phase while a mixture of them leads to the apoptosis. However, without characterization of the extracts, it is not possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanism of the observed phenomena.
