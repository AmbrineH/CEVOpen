<p class="p">From another work [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>], aqueous extracts of the whole 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> plant have been shown to induce cytotoxicity in the mouse tumor cell line, the B16 mouse melanoma cells at relatively low concentrations. It is difficult to determine what may be the causes of this cytotoxicity although it could be related to the content of phenolic compounds of the extract [
