<p class="p">Cytotoxicity is the measurement of how much a substance can damage or kill cells. This measurement can be performed both in vitro and in vivo, and this difference is significant, since it is one thing to measure the cytotoxic activity of a chemical agent on a cell culture in a homogeneous medium (e.g., a fibroblast layer on a medium of culture) and the measurement of cell 
 <italic class="italic">viability</italic> in vivo is very different, where many biochemical and other factors are involved. Most of the cytotoxicity studies of plant extracts have been conducted in vitro because it is the simplest method. In vitro studies, in turn, offer several advantages; e.g., they are highly reproducible simplified systems, they allow to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, the identification of early damages and allow to contain costs and get rapid responses concerning animal experimentation. The main criticism that can be found in systems for measuring cytotoxicity in vitro concerns the excessive simplification of such methods concerning a multicellular organism. Nevertheless, in vitro tests are widely used; the cytotoxicity can be carried out and evaluated with different essays. The most used is the MTT assay, the SRB assay (with Sulforhodamine B), the TB assay (with Trypan blue). In the study of cytotoxicity mechanism, the choice of the cellular model should respond to the need to study in detail the organ-specific effects of certain compounds or mechanisms of action in specific cell types. Unfortunately, most often the cellular model is chosen independently of the needs mentioned above; for this reason, the results obtained in the different studies are hardly comparable.
