 <xref rid="B133-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>] analyzed the plant extracts activity on human skin fibroblasts (HSF) proliferation and viability in order to add information on the effectiveness of these products. The sensitivity of HSF cells in culture to methanol, ethyl acetate, and heptane extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamii albi flos</italic> were investigated. Extracts with methanol, ethyl acetate and heptane of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamii albi flos</italic> were prepared by heating 20 g of plant material with 300 mL of the appropriate solvent for 5 h at a temperature of 60 °C at reflux. Each of these extracts was subsequently concentrated under reduced pressure at 30 °C up to a volume of 100 mL. The extracts thus obtained were used for the determination of flavonoids, pentacyclic triterpenes, and iridoids. The triterpene component seemed to be responsible for the absence of cytotoxicity of the heptane extracts even at high concentrations and, indeed, triterpenes can exert stimulatory effects on the proliferative capacity of HSF cells.
