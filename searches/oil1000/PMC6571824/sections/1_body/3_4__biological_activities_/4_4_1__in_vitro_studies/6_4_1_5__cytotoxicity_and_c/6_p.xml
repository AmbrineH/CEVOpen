<p class="p">When a model of chemical stress induced by potassium dichromate in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells was used, ethanolic extracts of

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Purified extract counteracted ROS formation in oxidative stress conditions in tested cells. The cytoprotective effect of 50 Âµg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> purified ethanolic extract seems related to the presence of verbascoside, which exhibited the highest cytoprotective action from all the polyphenols identified in the ethanolic extract.
