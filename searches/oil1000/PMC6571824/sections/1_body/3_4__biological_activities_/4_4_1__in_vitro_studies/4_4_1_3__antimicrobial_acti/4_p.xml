<p class="p">The great variety of species of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> genus present in Turkey [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>] has meant that traditional folk medicine made extensive use of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> herbs. On the contrary, 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> extracts possess little antifungal activity as found by Chipeva et al. [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] who evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> plants. The extracts, obtained from leaves and flowers, were harvested either in the wild or from in vitro propagated plants. Four solvents (chloroform, methanol, ethanol, and water) and two methods of extraction (SÐ¾xhlet, thermostat) were used. The different combinations of extraction solvent and extraction method led to results that also varied due to the origin of the plant, i.e., wild or in vitro propagated. In conclusion, 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> extracts possessed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity with greater efficacy towards Gram-positive bacteria. However, as the extracts have not been chemically characterized it is impossible to determine which molecule may be more responsible for such an antibacterial activity.
