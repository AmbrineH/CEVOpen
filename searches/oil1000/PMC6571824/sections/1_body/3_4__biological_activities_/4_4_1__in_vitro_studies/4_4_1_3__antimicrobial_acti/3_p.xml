<p class="p">Antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. tenuiflorum</italic> Fisch and Mey against some medical yeast species was described by Dulger et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. The ethanol extracts obtained from the leaves, rootstock, and the combined formulation of Turkish endemic specimens have been investigated for their antifungal activities against medical yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus</italic> species. The extract (in the form of sticky black substances) was dissolved in DMSO before testing. The combination of plant extracts (1:1 ratio) was used in this test. Comparing the obtained result with those of the antifungal drug ketoconazole used as a reference, it was noted that the combination of plant extracts (both leaves and rootstock) exhibited greater antifungal effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and that 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. was more susceptible than 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus</italic> spp. Unfortunately, in that study, there is no correlation between quantity and type of polyphenols present in the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">L. tenuiflorum</italic> and the antimycotic activity found. Conversely, none of the extracts obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">L. galactophyllum</italic> Boiss and Reuter, 
 <italic class="italic">L. macrodon</italic> Boiss and Huet and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> displayed activity towards 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. Lacking such an antimycotic power could be due to the different quantity of polyphenols contained in these species, ranging between 94 and 112 mg GAE/g in respect to higher values found for 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> which extracts ranged between 184 and 193 mg GAE/g [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>].
