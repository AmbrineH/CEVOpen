<p class="p">Generally, the term ‘natural antibiotics’ refers to those substances endowed with antibacterial activity deriving from plants. In fact, antibiotics of natural origin do not derive only from plants, but also from fungi, bacteria, and animals. Antibiotics are substances used to fight bacterial infections and may have bacteriostatic action (i.e., inhibit bacterial growth) or bactericidal (i.e., they can kill bacteria). A similar argument can be made for the antimycotics that are used to counteract the development of pathogenic fungi.</p>
