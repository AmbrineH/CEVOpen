<p class="p">The current study of Etsassala et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>] applied a fast screening method using a cyclic voltammetry technique for evaluating anti-tyrosinase activity of twenty-five species of plants from the 
 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> family: among these, those that showed a fast current inhibition rate at a minimum concentration when compared to a kojic acid standard were classified as having the greatest anti-tyrosinase activity such as 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia chamelaeagnea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. dolomitica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus ecklonii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. namaensis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. zuluensis</italic>.
