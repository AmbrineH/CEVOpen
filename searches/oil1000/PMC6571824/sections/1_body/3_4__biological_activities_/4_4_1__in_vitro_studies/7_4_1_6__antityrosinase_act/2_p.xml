 <italic class="italic">L. amplexicaule</italic> showed in vitro inhibitory activity against the mushroom tyrosinase. The tyrosinase inhibition mechanism and related kinetics have not been studied in detail. In the study, it is hypothesized that the high group of hydroxyl groups present on the isolated flavonoid molecule may be responsible for binding to the catalytic site of tyrosinase, and result in an inhibition phenomenon according to previous studies [
