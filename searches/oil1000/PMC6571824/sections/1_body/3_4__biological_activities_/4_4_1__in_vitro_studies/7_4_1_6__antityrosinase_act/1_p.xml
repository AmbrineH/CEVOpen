<p class="p">Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a ubiquitous enzyme containing two copper ions. The dinuclear copper center of tyrosinase catalyzes the o-hydroxylation of monophenols, oxidation of catechols [

In animals, as the enzyme catalyzes the first two main steps of the melanogenesis. Overproduction of melanin can result in various hyperpigmentation disorders including melasma and age spots. Thus the discovery of new tyrosinase inhibitors has been since many years the main goal of numerous investigations [
