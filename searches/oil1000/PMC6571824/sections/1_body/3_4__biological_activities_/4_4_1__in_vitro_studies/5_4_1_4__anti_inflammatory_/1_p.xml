<p class="p">Arachidonic acid is the main precursor of eicosanoids, substances involved in the bodyâ€™s inflammatory response. In the presence of tissue damage, enzymes belonging to the phospholipase class A2 release the arachidonic acid from the membrane phospholipids. From this, two different molecular types can be obtained: the series 2 of prostaglandins and thromboxanes (from the cyclooxygenase pathway) and the series of leukotrienes (from the lipoxygenase pathway). The synthesis of the series 2 of prostaglandins (PG2) and thromboxanes is mediated by the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is present in the human organism in the form of COX1 and COX2. The synthesis of leukotrienes is linked to the activity of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. From these observations, pharmacological research on molecules able to counteract the effects of arachidonic acid derivatives by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the inflammatory cascade has started. To this end, enzymes extracted from both animal and vegetable sources used as enzymatic model systems to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of plant extracts and active ingredients are also used.</p>
