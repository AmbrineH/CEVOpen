<p class="p">Pain therapy aims to recognize, evaluate and treat chronic pain in the most appropriate way. There are several classes of drugs that can be used for the treatment of pain. The type of drug to be used can vary depending on the origin, the nature and the intensity of the painful stimulus that is intended to be treated. Depending on the circumstances can be used: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen and nimesulide), opioid analgesics (e.g., codeine, tramadol, buprenorphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, methadone, hydromorphone and morphine), antidepressants, very useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine); anticonvulsants, also useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin); local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine). Unfortunately, the use of such drugs is often accompanied by sometimes serious side effects, which may sometimes outweigh the benefits of the drug. For this reason, over the past few years, general attention has shifted to non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., radiotherapy, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, massages, physiotherapy, relaxation techniques). Increasing attention has also concerned the active ingredients from medicinal plants. Although widely used in traditional folk medicine, there are only a few studies investigating the potential analgesic effects of the
