<p class="p">About the inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> extracts, cannot be ignored a study in which the leaves of this herb have been used as a placebo to test the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">U. dioica</italic> (stinging nettle) [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. That study prompted from the observation that the sting of the common stinging nettle has long been used for self-treatment of arthritic pain. A randomized controlled double-blind crossover study in twenty-seven patients with osteoarthritic pain at the base of the thumb or index finger was performed to ascertain if the daily application of nettle leaves in the painful area brought relief. 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> leaves were chosen as a placebo since leaves are almost indistinguishable from stinging nettle leaves. It was remarkable that after a week of treatment the score reduction with 
 <italic class="italic">U. dioica</italic> leaves was significantly greater than that with placebo (
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> leaves).
