<p class="p">Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> have been shown to inhibit lipoxygenase activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>], at relatively low concentrations of extract (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> â‰ˆ1.5 mg/mL). As these extracts have not been further characterized, it is not possible to attribute this inhibition activity of lipoxygenase to a specific molecule. It is very likely that this effect is due to more than one molecule and through several mechanisms. In fact, many studies have established that free oxygen radicals are implicated in inflammatory processes [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>] and that phenolic compounds can block lipoxygenase activity, or they can function as scavengers of free radicals which are released during the inflammatory cascade of arachidonic acid [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory bioactivity of compounds was also proved with aqueous-methanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">L. album</italic> herb in human neutrophils as recently showed by Czerwinska [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01913" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. This effect appears to be due to the inhibition of the release of some inflammation mediators, such as the IL-8 and 3 TNF cytokines, by neutrophil granulocytes.
