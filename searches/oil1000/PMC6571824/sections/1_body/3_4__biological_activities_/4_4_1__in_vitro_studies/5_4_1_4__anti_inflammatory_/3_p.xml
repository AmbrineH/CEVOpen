<p class="p">Rheumatoid arthritis is a multifactorial chronic, systemic and disabling inflammatory disease with an undefined etiology, but probably of autoimmune origin. It mainly affects the symmetrical joints, but also tendons, synovium, muscles, bags and other tissues of the organism. Rheumatoid arthritis develops because, in a genetically predisposed subject, an environmental triggering event activates an auto-immune response; there is thus an abnormal activation of the immune system, which affects the joints causing chronic inflammation and consequent joint damage.</p>
