<p class="p">Beside specific aspects of plant biochemistry, this review underlined the use of 
 <italic class="italic">Lamiun</italic> plants (some species) in the formulation of natural remedies for topical use, preparation of functional foods, possible action as tyrosinase inhibitors, among others. Lamiaceae is one of the most extensive and diverse plant families about their ethnomedicinal properties. Besides the great representativity of species, chemotaxonomic markers are individuated as well as targeted biological functions.
