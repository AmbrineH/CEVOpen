 <p> Different concentrations of glucose, peptone and yeast extract on biomass and carbohydrate productions in Aurantiochytrium sp. strain No. 32 and evaluation of the related FT-IR results. ( A), Effects of concentrations of glucose on biomass and carbohydrate production; ( B), Effects of concentrations of peptone on biomass and carbohydrate production; ( C), Effects of concentrations of yeast extract on biomass and carbohydrate production; ( D), the linear relationship between the carbohydrate contents deduced by the traditional method and the FT-IR method. Data are given as means Â± standard deviation, n = 3. Filled blank, biomass; White blank, carbohydrate content; blank with diagonal, carbohydrate yield. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01 The yield under the medium composed of 40 g/L glucose, 10 g/L peptone, and 5 g/L yeast extract was set as the control. </p>
