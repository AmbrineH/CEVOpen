<p class="p">A bio-macromolecule analysis based on the FT-IR, specific for the oleaginous 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., was firstly constructed in this study. This method was economic, green, and accurate, and was applied in strain screenings, medium optimization, and fermentation. Two 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains were screened for lipid and carbohydrate productions, respectively. Lipid and carbohydrate accumulated rapidly when the concentration of the reducing sugar in medium consumed to deficiency, and accumulation of lipid was ahead of that of carbohydrate. The 5-l fermentation performance of the two strains confirmed their potentials for lipid, DHA, and carbohydrate production, and broad applications in medical, food, and feed industries.
