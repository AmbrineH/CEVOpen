<p class="p">Screening 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains with high-level content of lipid or carbohydrate is the first and most essential step for achieving their significant industrial value. However, traditional biochemical analysis of lipid and carbohydrate need a long time, a large amount of cell culture and multi-instruments, leading to time and space limitations for screening. FT-IR is a high-throughput method for cellular biomolecular analysis, and needs a trace amount of cell culture, enabling it to be used for the rapid and high- throughput screening of
