<p class="p">Protein, carbohydrate, and lipid are three major bio-macromolecules of the cell and play different roles in the cell. Protein is closely related to basic biosynthesis and cell division, while lipids and carbohydrate serve as intracellular reservoirs of carbon and energy. Cells preferentially synthesize carbohydrate or lipid rather than protein for reserving carbon and energy to answer the poor growth condition. To screen 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains synthesizing high level of carbohydrate and lipid, the medium with nitrogen limitation condition, which might increase the carbohydrate and lipid synthesis and lead to a reduced synthesis of the protein [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], was used in this study. A total of 109 strains in our 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain library were analyzed by FT-IR. Based on the cellular contents of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein, a total of 18 strains were picked up among the 109 strains for further analysis after the 1st screening round (Data not shown). The FT-IR absorption profile for the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A. Lipid was the bio-macromolecule with the highest content in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cell, followed by protein and carbohydrate in proper order, consistent with its oleaginous characteristic and similar to other 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Absorption areas of representing peaks were used to quantify the contents of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A,B, the highest content of lipid was obtained in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6, while the lowest content of protein was obtained in this strain. The strain No. 32, with the highest content of carbohydrate, is a potential carbohydrate producer. Oppositely, the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 103 had the highest content of protein in its cell, with the lowest content of lipid and carbohydrate. These results indicated that the contents of carbohydrate and lipid, and the content of protein were negatively correlated in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cell. The traditional biochemical methods for analyzing lipid, carbohydrate, and protein in the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells were applied to validate the accuracy of FT-IR analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). To correct the effect of deuterated metabolic products on contents of three biomolecules in the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells, the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 was cultured in the medium prepared with D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O for cell deuteration (D group). Meanwhile, the cells cultured in the medium prepared with H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were set as the H group. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the FT-IR profiles of the D- and H-group cells were very similar. Further quantification analysis deduced by the FT-IR showed that the contents of three biomolecules, including lipid, protein and carbohydrate, were similar for the D- and H-group cells, suggesting that deuteration of cell or deuterated metabolic products distributed in a cell cannot affect the FT-IR results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C). Biomass composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. varied greatly among the 18 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The lipid made up 35.9–67.0% of DCW, the protein made up 8.0–14.0% of DCW, and the carbohydrate made up 3.8–8.4% of DCW. The FT-IR absorption area and the corresponding protein, carbohydrate and lipid content, were analyzed respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, good linear correlations among FT-IR absorption area versus protein (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9381), carbohydrate (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9226) and lipid (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9164) contents, respectively, were observed in 18 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains. In this study, two normalization strategies, with amide I (1690–1650 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, associated with biomass) and C–H stretching region (3000–2800 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, associated with lipid) as internal reference peaks for assessments of the relative contents of protein, lipid and carbohydrate, respectively, were applied to minimize the peak absorption’s fluctuation caused by the inhomogeneous thickness of sample tablet [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, weak linear correlations were obtained through these two normalization methods, indicating that the two normalization methods are highly species-specific among microorganism strains, and not suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains (data not shown). As the Lambert-Beer’s law described, the lipid or carbohydrate content (% DCW) is proportional to the corresponding FT-IR areas normalized by the amide I band (A
 <sub class="sub">lipid or carbohydrate</sub>/A
 <sub class="sub">amide I</sub>) only when the protein content keeps unchanged if the ratio of the molar absorptive coefficients of protein and lipid or carbohydrate is a constant [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This law is not suitable in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain due to the high variations of protein content in its cellular composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In the present study, we normalized the OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of every cell sample to 0.1 and then analyzed its FT-IR profile. There were good linear correlations between lipid, carbohydrate and protein content (%DCW) and the corresponding FT-IR areas normalized by the OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> (A
 <sub class="sub">lipid, carbohydrate or protein</sub>/0.1 OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>), indicating that FT-IR analysis normalized by the OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> can be used to analyze cellular composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains. The same method was also applied to normalize the FT-IR peaks to analyze the lipid, carbohydrate and protein content in algae, yeast, and bacteria cell [
