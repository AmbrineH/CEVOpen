<p class="p">Based on the optimized media for the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6 and No. 32, respectively, 5 L fermentations were performed for lipid and carbohydrate productions under the FT-IR monitoring. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>A, a total of 119.1 g/L reducing sugar was consumed, and a maximum DCW of up to 66.4 g/L was obtained in 60 h. The cell of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6 entered the stable stage of growth at 54 h and was kept until the end of fermentation at 72 h. At the later period of fermentation, the maximum lipid content and DHA yield, up to 72.4% DCW and 21.6 g/L, respectively, were obtained at 66 h, suggesting that the carbon resource was first consumed for cell growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6, and then for lipid synthesis when the carbon resource was consumed to deficiency. The DCW, lipid and DHA productivities of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 could reach up to 1.11 g/L/h, 0.72 g/L/h and 0.33 g/L/h, respectively, higher than those of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains YLH70, SR21, and 
 <italic class="italic">Japonochytrium marinum</italic> AN-4 [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. As an essential fermentative parameter of oleaginous 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., lipid content was monitored through FT-IR method synchronously, guiding for lipid and DHA production of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. with high speed and accuracy.
