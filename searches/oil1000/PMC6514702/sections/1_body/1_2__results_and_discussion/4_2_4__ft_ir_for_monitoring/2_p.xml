<p class="p">FT-IR method was also used for carbohydrate analysis during the fermentation by 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>B, a total of 99.9 g/L of reducing sugar was consumed during the fermentation process (96 h), with a consumption rate of up to 1.04 g/L/h, indicating an ideal fermentative characteristic of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 without apparent glucose inhibition effect. The cell of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 reached the stable stage of growth at approximate 78 h, and the maximum biomass of 49.1 g/L was obtained at 84 h. The biomass productivity for 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 was 0.58 g/L/h. Meanwhile, a maximum carbohydrate production of 31.3% DCW, reaching up to 15.4 g/L, was obtained at 84 h with carbohydrate productivity of up to 0.18 g/L/h. It was found that the carbohydrate content in the cell of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 begun to be improved when the concentration of reducing sugar dropped to approximate 20 g/L and reached the highest level during the stable stage of the cell growth. This result suggested that the reducing sugar was first inflowed into the metabolic pathway for cell growth, and then into the carbohydrate synthesis for energy reservation when the reducing sugar was consumed to deficiency. Moreover, although microbial cell preferentially synthesizes lipid and carbohydrate under the nutrition conditions, lipid was accumulated more rapidly than carbohydrate. This finding could explain why the emergence of the maximum carbohydrate content in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 (at 66 h) was later than that of the maximum lipid content in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 (at 84 h), and carbohydrate fermentation needed more time for higher productivity [

 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. has been widely applied as feed and nutrient-enriching composition in aquatic and livestock industries, due to the multiple nutrition in its cell, such as lipid-rich in PUFAs, carbohydrate, protein, and micronutrients [
