 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 had been screened for the high carbohydrate content in its cells, and the medium composition was further optimized for carbohydrate production. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the highest carbohydrate content and yield (34.2% DCW, 7.56 g/L) were obtained under the optimal medium with 100 g/L glucose, 20 g/L peptone and 30 g/L yeast extract, 307% and 367% higher than those in the initial condition. As a heterotrophic marine protist, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 could utilize up to 100 g/L of glucose to grow fast (22.1 g/L of biomass in 4 days) without glucose effect and inhibition, making it an ideal strain for industrial fermentation purposes. Meanwhile, the carbohydrate content and yield in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 cell could reach up to 34.2% of DCW and 7.56 g/L, which were higher than those in 
 <italic class="italic">A. limacinum</italic> SR21 cell (33.38% DCW, 3.84 g/L) and those in 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. HX-308 (13.58% DCW, 6.63 g/L) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Under nutrient limitations, microbial cell preferentially synthesized carbohydrate and lipid for the carbon and energy reservation. However, accumulation of lipid was enhanced more quickly than that of carbohydrate in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. under different nutrient limitation conditions [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Thus, a relatively low C/N ratio of 2 was the optimal value for balancing carbohydrate synthesis and biomass in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 to avoid over-accumulation of lipid, lower than that (4.8) of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 for lipid production. Meanwhile, many micro-elements, such as metal elements and vitamins, were essential for 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains for cell growth and metabolite synthesis, increasing the production cost significantly [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Unlike the other strains, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 did not need any micro-elements to obtain a high level of biomass and carbohydrate in its cell. This result indicates that the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 is an ideal potential candidate for producing carbohydrate.
