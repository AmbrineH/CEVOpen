<p class="p">Moreover, the FT-IR method was also used for lipid and carbohydrate contents analysis in optimization performances, and the results (% DCW) from the FT-IR method and the traditional biochemical method had high linear correlations with R

The linear equations representing lipid and carbohydrate contents with the FT-IR method (x-axis) vs the traditional biochemical method (y-axis) were y = 1.5168x − 26.143 for lipid and y = 1.0231x − 0.1715 for carbohydrate (

 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrium</italic> sp. cells [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Meanwhile, the 3000–2800 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> area of FT-IR, representing the C–H stretching vibration acyl chains, was also used to analyze the lipid contents in marine microalgae with the amino I area (1650 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) as the internal standard. However, this range of area in FT-IR could not be used to quantify the lipid content in some microalgae due to its high variability in this area of FT-IR caused by the overlapping of OH bond absorption and therefore leading to misinterpretations [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, these two areas in FT-IR, representing two important chemical bonds in lipid, were firstly considered in combination for lipid analysis in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells due to its high lipid content and relative stable profile in the 3000–2800 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of FT-IR, and a high accuracy for lipid analysis (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9006) was obtained through this analysis method. However, these results above were obtained at an approximate lipid content range of 45–73% DCW, cells with the lipid content under 26% DCW might not be analyzed by this FT-IR method. This result indicated that the FT-IR method for lipid analysis used in this study is specific for the oleaginous microorganism, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. (with higher lipid content, up to 70% in cells), while not fit for the microorganisms with low lipid content.
