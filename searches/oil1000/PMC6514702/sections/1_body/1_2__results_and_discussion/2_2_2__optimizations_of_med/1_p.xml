 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 had been screened for lipid and DHA productions; however, the media composition needed to be further optimized to obtain the optimal yields. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the optimal lipid content and DHA yield of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 were 73.6% DCW and 8 g/L when the concentrations of glucose, peptone and yeast extract were 120, 15 and 10 g/L, 35.1% and 25% higher than those in the initial condition. 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 could endure up to 120 g/L glucose, and did not exhibit the glucose inhibition until the concentration of glucose reached up to 140 g/L, which was higher than those of the other 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains, and characterized the 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 as an ideal lipid and DHA producer needing less fed-batch times with lower potential pollution risk [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. C/N ratio in the medium is a key factor regulating lipid synthesis in oleaginous microorganisms, and the high C/N ratio condition (Nitrogen limitation) induces improvement of lipid production for carbon and energy reservations as an anti-stress response. Under nitrogen limitation condition, residual carbon source in medium flow to the lipid synthesis by producing acetoacetyl coenzyme A, which was the structural unit for lipid and DHA synthesis. However, a high C/N ratio is a disadvantage to cell growth and protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The optimal C/N ratio of the cultivation medium for lipid and DHA synthesis in strain 6 was up to 4.8 (glucose as carbon resource, peptone and yeast extract as nitrogen resource), which induced lipid and DHA synthesis significantly and had no obvious negative effect on cell growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Huang et al. found that a low C/N ratio (1.25) was optimal for 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium limacinum</italic> SR21 to produce lipid and DHA at a balance condition between biomass and lipid synthesis [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Results reported by Ryu et al. indicated that the highest DHA productivity (38.8% of total lipid) was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. KRS101 when a C/N ratio in the medium was up to 20 [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. These results validated that the C/N ratio in medium plays a significant role in regulating biomass, lipid and DHA productions in 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., and showed strain-specific among different strains.
