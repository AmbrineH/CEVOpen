<p class="p">Assessments of the FT-IR and traditional methods for analysis of bio-macromolecule were summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01593-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. At least 1 g of the dried cell is needed for analysis using the traditional biochemical method; thus, at least 50 mL of liquid sample was cultured and lyophilized. The time consumption of this method for analysis is at least 72 h, including cell lyophilization and grinding, lipid extraction and weighing, carbohydrate extraction, reaction with sulfuric acid and anthrone, and analysis of carbohydrate content. A large number of reagents, such as liquid nitrogen, chloroform, methanol, sulfuric acid, and anthrone, which have severe corrosivity, irritation, and pollution, have to be used in the traditional biochemical method. Moreover, numerous pieces of equipment, such as the centrifuge, freeze dryer, mortar, pestle, evaporimeter, and balance, are also essential for the traditional method. Thus, the traditional biochemical method for bio-macromolecules is time-consuming, expensive, equipment-limited and severely polluted. The 96 well microplates are used for analysis in FT-IR. Therefore, only approximately 200 Î¼L of the liquid sample is needed for every sample analysis through FT-IR. Without cell lyophilization, bio-macromolecule extraction and analysis, only approximate 4 h is required for FT-IR analysis, saving approximate 17 times than that of the traditional biochemical method. Moreover, due to the simple process, only the FT-IR spectrometer and spectrophotometer are needed in FT-IR, and no chemical reagent is required for analysis. Unlike the traditional biochemical methods, which can detect only one kind of bio-macromolecule at a time, the FT-IR can simultaneously detect the content of lipid, carbohydrate and protein components. However, the overlap of the stretching vibration peaks of different biochemical components made FT-IR analysis a certain degree of quantity inaccuracy. In this study, various combinations of peaks-integration and normalization were analyzed and compared with the results from the traditional biochemical methods, and high coefficients of determination (R = 0.9006 for lipid and R = 0.9575 for carbohydrate) were obtained. Thus, FT-IR analysis is a very economical and green method with less pollution and high accuracy for bio-macromolecule analysis in
