<p class="p">The FT-IR analysis was based on the method described by Giordano et al. with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The optical density (OD) of the cell under 600 nm for every culture sample was measured and calculated. A proper proportion of dilution with the blank medium was performed to make sure the OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of every sample as 0.1. The culture with OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> value of 0.1 was harvested by centrifugation at 6000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was then washed twice with sterile isotonic saline. After the final wash, a total of 50 µL isotonic saline was left, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in this volume. For FT-IR spectroscopy analysis, 30 µL of cell suspension for every sample was homogenized using pipettor in 96 well microplates and dried at 60 °C for 90 min. Spectra were acquired with a TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a High Throughput Screening eX-Tension (HTS-XT) unit. The spectral region was set 4000 to 600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, an aperture of 5.0 mm, taking 64 scans that were subsequently averaged. The spectra were resorted to baseline correction to minimize variations between spectra caused by the baseline shift. The OPUS 6.5 software (Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA, USA) package was used for quantitive and qualitative analysis of target peaks.
