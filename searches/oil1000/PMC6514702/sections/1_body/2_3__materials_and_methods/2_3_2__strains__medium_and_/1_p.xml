<p class="p">A total of 109 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains from our 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> library, which was isolated from the mangrove ecosystem in Yueqing Bay (Zhejiang, China), were used in this study [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Each strain was preserved in 20% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glycerol and at −80 °C before it was used. The strain was transferred onto the GPY plate (2% glucose, 1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 20% sea salt and 20% agar powder) for purification and recovering of strains. For screenings of strains with high levels of lipid, protein and carbohydrate contents, respectively, the single colony was transferred into the 250 mL flask containing 50 mL screening medium and cultured at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 3 days. The screening medium was composed of 8% glucose, 1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 20% sea salt (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and 50% D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, as the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O medium and the D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O medium, respectively. The 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 was selected as the analyzed strain, and it was transferred into the D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O medium and cultured for deuteration of cell. The cultured cells under the D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O medium were washed and diluted with D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and was set as the D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O-treated group (D group). Meanwhile, the cells cultured in the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O medium and prepared with H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were set as the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O-treated group (H and the control group). The cells of two groups were analyzed by the FT-IR based on the method described below. The results from the two groups were compared and analyzed.
