<p class="p">The biomass was determined as the dried cell weight (DCW) or the optical density under 600 nm (OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>). For DCW analysis, an aliquot of 50 mL of culture was centrifuged at 4 °C and 10,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min and then washed twice with distilled water. The cell pellet was lyophilized to a constant weight at 50 °C for 2 days. If needed, the dried cells were pestled into a fine powder with mortar under liquid nitrogen for further analysis. For OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> analysis, proper dilution time of cell culture with a blank medium was performed to make sure the reading of spectrophotometer was at a range of 0.1–0.3. The OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of cell culture was then calculated.
