<p class="p">To optimize media composition for lipid and carbohydrate productions, glucose, peptone and yeast extract, representing carbon and nitrogen resources, were optimized through the “One at a time” method. Different concentrations of glucose (40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 g/L), peptone (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 g/L) and yeast extract (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 g/L) were tested, and one factor was optimized when the other factors were fixed. The biomass, lipid, and carbohydrate, measured by the traditional method and FT-IR method, respectively, were responses for optimizations.</p>
