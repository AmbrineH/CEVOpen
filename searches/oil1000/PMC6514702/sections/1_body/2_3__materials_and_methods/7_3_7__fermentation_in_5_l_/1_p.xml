<p class="p">The RALF 5 l bioreactor (Bioengineering, Switzerland) was used to perform the fed-batch bioreactor cultivations using the optimal media obtained from above optimizations. The pre-culture was prepared in a 500 mL flask and then transferred into the 5 L bioreactor containing 4 l media optimized for lipid and carbohydrate production, respectively. For lipid production, the fermentation was set based on our previous method [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The temperature was set at 25 °C with aeration and agitation rate kept at 2 vvm and 600 rpm, respectively. For carbohydrate production, the fermentation temperature was set at 28 °C with aeration and agitation rate kept at 1 vvm and 400 rpm, respectively. Fifty milliliters of sample was taken at 6 h intervals over the entire cultivation (72 h for lipid fermentation and 96 h for carbohydrate fermentation) for DCW, reducing sugar, lipid, fatty acid, carbohydrate, and FT-IR analyses.
