<p class="p">Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a kind of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), plays essential roles in alleviating cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancer in humans [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Moreover, aquatic animals and poultries also require DHA for their development and survival [

 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. is a kind of 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrids</italic>, which belong to a group of heterotrophic, unicellular, marine protists, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Oblongichytrium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">Thraustochytrids</italic> are considered to form one genus [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. As a well-known oleaginous microorganism, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. can accumulate a large amount of lipid, rich in DHA in its cell. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. is a DHA producer and a substitute for the traditional fish oil resource as a new DHA resource [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Moreover, cells of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. are rich in valuable metabolites, such as terpenoids, pigment, carbohydrate, and protein, which have high nutritional values and multiple physiological functions. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. has been widely applied in the medical, food, and feed industries [
