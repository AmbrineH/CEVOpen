<p class="p">In the present study, an analytic method based on the FT-IR technology for the three main bio-macromolecules, including lipid, carbohydrate, and protein, will be constructed to analyze the cellular composition of the oleaginous protist 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. This method will be applied in strain screening, medium optimization and fermentation of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. The feasibility and reliability of the FT-IR method and the potentials of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains for lipid and carbohydrate productions will be evaluated, which accelerates the research development of 
 <italic class="italic">Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., and improves its applications in medical, food and feed industries.
