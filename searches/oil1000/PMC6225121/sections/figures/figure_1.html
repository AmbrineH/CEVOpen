 <p> Effects of geraniol and citral on physiological qualities of rice infected by A. flavus and A. ochraceus. The grains were stored for various time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 d) with geraniol (0.5 μL/mL), citral (0.5 μL/mL), and AlP (10 mg/L) treatment and sterile water (control), respectively. ( A) Changes in pH values with A. flavus; ( B) Changes in fatty acid content with A. flavus; ( C) Changes in MDA content with A. flavus; ( D) Changes in colony number of A. flavus; ( E) Changes in pH values with A. ochraceus; ( F) Changes in fatty acid content with A. ochraceus; ( G) Changes in MDA content with A. ochraceus; and ( H) Changes in colony number of A. ochraceus. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Different letters at each time point denote significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05), and an asterisk ( p &lt; 0.05) and two asterisks ( p &lt; 0.01) are used when compared with control according to Duncan’s test. </p>
