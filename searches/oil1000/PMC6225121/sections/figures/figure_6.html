 <p> Effects of combined EOCs and MAP on the preservation-related parameters in rice grains. The grains were treated with geraniol (0.5 μL/mL), citral (0.5 μL/mL), AlP (10 mg/L), and sterile water (control) respectively for 8 days under different MAP conditions (25% CO 2 and 75% N 2; 50% CO 2 and 50% N 2; 75% CO 2 and 25% N 2; 100% CO 2) at 25–30 °C and 80–90% relative humidity (RH). ( A) Changes in pH values with A. flavus; ( B) Changes in fatty acid content with A. flavus; ( C) Changes in MDA content with A. flavus; ( D) Changes in colony number of A. flavus; ( E) Changes in pH values with A. ochraceus; ( F) Changes in fatty acid content with A. ochraceus; ( G) Changes in MDA content with A. ochraceus; and ( H) Changes in colony number of A. ochraceus. </p>
