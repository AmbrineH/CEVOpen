 <p class="p">The grain contamination by 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. has been a serious issue. This study exhibited the excellent antifungal effects of the essential oil compounds (EOCs) geraniol and citral against common grain pathogens (
  <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>) in vitro and in situ. The inhibitory mechanisms were also evaluated from the perspective of cell membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. growth-related gene expression. Meanwhile, the combined effects of EOCs in the vapor phase and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) were examined to find an alternative preservation method for controlling 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. The results indicated that citral exhibited the antifungal activity mainly by downregulating the sporulation- and growth-related genes for both pathogens. Geraniol displayed inhibitory effectiveness against 
  <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> predominantly by inducing the intracellular ROS accumulation and showed toxicity against 
  <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> principally by changing cell membrane permeability. Furthermore, the synthetic effects of EOCs and MAP (75% CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 25% N
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>) induced better grain quality than the current commercial fumigant AlP. These findings reveal that EOCs have potential to be a novel grain preservative for further application.
