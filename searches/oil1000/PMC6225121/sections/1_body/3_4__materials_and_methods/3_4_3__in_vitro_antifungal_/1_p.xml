<p class="p">The divided-plate method to determine antifungal activity was used as described by Chaves et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, a fresh 5 mm plug of pathogens was transferred to the center of one half of a divided plate containing PDA medium, and each essential oil with a different volume was added on another compartment of the plates (50 mL) to attain 0 (control), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 μL/mL concentrations. Then, the plates were hermetically sealed with parafilm to prevent the escape of oil volatiles. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7 days, and the radial growth diameters of colonies were measured in two mutually perpendicular directions to obtain the mean diameter each day. These measurements were carried out three times. The lowest concentration of essential oil which completely inhibited fungal growth was designated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the percent of mycelial inhibition was calculated using the following equation: (colony diameter in control − colony diameter in treatment)/(colony diameter in control − 5) × 100%, where 5 is the initial diameter of the plaque (mm).
