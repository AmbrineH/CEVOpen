<p class="p">Materials: The fresh rice grains were purchased from a local market in the Xihu district of Hangzhou, China. PDA medium (potato, 200 g; dextrose, 20 g; agar, 15 g; and distilled water, 1000 mL; pH 5.6 ± 0.2) and plate count agar (PCA) medium (pancreatic digest of casein, 5.0 g; yeast extract, 2.5 g; dextrose, 1.0 g; agar, 15 g; and distilled water, 1000 mL; pH 7.0 ± 0.2) medium were autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Tablets of aluminium phosphide (AlP) was obtained from Shanghai Skyblue Chemical Co., Ltd. and stored in a dry safety cabinet. EOs’ main bioactive components such as geraniol and carvone which were extracted and separated from natural

 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO’s component, eugenol of clove EO’s component, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Citral and anethole were extracted from lemongrass EO and anise EO with hydrodistillation to attain a high-purity grade (95–100%) by anhydrous sodium sulphate drying in accordance with a previously described method [
