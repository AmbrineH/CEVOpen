<p class="p">The surface morphology and microstructures of grains were characterized by a field emission SEM (TM-1000, Hitachi, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The following procedures were adopted for the samples before microscopic observation. The control and treated grains were first soaked in phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.0) containing 2.5% (
