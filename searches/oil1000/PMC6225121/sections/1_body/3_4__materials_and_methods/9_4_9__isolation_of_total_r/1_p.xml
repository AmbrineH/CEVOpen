<p class="p">Fungal mycelia were collected by filtering and ground under liquid nitrogen conditions to extract the total RNA by using the MiniBEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the obtained RNA was evaluated by a nucleic acid spectrophotometer (Nanodrop ND-1000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 260 nm and 280 nm to check the purity and integrity. The RNA samples were treated with gDNA Eraser (Vazyme, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) to avoid interference from the gDNA and the synthesis of complimentary DNA (cDNA) was carried out using HiScript
