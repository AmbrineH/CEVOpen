 <italic class="italic">.</italic> Twenty-five-gram grain samples with 200 μL of conidial suspension inoculation were placed in sterilized Petri dishes (6 cm) and transferred into UV-sterilized polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers (20 cm × 12 cm black boxes). An autoclaved piece of disc pipetted with essential oil separately was added into each container. The treatments were designated as follows: (A) geraniol; (B) citral; (C) AlP (positive control); and (D) sterile distilled water (negative control). Thereafter, these containers were packaged under various modified atmospheres with a MAP machine (DT-6D, Dajiang Intelligent Equipment, China) and were instantly heat-sealed by a vacuum sealer. The different modified atmospheres were appointed as follows: (I) 25% CO
