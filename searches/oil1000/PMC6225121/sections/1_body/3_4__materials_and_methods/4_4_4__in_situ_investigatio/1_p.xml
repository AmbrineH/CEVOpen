<p class="p">Based on results of the in vitro antifungal test, geraniol and citral were selected for further study. The fresh rice grains from a local supermarket (Hangzhou, China) were stored at 4 °C before use. The grains were sterilized with the 0.1% (

Aliquot samples of 60 g were placed in sterilized Petri dishes (9 cm) and transferred to the porcelain plate of a disinfected desiccator (inner diameter: 300 mm, height: 370 mm, volume: 1.9 L). Spores of the pathogen were harvested from the PDA medium and suspended in sterilized phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to 1.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> conidia/mL concentration with serial dilution by haemocytometer count. Then, 200 μL of conidial suspension was evenly inoculated on the grains. An autoclaved filter paper disc (6 mm) was laid on the bottom of the desiccator with the addition of 950 μL of geraniol and citral solution, respectively. Control was performed with the same volume of sterile distilled water on the disc. AlP tablets (19 mg) were used as the positive control. Subsequently, the lid was smeared with Vaseline and covered on the desiccator to avoid the leakage of EOCs. The desiccators were stored on an artificial climate chest at 25–30 °C and 80–90% relative humidity (RH) for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Each experiment was done with three repetitions.
