 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>, were inoculated into each broth, respectively. The same amount of pathogen inoculum was cultured in the media without adding EOC emulsions to serve as the control. They were incubated in the dark at 28 °C on a rotary shaker (QYC 2102, FUMA, Shanghai, China) at 200 rpm. On day 7, the supernatant was examined for cell permeability after centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min. The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtering and washed with sterilized water for subsequent ROS assay and RNA extraction. The cell permeability of pathogens was measured by the method described previously [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] with some modifications. The supernatant was detected by conductivity meters (DDS-307, INESA Instrument, Shanghai, China). The corresponding mycelia were heated for 20 min in a boiling water bath to determine the electric conductivity. The PDB without EOCs and pathogens was used for the initial electric conductivity.
