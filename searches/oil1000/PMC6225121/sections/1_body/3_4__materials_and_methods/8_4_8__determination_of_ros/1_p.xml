<p class="p">Intracellular production of ROS in pathogens was measured using DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) probe. The fungal mycelia were obtained as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot7-molecules-23-02108" class="xref">Section 4.7</xref> and were incubated with 20 µM DCFH-DA at 30 °C for 30 min in a dark environment. The hyphae were washed with phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.0) twice and were disrupted in the same buffer with acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) by tissue homogenizer (Tissuelyer-48, Jingxin Technologies, Shanghai, China) for 3 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed at λ
