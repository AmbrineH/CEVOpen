<p class="p">However, there is very limited research that has studied the mode of interaction of EOCs and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. from the gene level and the function of EOCs as the grain preservative. Thence, the objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of diverse EOCs against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> and to reveal the underlying mechanism of antimicrobial activities from the aspects of cell membrane morphology, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) change, and differential gene expression. Moreover, EOCs were investigated in combination with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to further improve the grain quality regarding 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> infection.
