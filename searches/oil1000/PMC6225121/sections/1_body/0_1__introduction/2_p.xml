<p class="p">In developing countries, cereal preservation is generally achieved by using chemical preservatives and controlling the storage environment. The preservatives currently used in the food industry are mostly chemically synthesized organic acids and relevant salts as well as some antioxidants. For example, methyl bromide and phosphine used in chemical fumigation measures are commonly applied worldwide to control pest and mold infestations in warehouses. However, this method has a negative impact for the environment and is a threat to human health. Thus, there is an urgent need to find a practical, effective, and nonpolluting method to replace traditional chemical fumigants to control fungal contamination of stored grain.</p>
