<p class="p">At present, some countries have used atmospheric storage technologies to store food crops. Molds are the main corrupting organisms in the grain storage ecosystem and are essentially aerobic. Consequently, creating an oxygen-deficient environment in the storage grain ecosystem has a fatal effect on molds and greatly extends the shelf life. The use of a modified atmosphere to store food crops involves changing the natural stored gas composition, which includes carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), oxygen (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and nitrogen (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and is lethal to pathogens. In the literature, common atmospheric storage technologies can be divided into modified atmosphere (MA) and controlled atmosphere (CA) categories [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Their difference is the degree of atmospheric composition. The gas composition of the artificially controlled storage is initially adjusted and dynamically changes according to the respiration rate of the crops and the permeability of the membrane or storage structure around the grain. The gas composition has been constantly controlled and monitored during the storage period. In addition to extending the storage period, atmospheric storage technology can also maintain the natural quality of the grain. Changing the gas around the food can reduce the respiration rate of the grain and inhibit the activity of microorganisms in the grain, thereby greatly prolonging the storage life of the grain.
