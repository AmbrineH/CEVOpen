<p class="p">The present study demonstrated that two EOCs (citral and geraniol) have antimicrobial effects against two pathogens (
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>) in vitro and in grain, and explored their mode of action. The results indicated that citral and geraniol could apparently inhibit fungal growth at certain concentrations by changing cell membrane permeability, inducing intracellular accumulation of ROS, and interfering with key related genes. Furthermore, the citral and geraniol in combination with MAP could have synergistic effects on controlling 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. infection of grain, which presents an alternative preservation method to improve the shelf life of grain by using natural bioactive substances. Collectively, these EOCs could provide a basis for the development of novel grain preservatives for practical applications.
