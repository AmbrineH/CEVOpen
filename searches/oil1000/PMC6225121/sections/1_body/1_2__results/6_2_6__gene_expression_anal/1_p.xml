<p class="p">For the purpose of revealing the molecular mechanisms behind the inhibitory role of the EOsâ€™ major components in pathogens, some growth-related and secondary metabolite-related genes of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> were monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in mycelia that were treated with EOCs. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A, all growth- and secondary metabolite-related genes in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> were downregulated in the geraniol treatment group. Among the five downregulated genes, 
 <italic class="italic">aflR</italic>, which is a transcription activator of aflatoxin biosynthesis, was lowly expressed after geraniol treatment. Meanwhile, the key regulatory gene of secondary metabolites, 
 <italic class="italic">laeA</italic>, was downregulated with an average 11.1-fold decrease when exposed to citral. In addition, both citral and geraniol resulted in the expression reduction of the sporulation gene 
 <italic class="italic">brlA</italic> compared to the control.
