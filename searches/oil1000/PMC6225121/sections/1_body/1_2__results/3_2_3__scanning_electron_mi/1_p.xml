<p class="p">The microstructure of interactions between starch granules and fungi were observed using SEM. SEM micrographs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> on grains after treatment with EOCs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Many 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> mycelium and visible spores were distributed on the surface of granules, and the release of internal starch contents from boundary damage in grains was noticeable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> affected the integrity of starch granules seriously and resulted in some partial disruption of starches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>D). It was speculated that the mold occupied space gaps among starch granules and consumed nutrients, thus eroding the rice grains. After treatment with geraniol, starches appeared to follow healthy development with a regular crystalline form (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B) and were much larger than that in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A, revealing that geraniol not only effectively prevented the infection of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> on grains, but also maintained the complete structure of granules without harmful side effects. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>Câ€“F, no apparent variation of the starch granule morphology was observed for treatment with citral; only a few existing wrinkled flattened empty hyphae.
