<p class="p">One approach used for determining the mode of action of the antimicrobials against the pathogens was to measure the relative electrical conductivity from the suspensions of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The change of electrical conductivity reflected the effect of cell membrane permeability in the pathogens caused by EOC treatment. The treatments with citral and geraniol both resulted in an obvious increase of electrical conductivity in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>. The conductivity due to electrolyte leakage in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> from the control group was 79.4 ± 4.1%, but this value reached 91 ± 6.2% after geraniol treatment (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, there was no apparent change for 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> when exposed to citral.
