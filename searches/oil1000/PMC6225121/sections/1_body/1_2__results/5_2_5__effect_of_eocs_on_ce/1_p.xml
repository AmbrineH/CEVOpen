<p class="p">ROS production and accumulation in the cell exerts oxidative stress, which may lead to the damage of cellular structures and eventually induce apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the antifungal action of EOCs and oxidative stress in pathogens. The results are demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The ROS increase was 20.5 ± 7.0% in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 14.2 ± 7.1% in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> when treated with citral. Geraniol treatment showed a rapid increase of ROS accumulation in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and reached values of 74.2 ± 5.5%, which indicated that geraniol treatment resulted in an evident stimulation of ROS generation. There was no significant difference in ROS increase in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> between geraniol and citral.
