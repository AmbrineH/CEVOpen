 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> presents the quality characteristics and growth of spoilage organisms on fresh rice with significant synergistic treatments of EOCs and MAP (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). The pH dropped fast in all MAP conditions without EOCs eight days after inoculation with 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>. The pH in the control had a fluctuation, but a stable level of pH was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> with treatment with the combined EOCs and different gas composition. In terms of the content of fatty acids, compared to the untreated control and AlP, the geraniol or citral combined with MAP obviously postponed the increase of fatty acid content whether the grains were challenged with 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>. The fatty acid content in geraniol with 100% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment reached the lowest level of 0.11 NaOH mg/g and was one-tenth of that of the control group. Moreover, fatty acid content had a gradual decline with the increasing proportion of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere composition over eight days when using the same EOCs in each group. With respect to MDA content, no distinct changes for either pathogen were illustrated in the effects of the diversified gas treatments with geraniol or citral as a fumigant. Concurrently, the cotreatment of geraniol or citral with identical MAP manifested higher MDA content in comparison with the sterile water control and AlP positive control. In the light of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>D–H, the combined EOCs and MAP effectively delayed the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. on grains after eight days’ exposure when compared to the single MAP treatment. In particular, the EOC treatments together with 100% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas packaging nearly inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth in grains. In addition, packaging with gas components of 50% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>:50% N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 75% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>:25% N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> associated with citral denoted a better antifungal effect against 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> than AlP, and their reduction levels were 4.78 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> colony forming unit (CFU)/g and 4.17 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> CFU/g, respectively. However, there were no obvious differences in the effect of the other gas compositions.
