<p class="p">Among all the tested EOs’ major components, there were several vapors of EOCs with effective inhibitory activity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> in vitro (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02108" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Unfortunately, the other components showed little antifungal property for the target pathogens. A possible explanation for this is that some EOCs have a special mode of action for some specific microbes. Geraniol and citral significantly inhibited mycelial growth (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and exhibited higher inhibition rates for two strains compared to other treatments. 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02108-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> presents the antifungal effect with different concentrations of geraniol and citral at the seventh day after inoculation with spoilage pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of citral was 0.5 μL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 0.4 μL/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>, whereas geraniol seemed not to fully prevent the growth of these fungi. The inhibition rate of geraniol against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> was 98.44% between 0.5 and 0.6 μL/mL, and similarly, 98.38% against 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> at the range of 0.3 to 0.6 μL/mL. It was indicated that geraniol in the vapor phase might reach saturated concentration in sealed plates. Considering excellent in vitro results, geraniol and citral were chosen for subsequent in situ studies.
