<p class="p">The pH with geraniol fumigation falls fast from 6.97 ± 0.03 to 4.02 ± 0.17 in eight days; a similar result was obtained with citral (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A). This was likely due to the two EOs’ major components in the vapor phase being slightly acidic. However, aluminium phosphide (AlP), a common commercial fumigant, could prominently maintain stable pH at the level of 6.54 ± 0.04 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Fat acidity of grain treated with geraniol and citral was at the values of 1.89 ± 0.29 and 0.42 ± 0.07 NaOH mg/g, respectively, when compared to grain without EOCs after being infected with 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> for eight days (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B). Additionally, citral, equally to AlP, prevented the rapid rise of lipid acids of grains for both 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> infections. There was a slowly increasing tendency of malondialdehyde (MDA) content in grains with EOC treatments and the content in the control group inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> was 3.85 times that of citral at the eighth day (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). It seemed that geraniol and citral, which were the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia rugosa</italic> EO and lemongrass EO respectively, could better delay MDA increase of grain after inoculation with 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>C–G). Meanwhile, there was no substantial difference in MDA content between the AlP and control after eight days’ infections of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>. For microbial numbers, geraniol and citral could significantly reduce colonization by 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> in grain after inoculation (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>D–H). These results signified that geraniol and citral have the potential to protect grain (rice) from infection by pathogens and to delay the grains’ corruption.
