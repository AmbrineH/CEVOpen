<p class="p">EOC volatiles appear to be promising control methods against microorganisms in packaging. The majority of the work initiated so far has concentrated on the control effects of EOCs or MAP single treatments against pathogen contamination in grain. In our study, EOCs in combination with MAP administered to rice displayed weakened grain respiration with less loss of EOCs in the vapor phase, achieving the better preservation effect. MAP (100% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) showed complete inactivation for 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>, with &lt;1.0 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> CFU/g after eight days of storage. Owing to 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> being an aerobic fungus, high-purity CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could exert an antifungal effect by affecting the enzymatic decarboxylation of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, the 100% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment of grain is impractical during industrial grain storage because of high cost and high energy consumption. The lower level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> combined with EOCs should be taken into consideration.
