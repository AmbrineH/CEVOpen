<p class="p">In this study, we tested about 30 plant EOs (

 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>) by fumigation. In solid media, only seven vaporous EOCs exhibited an inhibitory effect against the above molds (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02108" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and two EOCs (citral and geraniol) with better properties were appropriate for subsequent studies. The impact of these two EOCs on fungal growth was increased progressively with concentration. Interestingly,
