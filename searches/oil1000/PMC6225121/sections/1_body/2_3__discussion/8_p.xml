<p class="p">There is no doubt that the antifungal activity of EOCs can be attributable to multiple mechanisms because of the complexity of fungal cell structure and composition. However, not all of these mechanisms are involved in fungal inactivation and they might have many intricate causal or feedback relationships. In accordance with our study, citral exhibited antifungal activity mainly by diminishing the sporulation- and growth-related genes for 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>. The geraniol displayed inhibitory effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> predominantly by increasing the intracellular ROS accumulation and showed toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> principally by impairing the cell membrane.
