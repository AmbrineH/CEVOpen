<p class="p">Cereals represent the most important source of food samples in many countries. They have been highly susceptible to pathogens and their secretion of mycotoxins due to the disturbance or aging of tissue physiology and mechanical damage preharvest and postharvest, which not only causes large pecuniary losses, but also a serious threat to human health. Recently, the use of a number of natural-product-derived volatile chemicals in crops and food for the treatment of diverse agricultural diseases has drawn widespread attention from researchers. Polyphenols, vitamins, alkaloids, saponins, polysaccharides, and bioactive peptides derived from many different plants have displayed antioxidant capabilities and antimicrobial activities. Plant EOs and related EOCs, odorous and volatile products with diversified bioactive functions formed by secondary metabolism, have been applied in medicine and as food additives, such as flavor enhancers, aromatizers, and preservatives.</p>
