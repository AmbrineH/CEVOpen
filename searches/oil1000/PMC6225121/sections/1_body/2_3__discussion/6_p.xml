<p class="p">To reveal the inhibitory effects of citral and geraniol on 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> from a molecular perspective, some key genes which were closely associated with growth and toxin metabolism were detected. The expression profile of key regulatory genes of aflatoxin biosynthesis and growth in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A). Among these genes, the transcriptional activator gene of asexual sporulation 
 <italic class="italic">brlA</italic> and the global regulatory gene of secondary metabolite 
 <italic class="italic">laeA</italic> were both highly downregulated by citral. Previous research demonstrated that disruption or deletion of the 
 <italic class="italic">brlA</italic> gene resulted in loss of the ability for premature development in 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. It was elucidated that citral modulated growth-related genes of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> to achieve its antifungal property. Interestingly, we observed that the citral and geraniol not only influenced the growth regulatory genes, but also had inhibitory capacity for the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes, especially for aflatoxin biosynthetic genes, which signified that citral and geraniol had sufficiently inhibited them to prevent aflatoxin from being synthesized in addition to retarding 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth at low concentrations. The 
 <italic class="italic">aflS</italic> gene is a pathway regulator, and 
 <italic class="italic">AflR</italic> is a transcriptional activator of aflatoxin pathway cluster structural genes [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. When 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> was in an appropriate condition, 
 <italic class="italic">AflS</italic> bound to 
 <italic class="italic">AflR</italic> to form a complex and seek a promoter region for aflatoxin biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Thus, in our study, it was found that citral and geraniol could inhibit major biosynthetic genes. This is consistent with previous reports, which manifested that cinnamaldehyde, citral, and eugenol inhibited aflatoxin production in 
 <italic class="italic">A. parasiticus</italic> by downregulating the aflatoxin pathway genes (
 <italic class="italic">aflR</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">aflT</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">aflD</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">aflM</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">aflP</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, aflatoxin accumulation was achieved in the context of sporulation. It was suggested that citral and geraniol resulted in mycotoxin prevention by inhibiting the sporulation gene 
 <italic class="italic">brlA</italic>.
