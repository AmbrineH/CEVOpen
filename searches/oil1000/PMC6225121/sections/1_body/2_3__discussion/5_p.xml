<p class="p">Oxidative stress is considered as a signal for inducing cell death in response to various external environmental stresses and internal psychophysiological stimulation. ROS, mainly generated in the mitochondria through the oxidative process, are a series of intermediate products formed during the process of oxygen metabolism, and excessive ROS attack cellular biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA to cause irreversible oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. This study indicated that citral and geraniol induced rapid and significant ROS production in 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). This result was in agreement with a previous report which showed that citral and carvacrol caused oxidative damage in 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Besides, it was inferred that ROS formation was the main factor for the inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> by geraniol, according to a 74.2% ROS increase. Previous investigations suggested that high ROS levels reduced intracellular antioxidants, impaired DNA and proteins, and thus triggered cell damage or apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The mechanism of microbial inactivation by ROS assumed that ROS involved the formation of Fenton-mediated hydroxyl radicals through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ultimately initiated cell death [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The accumulating evidence implied that the geraniol swiftly facilitated the induction of more ROS in 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>, which was similar to a prior study which described that cinnamaldehyde inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> by interfering with the intracellular redox system to affect metabolic regulation [
