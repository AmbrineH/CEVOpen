<p class="p">AlP is the chemical fumigant commonly used to control the corruption of grain; however, PH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> released by AlP might be harmful for human health. Based on our results, citral or geraniol cotreatment with MAP significantly alleviated spoilage in grain and preserved grain quality to a maximum without any chemical residue, as opposed to AlP treatment, which indicated that the EOsâ€™ major components as a novel potential approach could displace the conventional chemical fumigant for future use in grain preservation. Additionally, EOCs combined with MAP had better effects on reducing colony number and improving grain quality than EOC or MAP treatments alone. Therefore, a low dose of EOCs combined with modern preservation technology such as low temperature and MAP could not only reduce the growth of pathogens for extending the shelf life of agricultural products, but also maintain sensory quality.
