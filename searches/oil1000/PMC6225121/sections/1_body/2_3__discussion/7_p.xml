<p class="p">Concerning the transcriptional level in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>, although the growth and metabolite biosynthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> at the molecular level have not been completely elucidated, some of critical genes have been strongly correlated with metabolite pathways. 
 <italic class="italic">PacC</italic> is a pH-dependent, alkaline-induced regulator responsible for growth in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In this study, the 
 <italic class="italic">pacC</italic> gene was effectively induced at a transcriptional level in 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> treated by citral, which explicated the mode of action of citral against 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic>. Nevertheless, geraniol treatment appeared to have no apparent inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">pacC</italic>. A different mode of action for geraniol might be illustrated. Additionally, ochratoxin, as a secondary metabolite, was a polyketide mycotoxin mainly produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> spp., and was classified as a group 2B potential carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Ochratoxin biosynthesis is dependent on enzymatic reactions because of its special molecular structure. Thence, 
 <italic class="italic">pks</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">p450-B03</italic>, as two key genes which encode a polyketide synthase and a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, respectively, have played a vital role in the ochratoxin biosynthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In line with these findings, qRT-PCR analyses denoted that both citral and geraniol had negative regulation effects on 
 <italic class="italic">pks</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">p450-B03</italic> to inhibit the ochratoxin production. These results were supported by the evidence which revealed that clove, cinnamon, lemongrass, and mandarin EOs suppressed the relative expression of the selected ochratoxin-related genes [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, some earlier works showed that citrus EOs and their major components exerted inhibitory effects on fungal growth, but not on toxin accumulation, and even induced the higher production of ochratoxin in 
 <italic class="italic">A. westerdijkiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This is not inexplicable, given that EOCs with low doses might create stress conditions and stimulate the enhancement of secondary metabolism in fungi for resisting external pressures. Previous research also demonstrated that geraniol interfered with bilayer fluidity and caused genotoxicity in some fungi [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], which was further confirmed to be a consistent explanation of the antifungal mode of specific EOCs.
