<p class="p">In the case of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) liners with oxygen-scavenging functionality, oxygen-barrier liners made up of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear polymers from a different manufacturer had no significant effect on the composition of hop volatiles in beer after prolonged storage. It has also been demonstrated that can coatings are able to absorb hop volatiles in a similar pattern as crown corks although to a lesser extent. Consequently, significantly higher percentages of myrcene were found in the beer [
