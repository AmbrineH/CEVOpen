<p class="p">For obtaining and optimizing structures the Gaussian Suite of Programs [
 <xref rid="B169-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>] was used. The analysis was performed with the Molden program [
 <xref rid="B170-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>], which also enables capturing frames to obtain pictures as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00257-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> where the reactant and the transition state of the reaction between xanthohumol (polyphenol found in hops and known antigenotoxic agent) and cyanoethylene oxide—cytochrome P450 2E1 metabolized form of food carcinogen acrylonitrile [
 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>], acquired using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>] according to the Hartree–Fock method and 6-31G(d) basis set presented. Xanthohumol was chosen as its antigenotoxic activity was already confirmed through in vivo and in vitro studies and simulation of its reaction with cyanoethylene oxide, a typical and common epoxy-type chemical carcinogen with confirmed carcinogenicity, can uncover xanthohumol’s antigenotoxic mechanism of action. Simulations of such reactions, like the one in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00257-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, between hop compounds and carcinogenic substances enable us to reveal the mechanism of known antigenotoxic agents and even find new potential antigenotoxic agents through in silico quantum–chemical methods.
