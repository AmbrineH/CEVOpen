<p class="p">Extracts obtained from brewing wastes may also serve as important dietary sources of polyphenolic compounds. Almost all the parts of the hop plant contain many nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. Nevertheless, according to the so-called “biorefinery” concept, the production of value-added bioproducts like phytochemicals from food industry wastes should not only help to lower the negative environmental impact, but should also add economic value to the brewing products hence progressing towards the sustainable development of the beer industry. The biorefinery concept has been already integrated into modern day brewing technological advances which tend to reduce the amount of waste produced and to generate useful materials from the by-products of brewing.</p>
