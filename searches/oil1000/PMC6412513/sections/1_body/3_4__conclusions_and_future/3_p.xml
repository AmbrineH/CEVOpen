<p class="p">In order to optimize the recovery of polyphenols, the research on novel extraction techniques (maceration, ultrasound, and microwave-assisted extraction) and separation techniques in combination with alternative solvents is gaining increasing interest. The polyphenolic fractions are tested for their chemical and biological properties. On the other hand, the biomass remaining after the extraction or processing of biological materials, such as brewers’ spent grain, still contains a number of valuable components and therefore represents a source of alternative fuels as well as the source of chemical compounds. This certainly represents an additional challenge to obtain value added products from the low-value streams. An additional advantage is derived from the generally displeasing fact that polyphenols may unfavorably influence beer stability. According to the biorefinery concept, crude extracts of phenolic compounds with high antioxidative activity can be obtained from the brewery waste stream produced during regeneration of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) resins used to clarify beer. The concentration of haze-active proteins and polyphenols is reduced by the adsorption with PVPP [

Huge amounts of these compounds are therefore present in the waste stream, which contains large amounts of polyphenols, and therefore represents a promising alternative and an economical source of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials with various applications in the food industry. Food industry is aiming to intensify also the studies regarding organoleptic properties of beer related to packing and storage. Recent research shall be shifted towards investigation of absorption kinetics of hop volatiles into different crown cork liner polymers and can coatings due to the issue of flavor scalping, connected to the loss of aroma substances in food containers. This phenomenon is the result of their migration into the packaging materials. Information related to the absorption of aroma-active beer constituents by different “modern” PE beer bottle closures and can coatings, as well as the concurrent uptake rate of hop volatiles into crown cork liners, is thus far lacking in the published literature. Substances absorbed by the polymers are usually determined by the supercritical fluid extraction/gas chromatography method. Polypropylene absorbs most aromas: higher amounts are absorbed by low-density polymers.
