<p class="p">Certain hop extracts are already in general use, especially for providing sedative and estrogenic effects. Many more could potentially be used as several in vitro studies point out that a number of compounds isolated from hops exert significant biological activities. However, in vivo studies at physiologically attainable concentrations to confirm these activities are still relatively rare. It is not the main question whether these compounds really possess features enabling them to impact the enzymatic action and/or cellular processes, but rather if these active substances reach the target cells in sufficient concentration and form to provoke/reach the desired effects. We must also consider that the action of many substances differs greatly when applied in different matrixes. After the ingestion of a given substance, its metabolism plays a crucial role and importantly impacts its absorption. The majority of polyphenols including prenylflavonoids, with the notable exception of catechins, is poorly absorbed [

 <xref rid="B164-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>] exhibited a great potential, even in an in vivo human study, for increasing the bioavailability. Producing the mixtures/combinations of biologically active substances represents another practiced approach with several important advantages. The knowledge on encapsulation of extracts, including plant extracts such as hops, is still relatively scarce. Therefore, there is an idea either to develop suitable techniques or to modify the existing formulation techniques [
 <xref rid="B165-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>] which would yield extract formulations with a high bioavailability. To examine their biological effects, further in vitro and in vivo studies would be required. The latter can prevent the potential high dose toxicity or improve the tolerance of already established drugs and therapies and additionally bring about potential synergistic effects. Synergistic effects due to the lower needed concentrations not only prevent the negative side effects of compounds and the potentially developed resistance, enhance their beneficial effects but also bring new effects that none of the compounds, like the truly neglected sulfur-containing hop compounds, may initially possess on their own. For a great number of substances, their biological activity is yet to be determined. On the other hand, because hops have been traditionally used in brewing the most important constituents of the ’hoppy’ aroma have been profoundly investigated. As the scent represents one of our strongest senses and the only one directly connected to the brain, even compounds representing a really minor portion of the hops can evoke certain positive psychological and physiological effects. In plants one can only find mixtures of compounds, which are capable of numerous strong health-promoting activities, the majority have not yet been found/studied, this can help to prevent the formation and even start the healing process of several common diseases like cancer.
