 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] subsequently identified four acylphloroglucinol-glucopyranosides. The first 1-(2-methyl propanoyl)phloroglucinol-glucopyranoside had been found in hops before. Other were multifidol glucosides, 1-(3-methyl butyryl) phloroglucinol, and 5-(2 Methylpropanoyl) phloroglucinol. Consistently with the nomenclature of hop bitter acids, the substances were named co-, ad-, n-, and co-iso-multifidol glucosides. Discovered phloroglucinols were tested for inhibitory COX-1 activity and all listed substances exhibited corresponding anti-inflammatory activity [
