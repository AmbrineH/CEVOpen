<p class="p">In vitro and even in vivo studies have established that quercetin downregulates cell survival and proliferative proteins as well as induces apoptosis and dose-dependently impacts cell growth [

 <xref rid="B119-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. The apoptosis may be induced partially through hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 reported for human leukemia cells and lung cancer cell lines as well as partially by modulating the expression and activity of Mcl-1: antiapoptotic proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family [
