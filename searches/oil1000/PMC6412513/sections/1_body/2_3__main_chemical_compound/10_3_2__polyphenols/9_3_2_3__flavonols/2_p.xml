<p class="p">Plants, including hops, mostly contain flavonols as glycosides [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Their bioavailability depends on the glycosidic part. In the case of quercetin, glucosides represent the most bioavailable form (even more than aglycone). Unfortunately, the least bioavailable form of quercetin—rutin—represents the most common form of quercetin in hops [
