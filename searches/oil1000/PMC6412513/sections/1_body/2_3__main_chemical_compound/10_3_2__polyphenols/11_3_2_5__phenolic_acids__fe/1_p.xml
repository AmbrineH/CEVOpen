<p class="p">Hop cones, also contain a certain amount of ferulic acid belonging to the hydroxycinnamic acids from the class of phenolic acids. For quite a while, ferulic acid was unjustifiably neglected as it possesses several health-promoting activities. It is similar to other highly antioxidative polyphenols as it prevents lipid peroxidation, apoptotic cell death of healthy cells, and is an effective and multifunctional free radical scavenger [

 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. It slows down the degradation of iso-α-acids and therefore partially prevents the spoiling of beer [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Unlike many polyphenols, the ferulic acid in its free form is very efficiently absorbed as approximately 50% of the ingested dose gets recovered in urine [

 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. However, in cereals, the esterified ferulic acid is only poorly absorbed [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Ferulic acid is able to ameliorate toxicity of certain chemicals, carcinogenic agents, ionizing radiation, and is even a strong UV absorber [

 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Interactions with several enzymes enable the ferulic acid to act as an anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and anticarcinogenic agent. In cancer cells, it is shown to decrease cell viability and colony formation while it inhibits cell migration and invasion [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Zhang and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B129-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>] therefore proposed ferulic acid for breast cancer therapy. Owing to its antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective features, ferulic acid should also be used for treating other diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cardiomyopathic disorders, and many others [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Compared to flavonoids that are a strong antimicrobial agent, ferulic acid exerts weaker activity; however, it still has significant activity against several Gram positive bacteria such as
