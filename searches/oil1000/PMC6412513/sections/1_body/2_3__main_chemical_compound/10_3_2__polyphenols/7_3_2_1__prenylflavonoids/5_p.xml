<p class="p">Gerhäuser and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>] presumed that the chemopreventive properties of xanthohumol stem from its ability to inhibit metabolic activation of certain procarcinogens by cytochromes P450, like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-ƒ]quinoline (IQ). However, Plazar [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] showed that in rat liver slices (in vivo) xanthohumol does not inhibit the metabolic activation, but only protects against the genotoxicity of IQ and BaP, partially even against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding oxidative DNA damage. Several studies [

 <xref rid="B97-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] also suggested that the induction of detoxification enzymes represents yet another chemoprotective mechanism of xanthohumol. This presumption was also rejected by Plazar [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], proposing that the protective mechanism could be ascribed to the inhibition of the cellular uptake of genotoxic IQ and BaP or that rather the metabolic products of XN (and not XN itself) are responsible for protection. An evidence supporting the first argument is that xanthohumol decreased the human recombinant DNA polymerase α activity in the MDA MB 435 human breast cancer cell line, thereby slowing down the (mutated) DNA replication [
