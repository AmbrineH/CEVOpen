 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] undoubtedly reveal that even though prenylation increases the uptake of parent flavonoids into the digestive tract, enhanced in tissue accumulation results in diminished (lower) bioavailability of its prenylated counterpart. Rodent studies [

 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] demonstrated that naringenin accumulated in muscle tissue and quercetin in liver tissue. This, however, in the case of long-term dietary use (as supplements), requires attention to avoid deleterious effects of bioaccumulation in nontarget tissues as detoxification of prenylflavonoids from the blood seems much slower as their nonprenylated counterparts [

Clinical study of oral bioavailability of prenylflavonoids from hops revealed that even though 6-PN is significantly less bioavailable than 8-PN, it is equally effective in enhancing peripheral blood mononuclear cells viability [
