<p class="p">Similarly to isoxanthohumol, 8-prenylnaringenin exhibits several anticarcinogenic activities like strong antiangiogenic effect and the inhibition of survival and proliferation of estrogen-responsive cells by interfering with the PI3K pathway [

 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] that metabolic products of xanthohumol contribute more to its chemoprevention than the xanthohumol itself. Both XN and 8-PN also proved to be strong inhibitors of NF-κB activation in microglial cell lines, thereby possessing the ability to modulate immune responses in the nervous system [
