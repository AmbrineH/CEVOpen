<p class="p">Delmulle and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B112-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>] discovered that hop prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 8-prenylnaringenin, and 6-prenylnaringenin) induce the nonapoptotic, caspase-independent form of cell death. For hop-derived prenylflavanones the form of cell death seems to be autophagy, due to the increased formation of vacuoles, however, for XN this was not observed. All in all, all hop-derived prenylflavonoids, including desmethylxanthohumol, proved to trigger some sort of cell death [

 <xref rid="B113-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>] and 6-prenylnaringenin showed a significant antifungal and antibacterial effect [
