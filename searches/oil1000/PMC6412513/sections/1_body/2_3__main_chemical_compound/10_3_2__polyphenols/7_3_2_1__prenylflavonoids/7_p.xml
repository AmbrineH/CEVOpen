<p class="p">Several in vitro studies showed that XN can induce apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 or by acitvation of the caspase cascade and can even inhibit the growth of several cancer types like ovarian, breast, colon, prostate, hepatic, pulmonary cancer, and leukemia [

 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. The second proposed mechanism of apoptosis triggered by xanthohumol is the induction of ROS [

 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>], who discovered that xanthohumol inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation consequentially causing ROS generation and therefore inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. Additionally, the most prominent prenylflavonoid is involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis as it was shown to inhibit microcapillary tube formation of HMEC-1 cells [
