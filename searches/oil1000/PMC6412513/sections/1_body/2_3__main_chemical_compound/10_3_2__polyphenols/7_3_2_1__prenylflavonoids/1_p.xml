<p class="p">Prenylflavonoids represent a class of flavonoids with at least one prenyl or geranyl substituent in the ring [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. It was established that the prenyl substituent significantly alters the biological activity of corresponding flavonoids, likely due to the increased lipophilicity that improves the binding affinity towards biological membranes [

 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], the shared observation is that prenylation elevates the biological effect of nonprenylated moieties, both phloroglucinol derivatives and flavonoids [
