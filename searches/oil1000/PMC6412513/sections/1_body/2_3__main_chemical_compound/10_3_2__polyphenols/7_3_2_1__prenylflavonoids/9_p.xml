<p class="p">Even though the isomer of xanthohumol—isoxanthohumol—was found to be less potent than xanthohumol in the majority of anticarcinogenic features, it was shown to be more anti-mutagenic and antiangiogenic, and even exhibits limited estrogenic activity [

The metabolism of xanthohumol does not end in isoxanthohumol the activation by intestinal microflora or cytochrome P450 enzymes yields one of the most potent phytoestrogens—8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN)—capable of binding to α- and β-estrogen receptors [

Clinical tests confirm that 8-PN represents a promising novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms [

Even though standardized hops extract containing 0.42% of 8-PN did not stimulate the growth of methyl-nitrosourea induced mammary cancer and proliferative events in the normal mammary gland of Wistar rats, some safety issues remain regarding the potential adverse effects associated with a long-term consumption of phytoestrogens [
