<p class="p">From the revelation of (the French paradox), resveratrol has become one of the most known polyphenols. Copious studies, even in vivo, have reported about its anti-inflammatory and several anticancer effects. In various cancer types, resveratrol inhibits of tumor formation and growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and induces apoptosis. One of the possible mechanisms of resveratrolâ€™s anticancer activity, at least in breast cancer cells, is its ability to induce the expression of SERCA3 gene fundamental for maintaining the intracellular (Ca

In addition, resveratrol possesses several features for the prevention or improvement of cardiovascular diseases [
