<p class="p">In human prostate and breast cancer cells, flavanols catechin and epicatechin have exhibited antioxidative and antiinflammmatory effects as well as the inhibition of telomerase [

Along with various other polyphenols, they time- and dose-specifically decrease the proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells; are able to interact with estrogen and androgen receptors, even at nanomolar concentrations; and lower the amount of NO species by decreasing its secretion and inhibiting its production [

Epicatechin, along with other tea catechins, additionally suppresses the growth of various types of cancer cells and by inhibiting apoptosis in the PC12 cells also exerts neuroprotective effects, moreover, it acts as an anti-aging agent [
