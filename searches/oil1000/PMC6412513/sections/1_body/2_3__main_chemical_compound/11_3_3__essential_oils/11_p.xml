 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. Polyfunctional thiols have been appreciated and widely studied in the enology field as the compounds providing desirable odor notes like rhubarb, citrus, passion fruit, or blackcurrant bud carried by 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), 3-mercapto hexyl acetate, 4-methyl-4-mercaptopentan-2-one (4MMP), 3-sulfanyl-4-methyl pentane-1-ol, 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, and others [
