<p class="p">Among sesquiterpenes found in hop essential oils (and other essential oils from clove, piper, and hemp), β caryophyllene seems to be the most important regarding biological effects. Its spiciness, partially coming from the antagonistic action towards the cannabinoid receptor (CB), is actually more representative of piper and clove aroma than hop [
 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Several in vitro studies have shown that β caryophyllene and its oxide possess significant anticancer activities, affecting growth and proliferation of various cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Especially β-caryophyllene oxide proved to alter several key pathways of cancer development, such as MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3 pathways [

Additionally, both compounds enhance the efficacy of standard drugs by augmenting their concentrations inside tumorigenic cells [

In the oxygenated fraction, one can also find 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol, whose concentration increases during the storage of hops [
