<p class="p">Essential oils, as is already evident from the name, represent the essence of the plant, meaning its distinctive aroma. Hop aroma has always intrigued the mankind and it represents the significant portion of beer aroma. It is actually the quest for a better beer aroma that evidently brought so many hop varieties [

Even though this subject has been in the center of scientific and brewerâ€™s attention for centuries, the whole list of substances contributing to the hop aroma and consequentially to beer taste is still not completed. Following the bitter fraction, hop essential oil compounds are also secreted from lupulin glands of female plants [

In the first hydrocarbon fraction, one can find monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The second fraction contains oxygenated compounds like terpene and sesquiterpene alcohols. In spite of the fact that many believe that the last fraction of sulfur-containing compounds does not contain important biologically-active molecules, this may not be entirely true. Compounds from the sulfur fraction moreover proved to be important contributors to the hop and beer aroma and prevent its spoiling [
