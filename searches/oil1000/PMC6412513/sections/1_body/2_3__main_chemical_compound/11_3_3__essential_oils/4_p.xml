<p class="p">An important (hop) essential oil component monoterpene myrcene has two sides. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), myrcene, contained in certain popular beverages, is regarded as a potential human carcinogen; however, it is clearly stated that this fact still needs to be further evaluated [

On the other hand, both myrcene and linalool significantly inhibited the genotoxicity of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4-5-b]pyridine and only myrcene, even though less efficiently, inhibited the toxicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline [

 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. Moreover, β-myrcene also inhibited invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (breast cancer cells) induced by TNF-α [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. More studies argue in favor of positive health effects of myrcene than of its carcinogenicity, therefore, we cannot exclude it from the list of potential anticancer agents.
