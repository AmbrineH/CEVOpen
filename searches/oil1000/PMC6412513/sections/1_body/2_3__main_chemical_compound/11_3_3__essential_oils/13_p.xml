<p class="p">To conclude, organosulfur compounds found in hop essential oils can be beneficial through at least three different ways. Some are carriers of the aroma and flavor and can thereby importantly affect our mental and physical state according to the foundations of aromatherapy. Others prevent oxidation/degradation of important biologically active molecules like EGCG. Some may again release glutathione and can, therefore, contribute to the detoxification of organism, especially from numerous tumorigenic substances surrounding us. Last but not least, even compounds not biologically active on their own can still bring about synergistic effects and therefore enhance health-promoting activities of other more active substances contained in hops or even provide new effects that none of these compounds feature on their own. </p>
