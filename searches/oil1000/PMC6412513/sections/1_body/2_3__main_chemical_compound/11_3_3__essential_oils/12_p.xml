<p class="p">Roland and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B134-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] investigated in which form one can find thiols, especially 3MH and 4MMP in hops. For 4MMP the free-form represents the most important fraction (up to 95–100%) with precursors found in trace amounts only or even completely absent. However, surprisingly, the contrary was found for 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol, where more than 99% were allocated to its precursors: S-cysteinylated and S-glutathionylated conjugates. In a majority of hop varieties, glutathionated 3MH represents more than 80% of the total amount, only in Barbe Rouge hops the proportion is 50:50. Free 3MH represents less than 1% in all hop varieties, although some studies reported up to 7.1% of the free fraction [

 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. Since from glutathione-S-conjugates free glutathione can be released, consumed thiol precursors from hops may importantly contribute to the organism’s detoxification processes and therefore prevent the oxidative stress and other diseases like cancer.
