<p class="p">Clustering analysis of essential oils from 25 different hop varieties has shown that the highest amounts, accounting for 47.1 to 89.3% of the oils, represent β-myrcene, α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and humulene epoxide II [

 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] study who listed the most important components of hop aroma as myrcene, α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, and β-farnesene. A newer study where comparative aroma extract dilution analysis was performed on the special flavor hop varieties Huell Melon and Polaris determined myrcene, (3R)-linalool, and 2- and 3-methyl butanoic acid as important variety-independent hop odorants and found (1R,4S)-Calamenene—a new odor-active compound in hops [

Considering the division into three fractions, the majority of the hydrocarbon fraction is made up of monoterpenes α- and β-pinene, myrcene, and limonene as well as sesquiterpenes α humulene, β-farnesene (not in all hop varieties), β-caryophyllene, α- and β-selinene, and γ-muurolene [
