Therefore, exploring and exploiting plants with significant healing capacities should remain the main focus of scientific research as it has numerous advantages. Compounds from plants can be easily administered (added) to the diet as they exert low or are even devoid of harmful side effects. In addition, synergistic effects can importantly enhance their action or also action of existing drugs and therapies [

Moreover, such plants and their products, including extracts, can be exploited for prevention, reversing the progress or even healing of various widespread diseases. Finally, secondary plant metabolites are characterized by specific responses depending on the environment [
