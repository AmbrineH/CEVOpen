More concise studies revealed that hop plant or constituting substances possess several other biological properties such as strong antioxidative action, estrogenic activity, anti-inflammatory action, and several anticarcinogenic features like apoptosis-inducing, antimetastatic, antiproliferative, anti-invasive, or antiangiogenic properties [
