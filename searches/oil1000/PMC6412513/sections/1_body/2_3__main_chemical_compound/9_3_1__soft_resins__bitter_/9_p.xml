 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] proposed that a pivotal mechanism for the chemopreventive action of hop bitter acids represents the induction of apoptosis. Many subsequent studies confirmed that bitter acids trigger apoptosis, but the full mechanism of this action still needs to be uncovered. However, it is known that apoptosis is induced via both pathways: intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic [
