 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] demonstrated that humulone, derivatives of α-acids such as iso-α-acids or rho-iso-α-acids and even hexahydro-β-acids inhibit various animal edema, thereby reducing inflammation. This activity probably stems from interactions with other important enzymes like COX, IKK (NF-kB), and Jun N-terminal kinase with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), as was explicitly demonstrated in the case of humulone [
