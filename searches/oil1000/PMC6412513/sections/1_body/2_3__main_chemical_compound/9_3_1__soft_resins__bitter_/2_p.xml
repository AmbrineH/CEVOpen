<p class="p">The most important representatives of α-acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00257-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) are humulone (35–70% of total α-acids), cohumulone (20–65% of total α-acids), and adhumulone (10–15% of total α-acids). As their chemical structures are very similar, the names and quantities of representative β-acids are analogous; lupulone (30–55% of total β-acids), colupulone, and adlupulone. Other minor representatives of bitter acids include posthumulone/postlupulone, prehumulone/prelupulone, and adprehumulone [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The quantities of both types of acids and their homologs, however, may vary greatly as they depend on the hop variety, climate and cultivation conditions [
