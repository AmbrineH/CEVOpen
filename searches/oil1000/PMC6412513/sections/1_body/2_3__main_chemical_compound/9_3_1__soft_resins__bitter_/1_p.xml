<p class="p">Due to the high content of biologically active compounds, the biological effects of hops foremostly refer to the mature female hop cones (flowerings) and their extracts. Bitter acids and xanthohumol were also found in male inflorescences: their concentrations are similar to those found during early female flowerings [

According to their (in)solubility in hexane, the division to soft and hard resins is generally accepted; soft resins being hexane soluble. Soft resins found in yellow powder secreted by lupulin glands are mainly lupulic acids, chemically di- or tri-prenylated phloroglucinol derivatives, and homologs [

 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Owing to their bitter taste, the term ‘bitter acids’ is adopted in the literature. Among soft hop bitter acids a division into two categories is adopted. α-acids (alpha lupulic acids or humulones) and their homologs represent the first category and the larger portion of soft resins, while the minor part represents the β-acids (beta lupulic acids) with homologs named lupulones [
