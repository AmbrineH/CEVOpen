<p class="p">Kurasawa and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] established that dried hop extracts, when administered orally, increase the gastric juice volume without affecting its acidity. On the basis of those experiments, Zanoli and Zavatti [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] suggested that the bitterness (the taste) of hops represents a crucial factor in inducing gastric secretion via the cephalic phase. Later, Walker and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] confirmed that the bitter acids comprising of α-, β-, and iso-α-acids are potential key components promoting gastric acid secretion and upregulation of the CHRM3 gene expression.
