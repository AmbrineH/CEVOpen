<p class="p">Hop cones of the female hop plant, presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00257-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, are in the center of the scientific attention as an exclusive part of the hop plant used for the production of beer owing to their bitter taste, aroma and antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Hop cones contain several functional groups of compounds; the non-nutrient portion (secondary metabolites) can be divided into three major classes: bitter acids and their derivatives, polyphenols, and essential oil components [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. As their structure and properties differ significantly we have decided to present them in separate sections. The main groups of chemical compounds found in hops, their (skeleton) chemical structure, and typical representatives are collected in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00257-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Detailed structures of the mentioned representatives are provided in the
