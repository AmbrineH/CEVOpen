<p class="p">Similarly to other plants, hop cones also contain a very diverse group of compounds called polyphenols. Beside polyphenols present in the majority of plants, hop cones also contain prenylflavonoids and multifidol glucosides that are almost exclusively found in hops, at least in significant quantities. It has been shown that members of the prenylflavonoid class of polyphenols exhibit several beneficial biological activities and could be therefore exploited as novel drugs for treating and preventing several diseases along with cancer [

Consequently, their biological features are known and certain polyphenols are already in the last stages of clinical trials as anticancer agents [
