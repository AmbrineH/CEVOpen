<p class="p">Numerous publications on isolation of active compounds have appeared over the past two decades regarding a wide range of natural flavor formulations that are readily available including essential oils, herb and spice extracts, flavor substances fractionated from essential oils, or botanical extracts and natural flavor substances produced by fermentation [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The composition of these formulations depends on the nature of the solvent and on the applied extraction/isolation method. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in producing with hop extracts high flavonoid or polyphenol content. Polyphenols in hops have been studied for various reasons, especially due to their visible role in industrial applications as natural additives with antimicrobial and/or antioxidant properties. Technologies used to isolate compounds with a certain biological activity and to produce natural flavor formulations are well established, but several involve the use of conventional solvents like alcohols (methanol and ethanol), acetone, diethyl ether, or ethyl acetate and the use of methods that are energy intensive. Solvents that are produced from fossil fuels need to be tightly controlled with respect to their residual levels. The residues of the applied solvents may also remain in the final products bearing a detrimental effect on human health. This requires additional purification steps that are time-consuming and increase the total process cost [
