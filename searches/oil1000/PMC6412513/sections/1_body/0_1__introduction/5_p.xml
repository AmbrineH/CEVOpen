<p class="p">The use of various gases in the sub- or supercritical state as extracting solvents has been under investigation for nearly half a century. A large number of natural products has been extracted with carbon dioxide and its commercial applications in the food industry are already well established. The earliest examples of such processes are decaffeination of coffee and production of hop extracts [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Development of such processes and their scaling up are still highly topical. Several modifications of these processes have been reported with respect to the extraction procedure, the choice of an appropriate solvent and cosolvent for the isolation of the desired compound and the tunability of operating conditions. New perspectives have also opened by the introduction of unconventional supercritical solvents, such as noble gases and their mixtures, SF
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>, and of course water as the cheapest solvent. However, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> still remains the solvent of choice for these operations and indeed more than 90% of supercritical fluid extractions have been performed with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as the supercritical solvent, mainly because of its easy penetration inside plant materials and high solvent power. Disadvantageously, its use is largely limited to the processing of dry raw materials and compounds of low polarity as well as low molecular weight.
