<p class="p">Despite the abundant literature on extraction solvents and techniques for polyphenols from a different plant and herbal sources, there is surprisingly little information available on the effect of extraction conditions on the polyphenol content and antioxidative activities of hops and its products. Namely, the solubility of a solute depends on the solvent density that may vary considerably with changing extraction conditions, especially when operating in the sub- or supercritical region. With a higher temperature, moving towards the critical point, the solvent power increases. Optimum conditions for the extraction of a particular solute has to be therefore established experimentally by determining phase equilibria of this substance in a given solvent.</p>
