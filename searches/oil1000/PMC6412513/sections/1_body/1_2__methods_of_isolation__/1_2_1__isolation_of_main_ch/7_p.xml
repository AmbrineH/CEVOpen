<p class="p">Despite several disadvantages, liquid–liquid and solid–liquid extractions are still the most commonly used isolation procedures. For several years, conventional techniques have been widely accepted, mainly because of their ease of use, efficiency, and wide-ranging applicability [

Typically, sterilized contaminant free components should be obtained from food and natural tissues in their chemically natural state. Harmful components from nutraceutical products should be removed; heavy metal recovery and enantiomeric resolution are also possible. Currently, solid phase microextraction is successfully applied for the characterization of aromatic properties of hops and other plant raw materials. On the contrary, for the isolation of nonvolatile compounds, solid-phase extraction, and solvent extraction are successfully used [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. For sample preparation, including purification and/or isolation of polyphenolic compounds, solid-phase extraction in offline columns has also become a popular and effective method. Moreover, accelerated solvent extraction has been recently applied for the extraction of bitter acids from hops and hop products. Finally, low-temperature levels, high yields, and a short process time represent the main advantages of ultrasound-assisted extraction. The procedure usually requires additional cooling, the main part of the applied energy is thereby transferred into heat to protect heat-sensitive substances. Due to cavitation, the cells of the plant material are highly disrupted [
