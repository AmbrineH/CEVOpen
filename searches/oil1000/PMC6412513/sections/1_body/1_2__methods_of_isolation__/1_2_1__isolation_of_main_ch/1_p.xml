<p class="p">Distillation has been traditionally used for obtaining essential oils from hops. Different approaches have been followed. The essential oil was obtained by passing steam through ground hops and removing the oil from the condensate by extraction with ether. The process took approximately 4 h for distillation of a 100 g sample of coarsely ground hops in 3 L of water. The effect of reducing the time taken for the usual steam distillation has been studied [

 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], by Freiherr Von Horst and Kellner, for their “Thin Layer Steam Distillation of Hop Oil Extract”. The process is described as continuous and was proposed for obtaining the essential oil of hop preparations. The main feature of this process was the advantage of completely recovering the oil of hop from the steam distillate and simultaneously producing a residual hop extract containing other components of said extract in substantially unaltered form.
