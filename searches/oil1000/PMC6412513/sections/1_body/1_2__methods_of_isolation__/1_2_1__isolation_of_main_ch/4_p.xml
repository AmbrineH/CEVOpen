<p class="p">Ethanol as a polar solvent dissolves a broader range of hop components and represents a suitable solvent for extraction of polyphenols, compounds with structural phenolic features, which can be associated with different organic acids and carbohydrates. Typically 90% ethanol is used and the resulting extract possesses a very similar composition to the original hops. However, the total content of polyphenols is still lower with respect to the other groups of substances [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Besides ethanol, scientific literature reports alternative organic solvents—such as methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate—as effective extractive media for polyphenols as well as, to a lesser extent, propanol, dimethylformamide, and their combinations [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Considering industrial applications, the use of organic solvents is limited due to the fact that nontoxic solvents and the maximum residue levels of several solvents in the extracted foodstuff are strictly specified. Consequently, for the manufacture of hop extracts by breweries, carbon dioxide still remains the most applied solvent. High pressure or supercritical fluid extraction is especially suitable for isolation/fractionation of valuable ingredients from natural raw materials with limited solubility in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at moderate pressures. The extracts contain nearly all essential oils in hops, as well as a sufficiently high ratio of α-acids (humulones) and less bitter lupulones, besides other components such as hard resins and traces of triglycerides, waxes, chlorophylls, and inorganic salts [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The main feature distinguishing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracts from those prepared with conventional extraction is the lack of traces of undesired organic solvents. Therefore, supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction has become the industrial process of choice for the production of brewery ingredients.
