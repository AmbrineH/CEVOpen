<p class="p">High resolution and the ability to provide precise and accurate qualitative and quantitative data put forth gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses as a valuable tool for taxonomic studies of plants. Various phenolic compounds have been found in beer using different detectors, such as coulometric, electrochemical, and photodiode arrays; ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry; and low-resolution mass spectrometry [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. More than two hundred compounds such as essential oils, prenylflavonoids, and bitter acids usually classified as α-acids and β-acid, can be detected and further separated. In one single run, their quantities can be estimated by the means of capillary GC analysis.
