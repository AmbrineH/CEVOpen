<p class="p">A variety of phenolic compounds, such as hexosides, dihexosides, pentosides, and quinic conjugates, such as feruloyl quinic acid, caffeic acid-O-hexoside, coumaric acid-O-hexoside, sinapic acid-O- hexoside, catechin-O-dihexoside, kaempferol-O-hexoside, and apigenin-C-hexosidepentoside, in beer extracts, of which some have been reported for the first time in beer, were efficiently determined by a LTQ-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, techniques employing high-resolution mass spectrometry are still under intense investigation, since data on identification of the phenolic profile by high-resolution mass spectrometry in analysis of hops compounds are still relatively scarce. These techniques, including ion trap quadrupole-Orbitrap-mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap-MS), which provides single-stage mass analysis that supplies molecular weight information, as well as two-stage mass analysis (MS/MS) and multi-stage mass analysis (MSn) that provide structural information, have been demonstrated as a reliable tool for the structural elucidation of unknown compounds in complex mixtures such as the total hop extracts.
