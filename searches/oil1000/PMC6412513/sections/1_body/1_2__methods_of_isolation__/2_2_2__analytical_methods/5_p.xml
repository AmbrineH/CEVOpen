<p class="p">Isoxanthohumol can be metabolized in the human liver to form 8-prenylnaringenin. Prenylnaringenin is an isomerization product of desmethylxanthohumol and until now, known as the most potent phytoestrogen isolated [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Specific cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for the O-demethylation reaction. The enzymes that convert isoxanthohumol and 8-prenylnaringenin to their most abundant metabolites were identified.
