<p class="p">α-, β-, and iso-α-acids are known for their high potential to oxidize. Development of simple preparative methods (which exclude other hop constituents such as polyphenols, lipids, waxes, and polysaccharides) for the bitter acid oxide fractions is essential due to their effect on beer properties as well as their potential health benefits [

A total content of matured hop bitter acids (MHBA), primarily composed of α-acid-derived oxides, is determined by a quantitative analytical method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) frequently coupled with atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-MS-MS) or with negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. “General, HPLC analyses have unfortunately displayed a lack of reproducibility, the disadvantage of consumption of organic solvents and only the major compounds, i.e., the humulones and iso-humulones can be examined by this methodology.” Xanthohumol has been determined in hops by HPLC using UV detection. Though, this technique lacks deficient sensitivity and for the quantitative determination of the minor prenylflavonoids. Higher sensitivity is enabled by tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with (tandem) mass spectrometry has been successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of prenylflavonoids [
