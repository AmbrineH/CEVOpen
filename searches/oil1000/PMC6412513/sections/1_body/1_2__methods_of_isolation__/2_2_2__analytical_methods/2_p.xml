<p class="p">Main components of hop essential oils such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes comprising humulene, bisabolene, caryophyllene, farnesene, and elemene skeletons are commonly determined by the evaluation of the total volatile content by GCâ€“MS [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The method requires the determination of retention parameters (t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub>, calculated retention index and Kovats retention index) and m/z values of molecular ions for selected compounds from hop essential oils [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The main advantage of the method is that essential oils obtained by steam distillation are ready to use for subsolvent GC analysis after appropriate dilution without additional purification.
