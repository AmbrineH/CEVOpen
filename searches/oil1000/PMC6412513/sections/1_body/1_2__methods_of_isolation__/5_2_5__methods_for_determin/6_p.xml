<p class="p">Numerous natural compounds exhibit phytopharmaceutical potentials. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary laboratory testing and to decrease research costs, it is reasonable to first perform the in silico analysis in order to reduce the number of potential candidates to be experimentally tested or to find novel, stronger candidates for laboratory tests. Even the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has proposed a computational approach to supplement the toxicity profiles of compounds [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. There exist various computational approaches for investigating genotoxicity of specific compounds. One approach is to use the tools that search the existing (toxicological) databases and compare the substances on the basis of their structural elements or other properties with various mathematical/statistical operations [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A completely different approach that is also used by our research group is to perform computer simulations of chemical reactions of DNA with potential (anti)genotoxic agents on the basis of quantum mechanics and/or molecular dynamics. More insights are presented in the concluding chapter.
