<p class="p">Another universally applicable method for genotoxicity tests is the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. This method is used for determining the standard micronucleus index (MNi), representing a small nucleus lacking part(s) of a chromosome or lagging behind in anaphase during nuclear division [

 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. This method can additionally be used also for measuring the nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), nuclear buds (NBUDs), cell death (necrosis or apoptosis), or nuclear division rate [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Therefore, the CBMN method remains widely applicable for determining chromosomal instability, cell death, and cytostasis through various direct and/or indirect measurements of several aspects of cellular and nuclear dysfunctions. An important advantage of the CBMN method lies in specifically restricted scoring to once-divided cells [
