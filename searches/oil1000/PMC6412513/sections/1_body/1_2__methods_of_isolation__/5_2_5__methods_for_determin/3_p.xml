<p class="p">The methods and tests for determining the genotoxic potential can, with minor modifications, in most cases be used for the determination of the antigenotoxic potential as well. The most widespread used genotoxicity test remains the Comet assay as it is straightforward, economical, and can be applied in numerous ways on various cells and tissues for investigating DNA damage at physiological conditions and concentrations [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. As it is utilized for determining DNA damage and its repair, it is popular in human biomonitoring studies along with environmental studies and in assessing the occupational exposure to genotoxic agents associated with various diseases, and the intrinsic factors that affect DNA damage levels in humans. On the other hand, genoprotection by dietary and other factors as well as the exploration of the effect of repair gene polymorphisms can be addressed too [

 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The essence of the Comet assay is in that the studied cells are embedded in agarose, lysed, and electrophoresed at high pH, the DNA strands containing breaks thereby move towards the anode, which under fluorescence microscopy looks like a comet tail. The assay has received numerous improvements, especially by including various DNA modifications like oxidized bases and DNA alkylation with specific enzymes in addition to strand breaks that are primarily/easily detected/determined by the Comet assay. Among the most commonly used enzymes one can find endonuclease III, formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FGP), and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II [

 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. As already mentioned, the Comet assay additionally enables the determination of DNA repair, not only DNA damage. For determining DNA repair, DNA damage on cells is initially induced via ionizing radiation, UVC radiation, or other genotoxic agents and the chromosomal aberrations or micronucleus frequency is measured as it represents unrepaired DNA [

 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. By introducing lesion-specific endonucleases after the lysis of the cells it is possible to observe the removal of specific base damages like oxidized and alkylated bases removed by the base excision repair and UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers removed by the nucleotide excision repair [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The latter additionally enables to assess the repair capacity by measuring the increase of repair intermediates instead of the removal of the damage [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Therefore, the associations of investigators of the majority of diseases share a common belief that the Comet assay exhibits an enormous potential for the use in everyday clinical practice [
