<p class="p">The Comet assay possesses several advantages over alternative methods such as using substrates with a low density of lesions and better simulating real-life conditions compared to other in vitro assays [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Only the quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method requires equally small amounts of DNA as the Comet assay; however, the limit of detection of the latter is at least an order of magnitude higher and therefore, inappropriate for a biomarker assay [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Compared to HPLC methods, the Comet assay is less precise, but better when estimating background levels, and its FPG-based modifications are even more accurate than HPLC [
