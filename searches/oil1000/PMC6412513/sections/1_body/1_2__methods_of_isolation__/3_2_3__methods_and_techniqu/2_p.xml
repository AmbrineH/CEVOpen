<p class="p">Total phenolics and antioxidative activities of hop extracts are commonly determined by well-established methods. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH*) scavenging assay is used to evaluate the antioxidative activities of the extracts, whilst the total phenolics are determined by the reduction of phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Besides, other in vitro antioxidant assays, such as the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, the hydrogen peroxide scavenging (HPS) assay, and the linoleic acid (LA) assay, have also been reported for evaluation of oxidative stability. Using the ORAC assay, cinnamic, caffeic, and ferulic acids; gallocatechin, xanthohumol; and myricetin were described as the most active in hydroxyl and peroxyl radical-scavenging [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The effect of phenolic compounds was related with vitamin C, using ABTS and DPPH-scavenging assays. Antioxidant activities are expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). VCEAC results for phenolic compounds were gallic acid &gt; quercetin &gt; epicatechin &gt; catechin &gt; vitamin C &gt; rutin. It was proposed that monomeric and oligomeric flavonols have the ability to limit LDL oxidation. It was demonstrated that among phenolic compounds, flavonoids with a prenyl group are more effective as inhibitors of LDL oxidation [
