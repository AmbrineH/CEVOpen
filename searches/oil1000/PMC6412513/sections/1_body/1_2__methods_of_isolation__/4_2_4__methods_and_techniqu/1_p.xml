<p class="p">Hops have a long history of use as a natural preservative in beer due to high concentrations of unique bitter acids that inhibit the growth of Gram positive bacteria already at surprisingly low concentrations. 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is one of the most common Gram positive bacteria causing food poisoning. Its source is not the food itself, but the humans who contaminate the food after it has been processed. Despite the well-known high antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of hops, there is a lack of information about antimicrobial potentials of individual hop compounds. However, lupulone, humulone, isohumulone, and humulinic acid have shown high antimicrobial activity against certain bacteria like
