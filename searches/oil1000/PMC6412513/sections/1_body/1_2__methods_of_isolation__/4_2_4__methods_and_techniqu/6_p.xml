<p class="p">Hop extracts obtained by supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction, show significant antibacterial potential against investigated bacterial strains. Xanthohumol has been proven to possess the highest activity against all tested strains. According to the literature, α- and β-acids, humulones and lupulones, and the isomerized forms of humulones might be considered as antimicrobial agents in hop extracts as well. Possible mechanisms of antibacterial activity of bitter acids and their derivatives might include the induced leakage of the bacterial membrane due to their highly hydrophobic character, especially of lupulone [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Among organic solvents used for Soxhlet extraction, methanol and ethanol have been proven as efficient solvents for isolation of compounds with high antimicrobial activity. On the other hand, when n-hexane is used as a solvent, the resulting extract is less effective than methanol and ethanol extracts against tested bacteria and fungi.
