<p class="p">The most extensively used techniques to investigate the antibacterial activity of natural substances and plant extracts are diffusion methods which are based on the use of discs or holes as reservoirs containing solutions of substances to be examined according to Brantner and Grein [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], which studied plants of 28 families, selected on the basis of medicinal folklore reports and literature data, in a screening program. Aqueous extracts of plants used externally for treatment of infected skin lesions were tested for their antibacterial potential. The results indicated that ~60% of the plant extracts tested exhibited some level of antibacterial action. Hole-plate diffusion method is used in the case of pure compounds, whilst the cylinder diffusion method is used for the extracts.
