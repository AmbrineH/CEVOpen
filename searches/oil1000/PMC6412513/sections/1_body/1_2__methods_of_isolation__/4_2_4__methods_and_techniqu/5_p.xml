<p class="p">However, in the case of solutions with low activity a larger concentration or volume is needed, which may be problematic when determining the antibacterial activity of extracts, including hop extracts. The limited capacity of discs means that holes or cylinders are preferably used. Among several phenolic compounds present in plant extracts, flavone, quercetin, and naringenin have been proved as highly effective in inhibiting the growth of microorganisms due to their interaction with nucleic acid or proteins [

 <xref rid="B46-nutrients-11-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Indeed, diverse extraction procedures give extracts with characteristic phenolic profile and different proportion of single phenolic compounds and this certainly influences the antioxidative properties of the extracts.
