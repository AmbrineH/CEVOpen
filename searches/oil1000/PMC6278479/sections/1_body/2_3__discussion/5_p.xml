<p class="p">The three essential oils tested exhibited pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the highest diameter of growth inhibition zone recorded for 
 <italic class="italic">M. luteus</italic> NCIMB 8166 (41.33 mm) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6816 (32.67 mm) by the green cardamom oil. The Gram-positive bacterium, 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> was the most sensitive bacteria to the black cardamom oil (35.67 mm). This can be explained to the difference in the structure and composition of the cell wall of bacteria belonging to two groups and the different mechanism of action of the various components in each essential oil tested [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Using the two biomonitor strains 
 <italic class="italic">C. violaceum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, we founded that all tested essential oils and their main component (1,8-cineole) attenuated the expression of the tested QS-controlled virulence factors (violacein pigment production, elastase and protease production, and motility) in a dose dependent manner. Previous reports have shown that the essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation from the green cardamom (chemotype α-terpinyl acetate/1,8-cineole) had anti-QS properties against the sensor plasmid pJBA132 (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strain) with a percentage of inhibition about 31% after 24 h of exposure, and a weak activity using the long-chain sensor plasmid pRK-C12 in 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic> strain (inhibition 21–22%). This result indicated that the chemical compounds founded in the green cardamom oil can compete with C6-HSL autoinducers molecules [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] reported that the green cardamom methanolic extract exhibited significant elimination of pyocyanin formation, significantly inhibited twitching and swimming motilities, and biofilm formation in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 strain. It has been recently demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">Amomum tsao-ko</italic> extract exhibited a high biofilm inhibition when tested against 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> (51.96%), 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (47.06%), and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (45.28%) at 4 mg/mL. The same authors demonstrated that this extract can inhibit the violacein production (44.59%) and anti-swarming activity by 4 mg/mL extract on 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and
