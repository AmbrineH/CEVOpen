 <italic class="italic">E. cardamomum</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">A. subulatum</italic> essentials oils have been recognized for their wide range of physiological and pharmacological properties but no studies were carried out on their phytotoxic activities. The difference in phytotoxic activity of the oils could be attribuited to their chemical composition. 
 <italic class="italic">A. corrorima</italic> essential oil composition is richer in monoterpene hydrocarbons (71.4%) than other essential oils studied. Our results corroborate with De Martino and coworkers [
