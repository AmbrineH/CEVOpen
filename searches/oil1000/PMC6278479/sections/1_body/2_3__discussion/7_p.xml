<p class="p">In conclusion, this study has determined the chemical structure of 
 <italic class="italic">Elettaria cardamomum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aframomum corriroma</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Amomum subulatum</italic> oils, and showed that these oils were mainly composed of the oxygenated monoeterpens, in particular 1,8-cineole. It is evident that the tested oils have effectively reduced/stopped the bacterial and fungal growth as well as the communication of bacterial cells. It is proposed that cardamom oils especially their extracts may have a potential use in clinical settings for microbial infections.
