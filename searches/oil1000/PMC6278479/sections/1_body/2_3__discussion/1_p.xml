<p class="p">Our results showed that the tested 
 <italic class="italic">A. subulatum</italic> essential oil was characterized by high proportion of monoterpenes (84.6) dominated by the 1,8-cineole and geraniol. Really, in all essential oils tested, 1,8-cineole was the dominant compound found with a percentage varying from 41.7 to 55.4%. The obtained results were in agreement with those reported in the literature. In fact, in a previous work, we reported that the green cardamom was particularly rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (88.7%) with a dominance of α-terpinyl acetate (45.6%), 1,8-cineole (26%). Additionally, several reports have shown that the basic green cardamom aroma from different geographic origin is a combination of 1,8-cineole and α-terpinyl acetate with different percentages [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] studied the content and the chemical composition of seven cardamom genotypes from India at different maturity levels (stage of capsule development) and reported that α-terpinyl acetate and 1,8-cineole were always the main components. In 2006, Hymete and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] reported that the seed oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Aframomum corrorima</italic> from Ethiopia was particularly rich on the monoterpenes 1,8-cineole (44.3%) and sabinene (17.3%), whereas the sesquiterpenic compounds (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (17.2%), β-caryophyllene (9.7%) and caryophyllene oxide (6.9%) dominated the composition of the husk oil. Eyob and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] conducted an ethnobotanical survey in the southern regions of Ethiopia on the three major korarima growing wild including Gamo Gofa, Debub Omo and Kaffa. They identified 38 and 52 compounds, respectively in leaf and rhizome essential oils. The major component of the oil of the leaf was β-caryophyllene (60.7%). The rhizome oil was dominated by γ-terpinene (21.8%) and β-pinene (17.6%). Similar results have been reported by Baser and Kürkçüoglu [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Kumar and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] reported the chemical composition of the hydrodistilled essential oil obtained from the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">A. subulatum</italic> grown in northeast region of Sikkim (India) by using the capillary GC and GC-MS techniques. They reported that the hydrodistillated oil was dominated by 1,8-cineole (65.39%), α-terpineol (10.15%), β-pinene (7.23%). In 2013, Joshi and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported the GC-MS profile of the essential oils from the different locations in India. The oils collected showed qualitative and quantitative differences in composition with a dominance of oxygenated monoterpenes (65.31–75.54%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (10.53–17.12%), terpene alcohols (15.32–18.80%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (5.02–9.19%). The oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineole (50.55–60.46%) represent the major compound in the oils collected from all regions tested.
