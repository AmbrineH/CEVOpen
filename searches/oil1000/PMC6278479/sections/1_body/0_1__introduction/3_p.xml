<p class="p">It is well known that both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogenic bacteria regulate their virulence traits using the quorum sensing (QS) system throughout the expression of a variety of genes as function of bacterial cell density [

A large variety of plant-derived molecules were described for their ability to interfere with the autoinducers molecules synthesized by Gram positive bacteria (AIP) and Gram negative bacteria (AHL) and attenuates the behavior of the QS-controlled virulence factors expression in both
