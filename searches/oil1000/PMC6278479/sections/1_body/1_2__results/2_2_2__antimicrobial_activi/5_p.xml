<p class="p">Using the microdilution assay, the results showed that weak concentrations of the three essential oils tested were sufficient to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested (MICs values), and to completely stop the bacterial growth (MBCs values). In fact, the lowest MICs values were ranged from 0.048 to 0.19 mg/mL for Ethiopian cardamom oil, and from 0.048 to 0.097 mg/mL for the green and black cardamom oils. Concentrations as low as 0.39 mg/mL was sufficient to reproduce a bacteriostatic effect for the black Ethiopian cardamom oil, 0.78 mg/mL for the black cardamom oil, and 6.25 mg/mL for the green cardamom oil (
