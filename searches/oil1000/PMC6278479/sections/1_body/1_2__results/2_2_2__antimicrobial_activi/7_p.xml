<p class="p">Under control conditions, PAO1 strain give a diameter about 54 mm and in the presence of different concentrations of the three essential oils and their main component (1,8-cineole), the bacteria were able to grow and form a colony in the center with diameter not exceeding 8.33 mm. In fact, the highest level of inhibition in the migration of PAO1 was recorded with the green and ethiopian volatile oils at 400 µg/mL. The diameter of the colony ranged from 54 ± 1 mm to 8.33 ± 0.58. 1,8-Cineole was also able to inhibit the swarming ability of the PAO1 strain with a diameter ranging from 17.33 ± 1.15 mm at 10 µg/mL to 10.33 ± 0.58 mm at 400 µg/mL.</p>
