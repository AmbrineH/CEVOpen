 <xref rid="molecules-23-02818-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), the results showed that the three essential oils were also active against the yeast strains tested with high diameters of fungal growth inhibition zone ranging from 14.33 to 21.67 mm for the green cardamom oil, from 12.67 to 34.33 mm for the Ethiopian cardamom oil, and from 6.0 to 40.33 mm for the black cardamom oil. The Ethiopian cardamom was the most active essential oil with MICs values ranging from 0.048 to 0.19 mg/mL, and MBCs values from 0.19 to 1.75 mg/mL. Using the Duncanâ€™s test comparing the mean diameters of the microbial growth inhibition zones, independently of the microorganism tested, Corriroma essential oil was classified as the most active oil (mean diameter 17.75 mm) followed by the green cardamom oil (mean diameter 16.27 mm) and finally the Ethiopian cardamom oil (mean diameter 16.21 mm).
