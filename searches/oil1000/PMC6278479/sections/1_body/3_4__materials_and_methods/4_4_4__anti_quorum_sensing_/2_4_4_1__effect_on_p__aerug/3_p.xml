<p class="p">For elastolytic activity, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was grown in LB broth medium supplemented with different concentrations of essential oils and 1,8-cineole and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 µL of the culture supernatant was added to 900 mL elastin congo red (ECR, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, Italy) buffer (100 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ECR (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, Italy). The eppendorf tubes were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The insoluble ECR was removed by centrifugation and the absorbance of the supernatant was estimated spectrophotometrically at OD
 <sub class="sub">495</sub> (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan).
