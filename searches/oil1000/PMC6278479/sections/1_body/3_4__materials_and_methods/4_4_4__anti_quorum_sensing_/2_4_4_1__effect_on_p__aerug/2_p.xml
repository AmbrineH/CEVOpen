<p class="p">The effect of the tested oils and 1,8-cineole on the swarming activity in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain was performed in Luria Bertani semisolid medium (Biorad, France) prepared at 0.5% agar and supplemented with different oils concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 µg/mL. The Petri dishes plates inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and the extent of swarming was determined by measuring the swarming diameter using a 1 cm flat ruler.
