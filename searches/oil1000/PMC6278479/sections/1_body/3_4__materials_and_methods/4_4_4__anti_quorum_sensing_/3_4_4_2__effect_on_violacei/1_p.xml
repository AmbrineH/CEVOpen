<p class="p">Inhibition of violacein production in the presence of tested essential oils and their major component (1,8-cineole) was tested according the method described by McClean and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. For this, two microlitres of essential oil or 1,8-cineole (2 mg/disc) were loaded to the sterile disks and placed on the surface of CV026 inoculated LB agar plates supplemented with 50 µL of 1 µg/mL of C6-HSL. The plates were incubated upright at 32 °C for 24 h and zone of inhibition of QS was detected by the presence of colourless but viable cells around the disks and the zone of growth inhibition was also recorded.
