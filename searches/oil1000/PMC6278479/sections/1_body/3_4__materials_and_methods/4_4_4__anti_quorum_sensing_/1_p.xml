<p class="p">The anti-quorum sensing activities of the tested essential oils and their main component 1,8-cineole were tested by using three reporter strains 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and the mutant strain 
 <italic class="italic">Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> CV026. The 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. While, the mini-Tn5 mutant 
 <italic class="italic">C. violaceum</italic> 026 strains that produces violacein pigment only in the presence of exogenous C6-AHL was grown in Luria-Bertani broth medium at 32 °C.
