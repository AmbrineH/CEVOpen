<p class="p">Gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry GC/EIMS analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas-chromatograph (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector (Varian, Inc., CA, USA). Analytical conditions: injector and transfer line temperatures at 220 and 240 °C, respectively; oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; injection of 0.2 mL (10% hexane solution); split ratio 1:30. Identification of the constituents was based on comparison of the retention times with those of authentic standards, comparing their Linear Retention Indices relative to the series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hydrocarbons, and by computer matching against commercial (NIST 98 and ADAMS 95) and home-made library mass spectra built up from pure substances and components of known essential oils and MS literature data [
