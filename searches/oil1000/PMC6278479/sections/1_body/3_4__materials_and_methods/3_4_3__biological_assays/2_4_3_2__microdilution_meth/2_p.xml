<p class="p">The inocula of the bacterial and fungal strains were prepared from 12 h broth cultures and suspensions were adjusted to 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> UFC/mL. The essential oils dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), were first diluted to the highest concentration (100 mg/mL) to be tested, and 200 µL of the essential oils stock solutions were serial twofold diluted in a decreasing concentration range in the 96 well-plate. All 96-well plates were prepared by dispensing into each well 195 µL of the correspondent broth and 5 µL of the bacterial/fungal inocula. The last well containing 195 µL of nutrient broth without essential oil and 5 µL of the inocula on each strip was used as the negative control. The final volume in each well was 200 µL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
