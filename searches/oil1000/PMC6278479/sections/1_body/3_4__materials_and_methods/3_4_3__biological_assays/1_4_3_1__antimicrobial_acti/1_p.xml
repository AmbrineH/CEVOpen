<p class="p">The antimicrobial effect of the three volatile oils was tested against 25 food-borne pathogenic bacteria including 25 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and against seven yeasts including six 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. strains and one 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain by using the disk diffusion assay [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-02818" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. For the experiments, a loopful of the microorganisms working stocks was enriched on a tube containing 9 mL of enrichment broth (Mueller Hinton for bacteria and Sabouraud Chloramphenicol for yeast) then incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The overnight cultures were used for the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils used in this study and the optical density was adjusted at 0.1 (OD
 <sub class="sub">600nm</sub>). The inoculums were streaked onto MH (1% NaCl for 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> strains) agar plates using a sterile swab. While, the yeast strains were inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (Biolife, Milan, Italy) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The yeast cultures were harvested and then suspended in sterile saline (0.8% NaCl) and the cell density was adjusted to 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cells/mL (OD
 <sub class="sub">540</sub>= 0.5). The fungal inoculums were streaked onto fresh Sabouraud dextrose agar plates using a sterile swab.
