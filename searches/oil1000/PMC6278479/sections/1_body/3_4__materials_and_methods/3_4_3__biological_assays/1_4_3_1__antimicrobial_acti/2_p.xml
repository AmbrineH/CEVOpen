<p class="p">A sterile filter discs (diameter 6 mm, Biolife, Milan, Italy) were impregnated with 10 mg of each essential oil. Ampicillin (10 mg/mL) was used in this study as positive controls for all bacterial strains tested. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the zones of inhibition around each of the disks was taken as measure of the antimicrobial activity. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean diameter of the inhibition zone was recorded.</p>
