<p class="p">The phytotoxic activity was evaluated on germination and root elongation of three different plant species: 
 <italic class="italic">R. sativus</italic> cv “Saxa” (radish), 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> (garden cress) and 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativa</italic> (lettuce). These seeds are well known from the histological point of view and usually they are used in assays of phytotoxicity because of their easy germinability. The seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">R. sativus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> were purchased from Blumen group srl (Piacenza, Italy), the seeds of garden cress from Euroselect (Bari). The seeds were surface sterilized in 95% ethanol for 15 s and sown in Petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm), containing five layers of Whatman filter paper, impregnated with distilled water (7 mL, control) or the tested solution of the essential oil (7 mL), at the different doses. The germination conditions were 20 ± 1 °C, with natural photoperiod. The essential oils, in water-acetone mixture (99.5:0.5), were assayed at the doses of 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.062 µg/mL Controls performed with water-acetone mixture alone showed no appreciable differences in comparison to controls in water alone. Seed germination was observed directly in Petri dishes every 24 h. A seed was considered germinated when the protrusion of the root became evident [

Each determination was repeated three times, using Petri dishes containing 10 seeds each. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for both germination and radicle elongation [
