<p class="p">It is possible to make acceptable non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics using egg yolk, egg white, soy protein, or their combinations. The non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics produced in this study can not only be used as a coffee creamer but also be used as a substitute for breast milk with superior nutritional quality to the commercial coffee creamer analogs/mimics. Addition of more egg yolk components to the formula can improve the nutritional quality and reduce the production costs of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics, but increase in egg flavor/odor and decrease in solubility can be important issues to overcome. Solving the solubility, off-flavor and nutrient balances, especially in fatty acid composition, are important issues to overcome if the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics are going to be used as a coffee creamer as well as a milk replacer.</p>
