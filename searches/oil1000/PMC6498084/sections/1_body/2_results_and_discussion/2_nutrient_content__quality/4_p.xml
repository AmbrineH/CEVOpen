The spray-dried non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics prepared from the emulsion are also expected to be more susceptible to oxidative changes because of the increased surface area and air inclusion in the dried powder, which accelerate lipid oxidation [

 <xref rid="b36-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The inclusion of egg yolk in the formulae of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics was expected to accelerate lipid oxidation further because egg yolk usually contains phospholipids with high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="b37-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, the increase of TBARS in the spray-dried non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics during the storage was relatively small even though they were stored in oxygen-permeable bags at room temperature conditions, which was unexpected. Also, the addition of egg yolk to the formulae of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics did not increase the TBARS values, but the addition of soy proteins did (
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The reason for the increase in TBARS of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics with the soy proteins is not clear, but could be related to the oxidized lipids in the dried soy protein powders.
