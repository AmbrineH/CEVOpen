<p class="p">The TBARS values of the spray-dried non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at 0 month were &lt;1.0 mg/kg product (
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Control had the lowest TBARS value while the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics with the highest level of soy protein (WS2, 4% soy protein) had the highest TBARS value. The TBARS values of the spray-dried non-dairy creamers analogs/mimics increased from 0.95 to 1.35 in the WS2 formula as the storage time increased from 0-month to 3 months. The TBARS values of the all 9 non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics were significantly higher than that of the control at all storage times. However, the TBARS values were still low and the majority of the general public may not recognize oxidation flavor from the product.
