<p class="p">Because the solubility of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics, except for the control (commercial), were not different from each other and the color of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics did not change over the storage time, solubility and color of the products were not measured after 0-month storage. Beany flavor/odor was detected from the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at 0 month of storage, but disappeared after 3 months of storage probably due to the decrease in aldehydes during the storage (
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Ketones were the major volatiles at 0-month storage, but they had no effect on the odor of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics because of they have high thresholds [

 <xref rid="b43-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported that aldehydes (hexanal and pentanal) are responsible for the beany flavor. Oxidized flavor/odor increased slightly during the storage, but the intensity was very weak in all the formulae. Egg flavor/odor in egg yolk-added formulae was a concern at 0 month, but became non-significant after 3 months of storage. Due to a significant decrease in the egg flavor/odor in egg yolk-added formulae in aerobic storage conditions, which lost all the sulfur compounds that are responsible for the sulfury hard-boiled egg odor [
 <xref rid="b40-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], overall acceptance of all the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics were greater than 5 (moderately high). This indicated that storage improved the overall acceptance of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics because most of the off-odor volatiles disappeared during the storage.
