<p class="p">The nutrient content of the 10 formulae was within the calculated value ranges with some differences depending upon the formula (protein 8.6% to 10.2%, fat 20.5% to 31.0%, carbohydrate 56.1% to 64.5%, moisture 1.9% to 4.0%, and ash 1.4% to 1.9% ranges, except for the control that has only 3% proteins, 
 <xref rid="t2-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). More than 99% of the fatty acids in the products with no egg yolk in the formula were saturated fatty acids because coconut oil was used in the formula (
 <xref rid="t3-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The majority of fatty acids in coconut oil as well as non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics were lauric (C12:0, 41% to 50%), myristic (C14:0, 16% to 18%), palmitic (C16:0, 9% to 12%), stearic (C18:0, 9% to 11%), caprylic (C8:0, 7% to 8%), and capric acid (C10:0, 5% to 6%). As expected, the amounts of oleic (up to 4.8%) and linoleic acid (up to 2.8%) content increased as the amount of egg yolk increased in the formulae, but the increases of polyunsaturated fatty acids were very small (&lt;0.5% of total fat). Preparation of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics using egg white, egg yolk and egg yolk+soy proteins increased the amount of proteins by 3 folds (from 3% to 9%â€“10%) and lowered fat content by 6% to 8% from the control. The composition of fatty acids was also changed, but the increases of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA due to the added egg yolk were small (&lt;2%,
