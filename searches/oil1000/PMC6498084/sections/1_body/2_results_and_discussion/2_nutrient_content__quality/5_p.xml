<p class="p">Volatiles results indicated that ketones were the major volatiles, and aldehydes and hydrocarbons were the next highest volatiles produced from the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at 0 month. Only very small amounts of alcohols and sulfur compounds were detected at 0 month (
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The amounts of ketones were not influenced by non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics formulae and had little effect on the odor/flavor of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics. Six different aldehydes, which include propanal, butanal, 3-methyl butanal, 2-methyl butanal, pentanal and hexanal, were produced from the non-dairy creamers analogs/mimics. The amounts of butanal, 3- methyl butanal, 2-methyl butanal and hexanal increased as the amount of egg yolk and soy protein in formulae increased. Aldehydes, especially hexanal, are usually closely related to the degree of lipid oxidation in food products [

 <xref rid="b39-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. No consistent trends for the amounts and kinds of hydrocarbons by the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics formulae were observed. Carbon disulfide was the only sulfur compound detected from the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at low levels at 0-month storage (
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Ahn [
 <xref rid="b40-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] reported that sulfur compounds are responsible for the typical “hard-boiled egg” smell. Sulfur compounds easily disappear during storage in oxygen permeable packaging conditions because they are highly volatile [
 <xref rid="b41-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The profiles and amounts of volatiles in the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics after 1-month storage were not much different from those of the 0-month samples, except for the dramatic increase in hydrocarbons in soy protein-added formulae (data not shown). The amounts of total and individual volatile, and volatile profiles of the all 10 non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics changed significantly after 3-month storage. The amounts of volatiles in non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics after 3 months of storage were less than a half of the 0-month samples and many hydrocarbons and all the sulfur compounds disappeared (
