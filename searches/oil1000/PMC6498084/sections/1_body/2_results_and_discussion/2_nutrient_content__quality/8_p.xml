<p class="p">One of the underlying objectives of this study was developing non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics using egg products to improve the nutrient quality of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics and use it as a low-cost milk replacer for the low-income family. If the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics developed are going to be used as a milk replacer, however, the balance of nutrients and their composition (polyunsaturated fatty acids such as EPA and DHA, choline, calcium, lutein, immunoglobulin, etc.) should be further improved by adding more egg yolk. Also, methods that could increase the solubility and minimize or eliminate egg flavor from the products should be developed. The cost analysis for the formulae indicated that the more liquid egg white was used, the higher the cost of the product would be. However, egg yolk was a cost-relieving ingredient. Higher amounts of yolk and soy protein combinations in place of egg white reduced the cost of the products close to the level of commercial non-dairy coffee creamers analogs/mimics.</p>
