<p class="p">The sensory results of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at 0-month storage are as follow: yellowness and darkness of the liquid non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics increased as the amount of egg yolk in the formula increased (
 <xref rid="t7-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Also, sensory panels sensed egg flavor/odor in all egg white and/or yolk added products. The intensity of egg flavor/odor in the formula with egg white alone was very weak. However, the intensity increased as the amount of egg yolk in the formula increased. With 7.5% of egg yolk in the formula, the intensity was rated as ‘strong’ egg flavor/odor. No beany flavor/odor or oxidized oil flavor/odor was detected, or negligible if any. The overall acceptability of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics was ‘high’ to ‘very high’ except for 7.5% egg yolk-added formulae (somewhat acceptable). The overall acceptability of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics was closely related to the intensity of egg flavor/odor (
 <xref rid="t7-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Pasteurization of the emulsion before spray-drying, which is a mandatory step for the commercial processing, may reduce the egg flavor/odor problems in the non-dairy creamer analog/mimic products as well. Some of the formulae containing high levels of egg yolk produced egg flavor/odor if not stored for 3 months in oxygen-permeable bags. Oxidation of the fats in the powder was minimal probably because coconut oil was used as the main fat source, but long-term storage in oxygen-permeable bags can cause flavor problems if other fat sources with high polyunsaturated fatty acids are used.
