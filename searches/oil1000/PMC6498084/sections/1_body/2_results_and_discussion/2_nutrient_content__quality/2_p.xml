<p class="p">Addition of 2.5% egg yolk to the formulae increased the choline content in the products by about 10 mg choline/100 g dried products and the amount reached to around 70 mg choline/100 g product when 7.5% of egg yolk was used in the formulae. This amount is 1.5-fold higher than that of the control and &gt;2-fold of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics added with egg white. Storage time did not affect the content of choline in the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics (
 <xref rid="t4-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The amounts of lutein in the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics were very small (&lt;4 μg/g sample) and the amount was the highest when 7.5% egg yolk was added in the formula (
 <xref rid="t4-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Although, egg yolk contains about 80 to 120 μg lutein/g yolk depending upon hen’s diet, the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics added with 7.5% yolk had only 4 μg lutein per gram non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics at 0 month. The amounts of lutein continued to decrease over the storage time, and only about 15% to 20% of the 0-month amounts were left after 3 months of storage. This amount was much smaller than the expected value probably because some of the lutein from the egg yolk should have been destroyed by the heat during the spray-spraying process. Also, more than half of the lutein in spray-dried yolk was destroyed after 3 months of storage. Wang et al [

 <xref rid="b33-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] reported that lutein is unstable to heat but encapsulation increase the heat stability of lutein during the spray-drying process as well as storage.
