<p class="p">After spray-drying, the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics should be easily dissolved in water to be used in coffee or as a milk replacer. However, the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics dispersed slowly due to the proteins from egg yolk, white, and soy proteins even in hot water. The spray-dried non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics behaved like dried milk powders: once they were dissolved in hot water, they remained as suspension/emulsion form even the solution temperature went down to the room temperature. Another important parameter in dissolving non-dairy analogs/mimics was water temperature. If the water temperature was higher than 80°C, some of the protein in the powder started to denature (coagulated). However, it was difficult to dissolve the powder when the water temperature was lower than 45°C because the melting point of coconut oil is 43°C. The best water temperature to make liquid non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics using the dried products was 55°C to 75°C. It was expected that the solubility of the spray-dried non-dairy analog/mimic powders could be improved if a second emulsification/ homogenization step (pressurized or ultrasound homogenizer) is added in the processing line like in the commercial non-dairy creamer producing processes [
