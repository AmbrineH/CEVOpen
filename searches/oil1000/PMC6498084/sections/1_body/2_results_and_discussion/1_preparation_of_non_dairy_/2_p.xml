<p class="p">The temperatures of the water phase, the oil phase, and egg played an important role in the success or failure of the emulsions. Due to the low heat stability of egg white proteins, especially ovotransferrin [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], maintaining the temperature of water and oil phases at &lt;55°C was important for the successful emulsion preparation. The solubility of soy protein and casein was also low, but their solubility issues were solved by soaking them in warm water (55°C) for 20 min before use. Nasser et al [
 <xref rid="b25-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported that micellar casein loses its rehydration properties during storage, and causes lower solubility and longer rehydration time. The insolubility of proteins develops more rapidly when the protein concentration is high and is primarily due to the aggregation of casein micelles [
