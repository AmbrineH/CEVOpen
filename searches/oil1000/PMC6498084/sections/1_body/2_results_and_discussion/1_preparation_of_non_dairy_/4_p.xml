<p class="p">Coconut oil and hydrogenated soybean oil were excellent oil sources for non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics because of their high resistance to oxidative changes during heat processing, spray drying and storage [
 <xref rid="b28-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Corn oil did not have any problems in making emulsions at room temperature conditions, but higher than room temperature conditions were needed when hydrogenated soybean oil or hydrogenated coconut oil were used. A lipid-soluble emulsifier (distilled monoglyceride at 0.5% level, the melting point is 63°C to 68°C) was added to the formula to help emulsification after dissolving it in oils at 65°C before use. Mono- and di-glycerides as well as alginates, carrageenans, gums and gelatin are commonly used as emulsifiers/stabilizers in milk products [
 <xref rid="b29-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Dextrin with DE value of 22 and a water-soluble emulsifier (sodium stearoyl lactylate) at 0.3% level each were included in the formula to improve emulsion stability and emulsification, respectively. Phosphate dibasic was added at 1% level to stabilize casein and other proteins [
 <xref rid="b30-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Milk-type flavor at 0.2% level was used as a flavoring agent. Silica was included in the formula at 0.2% level as an anti-caking agent.
