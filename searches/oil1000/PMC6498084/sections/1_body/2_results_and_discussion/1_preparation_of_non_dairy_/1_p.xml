<p class="p">The solubility test of the ingredients used in the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics formula (
 <xref rid="t1-ajas-18-0738" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) indicated that some of the ingredients including spray-dried egg yolk, spray-dried egg white, and starch had low solubility and caused serious problems in making emulsions. Significant portions of spray-dried egg yolk and white powders precipitated, and almost all the natural starch added were caked at the bottom of the homogenized solution upon holding due to low solubility. To overcome the solubility problems with the dried egg yolk and white powders, the dried egg white and dried egg yolk were replaced with liquid yolk and white, which were also beneficial in lowering the product cost. To solve the solubility issues with natural starch, hydrolyzed starch and low-molecular starch products such as maltodextrin were used instead. The solubility of hydrolyzed or modified starches was much greater than that of the natural starch, but the solubility could not go higher than 25% and the viscosity of the solutions became very high at the concentration. So, corn syrup was tested as a source of carbohydrates. However, one issue with corn syrup was that the final non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics after spray drying were sticky when corn syrup with dextrose equivalent (DE) value of 30 to 40 was used. So, maltodextrin powder with a DE value of 22 was used in place of corn syrup for the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics.
