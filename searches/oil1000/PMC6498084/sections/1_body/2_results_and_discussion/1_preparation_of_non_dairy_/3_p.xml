<p class="p">The emulsion stability of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics is important because the liquid product should stay in emulsion during the spray-drying period and the dried products should stay in dispersed conditions when used in coffee or as a milk replacer. The emulsions prepared using all the 10 formulae indicated that emulsion stability increased when egg yolk was included in the formula. Especially, WY1 (9% egg white+2.5% egg yolk), WY2 (8% egg white+5% yolk), and WS1 (8% egg white+2% soy protein) produced the most stable emulsions. However, when egg yolk and/or soy protein was added, the color of the emulsion became dark. When silica was added during the emulsion preparation step, it dramatically reduced emulsion stability. Silica is widely used in food industry as an anti-caking or anti-foaming agent or to control the viscosity of the fluids [
