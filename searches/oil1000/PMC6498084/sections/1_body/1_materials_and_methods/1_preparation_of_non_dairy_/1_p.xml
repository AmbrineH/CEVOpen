<p class="p">Spray dried egg white, egg yolk, and soy protein isolate were purchased from manufacturers and used for the formulae. Modification of formulae and the use of liquid egg white and liquid egg yolk instead of dried ones were also tested. Sodium caseinate level was reduced while the levels of glucose (60%), fat (30%), emulsifier (1.5%), and others (anti-caking agents, gum and flavors, 3.5%) were maintained. The protein content in the formulae was adjusted to approximately 8.5%, and dried egg white, yolk, and soy protein isolate were used as protein sources. When egg yolk was added, smaller amounts of fat (hydrogenated vegetable fat) and emulsifier were used because dried egg yolk contains 61% fat, 1/3 of which is phospholipids, an excellent emulsifier. Soy protein isolate replaced egg white at 1:1 ratio when used.</p>
