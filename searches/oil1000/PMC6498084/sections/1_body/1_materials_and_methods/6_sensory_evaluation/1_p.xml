<p class="p">Ten trained sensory panelists characterized solubility, color intensities including yellowness and darkness, off-odor and off-flavors including beany, egg, and oxidized oil flavors, overall acceptance of the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics. Sensory panelists were asked to rate the intensity of flavor and color on 9-point scales (1: none of the attribute, 9: extremely high intensity of the attribute). The term of each sensory attribute was provided for panelists. Thirty grams of non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics was dissolved in 300 mL of hot water (70Â°C), and 20 mL/person was served in a covered 60 mL plastic cup labeled with a random three-digit code. Panelists instructed to smell the samples first and then taste in the randomized order presented on the questionnaire. Participants instructed to rinse their mouths with water before starting to taste, and also between samples. A commercial non-dairy creamer was used as a reference.</p>
