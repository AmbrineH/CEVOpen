<p class="p">A mini spray dryer (Model B-290, Buchi Labortechnik AG, Postfach, Flawil, Switzerland) was used to spray-dry the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics. The inlet temperature of the spray dryer was set at 185°C and the exhaust temperature was maintained at 85°C by adjusting the flow rate of liquid non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics to the atomizer. All non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics formulae were freshly prepared, spray dried, subdivided into portions, packaged in oxygen permeable zipper bags, and stored at 22°C for 3 months.</p>
