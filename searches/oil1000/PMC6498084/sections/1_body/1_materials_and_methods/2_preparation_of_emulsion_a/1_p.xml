<p class="p">The emulsion was prepared using all the non-dairy formulae (in liquid form) and tested for their stability during storage. The water phase (a mixture of water-soluble compounds), the oil phase, and egg (white and yolk+white) in the non-dairy creamer analogs/mimics formula were prepared separately using Waring blender (22,000 rpm). The water phase was added first, mixed, and then the egg yolk and white were added before adding oil. Emulsion stability was determined by holding the emulsions at 22Â°C conditions for 7 days after transferring each emulsion to a 100-mL graduated cylinder and observing phase separation over the storage time.</p>
