<p class="p">Many poor mothers in the poverty-ridden areas of the world feed their babies and toddlers non-dairy coffee creamers as a substitute for breast milk because most poor mothers cannot produce enough breast milk for their baby due to momâ€™s malnutrition conditions and the price of infant milk formulas are too expensive for them. However, feeding non-dairy coffee creamers to the poor infants cause severe malnutrition problems because of the low nutritional value of non-dairy creamers. Non-dairy coffee creamers are the substituents for milk or cream as an additive to coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Normally non-dairy coffee creamers contain corn syrup solids (60% to 65%), vegetable oil (30%, hydrogenated coconut or palm oil), sodium caseinate (2% to 5%) and other ingredients (emulsifiers, stabilizers, anti-caking agents, and color and flavoring agents). This means that non-dairy coffee creamers have very low protein content compared with human breast milk (dried), which contain 58% carbohydrate, 32.5% fat, 8.5% protein, and 1.2% minerals. Thus, improvement in nutritional composition in the non-dairy creamers is necessary if they are going to be used as an alternative to the milk formulas.</p>
