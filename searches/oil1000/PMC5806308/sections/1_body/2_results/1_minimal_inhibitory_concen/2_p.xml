<p id="Par37" class="p">The essential oil and the extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</italic> leaves showed a bacteriostatic effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The bacteriostatic effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, at the same concentration, suggests that the chemical composition of the extracts and its mechanism of action had a bacteriostatic effect that was independent of the chemistry of the cell wall of the microorganisms, which in other studies has been reported to be a factor.
