<p id="Par38" class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, only the essential oil showed a fungicide effect, since its growth was not observed in the Petri dishes. These results suggest that the essential oil and the extracts of this plant may produce a fungicide or fungistatic effect at low concentrations in comparison with the levels that are necessary to cause a bacteriostatic effect. These last results are relevant since most of studies that have used the microdilution technique to calculate the MIC have not reported complementary tests necessary to verify the bactericide, bacteriostatic, fungicide or fungistatic effects of the extracts.
