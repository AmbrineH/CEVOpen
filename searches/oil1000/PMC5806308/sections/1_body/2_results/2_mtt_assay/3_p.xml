<p id="Par41" class="p">The aqueous extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd caused a decrease in the cell proliferation in both cell lines assessed (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). At concentrations of 4% and 8%, the human fibroblast cell line displayed relative cell proliferation percentage values of 73.56% and 46.93% respectively. The same effect was observed on the CHO-K1 cell line but at a concentration of 8% with a relative cell proliferation percentage value of 50.82%. A slight proliferative effect was observed on the CHO-K1 cell line at concentrations of 0.25% and 0.50%.
