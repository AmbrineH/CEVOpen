<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, there is no available information on an eligible wall material for the encapsulation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> essential oil and ethanolic extract. Since the coating behavior of each wall material is different, the suitability of a wall material for encapsulation needs to be evaluated due to the lack of knowledge about the compatibility of the encapsulate and its coating properties. This study will provide knowledge on selecting wall materials in order to produce a powder containing bioactive compounds and other related research. The influence of wall material composition for microencapsulation was evaluated. Sodium caseinate, skim milk, maltodextrin, resistant-maltodextrin, gum arabic, and beta-cyclodextrin were chosen as the encapsulating agents (wall materials). Powder quality tests and encapsulation efficiency of the main active compounds contained in 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> ethanolic extract and essential oil (core materials) were the main parameters for the evaluation.
