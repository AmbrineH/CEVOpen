<p class="p">Depending on the polymer used, microencapsulation may control organoleptic modifications and increase the solubility/dissolution rate of the spray-dried product [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. A good encapsulating agent (wall material) should have emulsifying and film forming properties, display low hygroscopicity, have low viscosity at high solid contents, resistance to the gastrointestinal tract, be biodegradable, non-toxic, low-cost, bland in flavor/tasteless, soluble in aqueous solvents, and food-grade [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. However, no single encapsulant possesses all these properties, and because of that, two or more encapsulants must often be used in particular combinations [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The type of wall material affects the quantification of active substances due to the interaction between active compounds and wall material [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The main groups of wall materials for microencapsulation are lipids (glycerides, phospholipids, waxes, etc.), proteins (gluten, whey proteins, isolates, etc.), and carbohydrates (starch, cellulose and their derivatives, plant exudates, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Maltodextrin and gum arabic are used as encapsulants in spray-drying technique more commonly than other materials [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Maltodextrin is a hydrolyzed starch which is suitable for encapsulation of active ingredients because it has relatively low viscosity at high concentrations, a good protection against oxidation, and low cost [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Gum arabic is a suitable encapsulant for spray-drying because of its high solubility, good emulsifying properties, and low viscosity [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. There are only a few methods that improve the solubility of phenolic compounds and essential oils, which in turn upgrade the said bioactive compound’s bioavailability when taken orally [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Skim milk and sodium caseinate are suitable encapsulants for microencapsulation because of their low viscosity, high solubility, and good emulsifying properties. According to Ratchathani et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], skim milk powder as an encapsulating agent keeps the moisture content of fish oil microcapsule, and this feature is obtained by spray-drying in the range of 2.33–4.84%. A relatively new water-soluble fiber, resistant-maltodextrin, can be used as an encapsulating agent for spray-drying. Resistant-maltodextrin is a randomly linked alpha-glucoside oligosaccharide and it has a low glycemic index (10% of that of maltodextrin) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Most of the research work on resistant-maltodextrin has focused on its nutritional benefits. However, we have only come across a few recent reports on the use of resistant-maltodextrin as an encapsulant using spray- and freeze-drying processes, which mainly focus on stability, sensory profiles [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], and bioflavonoid naringin encapsulation [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>].
