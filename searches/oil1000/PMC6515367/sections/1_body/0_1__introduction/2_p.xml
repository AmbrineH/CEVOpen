<p class="p">According to the structural aspect, polyphenols fall into many different families, including flavonoids anthocyanins, coumarins, lignins, tannins, acids, and phenols [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This structural diversity results in a large variability of the physicochemical properties influencing the extraction of polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Solubility is considered to be the key aspect when the effects of polyphenols and essential oils in vivo are assessed. Poor solubility influences the bioavailability of polyphenols and essential oils. Only 1% to 10% of total polyphenol intake is detected in urine and plasma samples [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. A method for increasing bioavailability and reducing inter- and intra-individual variability should be analyzed due to poor solubility of polyphenols and essentials oils, and the difficulties of oral administration. Also, polyphenols and essential oils are sensitive to various environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and oxidation, which may reduce their bioavailability, content, nutritional value, and storage period [
