<p class="p">In this study, an ethanolic 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> herb extract and essential oil were successfully encapsulated by spray-drying technique using skim milk, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate, gum arabic, resistant-maltodextrin, and beta-cyclodextrin as wall materials. All wall materials enabled the formation of microparticles loaded with 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> ethanolic extract and essential oil. The morphology of microparticles, the spray-dried powders characteristics, and active compounds encapsulation efficiency were quite dependent on the wall material used. Using different encapsulating agents, some differences in morphology, physical characteristic, and encapsulation efficiency were found. When wall material solution for spray-drying contained 0.54 g of sodium caseinate, 10 g of skim milk, 8.96 g of resistant-maltodextrin, and 0.5 g of beta-cyclodextrin the EE of RA was 85.27%, CA—85.36%, AP—90.51%, EK—67.38%, DK—35.12%, and TPC—62.78%. The use of resistant-maltodextrin as the main encapsulating material, in supplementation with sodium caseinate, skim milk, and beta-cyclodextrin, increased the encapsulation efficiency, solubility, and wettability more than only using one encapsulating agent for spray-drying solution. Microparticles according to SEM micrographs were round-shaped with a smooth surface when using four encapsulating agents for spray-drying solution. The results showed that wall material solution containing these encapsulants is better at encapsulating phenolic compounds than ketones. To achieve higher EE of EK and DK it is necessary to optimize the conditions of the spray-drying process.
