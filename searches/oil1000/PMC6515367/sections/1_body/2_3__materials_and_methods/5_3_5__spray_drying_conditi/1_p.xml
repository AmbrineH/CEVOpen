<p class="p">The prepared liquid feeds were spray-dried using a Buchi B-291 Mini Spray-Dryer (BÜCHI Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) under the following experimental conditions: according to previous pilot studies inlet temperature was 160 °C, outlet temperature was 80–90 °C, spray flow feed rate—30 mL/min, air pressure—6 bar, aspirator—100%. All of the spray-dried powders were collected in glass vials and stored in a refrigerator at +4–7 °C, where they were protected from light and gas permeation in order to minimize possible changes in the material, such as an agglomeration, caused by oxidation and water absorption.</p>
