<p class="p">The morphological characteristics of the microcapsules produced with different wall materials at the temperature of 160°C were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The small amounts of spray-dried powders were placed on the double-sided tape surface fixed to stubs. Photomicrographs with magnifications of 500×, 1000×, and 6000× were recorded at 5 kV using Hitachi TM 3000 (Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron microscope.</p>
