<p class="p">Quantification was carried out by the external standard method. Elsholtzia ketone (C

 <sub class="sub">14</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Mw 162 g/mol) and dehydroelsholtzia ketone (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">12</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Mw 164 g/mol) contents were calculated using the equation of linear calibration of eugenol (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">12</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Mw 164 g/mol). The linear calibration curve was constructed as an area vs. concentration (eugenol R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9999).
