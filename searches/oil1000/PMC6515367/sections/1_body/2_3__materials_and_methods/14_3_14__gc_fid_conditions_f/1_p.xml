<p class="p">GC-FID analyses have been carried out using Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Shimadzu autoinjector AOC-20is (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) according to Pudziuvelyte et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] method. The operational conditions were as follows: temperature increased from 70 °C (3 min) to 180 °C (5 min) at 5 °C/min, then increased to 250 °C (3 min) at 10 °C/min and to 315 °C (10 min) at 10 °C/min. A column RXI-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. Split injector temperature: 260 °C. Split ratio: 1:20. Inlet pressure: 104.0 kPa. Carrier gas: helium (purity &gt; 99%), delivered at constant linear velocity 30.1 cm/s. FID (320 °C) gases: helium (flow 40.0 mL/min); air (flow 400.0 mL/min); helium (as make up, flow 30.0 mL/min).
