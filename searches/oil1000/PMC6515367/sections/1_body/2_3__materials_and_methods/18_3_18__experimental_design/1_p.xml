<p class="p">The experimental settings for experimental design for encapsulating agents were performed by statistical mixture experimental design. The experimental design of four components system is conducted by using Design Expert (version 9.0.4.01, Stat-Easy Inc., Minneapolis, USA). A set of candidate points in the design space is selected using D-optimal criterion. In D-optimal criterion, there are restrictions on the component proportions X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> that take the form of lower L
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and upper U
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> constraints, to keep the experimenter from exploring the entire simplex region. The mixture of the components was composed of sodium caseinate, skim milk, beta-cyclodextrin, and resistant-maltodextrin. The constraints of the component proportions were from 0.5% to 12% (

 <sub class="sub">j</sub> are chosen to describe the behavior of the formulations, which have compositions close to that of the best experiment obtained from preliminary work.
