<p class="p">Factors with a significance higher than or equal to 5% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were considered. Response variables of this experimental design were as follows: EE% (encapsulation efficiency) of RA (rosmarinic acid), CA (chlorogenic acid), AP (apigenin), EK (elsholtzia ketone), DK (dehydroelsholtzia ketone), and TPC (total phenolic content). The concentration of wall material compounds in liquid feeds was 20%, inlet temperature was 160 Â°C and spray flow feed rate 30 mL/min. These parameters were used as a constant in this experimental design. For each response variable the regression models were evaluated.
