For analysis a Waters 2695 chromatography system (Waters, Milford, CT, USA), equipped with a Waters 996 PDA detector was used. Data was collected and analyzed using the Empower-2 chromatographic manager system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). For determination of polyphenols, an ACE 5C

The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 μL. Absorption was measured at 330 nm. Quantification of phenolic compounds was performed using reference standards of apigenin, rosmarinic acid, and chlorogenic acid. The linear calibration curves were constructed (apigenin R
