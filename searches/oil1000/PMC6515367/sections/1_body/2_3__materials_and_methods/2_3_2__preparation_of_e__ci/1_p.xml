<p class="p">Before the extract preparation, 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> herbal material was grounded in a laboratory mill. Powdered material was then extracted with 70% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) ethanol in a conical flask by ultrasound-assisted extraction performed in an ultrasound bath (Bandelin electronic GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Berlin, Germany) at 25 °C for 30 min. These conditions were established as the best for the extraction of the main compounds from
