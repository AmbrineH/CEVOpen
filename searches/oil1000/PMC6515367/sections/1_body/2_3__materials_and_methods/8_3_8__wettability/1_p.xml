<p class="p">Wettability of the spray-dried powder was determined according to Antonio et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. A small amount (1 g) of spray-dried powder was poured into a beaker with 100 mL of purified water and left at room temperature without mixing. The time required for the powder particles to precipitate, to sink, or to become immersed and disappear from the surface of the water was used in a comparison of the extent of wettability between samples.
