The method based on the color change when Folin–Ciocalteau reagent reduced by sodium carbonate and phenolic compounds. A 100 mg of spray-dried powders were weighted and dispersed in 1 mL ethanol/acetic acid/water solution (20:8:42,

After that the mixture was filtered through a micro filter (0.45 µm). A 100 µL of sample and 2.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteau reagent were mixed in a tube and leave in the dark place for 5 min. A 2 mL of sodium carbonate solution was poured into the tube than mixed and leave in a dark place for 1 h at 25 °C. TPC was expressed as mg of equivalent gallic acid per gram of microcapsules. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm using a UV/VIS 1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
