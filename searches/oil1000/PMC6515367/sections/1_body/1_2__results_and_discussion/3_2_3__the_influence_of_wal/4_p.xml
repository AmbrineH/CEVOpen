<p class="p">The highest EE of RA (89.96%), CA (93.24%), AP (89.65%), EK (64.94%), DK (45.74%), and TPC (60.12%) were achieved when 0.5 g of sodium caseinate, 10 g of skim milk, 8.5 g of resistant-maltodextrin, and 1 g of beta-cyclodextrin were used as encapsulants for spray-drying (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). In all samples 02M, 05M, and 19M included the same amount of wall materials: 12 g of resistant-maltodextrin and 1 g of beta-cyclodextrin. Other wall material amounts varied from 0.5 g to 1 g of sodium caseinate and from 6 g to 6.5 g of skim milk. According to the results, higher amounts than 8 g of resistant-maltodextrin could impact the lower EE (%) of phenolic compounds, EK, and DK. Also, smaller amounts than 10 g of skim milk in the mixture of wall materials could result in lower EE (%) of active compounds.
