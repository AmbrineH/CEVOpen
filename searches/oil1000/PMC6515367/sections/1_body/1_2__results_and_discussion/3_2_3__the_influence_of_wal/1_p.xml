<p class="p">At the second experiment stage, the selection of an optimal ratio of wall materials in the liquid feed solution was carried out. Parameters for D-optimal mixture design in preparing liquid feed solution for spray-drying were prepared by using Design-Expert Version 9.0 software as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01461-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The regression coefficients, final equations are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01461-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Liquid feed solution contains four encapsulants: sodium caseinate, skim milk, resistant-maltodextrin, and beta-cyclodextrin. These encapsulants were chosen to be the variables toward the responses: EE of RA, CA, AP, EK, and DK. The total amount of wall material (a mixture of four encapsulants) was 20 g, the inlet temperature was 160 °C, the outlet temperature was 80–90 °C, and the spray flow feed rate was 30 mL/min.
