<p class="p">The obtained results showed that the optimal composition of 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> microcapsules has been determined as follows: 0.54 g of sodium caseinate, 10 g of skim milk, 8.96 g of resistant-maltodextrin, and 0.5 g of beta-cyclodextrin. All experimental values did not significantly differ from the predicted values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). According to the results, this composition of wall materials is more suitable for encapsulation of phenolics. EE (%) of RA, CA, and AP was more than 85%, which is higher than the EE of EK and DK, 67.38% and 35.12%, respectively. In order to obtain the highest EE values of ketones it is important to choose suitable conditions for spray-drying, such as temperature and feed flow. In the next stage of the study, it is necessary to optimize conditions of spray-drying to increase EE of ketones.
