<p class="p">The moisture content of spray-dried powders ranged from 3.71% ± 0.05% to 5.92% ± 0.08%. The moisture of spray-dried powders using four materials as encapsulating agents for spray-drying solution decreased by 1.2 times compared to when only gum arabic was used (7.6% ± 0.14%) (

The time required for the spray-dried powders to become completely wet ranged from 62 ± 0.35 to 105 ± 0.32 s and it was three times shorter when four materials for the spray-drying were used, compared to only using sodium caseinate (348 ± 2.83 s) as encapsulating agent (

Using solution which contains four materials for spray-drying, the solubility varied from 82.5% ± 0.03% to 99.8% ± 0.01% and it was approximately 2 times higher than only using beta-cyclodextrin (42.5% ± 0.49%) as encapsulating agent (

According to the results, better values of Carr index (from 24.44% ± 0.07% to 37.14% ± 0.03%) and Hausner ratio (from 1.324 ± 0.07 to 1.591 ± 0.03) were obtained by using four encapsulants for spray-drying rather than using, e.g., only sodium caseinate (44.44% ± 0.08% and 1.8 ± 0.07, respectively) (

Optimization was suitable to improve solubility and wettability of powders (get lower values tan using only one encapsulant for spray-drying).
