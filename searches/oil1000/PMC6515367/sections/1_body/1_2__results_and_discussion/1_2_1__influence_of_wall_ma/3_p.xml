 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. A high moisture content of powder can cause a stickiness in the particles. The moisture content of spray-dried powders ranged from 2.99% ± 0.07% to 7.6% ± 0.14%, and was the highest when wall material contained gum arabic (10%) and the lowest for maltodextrin (30%). The moisture content decreases with increasing the amount of wall material in liquid feed solution for spray-drying: maltodextrin 10–3.78% ± 0.18%, 20–3.28% ± 0.11%, 30–2.99% ± 0.07%; gum arabic 10–7.6% ± 0.14%, 20–6.7% ± 0.14%, 30–6.55% ± 0.11%; and resistant-maltodextrin 10–3.85% ± 0.05%, 20–3.54% ± 0.1%, 30–3.43% ± 0.09%. Our results are in line with the data of Ferrari et al. [

In this research, when a higher concentration of maltodextrin was used, a powder with a lower moisture content was obtained. According to our study, using beta-cyclodextrin as wall material, the moisture content in spray-dried powder increases: 10–4.31% ± 0.06%, 20–6.13% ± 0.08% and 30–6.45% ± 0.09%.
