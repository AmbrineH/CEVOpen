<p class="p">At the first stage of the experiment, the selection of the most suitable encapsulant agent for core material microencapsulation was carried out. Sodium caseinate, skim milk, resistant-maltodextrin, maltodextrin, gum Arabic, and beta-cyclodextrin were selected as potential wall materials. The concentration of encapsulating agents in liquid feed solution for spray-drying varied from 10% to 30%. In all experiments inlet temperature was 160 °C, the outlet temperature was 80–90 °C, and spray flow feed rate was 30 mL/min. The data in
