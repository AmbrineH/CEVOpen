<p class="p">The ability of the powder particles to overcome the surface tension between themselves and water or time required for the powder to become completely wet is called wettability [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The time required for the powders to become completely moist varied from 40 ± 4.95 to 348 ± 2.83 s. Shorter time was reached when beta-cyclodextrin 20% was used as a wall material and it was prolonged when sodium caseinate 20% was used. The wettability of the powder increased with increasing concentration of wall material. Higher concentrations (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall materials increased wettability (maltodextrin 189 &gt; 151 &gt; 139 s, beta-cyclodextrin 78 &gt; 40 &gt; 39 s, gum arabic 193 &gt; 157 &gt; 144 s, respectively). Opposite results were obtained by A-sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], that higher maltodextrin concentrations decrease wettability. Increasing skim milk concentrations (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) led to a significant decrease in wettability (46, 73, and 95 s, respectively). This can be explained by the fact that skim milk acts as a bulking agent that affects porous structure by making less porous powders.
