<p class="p">Maltodextrin is widely used as an encapsulant in spray-drying because it has high values of solubility in water and high glass transition temperature [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Higher concentrations (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall material influenced higher solubility of spray-dried powders (sodium caseinate 80.05% &gt; 80.9% &gt; 81.25%, skim milk 95% &gt; 95% &gt; 99.9%, respectively), however using beta-cyclodextrin in the same concentration range solubility decreases (55%, 45%, and 42.5%, respectively).
