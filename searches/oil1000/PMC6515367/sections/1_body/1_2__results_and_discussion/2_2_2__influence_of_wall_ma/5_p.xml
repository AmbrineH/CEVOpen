<p class="p">According to our results for the next stage of experiments, sodium caseinate, skim milk, beta-cyclodextrin, and resistant-maltodextrin were chosen. Sodium caseinate and skim milk are suitable for rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic acid, and apigenin microencapsulation because the EE of these active compounds was more than 50%. For EK and DK microencapsulation only sodium caseinate, skim milk, beta-cyclodextrin were suitable. Gum arabic and maltodextrin show low EE of these ketones.</p>
