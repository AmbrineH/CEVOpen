<p class="p">The DK EE of spray-dried powders ranged from 4.4% ± 0.24% to 88.9% ± 0.42% and was the highest when wall material contained beta-cyclodextrin (30%) and the lowest when resistant-maltodextrin (10%) was used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The EE of DK decreases with increasing concentration (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall material in liquid feed solution for spray-drying: skim milk 26.64%, 25.51%, 25.27%, maltodextrin 12.91%, 7.13%, (10% of wall material didn’t encapsulate DK), respectively.
