The TFC EE (%) increases when the wall material concentrations are in the range of 10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30% (using sodium caseinate (SCAS) and skim milk (SKIM)). The TFC EE (%) decreases when the concentration of wall material increases (for example, using maltodextrin (MD), gum arabic (GUM), and resistant-maltodextrin (RMD)) (
