<p class="p">The EE of RA increases with increasing concentration (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall material in liquid feed solution for spray-drying: skim milk 45.98%, 67.71%, 83.33%, gum arabic 24.89%, 62.47%, 96.36%, resistant-maltodextrin 17.69%, 40.56%, and 93.33%, respectively). However, the EE of RA decreases using sodium caseinate (81.33% &gt; 63.48% &gt; 52.71%) and maltodextrin (62.75% &gt; 61.25% &gt; 35.15%) as coating materials at the same range of concentrations (10%, 20%, and 30%). The CA EE of spray-dried powders varied from 4.07% ± 0.52% to 94.46% ± 0.4% and was the highest when wall material contained sodium caseinate (30%) and the lowest when gum arabic (30%) was used (

The EE of CA decreases with increasing concentration (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall material in liquid feed solution for spray-drying: maltodextrin 32.02%, 26.81%, 11.32%, gum arabic 4.93%, 4.19%, and 4.07%, respectively. The AP EE of spray-dried powders varied from 30.13 ± 0.69 to 99.31 ± 0.64% and was the highest when wall material contained skim milk (30%) and the lowest when resistant-maltodextrin (10%) was used (

The EE of AP increases with increasing concentration (10% &gt; 20% &gt; 30%) of wall material in liquid feed solution for spray-drying: maltodextrin 65.08%, 90.38%, 97.16%, resistant-maltodextrin 12.66%, 7.51%, and 98.2%, respectively. The EK EE of spray-dried powders varied from 10.29% ± 0.2% to 96.59% ± 0.4% and was the highest when wall material contained beta-cyclodextrin (10%) and the lowest when it contained resistant-maltodextrin (10%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Using sodium caseinate and skim milk in the concentration range of 10%, 20%, and 30%, EK EE increases accordingly—51.47, 77.27, 91.37 and 27.64, 41.17, 43.96. Gum arabic in all concentrations did not encapsulate EK.
