 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> ethanolic extract and essential oil microcapsules using GUM, SKIM, BCYC, MD, SCA, and RMD as encapsulating agents were obtained by spray-drying. The microcapsulesâ€™ morphologies were observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>). Analyzing the micrographs, the most common morphology of microcapsules was semi-spherical. There are two types of microparticle morphologies: particles with smooth surface and particles with a concave and folded surface.
