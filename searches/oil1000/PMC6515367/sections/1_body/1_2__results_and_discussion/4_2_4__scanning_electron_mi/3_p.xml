<p class="p">SKIM microparticles were semi-spherical and there were particles that looked compressed. Diameters of these particles varied from about 562 nm to 4.59 µm and more. MD microparticles showed more semi-spherical particles with smooth and wrinkled surfaces in diameters range from about 761 nm to 370 µm and more. In Diameters of SCA microparticles varied from about 1.06 nm to 2.81 µm and most of the particles were deeply wrinkled (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> show that RMD particles presented a different morphology when compared to particles spray-dried with other wall materials. Diameters of RMD microparticles varied from about 800 nm to 5.62 µm and more (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01461-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>). The majority of RMD microparticles had a semi-spherical appearance with smooth and less wrinkled surfaces which was important to confer a better encapsulation of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. ciliata</italic> extract. This may be due to the excellent film forming property by the RMD. The water evaporation rates observed in the spray-drying process is most likely the reason of morphological irregularities that have appeared on the surface of the microparticles. Lower inlet temperature of spray-drying process resulted in irregular microparticle form with shrunk, concave surfaces, while higher inlet temperature resulted in smoother, tighter microparticles [
