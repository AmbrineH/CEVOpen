The majority of spray-dried microparticles were spherical in shape, almost equal in size, and had a smooth surface without or with a few wrinkles on the surface. Diameters of microparticles varied from about 404 nm to 5.29 µm and more. Using four encapsulating agents improves smaller particles’ size and forms smooth surfaces. Using skim milk, sodium caseinate, beta-cyclodextrin, and resistant-maltodextrin in one encapsulating agent solution produced a smoother surface and spherical shape particles compared to when only one encapsulating agent for ethanolic extract encapsulation by spray-drying was used.
