<p class="p">The samples were filtered through a Teflon membrane 0.2 µm and introduced directly into the equipment. A Shimadzu liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, China) was used for the study. The chromatographic working conditions were: mobile phase acetonitrile and phosphate buffer pH 2.4 (70:30, 
 <italic class="italic">v/</italic>v), oven temperature of 25 °C, detector by diode array at 370 nm (200–400), flow at 0.9 mL/min., pressure of 14.1 μPa, injection volume of 20 μL, column of Uptisphere 5 0DB 708965 (RP-18). Relative abundance was determined according to area under curve (AUC). Finally, chemical compositions of each sample were subjected to the heat map for qualitative and quantitative comparison. Finally, average of retention time (Rt) for peaks was performed and integrations were used to carry out the hierarchical clustering analysis using the XLSTAT software, version 2018.5.53172. Pearson correlation was selected as a measure of similarity, and the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average.
