<p class="p">Total contents of phenols and flavonoids were determined. In the first case, total phenol content was calculated determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], using gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as the reference at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/mL. In addition, the total flavonoid content was carried out by the colorimetric method using aluminum chloride [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the reference substance at the concentrations of 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL. In each case, a linear calibration curve was constructed with absorbance measured with a spectrophotometer Rayleigh UV-1601 (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument Company, Beijing, China) at 715 nm. The total phenol and flavonoid contents (mg/mL, including standard deviations) were determined with respect to the reference calibration curves.
