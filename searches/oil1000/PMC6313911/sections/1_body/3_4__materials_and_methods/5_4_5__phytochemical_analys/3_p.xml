<p class="p">In order to corroborate qualitative chemical composition of the hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic> from different localities, a profile by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was also performed. Aluminum-backed silica gel TLC plates F 254 nm from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) were used and quercetin (98% purity, from Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard. The chromatography was carried out using as mobile phase: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol:acetic acid:water (65:25:10, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). The TLC plates were then sprayed with 5% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in ethanol and heated to approximately 105 Â°C until the appearance of spots or modification of the appearance of existing ones. In another system, TLC was revealed with aluminum chloride (Merck, Germany) at 5% in methanol. Finally, TLC plates were visualized under UV light at 254/365 nm.
