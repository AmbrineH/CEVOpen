For microscopic studies, free hand sections of leaves and stem were analyzed using optical microscopy (NOVEL, China) at 10Ã— magnification, which were previously hydrated and rinsed with sodium hypochlorite, colored with safranin 1% and fixed with glycerine gelatin. In parallel, photomicrographs were taken with the digital camera HDCE-50B (Alltion (Wuzhou) Co. Ltd., Guangxi, China).
