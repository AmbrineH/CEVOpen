<p class="p">The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was measured as described previously by Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], which determines the ability of the sample to reduce iron ferric (Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>) to ferrous (Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>). The determinations were carried out in a spectrophotometer Rayleigh UV-1601 (China) at 593 nm and concentration of FRAP was calculated from a linear equation obtained from a curve of vitamin C (purity 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) concentration vs absorbance. Different extract concentrations (ranging 25–40 μg/mL) were tested and equivalents μmol of vitamin C according to the standard curve of ascorbic acid (100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 μmol/L) were calculated. The experiment was carried out in triplicate and the results are expressed as vitamin C equivalents.
