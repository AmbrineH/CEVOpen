<p class="p">In parallel, the reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH; Sigma-Aldrich) radical to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazine was used for the radical-scavenging action of compounds containing –OH groups that decolorize the DPPH reagent [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Extracts were tested at different concentrations (ranging 25–50 μg/mL) and the absorbance was read at 517 nm in a spectrophotometer Rayleigh UV-1601 (China). The percentage inhibition of DPPH (% DPPH) staining was calculated by the following formula: % inhibition of the DPPH = (Abs control − Abs sample/Abs control) × 100. Results were expressed as mean and SD of medium inhibitory concentration (IC
