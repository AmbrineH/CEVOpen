<p class="p">The highest yield of soluble extractives was obtained for the 50% hydroalcoholic mixture, being higher in the PmC sample. In studies carried out by Cabrera et al., similar behavior was observed [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In the evaluations, a higher yield was obtained in extractions with hydroalcoholic mixture (22%); while extractions with ethanol and water extractives were smaller. Then, the main pharmacognostic parameters of the plant material were evaluated and corresponded to those reported in the literature for plant drugs [

In this sense, it is known that changes of plant composition are probably due to geographic conditions, season to collection, which could impact the observed differences [
