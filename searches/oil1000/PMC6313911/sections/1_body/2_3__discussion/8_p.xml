<p class="p">In the studied extracts, the presence of quercetin was confirmed, which reflects three important findings: (i) it could be a common compound present in 
 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic> independent of locality of cultivation, (ii) it can be used as marker component in different collections, and (iii) it is a metabolite with known medicinal value [

 <italic class="italic">P. matricarioides</italic>-derived products. However, the metabolite maps of the extracts showed the accumulation patterns of quercetin to be different, also suggesting the need for further bioactivity screening. In addition, a peak with RT of 4.87 min was observed in the three studied samples. The UV spectrum is characteristic of chlorogenic acid or a derivative. This compound exhibited peaks at 325, 300 (shoulder) and 250 nm [
