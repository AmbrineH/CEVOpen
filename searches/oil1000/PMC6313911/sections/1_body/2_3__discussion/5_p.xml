<p class="p">No differences were observed in the chemical composition determined by phytochemical screening in the evaluated samples. However, differences in the color intensity of some trials were observed, which could be related to different concentrations of functional groups. The results of the preliminary phytochemical screening are also in correspondence with those obtained by Cabrera et al. [
