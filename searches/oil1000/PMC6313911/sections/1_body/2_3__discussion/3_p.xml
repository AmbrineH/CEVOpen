<p class="p">The microscopic analysis of the leaves and stems of the plants from the three collection sites displayed the possible structural differences that could accompany this plant as functions of the environmental conditions in which it is developed. In addition, accurate data on the climatological data of each region could also be a direct influence. The three zones or areas selected in general are subject to the same macroclimatic conditions; however, the conditions of habitat or ecological niche differ from one another, and are aspects that can cause some variations in the internal morphology of the plant.</p>
