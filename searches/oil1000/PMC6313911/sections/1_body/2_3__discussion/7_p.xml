<p class="p">We then performed comparative analysis of the three extracts by HPLC, which is a versatile and very rapid tool that could be useful for chemotaxonomy, identification of the plant material, and to set up chemical fingerprints of studied extracts [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In addition, identification of phenolic compounds in medicinal plants is possible. The chromatograms displayed several compounds in the three extracts. Thus, the comparison of the chemical profiles of the extracts confirmed that the composition also depends on the geographical area, showing a wide profile of extracts from plants in the same country. Theses qualitative and quantitative differences were quickly assessed during the construction of related maps.
