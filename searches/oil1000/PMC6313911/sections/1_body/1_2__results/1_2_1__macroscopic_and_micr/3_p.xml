Sclerenchyma fibers are present which are more compact in PmI sections. It was possible to observe xylem (X) and phloem (F) formed by well-defined cells, with a similar appearance in PmB and PmC. The pith (M) formed by spherical cells of variable size was observed in the center, but they were larger in the samples of PmB. The longitudinal sections of the stems (
