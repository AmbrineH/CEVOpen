 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00110-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), pluricellular trichomes (PT) were observed, which were more abundant in the PmB sample. The epidermis (E) was presented with a stratum of cells, but thicker in the PmI sample. The chlorenchyma showed spherical cells of different sizes, presenting larger in the histological section of PmI. The vascular system (VS) was compact in the samples of PmB and PmC, while disperse characteristics were observed for PmI.
