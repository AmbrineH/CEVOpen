 <p> Maternal DHA intervention alters the FA composition in offspring heart and plasma. ( A, C): FA composition from the heart and plasma in developing pups nursed by mothers fed a control and 1% DHA diet, respectively. ( B, D): Ratios of DHA/ARA in the heart and plasma, respectively. FA composition was reported as percent of total FA content (g per 100 g). Each value represents the mean Â± SEM of eight and seven pups from control and 1% DHA diet groups, respectively. Analysis of FA using one way-ANOVA indicated significance between control and 1% DHA diet group. * p &lt; 0.05. Analysis of DHA/ARA ratios using two-tail unpaired t-test indicated significance between DHA group and controls. **** p &lt; 0.0001. </p>
