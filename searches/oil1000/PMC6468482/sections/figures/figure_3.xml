  <p class="p">Maternal DHA intervention alters the levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE and 4-HHE/4-HNE ratios in offspring heart and plasma. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>): Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in heart and plasma of pups nursed by control and 1% DHA mothers, respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>): Ratios of 4-HHE/4-HNE in hearts and plasma, respectively. Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE were measured using LC-MS/MS and normalized to tissue weight. Each value represents the mean Â± SEM of eight and seven pups from control and 1% DHA diet groups, respectively. Analysis using two-tail unpaired t-test indicated significance between DHA group and controls. ***
