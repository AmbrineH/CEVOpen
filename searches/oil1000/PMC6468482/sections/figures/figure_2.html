 <p> Maternal DHA intervention alters the levels of -hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 4-HHE/4-HNE ratios in offspring brain regions. ( A, C, E, G): Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in different brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively) from pups nursed by control and 1% DHA mothers. ( B, D, F, H): Ratios of 4-HHE/4-HNE in different brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively). Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in brain regions were measured using LC-MS/MS as described in text, and normalized to tissue weight. Each value represents the mean Â± SEM of eight and seven pups from control and 1% DHA diet groups, respectively. Analysis using two-tail unpaired t-test indicated significance between DHA group and controls. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. </p>
