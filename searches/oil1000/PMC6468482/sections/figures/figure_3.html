 <p> Maternal DHA intervention alters the levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE and 4-HHE/4-HNE ratios in offspring heart and plasma. ( A, C): Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in heart and plasma of pups nursed by control and 1% DHA mothers, respectively. ( B, D): Ratios of 4-HHE/4-HNE in hearts and plasma, respectively. Levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE were measured using LC-MS/MS and normalized to tissue weight. Each value represents the mean Â± SEM of eight and seven pups from control and 1% DHA diet groups, respectively. Analysis using two-tail unpaired t-test indicated significance between DHA group and controls. *** p &lt; 0.001; **** p &lt; 0.0001. </p>
