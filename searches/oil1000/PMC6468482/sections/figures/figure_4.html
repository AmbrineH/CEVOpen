 <p> Maternal DHA intervention alters the fatty acid (FA) composition in offspring brain regions. ( A, C, E, G): FA composition from different brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively) of developing pups nursed by mothers fed a control and 1% DHA diet. ( B, D, F, H): Ratios of DHA/ arachidonic acid (ARA) in different brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively). FA composition was reported as percent of total FA content (g per 100 g). Each value represents the mean Â± SEM of eight and seven pups from control and 1% DHA diet groups, respectively. Analysis of FA using one way-ANOVA indicated significance between 1% DHA diet group and controls. * p &lt; 0.05. Analysis of DHA/ARA ratios using two-tail unpaired t-test indicated significance between DHA group and controls. **** p &lt; 0.0001. </p>
