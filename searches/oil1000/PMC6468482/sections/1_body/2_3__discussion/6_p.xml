<p class="p">Whether maternal DHA-mediated the increase in 4-HHE may play a role in modulating neurophysiological function is not known and needs further investigation. In studies with cell culture, lipid peroxidation products have been shown to offer adaptive benefits, and depending on the conditions, these compounds may undergo a transition from a hormetic stage to a cytotoxic stage [

 <xref rid="B41-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. It is possible that the increase in 4-HHE together with changes in the (n-3)/(n-6) FA ratios results in alteration of the redox homeostasis in the brain and heart. In a study by Zhang et al., supplementation of neurons in culture with DHA could significantly reduce neuronal death, induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation, and the protective effect was attributed to nuclear factor-like-2 (Nrf2) activation and induction of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an important anti-oxidative enzyme [

Mice fed with a fish oil-enhanced diet showed resistance to ischemia as compared with mice fed with a regular diet, and together with increase an in 4-HHE, the protection was also associated with upregulation of Nrf2 and production of HO-1. In the study by Nakagawa et al., adult mice fed a fish oil-containing diet also showed increases in expression of HO-1 mRNA in different organs [

Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence for maternal DHA to induce 4-HHE and subsequently provide adaptive changes through activation of the Nrf2 pathway. However, whether these changes play a role in reversing the neurobehavioral changes observed in the gene/stress autism animal model remains to be further examined [
