<p class="p">In the present study, an LC-MS/MS protocol was used to determine levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE, and gas chromatography to determine FA composition in brain regions, as well as in heart and plasma, of weanling pups born from and nursed by dams fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 1% DHA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Maternal supplementation with DHA resulted in significant increases in DHA and concomitant decreases in ARA, as well as increases in DHA/ARA ratios in all pup brain regions analyzed. However, significant increases in levels of 4-HHE, a peroxidation product of DHA, were observed mainly in the cortex and hippocampus and not in the striatum and cerebellum. Furthermore, although substantial levels of 4-HNE were present in all pup brain regions, this peroxidation product was apparently not altered by maternal dietary supplement of DHA. In our previous study, maternal DHA supplementation also resulted in an increase in DHA and decrease in ARA levels in the total pup brain [

Therefore, the effect of maternal DHA or n-3 PUFA to cause the increase in DHA in pup brain is not surprising, but the fact that this dietary regimen can suppress ARA, as well as n-6 PUFA is intriguing and not well understood. Recent studies demonstrated that DHA and ARA in membrane phospholipids actively undergo “deacylation-reacylation” reactions, and free ARA is released largely through the cytosolic phospholipase A
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (cPLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and free DHA is released through iPLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the cPLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pathway produces ARA which is linked to metabolites that are inflammatory, whereas the iPLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mediated production of DHA is linked to metabolites that are pro-resolving. Based on this hypothesis, increases in DHA and decreases in ARA in pups, due to maternal DHA supplementation may alter the cycle for deacylation/reacylation of membrane phospholipids and subsequently enhance the protective events and suppress the inflammatory events. Changes in these FAs may be the underlying factor for promoting neurite outgrowth and an increase in synaptic proteins, which in turn, may have an impact on learning and memory during brain development [
