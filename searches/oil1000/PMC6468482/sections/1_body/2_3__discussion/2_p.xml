<p class="p">Endogenous levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE are present in all brain regions as well as in the heart and plasma. Maternal DHA was shown to increase the 4-HHE levels in specific brain regions without alteration of 4-HNE levels. These results are in agreement with our earlier study with cell model indicating differences in peroxidation activities for DHA and ARA, and increase in 4-HHE upon addition of DHA, but increase in 4-HNE due mainly to stimulation of cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pathway associated with the increase in cPLA

Further studies are needed to examine whether maternal DHA alters the oxylipins in pup brains and investigate whether the enhanced production of 4-HHE may impact brain development and the neuropsychological functions of the offspring.
