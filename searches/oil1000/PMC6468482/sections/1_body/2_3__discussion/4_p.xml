<p class="p">Our original goal to include analysis of pup plasma was to test whether changes in FAs and lipid peroxidation products in this easily accessible body fluid could serve as biomarkers for gauging effects of maternal DHA on the pup brain. Analysis of FAs in pup plasma indicated a large increase in DHA and a decrease in ARA. Interestingly, plasma from these pups not only showed large increases in 4-HHE, but also a significant decrease in the levels of 4-HNE. These results are in agreement with those reported by Nakagawa et al., who also observed significant increases in 4-HHE and decreases in 4-HNE levels in the plasma of adult mice fed with a fish oil-containing diet for 1 and 3 weeks [

However, the underlying mechanism for the decrease in 4-HNE in plasma but not in brain and heart remains to be elusive and not well understood. Nevertheless, despite that changes in plasma are closer to those in the heart than in the brain, analysis of FA and lipid peroxidation products in the plasma may provide useful information reflecting effects of dietary DHA on other body compartments/organs.
