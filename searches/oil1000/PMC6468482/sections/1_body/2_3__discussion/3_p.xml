<p class="p">In contrast to the brain, analysis of FA composition in the heart muscle of pups exposed to maternal DHA indicated a large increase in DHA and a significant decrease in ARA, as well as other n-6 PUFAs. Here, the increase in DHA is linked to a large increase in 4-HHE, but similar to results in the brain, maternal DHA did not alter the 4-HNE levels in the heart. The large increase in levels of 4-HHE in the DHA pup heart clearly shows the ability for dietary DHA to modify membrane phospholipids and peroxidation products in the myocardial tissue. Since myocardial tissue is known to comprise of a large number of mitochondria, it is reasonable to surmise that the changes in the membrane FA and lipid peroxidation products in mitochondria may play a role in energy metabolism, which in turn may impact myocardial function [
