<p class="p">Analysis of FAs in plasma indicated high levels (14.6%) of 18:2 (n-6) but low levels (less than 1%) of 22:6 (n-3) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>C). However, plasma from the DHA pups showed a large increase in 22:6 (n-3) (from 0.8 to 6.5%) and a non-significant decrease in 20:4 (n-6) (from 4.3 to 2.3%) compared to the control pups. The large increase in 22:6 (n-3) was also marked by decreases in other FAs, e.g., a significant decrease (11.9 to 6.9%) in 18:1 (n-9). The DHA/ARA ratios in plasma were 14.9-fold higher in the DHA group compared to the control group (
