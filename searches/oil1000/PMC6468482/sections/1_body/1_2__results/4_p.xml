 <xref rid="B30-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], FAs in the brain tissue are characterized by low levels (less than 1%) of 18:2 (n-6) and higher levels (~10%) of 20:4 (n-6) and 22:6 (n-3). Analysis of FAs in all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum indicated small but significant increases in 22:6 (n-3) and decreases in 20:4 (n-6) and other n-6 FAs in the DHA pups as compared to the control group (
