<p class="p">The levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE were measured in different regions of the brain in the developing pups nursed by mothers given the control and DHA diets (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8 and 7 pups), respectively. For analysis of brain regions, the left cerebral cortex and left striatum were used but the left and right hippocampi were combined, and the cerebellum was not separated. For the initial analysis of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in the cortex, a tissue weight:water ratio of 1:5 (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was used for processing the tissue. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A, levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in the cerebral cortex in control pups were 3528 ± 191 and 1146 ± 53 ng/g tissue, respectively (mean ± SEM), and 4531 ± 305 and 1050 ± 45 ng/g tissue in the DHA group, respectively. As for the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, we used a tissue weight:water ratio of 1:8 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C,E,G). These results also show no significant changes in levels of 4-HNE in any of the brain regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A,C,E,G). A significant increase in 4-HHE/4-HNE ratio was observed in the cortex and striatum of DHA pups as compared with control pups (
