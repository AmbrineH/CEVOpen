<p class="p">The high abundance of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) in the phospholipids in brain and retina has led to an interest in the search for its functional roles in health and diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. DHA, a fatty acid with six carbon-carbon double bonds, is particularly important during brain development, as there is a “DHA accretion spurt” during the late gestational period, a time of rapid neurogenesis [
 <xref rid="B2-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. There is strong support for the role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as essential nutrients for the brain [
 <xref rid="B3-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and mothers with low intake of n-3 PUFAs may show impairment in neurogenesis and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring, including increased risk of autism [

 <xref rid="B5-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Maternal consumption of seafood and DHA supplementation during pregnancy was shown to improve behavior in offspring [

Despite positive results with animal models, studies with DHA supplementation on children with autism spectrum disorder have not provided consistent results. One possible explanation is due in part to delayed diagnosis of the disorder, and recommendation of n-3 PUFA treatment at a time too late in development to have an obvious positive impact [
