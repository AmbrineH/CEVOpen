<p class="p">Since understanding the mechanism(s) whereby dietary DHA offers beneficial effects to the human brain is still elusive, recent studies have resorted to answering this question using animal models. There is evidence that maternal diets enriched in n-3 PUFAs can promote neuronal development and synaptic function, alter mental activities, and even modify contents of neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin, and their metabolites [

 <xref rid="B14-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Other studies support the ability for DHA to mediate the resolution of inflammation through the production of lipid mediators, such as resolvins and neuroprotectins [

 <xref rid="B16-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In a gene/stress mouse model in which autistic behavior was associated with maternal deletion of one copy of the serotonin transporter gene [

 <xref rid="B18-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In fact, the relative deficiency of DHA during pregnancy was sufficient to cause autism-associated behaviors in the pups regardless of whether or not maternal stress was present during pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B18-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In an additional study, dietary DHA administered to mice exposed to a viral mimetic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid, during the gestational period, was shown to alleviate autism-associated behavior in pups [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Taken together, these studies are in agreement with the potential beneficial effects of dietary DHA to ameliorate neurobehavioral deficits, due to maternal stress or insults.
