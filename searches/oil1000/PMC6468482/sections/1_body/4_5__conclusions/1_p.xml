<p class="p">In summary, our study clearly demonstrated that maternal DHA supplementation altered FA composition together with increases of 4-HHE levels in specific brain regions. In addition, these changes were rather exaggerated in the heart and plasma of weanling pups. Expectedly, similar changes in lipid peroxidation products may occur in other tissues/body organs. In future studies, it will be important to investigate whether such changes are associated with specific cell types or sub-regions, and whether the changes in peroxidation products reflect alterations of redox activity, as well as subsequent behavioral and cognitive functions in the brain. In addition, since changes were resulted from introducing dietary DHA to pregnant mothers and throughout gestation and lactation period, it may be of interest to perform future studies to test effects of DHA supplement to dams during gestation or lactation period.</p>
