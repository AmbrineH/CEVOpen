<p class="p">Brain and heart samples were weighed and homogenized for 5 min in 5 or 8-fold volumes of HPLC water using a bullet blender (Next Advance, Inc., Averill Park, NY, USA) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B44-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,100× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. A brief protocol for extraction and analysis of 4-HHE and 4-HNE from brain, heart and plasma is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00040-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out as described earlier [

 <xref rid="B45-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. An aliquot of supernatant was added to an equal volume of internal standard (4-HHE-d
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 1000 ng/mL), and acetonitrile (0.5 mL) containing 1% formic acid was added to the mixture. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using a Phree
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> cartridge. 4-HHE, 4-HNE and 4-HHE-d
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were derivatized by adding 200 µL of acidified 1,3-cyclohexanedione reagent at 60 °C for 1 h. The derivatized 4-HHE and 4-HNE were desalted using a C18 SPE cartridge and the eluate evaporated to dry. An aliquot of the reconstituted solution was injected into a Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> derivatives, respectively. MassLynx software (v4.1, Waters) was used for all data acquisition. A summary of the method validation for 4-HHE and 4-HNE is shown in
