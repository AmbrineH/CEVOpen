<p class="p">FA analyses of plasma and tissues were carried out by direct transesterification without prior extractions as described by Lepage and Roy [
 <xref rid="B43-metabolites-09-00040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Briefly, small aliquots (i.e., 0.1 mL) of tissue homogenates or plasma were combined with 1 mL of methanol-benzene (3:2) containing 0.1 mg of an internal standard (C17:0 methyl ester). Then 1 mL of freshly prepared acetyl chloride-methanol (5:100,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was added to the sample mixture in a glass test tube which was sealed tightly with a teflon-lined screw cap and subjected to methanolysis at 100 °C for 1 h. The samples were then cooled to room temperature, 1 mL of double-distilled water and 1 mL of hexane was added, and followed by vigorous mixing. After brief centrifugation to speed phase separation, the upper hexane layer was separated from the aqueous phase with a glass Pasteur pipette into a pre-rinsed conical glass tube through another Pasteur pipette filled with anhydrous sodium sulfate granules. Hexane was evaporated under nitrogen gas and the residue was resuspended in 100 µL of heptane. The sample was injected into the gas chromatography system. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7809A) equipped with a 60 m, 0.25 mm I.D., and 0.15-μm film DB-23 column. GC conditions were a helium flow rate of 1 mL/min with an initial temperature of 140 °C held for 5 min. The column temperature was then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and held at 250 °C for 15 min. FAs are identified by comparison of retention times using a variety of commercial standards. FA concentrations are reported as percent of total FA content (g per 100 g).
