<p class="p">Adult female C57BL/6J mice at age 6â€“8 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), and were fed the control diet for at least two weeks for habituation in the vivarium. Starting 2 weeks before breeding and during the entire time from breeding, through gestation and lactation, dams were fed one of two commercially-prepared mouse/rodent diets. The control diet (modified AIN-93G #103619) and an experimental diet containing 1% DHA (#103598) from Dyets Inc. (Bethlehem, PA, USA) were prepared according to the published guidelines from the American Institute of Nutrition (AIN). The composition of the control and 1% DHA diet is described in detail in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-09-00040" class="xref">Supplemental Table S3</xref>. The control diet contained no preformed DHA, but did contain sufficient amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) to meet normal brain DHA requirements [

Both diets were stabilized against auto-oxidation by the addition of a potent synthetic antioxidant (0.02 g tertiary-butylhydroquinone/100 g fat). The DHA source used in this study (i.e., DHASCO algal oil) contained small amounts of other long-chain n-3 PUFA ethyl esters, and was provided as a generous gift from DSM Nutritional Products, (Columbia, MD, USA). Fatty acid compositions of the control and experimental diets are shown in
