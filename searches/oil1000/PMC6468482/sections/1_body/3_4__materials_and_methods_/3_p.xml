<p class="p">Dietary treatments were initiated 2 weeks prior to breeding and maintained throughout gestation and lactation. At the time of weaning (21-days), 8 pups from two litters from dams fed the control diet and 7 from one litter from a dam fed the DHA diet were used. Body weight (mean ± SD) from controls and DHA pups were 8.0 ± 1.1 g (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5) and 8.5 ± 0.4 g (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 7), respectively. Animals were anaesthetized with isofluorane, and blood was obtained by heart puncture. The brains were dissected to obtain left and right cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum, and stored at −80 °C. In addition, the perfused hearts were removed and stored at -80 °C. Terminal blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture following CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> asphyxiation, using heparin as an anticoagulant. The blood was centrifuged at 16,100× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min to obtain plasma and frozen at −80 °C until use. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee (#8945), and performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines.
