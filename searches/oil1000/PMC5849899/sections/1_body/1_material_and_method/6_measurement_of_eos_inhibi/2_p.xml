<p class="p">PDB medium was prepared in accordance with Difco method (Difco Laboratories, 1984). Erlenmeyer flasks containing a 3‐day culture of fungus were kept in incubator at 28°C for 10 days, and their contents were evacuated in preweighed filter paper that had been put in a desiccator. After complete drawl of fluid, filter paper containing fungal hyphae were transferred to 40°C vacuum oven. Then, the initial weight of filter paper was subtracted from filter paper containing fungus, and dry weight of fungus hyphae was found. Comparison of the hyphae weight of the test sample with the weight of fungus in positive control sample indicated the effect of the tested EOs in inhibiting the fungal growth. After separating the solid part, the permeate was excluded for measuring aflatoxin B
