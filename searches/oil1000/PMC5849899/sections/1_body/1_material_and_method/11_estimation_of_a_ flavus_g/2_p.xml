<p class="p">For estimation of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth, using a homogenizer, 20 g of cheese samples were mixed with 90 ml of distilled water for 30 s. A serial dilution of the sample were prepared and cultured in a PDA media for 3 days of incubation at 28°C and the number of colony‐forming units (&lt;150 cfu) were enumerated and multiplied by its dilatation rate to calculate the number of colonies per gram of sample.
