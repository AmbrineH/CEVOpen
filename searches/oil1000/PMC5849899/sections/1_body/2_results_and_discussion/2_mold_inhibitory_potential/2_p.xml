<p class="p">The results of the inhibitory potential of thyme and clove EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth and against aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> production by 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> in PDA medium are shown in Tables

 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>. As it can be inferred from Tables 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> that clove EO completely prevented fungal growth and showed inhibition of 100% at 200 ppm, while at the same concentration thyme EO showed inhibition of 86.7% and for complete inhibitory effect, 600 ppm of thyme EO was needed. Therefore, clove EO had stronger inhibitory potential than thyme EO for prevention of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth. In a similar study, Mehrota et al. (2011) reported MIC of clove EO for 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as 0.25 μg/ml and in another study, Kumar et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3557-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) reported that the thyme EO completely inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> at concentration of 700 ppm.
