<p class="p">Inhibition of enzymatic browning is the most important concern in the mushroom's industry. As the food industry tends to decrease the use of chemical preservatives in food products, TG coating contained each essential oils could be considered as a potential source for shelf‐life extension of cold‐stored mushroom. TZ and TS treatments slowed down respiration rate, postponed cap opening, and SSC addition compared with gum‐coated, M‐treated, and control mushrooms. Furthermore, TS5 showed greater influence to inhibit discoloration of button mushrooms. Consequently, these natural products have promising effect to protect the quality and safety of button mushroom. TZ and TS coatings could prevent enzymatic browning through inhibition the activities of PPO and POD, increasing PAL activity during the storage time.</p>
