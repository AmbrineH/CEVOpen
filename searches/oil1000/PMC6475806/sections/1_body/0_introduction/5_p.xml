 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). These researches have revealed that essential oils (EOs) and extracts of various herbs and spices could be used as natural food preservers due to their antimicrobial acting. Like other biopolymers, Tragacanth gum is known as an appropriate carrier for natural antimicrobial and antioxidant complexes (Taban, Rahimi, Saharkhiz, Hadian, &amp; Zomorodian,
