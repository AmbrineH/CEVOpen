<p class="p">A substitutable way for postponing ripening and alleviating postharvest decay of fruit is achieved by application of natural products (Tripathi &amp; Dubey,

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, moisture, and solute movement has been revealed to expand the postharvest life of fruit and vegetables, increase the water barrier, inhibit microbial contamination, maintain flavor, reduce the degree of shrinkage distortion, and retard fat oxidation (Ali, Maqbool, Ramachandran, &amp; Alderson,

 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Fruit quality protection has been achieved using several edible coatings, such as chitosan in fresh‐cut strawberry (Campaniello, Bevilacqua, Sinigaglia, &amp; Corbo,
