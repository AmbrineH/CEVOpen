<p class="p">Button mushrooms were gathered from a local farm in Shiraz, Iran. Mushrooms were selected from the similar flower and zone of the shed so as to reduce probable alteration affected by cultivation and environment. During one hour of harvesting, the mushrooms were conveyed to the test center and then kept in dimness at 4 ± 1°C and 90% relative humidity (RH). Mushrooms having good physical shape without any damage were selected to be used in the experiments.</p>
