<p class="p">Polyphenol oxidase (EC 1.10.3.2) activity was investigated using incubating 0.5 ml of enzyme extract in 2.5 ml of buffered substrate (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH = 6.4, and 50 mM catechol), then detecting the change of absorbance at 398 nm. The quantity of enzyme caused 0.01 increases in absorbance per minute under the specified conditions defines one unit of PPO activity. The specific PPO activity was represented as U/mg protein.</p>
