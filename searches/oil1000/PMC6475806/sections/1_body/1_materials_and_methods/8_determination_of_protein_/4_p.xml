<p class="p">Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) measured spectrophotometrically using the substrate trans‐cinnamic acid at 290 nm. Three ml of the reaction mixture, containing 0.8 ml supernatant and 50 mM 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>‐phenylalanine in sodium borate buffer (200 mM, pH = 8.8), was incubated at 37°C; after 90 min, the reaction was interrupted by ice water. The amount of enzyme caused 0.01 absorbance rise in 1 hr under the assay conditions defined as one unit of PAL activity. The specific PAL activity was expressed as U/mg protein.
