<p class="p">Peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) activity was analyzed by determining the absorbance of guaiacol. 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 6.0), 5 mM guaiacol, 5 mM H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and 50 μl of tissue extract constructed the reaction mixture. One unit of POD activity was distinguished as the quantity of enzyme that leads to change of 0.01 absorbance per minute at 470 nm under the specified conditions. The specific POD activity was defined as U/mg protein.
