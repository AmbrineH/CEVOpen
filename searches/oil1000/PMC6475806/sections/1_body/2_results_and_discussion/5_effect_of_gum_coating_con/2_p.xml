<p class="p">The activity of PPO increased during the storage period. PPO activity of control mushrooms increased swiftly without peaks and was considerably greater than samples coated with TG and TG containing essential oils (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). TG coatings might be slightly permeable especially to oxygen, thus preventing PPO to access to oxygen. Browning has been studied in other fruits, and discoloration correlated well with PPO activity. The inhibition of the PPO activity by coating fruits and vegetables was reported by numerous investigators: chitosan coating on litchi fruit (Jiang, Li, &amp; Jiang, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), carrageenan coating on fresh‐cut banana (Bico, Raposo, Morais, &amp; Morais, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and different edible coatings on fresh‐cut “Royal Gala” apple (Bertrand, Raposo, Morais, &amp; Morais, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the present study, a high activity of PPO leads to a dark and unpleasant appearance of mushrooms. This result is in a good agreement with those reported by the above researchers. Here, there exist associations among the PPO activity and the color parameters in mushrooms; enhancing the PPO activity leads to the decrease in L* values and the increase in BI, indicating the dependency of enzymatic browning reactions to the PPO. In general, PPO acceleration the monophenols (monophenolase) hydroxylation and the oxidation of 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>‐diphenols into 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>‐quinones (diphenolase). Therefore, in the presence of oxygen, polymerization and creation of the unwanted brown pigments took place (Amin, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In general, treatments with essential oils prompt a decrease in the activity of PPO. The studies conducted by Amin (

 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) in fumigation of button mushroom with clove, cinnamaldehyde, and thyme essential oils show similar trends observed in our studies and those reported by several previous investigators. Compared to the control and M samples, those treated by TG containing essential oils preserved more ascorbic acid content (Data not shown). This may be attributed to the pH lowering action of ascorbic acid particularly at high concentration, which decreases the pH below the optimum value in turn inhibiting the catalytic action of PPO (Sapers,
