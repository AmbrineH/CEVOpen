<p class="p">Soluble solids content enhancement was gradual during storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The control and MS samples exposed the highest SSC; it extended 7.80 and 7.47°Brix, compared with 5.80, 5.71, 5.53, 5.75, 5.69, 5.46, 5.82, and 5.58°Brix in TZ1‐, TZ5‐, TZ10‐, TS1‐, TS5‐, TS10‐, TM, and gum‐coated mushrooms (T), respectively. The observed surge in SSC is a sign of high respiration rate and retarding the senescence process (Jafri, Jha, Bunkar, &amp; Ram, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Another factor contributed to SSC increase in aged mushroom might be the cell wall polysaccharides and hemicellulose solubilization (Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The increase in SSC of TZ10 and TS10 samples was slower and more gradual than the other samples. The coatings provided a promising semi‐permeable film on the surface of the fruit, adjusting the interior atmosphere by decreasing O

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and suppressing production of ethylene. The synthesis and use of metabolites consequences lower SSC, due to the slower hydrolysis of carbohydrates to sugars, decelerated by decreased respiration rates (Ali et al.,
