<p class="p">In all treatments, pattern of POD activity was similar during 16 days of storage, reaching a peak and then declined. The POD activities in TZ‐ and TS‐coated mushrooms were significantly lower than that in C (Figure

Unpleasant quality alterations, such as discoloration, off‐flavor, and nutritional destruction through handling, transportation, packaging, processing, and storage of fruit and vegetables, are consequences of enzymatic browning. These reactions resulted mostly from enzymes such as peroxidase (Mousavizadeh, Sedaghathoor, &amp; Khorami, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The POD association with enzymatic browning and antioxidant defense has been revealed by former investigation (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The increase in peroxidase is a sign of fruit quality deterioration and is relevant to the enzymatic browning process because

 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The quality features and mushroom decay may be affected by different enzymatic changes in chemical constituents. Also, POD could affect odor and taste and deteriorate eating and nutritional qualities of mushrooms (Baardseth, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>; Fasidi &amp; Kadiri, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). For that reason, it is required to inactivate the peroxidase enzyme to minimize deterioration.
