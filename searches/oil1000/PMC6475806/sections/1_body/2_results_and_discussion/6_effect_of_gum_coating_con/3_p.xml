<p class="p">It is acceptable that edible coatings practice as protective barrier on the surface of fresh product, diminish oxygen supply, slow down ripening and senescence, and, subsequently, postpone browning of fruits and vegetables. Several preservation methods, based on chitosan coating (Eissa, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and alginate coating (Jiang, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), restricted activities of POD. In addition, application of essential oils resulted in the decrease in the peroxidase enzyme activity, which may account for the inhibition of the mushroom browning. Alikhani, Sharifani, Azizi, Hemati, and Mousavizadeh. (
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) reported the value of natural essential oils in the decrease in activity of the peroxidase enzyme of fruits and vegetables. Mousavizadeh et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) demonstrated that antioxidative properties of essential oils can lead to peroxidase activity reduction in white and red cabbage. In this study, gum coating‚Äêimpregnated EOs reduced POD activity of samples. Thus, it appears that coating influence on browning inhibition is through extenuating oxygen supply and inhibitory properties on POD activity.
