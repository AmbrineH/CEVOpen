<p class="p">Despite PPO, PAL activities of all samples decreased continuously during storage (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). PAL is the major enzyme in the biosynthesis of varieties of phenylpropanoid compounds, such as simple phenols, anthocyanin, flavonoid, and lignin (Hiratsuka et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Ju, Yuan, Lieu, &amp; Xin, 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). It is stated that the accumulation of phenols and anthocyanins equated the PAL activity enhancement in some fruits (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Thus, PAL activity was studied in this paper to examine the possible response to TG coating containing EOs. Unlike, Eissa (
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) who reported cationic charge of chitosan caused protein binding and chitosan coating‐treated fresh‐cut mushroom inhibited the increase in PAL activity. Gum coating containing EOs induced increasing in PAL activity compared to control and M samples. It is conceivable that essential oils exhibit positive influence on plant secondary metabolites and motivating biosynthesis of phenolic and anthocyanin compounds by promoting PAL activity (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). TZ10, TZ5, TS10, and TS5 were more effective than other treatments in enhancing PAL activity.
