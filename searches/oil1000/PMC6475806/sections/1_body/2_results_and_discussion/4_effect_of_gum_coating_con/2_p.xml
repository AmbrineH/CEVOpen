<p class="p">After 16‐day storage, the proportion of opened caps mushrooms increased in all samples (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31000-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Control (C) and M‐treated samples had higher opened caps mushrooms, 82.2% and 80.0%, respectively. Over the same period, the percentage of opened caps mushrooms coated with TZs, TSs, and T were in the range 66.7%–75.6%. According to Jiang (
 <xref rid="fsn31000-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), mushroom cap opening leads to increased water loss, which in turn leads to mushroom dryness. Cohesive forces of water and other hydrophilic molecules, such as proteins responsible for the well position of the caps and veil in mushrooms, diminished over the storage, as a result of water loss increment. TG coating alone and in combination with each of the essential oils attenuated water loss, the cap opening of mushrooms was lower, and the least changes (66.7%) were related to mushrooms coated with TZ10.
