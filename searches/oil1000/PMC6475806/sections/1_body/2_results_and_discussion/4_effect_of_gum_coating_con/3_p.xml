Based on the assessment given by the sensory panel members, the control and MS failed to be acceptable following 16 days of storage. Over the same period of storage, mushrooms coated with Tragacanth gum and essential oils did not display any unsuitable characteristics and received an overall acceptability of about 2.17 from the panelists. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TZ5 and TS5 in delaying mushroom appearance deterioration. Jiang et al. (
