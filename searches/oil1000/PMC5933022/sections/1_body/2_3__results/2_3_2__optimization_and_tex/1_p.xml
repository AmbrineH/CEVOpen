<p class="p">The experimental design conducted the set of component mixtures for the oleogels with 0.1% essential oil of thyme formulations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Evaluation of mechanical properties by texture analyzer was performed as response. Back extrusion test determines firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency and shows what force (g) is achieved. All parameters of the oleogels increased linearly with the increase in the gelator, colloidal silica concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Formulations numbers 1, 2, and 3 contained lowest amount of gelator; accordingly, the force used for the determination of texture parameters was up to 250 g. Another group of formulations contained 6.75% of colloidal silica; the texture parameters were of medium values; used force was up to 800 g. Formulations with the highest amount of gelator needed higher force (up to 1400 g) to determinate firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency. Mechanical properties of oleogel depend on the gelator concentration: firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency increased with the increase in the colloidal silica amount. Index of viscosity in all determinations varied from 19.12 ± 0.6 to 89.99 ± 4.5 g and did not show high correlation with amount of oleogel components.
