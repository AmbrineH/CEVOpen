<p class="p">MIC of thyme oil of 0.25% was observed on the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans </italic>strain on solid medium and colonial morphology differed from control, especially in size, and the smallest colonies were detected in the presence of thyme oil with concentration of 0.125% [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Concentration of thymol in the essential oil varies from 20% to 54% in all species of thyme and
 <italic class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris</italic> as well. Plenty of results of biological activity dependence on concentrations of active substances are published. According to the results of quantitative analysis of oleogel, which demonstrated decreasing concentration of active ingredients, and antimicrobial test results of this study, it was decided to formulate oleogels with 0.1% of essential oil of thyme.
