<p class="p">The texture profile analysis of the formulated oleogels was conducted using a TA.XT.plus (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Godalming, Surrey, UK) texture analyzer. Back extrusion test was performed. The back extrusion rig (A/BE) is comprised of a sample container that is centrally located beneath a disc plunger. The disc plunger performs a compression test that extrudes the product up and around the edge of the disc. This test measures the consistency of viscous food products and semisolid pharmaceutical or cosmetic products. When a trigger force of 5 g has been achieved, the disc plunger begins to deform the sample to a specified distance (5 mm) after which the probe returns to its starting position. The maximum force represented as a peak on the graph measures firmness; the higher the value, the firmer the sample (

The area under the positive part of the graph indicates sample consistency (work done to hardness 1); the higher the value, the thicker and the higher the consistency of the sample. As the probe returns to its starting position, the initial lifting of the weight of the sample on the upper surface of the disc produces the negative part of the graph resulting from back extrusion. This gives an indication of the cohesiveness and resistance of the sample to separate (flow off) from the disc. The maximum negative force on the graph indicates sample adhesive force; the more negative the value is, the more “sticky” the sample is. The area under the negative part of the graph is known as the adhesiveness (energy required to break probe sample contact) and can give an indication of the cohesive forces of the molecules within the sample. The higher the value, the more energy required to break the probe sample contact as the probe withdraws from sample. All tests were conducted at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) and repeated three times.
