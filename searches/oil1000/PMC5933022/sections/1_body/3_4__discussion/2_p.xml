<p class="p">For the modeling of oleogel, the colloidal silica performed gelators role. The liquid paraffin and olive oil were mixed to compose mineral and herbal oil mixture for the oleogel formulation. The response surface central composite design was applied in order to formulate optimal composition of preparation and to investigate the relationship between ingredients and texture analysis. The influence of concentration of colloidal silica on textural parameters including firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency was found to be significant (
