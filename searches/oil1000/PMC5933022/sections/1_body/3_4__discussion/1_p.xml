<p class="p">Various studies investigated compositions and biological activity of essential oils and presented valuable results, which encourages the development of products with them. The isolation yield and chemical composition of the essential oils depend on many factors; therefore biological activity can vary. Thyme essential oil can contain 36–55% of thymol. Thyme essential oil has several chemotypes named according to the major compound: thymol, carvacrol, terpineol, and linalool. The concentration of thymol in Romanian thyme essential oil was 47.59% and its activity against

Antimicrobial activity of this study was determined for 0.05–0.30% of essential oil containing oleogel, while concentration of thymol was 9.6 mg/mL and that of carvacrol was 0.07 mg/mL. Thyme essential oil is convenient to insert in oil medium; therefore a lipophilic gel was formulated. Technology process of oleogels is simple; system does not contain water; its physical, microbiological, and chemical stability is much more as compared to conventional topical bases; the lipids of oleogels support skin hydration by reducing transepidermal water loss [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Despite the convenience of technology, the amount of thymol decreased by 30% and it can be related to the compound volatility or other investigation aspects in future. 0.1% concentration of thyme essential oil was chosen as active substance regarding the above-mentioned aspects.
