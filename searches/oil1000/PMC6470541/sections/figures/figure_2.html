 <p> Culture kinetics of P. acidilactici grown on different media formulated with peptones obtained from skin/bone (SBP, left) and head (HP, right) by-products from fish discards. MRS medium was used as control. : SBP_G and H_G; : SBP_Ha and H_Ha; : SBP_Bo and H_Bo; : SBP_HM and H_HM; : SBP_Me and H_Me; : MRS. Experimental data of biomass (X), lactic acid (La), acetic acid (Aa), and pediocin (BT) were fitted to the Equation (2). Reducing sugars (Rs) and protein (Pr) uptakes were also shown. The confidence intervals of experimental data (for two replicates) were in all cases less than 10% of the experimental mean value and omitted for clarity. </p>
