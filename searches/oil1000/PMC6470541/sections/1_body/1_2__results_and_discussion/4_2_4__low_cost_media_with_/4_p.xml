<p class="p">Regarding lactic acid, the highest and lowest 
 <italic class="italic">La
  <sub class="sub">m</sub>
 </italic> values were observed in media with peptones from skins/bones of grenadier and horse mackerel, respectively. Maximum lactic acid formation in SBP_G was significantly higher than MRS (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The lag phases and maximum rates of lactic acid productions were statistically identical for all peptones evaluated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). SBP_Me was the most efficient peptone for the formation of lactic acid per glucose consumption and HP_HM showed the highest value of

  <sub class="sub">La/Pr</sub>
 </italic>. The production of pediocin, in terms of 
 <italic class="italic">BT
  <sub class="sub">m</sub>
 </italic> values, was similar in SBP_G and MRS (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and much greater than in the rest of broths. Maximal rates of pediocin production were found in these cases, with MRS being the most productive and effective nutrient formulation for pediocin production, followed by SBP_HM, SBP_HA, and SBP_G.
