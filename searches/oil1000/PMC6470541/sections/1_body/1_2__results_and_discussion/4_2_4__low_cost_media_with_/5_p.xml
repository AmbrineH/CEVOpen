<p class="p">The outcomes of this study are in line with other studies of marine peptones that are derived from viscera by-products of several fish species, which also addressed their validity as proteic nutrient in culture media to produce bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria [

From an economical point of view and based on the commercial prices of MRS ingredients, the new fish peptones led to an important reduction of ingredient costs in the 3–4.5-fold range for biomass production, 2.5–3-fold range for pediocin SA-1 production, and 3-fold for lactic acid production (
