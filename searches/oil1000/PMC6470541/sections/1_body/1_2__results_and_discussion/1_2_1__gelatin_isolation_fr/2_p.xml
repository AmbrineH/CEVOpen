Regarding gel strength analysis, only gelling samples that were obtained from Ha and Me showed certain firmness to the penetration of the cylinder probe of the texture analyser. The values of blooms for both gelatins were significantly lower than those observed for gelatin that was obtained from collagen extracted from mackerel skin [
