However, using these last steps, a lower amount of gelatins from megrim (7.4%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> of skin) and hake (6.5%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> of skin) were recovered by the same authors [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The differences in yields that were found in the present work could be due to the method of extraction, which is optimal for tuna and blue shark skins, but is perhaps too aggressive for Me and Ha skins, together with the type and state of the substrate. In fact, our results were calculated based on the SB weight, and SB were mechanically obtained (in a very aggressive way) and then processed without being previously cut into small portions and without an initial wash in saline solution.
