 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-17-00139" class="xref">Table S2 (Supplementary Materials)</xref>, the values of total protein (Prs, Pr-tN, and Pr (Î£aa)) from FPHs that are produced from SB were in all situations higher than that found for H (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). SB_G and SB_Me were the hydrolysates to yield the highest protein content. The differences between protein data that were quantified by the three methods were lower than 16%, in many cases being inferior to 2%. Such small discrepancies are due to the fact that Prs only determines soluble protein and Pr-tN also measures particulate protein. The results of FPHs digestibilities (Dig) were always higher than 90% (94% for SB_Me). The amino acids profile is a fundamental parameter to verify the validity of FPHs for human nutrient uses [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In all FPHs, essential amino acids (Val, Lys, Met, Ile, Leu, His, Arg, Phe, and Thr) are present in good proportion, although the most predominant are aspartic and glutamic acids. Based on these composition of amino acids, together with the excellent values of Dig, we can indicate that present FPHs have a valuable and potential application in pet and aquaculture feed as substitutive of fish meal [
