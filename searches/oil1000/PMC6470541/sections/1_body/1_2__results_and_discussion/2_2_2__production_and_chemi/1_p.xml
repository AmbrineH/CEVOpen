 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00139-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the balance of products that were obtained after Alcalase hydrolysis of SB and head (H) substrates as well as the approximate composition of FPHs. The amount of insoluble material isolated from FPHs processing was higher than 18% in SB and 13% in H. The maximum percentage for bones was found in SB_Bo and SB_G samples, and SB was always a superior bone source than H (

 <sub class="sub">dig</sub> data of SB and H. In half of the samples (SB_G, SB_H, H_G, H_Ha, and H_Me), the recovery of fish oil after proteolysis was ineffective, but in heads of HM, a 2.4%

Regarding the profile of fatty acids that were present in fish oils, the most abundant were always oleic (12.6–15.4%) and palmitic acids (16.1–19.4%), followed by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (8.6–16%) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (4.1–10.1%) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-17-00139" class="xref">Table S1, Supplementary Materials</xref>). Because the amount of oil that was obtained from SB_Bo was very low (0.2% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>), no composition of fatty acid was determined. The sum of essential omega-3 (DHA+EPA) was greater than 12.8% (26.1% in SB_Me), being 16.7% for SB_HM and 20.2% for H_HM. These results are in agreement with values that were reported for oil obtained from fillets of Atlantic horse mackerel (19.5–22%) and individuals of horse mackerel from Mediterranean Sea (22.1%) [
