 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00139-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the values of the antioxidant and antihypertensive activities that were determined for the FPHs samples generated at 4 h of Alcalase hydrolysis. Overall, the results of antioxidant activity were not especially significant. For instance, the percentages of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) were less than 50%, with only H_G and H_Bo reaching greater than 40%, whereas the SB_Bo data were negligible. Crocin and 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) quantifications confirmed these results. All of these values are low in comparison to the antioxidant activity produced by other marine and fish peptides and hydrolysates [
