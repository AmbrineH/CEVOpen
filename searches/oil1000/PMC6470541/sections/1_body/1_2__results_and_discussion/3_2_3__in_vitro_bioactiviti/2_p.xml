<p class="p">The percentages of antihypertensive inhibition (
 <italic class="italic">I
  <sub class="sub">ACE</sub>
 </italic>) were greater than 7%, with a maximum response in H_Bo. The large majority of 
 <italic class="italic">I
  <sub class="sub">ACE</sub>
 </italic> are in the range of 25.4% and 73.8%. However, the samples of SB_Bo and H_Me did not show activity. Hydrolysates from SB were higher, but differences between the different origins of by-products were not statistically significant. Our best FPH (SB_Bo = 74%) led to higher inhibition than referenced for papain-FPH (~45%) and alcalase-FPH (~65–70%) from complete boarfish wastes [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The results from SB_Ha and H_Ha were similar to those that were proposed for Pacific hake fillet hydrolysates generated with protamex [
 <xref rid="B36-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and FPH from Cape fish sawdust and cutoffs [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, the bioactivities of HM samples were inferior to those previously reported for horse mackerel processed with trypsin [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Dose-response bioassays for obtaining IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of hydrolysates were only performed in the samples with 
 <italic class="italic">I
  <sub class="sub">ACE</sub>
 </italic> &gt;50%. In terms of this parameter, H_Bo showed the strongest activity (178 μg/mL) and had the lowest value of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>. This data was in concordance with those found in FPH from Pacific hake (165 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B36-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], but were much stronger than those obtained for European hake heads (260 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], red scorpionfish muscle (970 μg/mL) [

 <xref rid="B38-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], and blue whiting fillets (1.34 mg/mL) [
