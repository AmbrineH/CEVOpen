<p class="p">The joint production of fishmeal and oils is the most common utilisation of fish by-products, including fish discards origin, but it is not the most valuable and sustainable when a fishmeal plant is not located nearby. Different strategies have been proposed in order to deal with the new biomasses that will be generated from 2019. The valorisation alternatives depend on the fish species and the reasons for discarding: a) fish under minimum conservation reference size species, b) non-quota fish species, and c) fish species with low commercial or interest value. In this last case, fish specimens can be used to develop new products for direct human consumption [

However, similar integral alternatives have not yet been explored for wastes from discarded fish species.
