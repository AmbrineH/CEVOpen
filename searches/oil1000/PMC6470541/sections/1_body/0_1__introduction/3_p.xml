<p class="p">In this context, the present study is the first time that by-products of skin and heads from discarded fish species in trawler fisheries in North-West Spain (megrim, boarfish, hake, grenadier, and Atlantic horse mackerel) have been evaluated for the production of gelatins, oils, fish protein hydrolysates, bioactive peptides, and marine peptones that are useful as nitrogen sources for microbial productions.</p>
